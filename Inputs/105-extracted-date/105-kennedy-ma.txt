 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Abraham, the Chairman of the Senate Immigration Subcommittee, for his leadership in reaching this acceptable compromise that addresses the needs of our high-tech industry and is fair to U.S. workers. I also commend the White House for its strong commitment to protecting the U.S. labor force. This is an issue of major importance to the high-tech industry and U.S. workers. High-tech jobs are growing at three times the rate of other jobs. Over the next ten years, high-tech computer companies will need 1.3 million additional employees. 
Few dispute the fact that today, U.S. high-tech companies are unable to find enough skilled workers to meet the mushrooms demands of their rapidly growing industry. Universities are also unable to obtain enough talented faculty members and researchers to fill critical high-tech academic positions. If these shortages persist, the growth and vitality of U.S. high-tech companies will be undermined and our role as a leader in technology and research will be diminished. 
The obvious solution to this current crisis is to increase the number of temporary visas available to skilled foreign workers. But the increase should not be permanent. Our immigration laws should not jeopardize opportunities for young Americans, downsized defense workers, and others who wish to enter the dynamic field of high-tech industries. 
The current compromise reaches a fair balance--by temporarily increasing the number of high-tech visas over the next three years, and then reinstating the current annual cap of 65,000 visas after the third year. 
Many of the foreign workers who will benefit from this compromise are exceptionally talented. They represent the `best and brightest' the world has to offer. We welcome these accomplished individuals and the unique skills they will bring to strengthen and diversify our economy. 
However, most of the positions that will be filled by these additional foreign workers are simply good middle class jobs. Most of the jobs are lower level computer programmers. Many are physical therapists, occupational therapies, or nurses. It is shameful that U.S. workers do not have the skills to compete for these jobs. The fact that American workers lack the training skills to compete for these good jobs is an incident of our educational system. Clearly, we need to do more to find a long-term solution to this festering problem. And this bill gives three years to address this failure. 
I have long insisted that any legislation increasing these visas should substantially invest in improved job training for U.S. workers and better education for U.S. students. We must give the U.S. workers the skills they need to qualify for these jobs. It makes no sense to throw in the towel by increasing quotas--even temporarily--without also investing in our own labor force. As a nation, we have an obligation to invest in our own workers and students. 
Many firms are doing the right thing. Many of the large computer companies spend millions of dollars each year training their workers, and encouraging young men and women to choose high-tech careers. The compromise before us today enhances that commitment. 
Earlier this year, Senator Feinstein and I proposed a way to provide genuine training for American workers, without costing the taxpayer a single penny. I am pleased that the legislation before the Senate today incorporates our idea and achieves this goal. It contains a reasonable fee for visa petitions and visa renewals for high-tech foreign workers. The $500 visa application fee included in the compromise will generate approximately $75 million a year. 
One third of these funds will be used to fund National Science Foundation scholarships in math, engineering, and computer science for low-income students. The remaining funds will be used to train U.S. workers. As a result, many students and many workers will obtain the skills necessary to compete successfully for these good jobs. It is imperative that we provide as many U.S. workers as possible with the skills and specialized training to qualify for these positions. 
The high-tech industry must also do a better job of recruiting U.S. workers. We have all read the reports about unscrupulous employers who pay only lip-service to recruiting U.S. workers, because they know they can obtain cheaper foreign labor. It makes sense that employers should recruit in the U.S. first, in cities like Boston, Detroit, or Los Angeles, before bringing workers in from Beijing, New Delhi, or Moscow. Only if employers cannot find qualified U.S. workers, should they be allowed to recruit and hire foreign workers. 
The following are a few examples of how U.S. employers have only payed lip service to recruiting U.S. workers. 
A high-tech facility in New Mexico announced a hiring freeze and refused to accept job applications. But at the same time, they brought in 53 foreign workers under the high-tech visa program. 
Alan Ezer is a 45-year-old computer programmer with 10 years of experience in the field. He has kept his skills up to date. He was willing to take a pay cut to stay in the industry. After he was laid off, he sent out 150 resumes. He got only one job interview and no job offers. 
Rose Marie Roo is an experienced computer programmer. But when no one would hire her to do computer work, she and her husband opened a bed and breakfast in Florida. 
Peter Van Horn, age 31, has a master's degree in computer science. He lives in California, but employers won't hire him either. 
The list goes on and on. Many of the nation's high-tech firms are blatantly turning away qualified U.S. workers while appealing to Congress for more foreign workers. 
As a result of this problem, Senator Feinstein and I fought long and hard to ensure that strong recruitment requirements would be included in the high-tech visa legislation. This compromise contains a worthwhile provision on this issue, and I commend Senator Abraham for supporting our effort. 
High-tech companies will be required to demonstrate that they have taken good faith steps to recruit in the U.S., according to industry-wide standards. Companies will be required to offer jobs to any U.S. workers who applies for a position and is equally or better qualified for the job than the foreign applicant. U.S. workers should have first crack at these jobs, and with this legislation, they will have it. 
We should also make every effort to retain skilled U.S. workers presently holding these high-tech positions. There have been countless media stories about predatory high-tech computer firms firing talented middled-aged employees and replacing them with foreign workers willing to work longer hours for less pay. In the most flagrant instances, the replaced U.S. workers have even been asked to train their foreign replacement. 
I am pleased that this compromise contains needed protections to guard against such abusive layoffs. Until now, it was legal under our immigration laws for an employer to fire U.S. workers and replace them with cheaper foreign workers. As a condition of participating in this compromise, employers covered under the legislation must attest that they have not laid off U.S. workers and tried to replace them with foreign workers. 
The compromise contains many worthwhile provisions, but it also has flaws. One of the most serious defects is that the new recruitment and layoff attestations do not cover all employers hiring skilled foreign workers. The compromise exempts the largest high-tech companies from the new attestation requirements, even though some of these firms are the most serious violators. 
Nevertheless, the Department of Labor will have increased enforcement powers. Under the previous law, the Department of Labor was restricted to waiting for complaints to be filed before they could act. The Department will now have authority to investigate compliance if they receive specific credible information that a violation has occurred. Additionally, the Department of Labor will now be empowered to conduct random investigations of even exempt employers if they are found to have committed violations. Violators will face stiffer fines and other punishment. 
A second flaw in the legislation is the failure to cap the number of visas made available to health care workers. The effect of the abolition of this cap is that U.S. health care workers, particularly physical and occupational therapists, will be increasingly unable to find work. A recent study by the American Physical Therapy Association indicates that by the year 2000, there will be an 11% surplus of physical therapists in the United States. By the year 2005, this surplus will increase to 20-30%. Faced with these estimates, it is impossible to conclude that there is a shortage of physical therapists in this country. I urge the Department of Labor to reconsider its classification of physical and occupational therapy as occupations for which there is a blanket shortage of labor. 
Despite these flaws, the compromise is, on the whole, fair to both U.S. and foreign workers. It provides much-needed protections for foreign workers. We must make sure that foreign workers who are brought to this country are not abused by their employers. The law requires that temporary foreign workers must be paid the prevailing wage for the specialty work they perform, including salary and benefits. This compromise requires employers to treat all similarly situated workers equally. 
Finally, I am pleased that the compromise contains whistleblower protections I had recommended earlier this year. Despite serious abuses, few complaints were filed by workers because they were afraid of retaliation. Foreign workers were afraid that if they complained they would lose their jobs and be forced to leave the country. American workers were afraid to complain because they feared being blackballed in the industry. 
This compromise protects workers who courageously report violations. Those who report abuses to the Department of Labor may request that their identity not be disclosed. And more important, workers who file complaints or cooperate with investigations cannot be intimidated, threatened, restrained, coerced, blacklisted, or discharged by their employer. 
Overall, this compromise is a reasonable solution of the current difficult problem. It deserves bipartisan support.

 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Graham, Senator Mack, Senator Abraham and our other distinguished colleagues in supporting the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act. Last year Congress enacted the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, which enabled Nicaraguan and Cuban refugees to remain permanently in the United States as immigrants. 
Haitian refugees deserve no less. 
These refugees have seen their relatives, friends and neighbors jailed, or murdered, or abducted in the middle of the night and never seen again. They have fled from decades of violence and brutal repression by the Ton Ton Macoutes, and later by the military regime which overthrew the first democratically elected president of Haiti. 
The people of Haiti have struggled long and hard to establish a democracy in their nation. They endured repression and suffered persecution at the hands of successive governments. Haitians supporting democracy have faced torture, extra-judicial killings, imprisonment, and other forms of persecution. The State Department has documented these and other gross violations of human rights. 
The Bush administration found that the vast majority of Haitian refugees were fleeing from political persecution. Thousands of these Haitians were paroled into the United States after establishing a credible fear of persecution. Many others filed bona fide applications for asylum upon arrival in the United States. 
This legislation will enable Haitians to apply for adjustment of status if prior to December 31, 1995, they were paroled into the U.S., under any of the parole classifications, or filed for asylum. Additionally, as a result of an amendment proposed by Senator Abraham and I, a significant number of unaccompanied children and orphans who did not have the capacity to apply for asylum for themselves will also be eligible to apply for adjustment of status. 
Like other political refugees, Haitians have come to this country with a strong love of freedom and a strong commitment to democracy. They have settled in many parts of the United States. They have established deep roots in our communities, and their children born here are U.S. citizens. Wherever they have settled, they have made lasting contributions to the economic vitality and diversity of our communities and the nation. 
This issue is about basic fairness. The United States has a long and noble tradition of providing safe haven to refugees. Over the years, we have enacted legislation to guarantee that Hungarians, Cubans, Yugoslavs, Vietnamese, Laotians, Cambodians, Poles, Chinese, and many other refugees will not be sent back to unstable or repressive regimes. 
Last year, we adopted legislation to protect Nicaraguans and Cubans. But Haitians were unfairly excluded from that bill. The time has come for Congress to end the bigotry. We must remedy this flagrant omission and add Haitians to the list of deserving refugees. 
By approving the Haitian Refugee Fairness Immigration Act, we can finally bring to an end the shameful decades of unjust treatment of Haitians. As the decisions of federal judges over the past two decades make clear, Haitans are treated with blatant discrimination under our immigration laws. Throughout the 1980's, less than 2 percent of Haitians fleeing the atrocities committed by the Duvalier regimes were granted asylum. Yet, other refugee groups had approval rates as high as 75 percent. 
Haitian asylum seekers were detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, but asylum seekers from other countries were routinely released while their asylum applications were processed. Until recently, Haitians have been the only group intercepted on the high seas and forcibly returned to their home country, without even the opportunity to seek asylum. We welcomed boat people from Cuba, Vietnam and other parts of the world. But for years, we picked up Haitians on the high seas and sent them back to Haiti, in violation of international refugee laws. 
This Congress has the opportunity to right the shameful wrongs that Haitian refugees have suffered. We have before us a bill that offers full protection of our laws to these victims of persecution in their fight for democracy. The call for democracy is being heard around the world, and America's voice has always been the loudest. How can we advocate democracy on the one hand, and then deny protection to those who heed our call and are forced to flee their homeland as a result? 
The struggle for democracy is often dangerous and life threatening. Ask Nestilia Robergeau, who knows first hand the high price of supporting democracy on Haiti. She and her brother started a youth group in support of Haiti's democratically elected President, Jean Bertrand Aristide. After a military coup ousted President Aristide, her brother was murdered by the military, and she went into hiding in the woods around her village until she could escape 
from Haiti in a small boat. Today, she lives in Atlanta and holds two jobs. She is active in her local church, and hopes to be a nurse. Last year, she told the Subcommittee on Immigration that ever since she arrived in the United States, she has lived in fear of being sent back to Haiti. 
Even the youngest Haitian refugees live in fear of being returned to Haiti. Ask Louisiana, a sixth grader at West Homestead Elementary School in Miami. She fled to the United States with her aunt, after her father, a pro-democracy activist, was murdered by the Haitian military. Last winter, Louisiana told us that she was terrified that she will be sent back to Haiti. She is terrified that the same people who killed her father will come after her in Haiti. She asked us to please pass a law that will let her stay in the United States, where she is safe. 
Ask Mr. H in Massachusetts, a journalist in Haiti who criticized the Haitian military government, and was repeatedly arrested for his outspoken views. Finally, he went into hiding in Haiti. When soldiers could not find him, they abducted his girlfriend, brutally beat her, and dumped her by the side of the road to die. But she survived, and she and Mr. H escaped by boat. They were picked up by the Coast Guard, and brought to the United States. They married and now live in Massachusetts. Their two children were born here. Yet, Mr. H and his wife could be deported without this legislation. 
Congress has a duty to offer the same protection to these Haitians that we have offered over the years to other refugees fleeing from repressive regimes. This bill is about what is fair, what is right, and what is just. We owe it to Louisiana, to Nestilia, and to the thousands of other Haitians forced to flee their homes because they believed in the promise of democracy. 
This legislation has strong bipartisan support. It is supported by a wide range of nationwide organizations, including the Americans for Tax Reform, U.S. Catholic Conference, the Church World Service, the American Baptist Churches, the Mennonite Central Committee, the Council of Jewish Federations, the Lutheran Immigration Refugee Service, the United Methodist General Board of Church and Society, the Presbyterian Church (USA) and many, many more. As Jack Kemp wrote to Congress earlier this year `This issue presents a chance to do the right thing by rectifying an omission in last year's bill, and to uphold our nation's tradition of accepting refugees.' 
We should do all we can to end the current flagrant discrimination under the immigration laws. Haitian refugees deserve protection too--the same protection we gave to Nicaraguans and Cubans last year. We need to pay more than lipservice to the fundamental principle of equal protection of the laws.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support this legislation because it will help millions of families across the country. One of the most important provisions offers urgently needed aid to communities to improve their public schools. Democrats worked effectively to provide funds for more teachers and smaller classes, and these efforts were successful. The result is that assistance is on the way for this important aspect of school reform. 
The bill provides $1.2 billion on the current fiscal year for this vital initiative to reduce class sizes in the nation's public schools. This is the first installment in an ongoing effort to help schools throughout the nation hire 100,000 more teachers, so that all students will get the attention they need in school to succeed in life. 
The bill also contains a major literacy initiative that will provide $260 million to help children learn to read well by the end of the third grade. It's a strong response to President Clinton's America Reads Challenge, and it makes a significant additional victory for education reform. 
In addition, the legislation includes $871 million for summer jobs for disadvantaged youth. For many of these youth, summer jobs are their first opportunity to work and their first step in learning the work ethic. 
This legislation also fully funds the Youth Opportunity grants established by the Workforce Investment Act signed into law in August. This innovative new program will offer education and career opportunities for teenagers most at risk and living in the poorest communities. 
The bill also contains the level of funding recommended by President Clinton for Head Start and after-school programs. These programs are vital to children across the country, and these funds are urgently needed. 
Another key part of this bill provides much needed assistance for home health care for senior citizens and persons with disabilities under Medicare. In 1997 in Massachusetts, approximately 150 home health agencies cared for 125,000 Medicare beneficiaries. But the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 contained provisions that led to an unintended 15 percent reduction in reimbursement for the state's home health providers. That reduction translated into a $110 million cut this year for providers across the state. Ten home health agencies in Massachusetts have closed their doors since January 1--in part due to the unanticipated consequences of the 1997 Act. 
Last February, Congressman Jim McGovern of Massachusetts and I introduced legislation to remedy this problem, and I am pleased that this bill achieves our goal. No senior citizens or persons with disabilities who depend on Medicare for home health services should have to worry that health care won't be available when they need it most. 
By delaying a forthcoming reduction in payments and by improving the formula for reimbursements, this bill enables home health agencies to provide the medical care needed for patients to stay in their own homes and communities, and out of hospitals and nursing homes. All of us who are concerned about this issue welcome the progress we have made, and we will continue to do all we can to see that home health care is widely available to those who need it in our states. 
The legislation also makes important changes in the immigration laws. It temporarily increases the number of visas available to skilled foreign workers to meet the demands of colleges, and the high-tech industry. It also contains a substantial investment to improve job training and educational opportunities for U.S. workers and students. 
In addition, the bill ensures that the 49,000 Haitians who came to this country fleeing persecution will have the opportunity to apply for asylum to remain in the United States permanently. The bill also provides $171 million for naturalization activities. Without this support, the processing of naturalization applications would fall even farther behind. 
The legislation also takes a major step toward more effective enforcement of the civil rights laws. For the first time in many years, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will receive the level of funds needed to fulfill its important mission. 
In many other respects, this legislation also deserves support. I commend the bipartisan support it has received, and I urge the Senate to approve it. 
However, in passing this important bill, this Congress leaves behind a number of key initiatives of great importance to working families. I know that my Democratic colleagues join me in pledging to renew our efforts early next year on behalf of the unfinished business of the current Congress. 
First, we must act on the Patient's Bill of Rights, which will end the abuses of HMOs and guarantee the 161 million Americans who use HMOs that medical decisions affecting their families will be made by doctors and patients, not insurance company accountants. 
Democrats will also give high priority to campaign finance reform next year. The greatest gift that Congress can give the American people is clean elections. This reform is important for our democracy, and it deserves to be enacted at the beginning of 1999, so that it will clearly apply to elections in the year 2000. 
Our nations school buildings are crumbling, and many areas of the country do not have enough classrooms. The 105th Congress did not act on our proposal to give localities tax breaks for bond initiatives to pay for school construction. And we will pursue this proposal again next year. 
We must also act in 1999 to reduce youth smoking and save millions of children from a lifetime of addiction and early death. Three thousand more children a day start smoking, and a thousand of them will die prematurely from tobacco-induced disease. 
We need strong legislation to prevent tobacco companies from targeting young Americans. It is the only effective way to stop this tragedy. 
Another top priority should be action on the minimum wage. At this time of extraordinary national prosperity, millions of minimum wage earners are working full time but still living in poverty. We proposed a modest increase of $1.00 an hour over two years to give a much-needed raise to 12 million Americans. The fight for this proposal--so important to working families across America--must be and will be renewed next year. 
We had landmark, bi-partisan legislation to assist Americans with disabilities to obtain skills and go to work, rather than sit a home on public assistance. Disabled Americans want the dignity of work. But this bill, too, was not considered by this Congress. 
The tragic deaths of James Byrd, an African American killed because of his race, and Matthew Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student killed because of his sexual orientation, brought the issue of hate crimes to the forefront this year. Their deaths and other senseless acts of hate resulting in death or serious injury should be a catalyst for passage of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. This bill ranks high among the unfinished business of the 105th Congress, and we will pursue it again next year. 
All of us regret that this massive legislation is being considered under end-of-session restrictions that make sensible debate impossible. But overall, I believe the bill deserves to pass, and I look forward to renewing the debate next year about the nation's basic priorities.

 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Bernardino R. Stabile on his retirement from the Secret Service. A military veteran and dedicated civil servant, Mr. Stabile has completed 53 outstanding years in service to the government. 
Mr. Stabile has served with great distinction for the past 25 years as an Operations Support Technician in the Boston Field Office of the Secret Service, working in support of the agency's protective and investigative missions. 
Earlier, Mr. Stabile had served for 27 years in the United States Marine Corps. He served in the South Pacific in World War II, including the Marshall Islands, Saipan, and Iwo Jima. He also served in the Korean War in the 1950's, was part of the Dominican Republic operation in 1965, and had two tours of duty in Vietnam in the 1960's. 
In the course of this extraordinary career, he became a highly decorated Sergeant Major and received numerous commendations, including the Bronze Star, the Navy Commendation Medal, the Presidential Unit Citation, and the Navy Unit Citation. Some say, once a `boot,' always a `boot.' But Sergeant Major Stabile took many `boots' over the years and developed them into effective leaders. 
Throughout his brilliant career, Bernardino Stabile has served his country with commitment, dedication, bravery, integrity, honor, and patriotism of the highest order. He deserves the gratitude of the Senate and the nation, and I am proud to take this opportunity to praise his outstanding service.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the passage of the Irish Peace Process Cultural and Training Program Act is an important step to facilitate the ongoing peace process in Northern Ireland and advance the goals of the Good Friday Agreement of April 10, 1998. The legislation contributes to this effort by providing the people of that strife-torn region with new opportunities to achieve permanent peace and reconciliation. 
This bill which authorizes a total of 12,000 residents of Northern Ireland and the six border counties of the Republic of Ireland to come to the United States for up to three years for job training and education. 
Northern Ireland has an overall unemployment rate of 9.6 percent, and it is 13 percent in Belfast. The economy grew only three percent in the last year. Economic stagnation and high unemployment disproportionately affect unskilled workers. The legislation reaches out to these disadvantaged workers by giving many of them an opportunity to learn skills in the United States, which they will in turn take home to their communities in Northern Ireland and the border counties and use them productively for their future. 
One of America's greatest strengths is its diversity, and the diversity of Northern Ireland can be a strength as well. A major goal of this legislation is to promote cross-community and cross-border understanding and build grassroots support for long-term reconciliation and peaceful coexistence of the two communities. Building on the success of similar programs, this legislation will enable persons who have lived amidst the conflict and bigotry of Northern Ireland to spend time in communities in the United States where reconciliation works to achieve a strong and more just society. It is our hope that the experience generated by this legislation produce long-lasting social and economic benefits for all the people of the borders and Northern Ireland.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a wonderful friend who has left us all too soon, Patrick Murphy of Provincetown, Massachusetts, who died last Friday from complication of AIDS. 
The poet Yeats wrote about another young man who died too young, in lines that apply to Patrick Murphy, too--he was `all life's epitome. What made us dream that he could comb grey hair?' 
Patrick was a very special friend, and we grieve all the more today because his life was so tragically cut short. But he lived that life with great energy, passion and commitment. And these priceless qualities won him countless friends and enormous success throughout his lifetime. But even more important, they won him the enduring respect and genuine affection of the people whose lives he touched and helped. 
Patrick succeeded where others failed because he would never allow himself to be distracted by the mean-spirited. He had a determination that could overcome any obstacle or criticism. He was seldom burdened by a sense of reality, which made him all the more endearing and all the more successful. 
In the Patrick Murphy handbook on life, `No you can't' became `Yes you can.' You can fight the bureaucracy. You can make a difference. You can live with AIDS--and never let anyone tell you you can't. 
All of us who knew Patrick knew that he never gave up and never gave in. He was the `ever-ready bunny' in the television commercial--the one who just keeps going and going--ever-ready to fight for all the causes we share. 
I remember my own campaign in Massachusetts in 1994. Patrick had just left the hospital. But that didn't stop him for a second. Before we knew it, he had list after list of events and phone-banks and campaign stops he was planning--working skillfully and tirelessly until every last vote was counted and victory was won. 
He did the same for Senator John Kerry in his reelection campaign in 1996--and for President Clinton and Vice President Gore in their campaign that year too. 
And he did it all over again for the impressive `For the Love of Life' Foundation that he founded in 1992 and that will be his lasting memorial. 
In the years to come, the Foundation will remind us again and again of Patrick and the power of individuals to make a difference. Ever since Patrick created `For the Love of Life' in 1992, the Foundation has brought greater hope and a higher quality of life to countless people living with AIDS--in Massachusetts and across the country. 
The Foundation was inspired by Patrick's extraordinary belief that people's dreams can come true. And, the Foundation's great mission has been to grant the wishes of individuals and families living with HIV and AIDS. 
`For the Love of Life' works closely with other AIDS organizations. It provides a special extra dimension that others can't. 
For an HIV positive father who could not afford a funeral for his infant son who died of AIDS--`For the Love of Life' made the difference. 
For a person living in a hospice in Boston--`For the Love of Life' enabled him to visit his mother in Pittsburgh for one last time, to share a birthday. 
The Foundation has helped many others as well--a mother with AIDS to attend her daughter's wedding--a teenage girl with AIDS to have a Sweet 16 party for her family and friends. Because of Patrick's vision and leadership, the dreams of countless others will come true. 
As many have said, life is best measures not by its length but by its depth--by those magical moments that make life special. Patrick made life special for himself and everyone he touched. And in the years to come, `For the Love of Life' will continue Patrick's great work by helping people with AIDS to live life and love life. And for that great gift and lesson to all of us--we thank Patrick with all our heart. 
Patrick, for the light you brought to dark hours and for the dignity you gave to the human spirit--God bless you and sustain you. Patrick said he was always happier and healthier when he had a project. So I say now, to Patrick in heaven, may you always have a project!

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to address the Senate for a few moments today to call attention to some progress that has been made, as I understand it, in budget negotiations in the areas of education, but also to indicate why I think the resolution of the President of the United States in identifying the importance of the help and assistance of the Federal Government for local communities and the States is extremely important, and why it has been very important in these last few days, that these negotiations reflect the President's strong commitment to education policy, and to put into some perspective why this battle has been necessary over the period of recent years and why it is necessary now. I will mention in just a few moments some of the areas where I understand progress has been made. Nothing will be achieved until everything is settled, but, nonetheless, the areas that I will mention here, I think, have been generally recognized as having been fairly well agreed to, and I think it is relevant to mention those because they are important and will be important when the final omnibus legislation has been achieved. 
If you look over the recent years to see what has happened in terms of the education budget, you will see why this battle has been so important. If you look at the amount of the Federal budget that is devoted to education, it represents only 2 percent of the total budget. We are talking now of a budget of $1.7 billion. Only 2 percent of that budget is education. I think most Americans would believe that it should be a good deal higher. 
What we are trying to do is to make sure that even this 2 percent is going to be preserved. If there is an opportunity, we are going to see some expansion of it. We understand that we have a tight fiscal situation. We are grateful for the economic policies that have brought us to some surplus, and we expect that to continue, although the surplus for the first 5 years is reflected really in the cumulative savings in our Social Security. And that is why the President is wise to say it is not appropriate now to have a tax cut because those funds which have been paid in and reflect themselves in the form of a surplus are really the hard-earned wages of workers and employers paying into the Social Security trust fund, and until we resolve the challenges of the Social Security trust fund, we should not, and we must not, see a tax cut. 
But what we are trying to do is give education more of a priority within the total budget. That is certainly the desire of the American people. What we have been faced with over the period of recent years is the following: In 1996, the Republicans attempted to cut $3.7 billion below the previous year, 1995, in terms of what had actually been appropriated. Do we understand? In the education budget--that was in 1996, that was resisted by the President--all those budget cuts were not achieved but there were some budget cuts. 
In 1997, the Republican proposal was to cut $1.5 billion below the previous year--not add on, Mr. President, not try to find out how we could possibly squeeze other aspects of our national budget in order to increase our commitment to education. No. We saw the request for $1.5 billion less in 1997 over the previous year; in 1998, a $2 billion cut below the President's request, and this year $2 billion below the President's request. 
These are the facts. And so it is understandable that in the final wrap-up of these budget negotiations, the President of the United States is going to do everything he possibly can to resist that kind of cut in terms of education funding. 
Now we know, as I have said before, the amounts of money do not necessarily indicate the solution to all of our problems. That is true in education as well. But what it does reflect is a nation's priorities--a nation's priorities. When you look over the record, for 1996, $3.7 billion; 1997, $1.5 billion; 1998, $2 billion; this year, 1999, $2 billion. That is reflected in the $420 million cut for title I, cutting back on the Eisenhower Teaching Program, cutting back on teacher technology, cutting back on the Afterschool Program, cutting back on the Year 2000 Program, zeroing out the Summer Jobs Program. 
We can understand why the President and many of us--the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, the Democratic leader in the House, Dick Gephardt--are saying we are not going to have an omnibus budget unless it protects education. In effect, that is what is happening in Washington. Surely, there are other priorities, but this is one identified by the President and the leaders, and the one which I believe is the overriding and overarching issue that those families across our country care most about. 
Now, we have heard that in the past few days the Reading Excellence Act, which is basically the Literacy Program that passed in the Senate virtually unanimously, was tied up over in the House of Representatives, and when they effectively halted other kinds of action, that legislation was still hanging out there and would not have been approved unless put into this omnibus legislation. 
When we understand that 40 percent of our children who are in the third and fourth grades cannot read properly, and when we understand that this is increasingly a problem, we are not going to be able to solve it all with our Reading Excellence Act, but we are going to be able to help and assist teachers who are attempting to set up literacy programs, who are tying into the Head Start Program, who are working with volunteers who reflect the interests of many of our young people who are working as volunteer teachers in the areas of literacy in our schools and colleges, with the Work-Study Program, which has been expanded significantly in the last couple of years. 
I am proud that Massachusetts is ranked as the second State in the country in the number of volunteers in the Work-Study Program who are working with children in their communities on literacy. California is first; we are second. California better look out because we are increasing the number of our colleges that will be doing it. Close to 60 percent of all of our colleges scattered around our State of Massachusetts now are doing that. I believe every college ought to be involved. We ought to be challenging the young people in all of our colleges to give something back to the community. This program will provide that little seed money to help assist those kinds of efforts in our States. That is an important program, and I understand has been agreed to. 
We have the Afterschool Program which last year had been a $40 million program; this year, now, some $200 million. We have 5 million American children who are under 14 years of age who are left alone every afternoon in this country--5 million of them. And we wonder what happens when we see these kinds of charts that reflect the spiking up in indexes of violent crime right after school, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon; 3 o'clock to about 6 o'clock in the afternoon have the highest incidents. These people should be involved in afterschool programs. They are working. They are working in my own city of Boston. Not all the city of Boston has it, but Mayor Menino is working to improve these programs. This is a good $200 million program. 
But that would not be there unless we had been battling--as in the past few days the President has--to have a modest program to try to help, to work through the nonprofit organizations, even some of those church-related groups, so children in this category can complete their homework in the afternoon. That way, when they go back home they can spend some quality time with their parents rather than come home and have the parents say, `Jimmy, go upstairs and finish your homework.' This happens. This is a family issue. These are two very, very modest but important programs. 
But we have more to do, Mr. President. This important program reflects what has been happening in our schools across this country in terms of the total number of students going to the schools. We have seen, now, the escalation in the number of students; 53 million now are going. This number is increasing. The demography, the number of children going in, is putting additional burdens on local communities and States. All we are saying is let's be a partner with them. Let's be a partner with them. 
We have listened on the floor to those saying, `This is not a role for the Federal Government.' You ask the parents. They want their child educated. They want a well trained teacher in a modern classroom with modern equipment so their child can learn. They want a partnership. With all due respect to our colleagues on the floor yesterday, talking about local control, saying, `We ought to let the local communities make those judgments,' the fact is, the local community has control, now, over 93 cents of every dollar that is spent at the present time. Only 7 cents out of that dollar is related to expenditures that are made by the Federal Government. That reflects a very narrow, targeted area of child needs like the title I programs for those children that come from economically deprived communities across this country, whether they are urban or rural communities. 
It has been worked out with bipartisan support, that program and the programs that are related to the needs of disabled children and the other limited, targeted programs here. What we are saying, and what the President is saying, is this: With this escalation, we are going to need more teachers. Let us develop the help and assistance so we will have more teachers so these children, particularly in the most formative time of their lives, are going to be in smaller classes so the children will have 16, 17, 18--hopefully, 17 children in the first three grades. That is when the children coming out--perhaps the children coming from a Head Start Program, maybe others who are not, who are coming from some kindergarten, entering first grade--that is when they are making their decisions in terms of developing their confidence, developing their interests in academics. As we have heard from virtually every teacher across the country, the advantage of having that number of students is that a teacher can spend individual moments every single day with that child. That is enormously important.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is the issue that still remains: Increasing the funding for teachers and also helping, assisting to try to do something about what the General Accounting Office has pointed out is the condition of schools all across this country. They say, to try to address the old schools, to modernize the old schools, nationwide, it would cost $110 billion. The President's program is only $22 billion. Listen to the conclusion, not of Democrats, not of Republicans, listen to the General Accounting Office that says: 
Virtually all communities, even some of the wealthiest, are wondering how to address school infrastructure needs while balancing them with other community priorities. 
This is a national problem. We want to make sure our children are in the best classrooms with the best teachers and that they have the best opportunity to learn. This afternoon I will be going out with the President to the Forrest Knoll Elementary School just out in suburban Maryland. We are going to an event. The whole sixth grade is housed in trailers. The Forrest Knoll Elementary School was originally built to hold 450 students. It now teaches over 700 students. 
We could find these kinds of conditions in communities, not only in urban, but in rural areas. We need the best local and State efforts, and also Federal help and assistance. That is what we are talking about in terms of modernization. That is what we are talking about in terms of enhanced teachers. These are priorities for American families. We ought to be able to work out a process, Republicans and Democrats alike, to try to address those very, very important and special needs. They are the No. 1 priorities for families in this country and we ought to, even in these final hours, we ought to be able to work through this process to make sure we are going to give our best efforts to the protection of children in our society, for their own interests and for our national interest. 
It is in our national interest clearly, so America is going to be able to compete in a global economy and we are going to have the best trained and best educated children and young people in this world. We can do no less. We owe that to our country. That is a great deal of what this debate is about here in the Nation's Capitol, over the time we are meeting here today. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the Chaplain for his very fine prayer in opening the Senate today. I think Christopher Columbus would be proud of us. We are doing the business of the Nation that he discovered, and we honor Italian Americans today for all of their contributions. 
I don't think there is a place in the Nation where the cause for celebration is more lively or more deeply felt than in my State of Massachusetts, where sons and daughters of Italian immigrants have made such an extraordinary contribution in so many different aspects of life. We honor those brave Italian Americans who faced the seas and struggled for their existence, for their deep-seated commitment to family and to their religion and for their sense of optimism and hope in coming here to the United States. I think we honor them best by being about the business of working families today on Columbus Day and in the final hours of this Congress. 
Mr. President, I would like to reserve about the last minute and a half of my time, if I might.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish to address the Senate briefly this afternoon on an issue of which the President, Senator Daschle, and Congressman Gephardt, and other members of Congress, have spoken on so many different occasions, and most particularly during the last several days--the negotiations on appropriations which are taking place, even as we meet here this afternoon, on whether we are going to give the education the priority that it deserves. I believe families all over this country want us to get education funding high priority. 
Families across the country want the federal government to be a helping hand in improving public schools. This year, the nation will set a new record for elementary and secondary school enrollment. The figure has reached an all-time high of 53 million students--500,000 more students than last year. Communities, states, and Congress must work together to see that these students receive a good education. 
Local communities are doing the very best they can to keep up with the increasing demand for good facilities and high academic standards. States are helping. But the issue today is whether we at the Federal Government are going to be a partner in helping to improve public schools for communities and families across the country. I believe we must be a strong education partner. The President believes we must be a strong education partner. We are very hopeful that the final negotiation allocate scarce resources to strengthening the education of the children of the nation. 
Mr. President, we know at the outset that money in and of itself is not the answer, but it is a pretty clear indication about what a nation's priorities are. If we look over what the budget was for 1998, we will see that only 2 percent of the Federal budget was actually appropriated in for education. I think most Americans would believe that that percentage ought to be a great deal higher. I certainly do. The President does. 
I rise this afternoon to commend the President for making the case he has made in ensuring that in this final funding agreement, we give high priority to education. Some may wonder why we have to be concerned about federal support for education? 
I want to review just for a few moments, Mr. President, the decision that was made by the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives in the earlier part of the year that shows why we have to stay here and fight for education funding. If Americans are wondering why the President continues to make statements about the importance of education, let's just review for a few moments how Republicans in the House of Representatives cut funding for education in June of this year. They cut $421 million below the President's request for title I. 
Now, it is important to try to understand what the title I program is. The role of the Federal Government in education is to target the children in our country that need the most help. We have made a commitment to children from economically distressed families that they would get extra help in order to help them increase their academic achievement. 
We can see the need reflected in a wide variety of indicators. In reading, for example, 40 percent of fourth graders are reading below grade level. We decided as a nation that we would give extra help in reading, math, and other academic subjects, to those children who would qualify. That has been a time-honored program. An increase in support for the program was in the President's budget and it was paid for. But our Republican friends decided to cut the program by $421 million below President Clinton's request. I think that cut was a mistake, but that was a decision made by the House of Representatives. 
Then, the cut a time-honored piece of legislation known as the Eisenhower Teacher Training Program--a program that helps teachers upgrade their skills so they will be more effective teaching science and math--by $50 million below last year. I believe very strongly that one of our main objectives as a nation should be to have a well-qualified teacher in every classroom in this country. The Eisenhower Teacher Training Program has played a very important and significant role in helping communities meet that goal. Nonetheless, that program was significantly cut back. 
I think all of us understand there are political leaders--Members of Congress, those who are running for Governor, those who are running in local communities--who are talking about the importance of new technology in their schools. 
We in Massachusetts were 48th out of 50 States in access to the Internet just 4 years ago. Then, in Massachusetts, we formed what was called Net Day, a cooperative effort between the private sector and the public sector, to improve children's access to technology. Now Massachusetts ranks 10th in the country in schools wired to the Internet. That was done by a cooperative effort of the software industries, labor, educators, business and communities. 50 miles of cable were laid down in Boston, voluntarily. All of the people who helped wire those schools understand the importance of having new technology and having Internet access. 
Therefore, it is difficult for me to understand why, the House of Representatives cut education technology programs by $137 million below the President's program, and zeroed out the Star School Program, which brings distance learning to rural and underserved communities. 
With the school budgets being cut back, critical programs are often eliminated such as music, the arts, and health programs. In addition, rural and underserved communities often have difficulty finding qualified math and science teachers. So, we developed a Star School Program so that all communities would have access to the best teachers who would be able to enter those schools through satellite. It was an overwhelming success. It has been evaluated and reevaluated and it has been one of the most effective programs that we have, particularly in rural areas --in urban areas as well, but particularly in rural areas. But the Star Schools program was zeroed out. 
They even cut support for after-school programs. After-school programs have an important impact on providing children opportunities for constructive activities, such as doing their homework with the assistance of a tutor. It also benefits families because when children go home and see their parents who have been working hard all day, the parents will not be in the situation where they must say, `Go upstairs and do your homework,' but they might have some quality time with their children. 
After-school programs also help keep children safe, drug-free and out of trouble. We know that juvenile crime peaks in the after-school hours between, 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. By developing afterschool programs, we enhance education but we also have a dramatic reduction in juvenile crime and delinquency. The 21st Century Community Learning Center program is a modest program to help create models for other communities in the best practices for after-school programs. But, the Republicans cut the program by $140 million below the President's level. 
Beyond that, Republicans in the House eliminated the Summer Jobs Program. A program that provides summer jobs for children who are in some of the most difficult educational and economic situations. A program that is a lifeline in so many communities across this country. Yet they zeroed it out--they didn't' just cut it by a quarter, or cut it in half, or cut it by three-quarters, but they eliminated it. 
If you go to Chicago--and I see our friend, Senator Durbin, from Illinois, who is an expert about this--to find out what is being done to reform their schools, you will find that they are providing academic enrichment and work experiences to children during the summer vacation. But, the Republicans zeroed out every single nickel for the Summer Jobs Program. 
If you are asking, as we have heard the Speaker asking and the Republican leader asking, Why should we be suddenly so concerned about education? We need to be concerned because families across the nation want us to help improve education, but instead, Republicans cut the title I program that help the neediest children. They cut the Eisenhower Teacher Training Program. They eliminated the Summer Jobs Program. They cut $130 million from the technology programs for schools. They cut the afterschool program. That is why these hours are important; they make a difference. 
The President has proposed that we make needed investments in reducing class size and modernizing our schools. He is making that speech against a background of a GAO report that schools have $112 billion in repair and modernization needs that they cannot address.

What kind of message are we sending to every child in America who goes to a school with leaking pipes, exposed wiring, broken windows, faulty heating systems, and no air conditioning? The message we are sending to every child is, they don't make a difference, they don't count. 
We believe, and the President believes, that the children count, and it is important to provide them with safe, modern schools. We are here in these final days, to make sure that, unlike the Republican judgment that was made in the House of Representatives in June of this past year, any budget that is going to bear the President's signature or have our vote is going to make these needed investments in education that are essential for every working family in this country.

Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct in his general summation of the approach of the President. And that is: One, to have smaller class sizes; two, to upgrade and modernize schools; three, to have an effective after-school program; four, to enhance the quality of teaching in the classroom; five, to ensure that we are going to have access to the new technology and that that is going to be available in the public schools so these children are going to be able to move ahead; six, to raise academic standards for all children; and then seven, to try to get the encouragement to those students to go on to higher education. 
That is all part of the partnership, among the local community, the States, and the Federal Government. This is not just a singular effort; this is a partnership. And when you eliminate the Federal assistance in that partnership, you undermine critical support for improving education that is so important to families and their children.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Senate floor this afternoon about matters which I am very hopeful can be addressed and will be addressed and I think should be addressed in the remaining hours before the Congress actually recesses. And this is in the area of education and what we are going to do finally in trying to meet the responsibilities that we have to assure a smaller class size for the 53 million Americans who will be attending and are attending schools across this country, which means an expansion in terms of the total number of teachers. 
I am very hopeful that in the ultimate and final budget agreement there will be an agreement on the President's recommendation of 100,000 teachers over the period of the next 5 years, and that we will also embrace the very, very important and, I think, essential school modernization program which effectively would provide about $22 billion in interest-free bonds to local communities all over this country in order to modernize their schools. 
What we have seen now is a rather dramatic change in the demography and the growth in the total number of children who are going into the school systems all across this country, and at the same time you have seen a continued deterioration in many of the school buildings across the country. That is certainly true in my State, which has many of the oldest school buildings in the country, but it is also true in many of the other States across this country, and even in a number of the rural communities. 
As a matter of fact, the General Accounting Office did a study in terms of what would be necessary in our country in order to make sure that we are going to have good classrooms for the students, and it was estimated to be $110 billion. That is what the need is according to a nonpartisan evaluation of what the conditions are in our school buildings across the country. 
Therefore, the recommendation the President has made for $122 billion is a very modest recommendation. We have not embraced that recommendation at the present time. The urging of the President of the United States is that before we move out from this Congress, we ought to be about the business of addressing that particular education need. Education is of prime importance to every family in this country. It is of essential importance to every young person in this Nation, and it is a matter of enormous importance in terms of our country being able to compete in a global economy. 
So the urgency of these proposals--one is to have a reduced class size and the second is to be able to modernize our classrooms--is enormously important. If we look over the amount of resources we devote to education in the budget of this country, we will find that it is only about 2 percent. It is only 2 percent of our national budget. 
This is the 1998 Federal budget, and you can see from this pie chart the allocations of resources. The area of education is only 2 percent. If you ask people what percent of a dollar they believe goes to education, I think most Americans would think 10 or 12 percent, or 10 or 12 cents should be going to education. If you ask what they believe they would like to be the number, it would be even higher. 
We are only talking about 2 percent. So the real question is, in a time now when our appropriators and negotiators are meeting to have final resolution on what will be a $1.7 billion budget, will we be able to find the resources to provide for the reduced class size for K through 3--$1 billion for fiscal 1999, $7 billion over the next 5 years--to see a dramatic reduction in the number of students per class in K through 3, that is what we are trying to do, and to modernize our school buildings all across this country. 
Those are two priorities. I must say I strongly agree with the President, with Senator Daschle, and with Leader Gephardt who said we should not leave this city until we respond in a positive way to make sure those requirements are fulfilled, because there is nothing that is more important than meeting the needs of the children of this country. 
Finally, Mr. President, I think this is important to do for a number of reasons. Every day that children go into the school systems of this country, they go into dilapidated schools, they go into old schools, they go to classrooms with windows broken or with poor heating or poor air-conditioning in the course of the early fall and the late spring and early summer in many other parts of the country, or where the pipes are leaking, or where some schools are actually closed in the wintertime because of the failure of the heating system, we are sending a very powerful message to those children. 
On the one hand, we as parents are saying that education counts, that we believe it ought to be a priority, that we think the future of this Nation is our children and we ought to be about the business of looking out for the interests of these children to make sure they are going to have a well-qualified teacher in every classroom in this country. That ought to be our hope, that ought to be our challenge, and that is what we are working for. And that ought to be an effort made in the local community. It ought to be an effort made at the State level. But we should not say we are going to abandon our national interest by saying we are not going to interfere if there are inadequate capabilities, or an inability, which is too often the case, to help and assist local communities, particularly when so many local communities such as we have seen in the recent times in Chicago and many other communities--my own city of Boston--are making this extraordinary effort to enhance the academic achievement for the children of this country and in those communities. 
We ought to be able to say we will be a partner with you, we are willing to be a partner with the local community, we are willing be a partner with the State, and we are going to be a partner in helping to modernize our facilities. Otherwise, the promise that we are going to convince this next generation that we are serious about their education is going to be a hollow one. No child will go into a classroom and see that it is in a deteriorated condition and then be exposed to other areas where everything is bright and shiny and new because of greater expenditures and not say, `What is really important? What do our parents really think is important? Where they are spending the money is what is bright and shiny and new.' 
When we are not expending the resources in the classrooms, we send a very powerful message--it may be a subtle message but it is a powerful one--that we are not prepared as a nation to do what needs to be done to upgrade the classrooms in this country. 
I hope in the remaining hours of this process, as our leaders, our appropriators and leaders, members of those committees, get together to work out the final budget, as we are starting over for the next year, that the education budget is going to have the priority that every American family wants it to have, and that is priority No. 1. I hope when we come to that No. 1 we are going to say, `The size of our classes is of enormous importance and consequence in terms of the ability of the teacher to relate to the children.' 
We have just heard an eloquent statement to that effect from some wonderful teachers from the State of South Dakota, as well as from Missouri, talking about the relationship between the teacher and the student and how it is enhanced to such an extraordinary degree when we have smaller class sizes. It ought to be self-evident and it ought to be intuitive. It is, in fact, true. 
I am not taking the time this morning--although I have at other times and will again--to talk about the progress that has been made in academic achievement in a number of communities when they have seen the significant reduction in the number of students per teacher that has taken place in communities and States across this country. The evidence is overwhelming that it has an enormously important positive impact. 
So let's get about doing what we know works, and that is to increase the number of teachers that we need in our schools. Even with the expansion of the number of students in our schools, let us increase the number of teachers, and let us enhance the quality of those teachers to make sure we are going to have good, qualified teachers in every classroom. Let's make sure the number of students in those classrooms will be such that the teacher is going to be able to identify and spend some moments with each child in that classroom. That is the hope and desire of the teachers who have committed themselves to excellence, to trying to enhance that academic achievement and accomplishment. Let's be a partner with the local communities and the States that are embarking on that effort. 
Let us, as we are going through the final days now--let's not leave town. Let's not say we will take whatever is served up to us in the budget. Let us say education is important. We can go about the business of trying to make a difference in the classrooms and in the quality of the people who will be in those classrooms. Let us resolve that we will do that before we leave this town. That is, I think, an important responsibility that we have. We should not fail our children. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield? 
Mr. President, I listened with interest to the attempts of my good friends Senators Lott and Nickles to rewrite the history of the Patients' Bill of Rights in this Congress. No amount of rhetoric and disinformation can disguise the fact that the Republicans in Congress have abused the rules of the Senate to prevent passage of strong patient protections this year. The vote today was the latest installment payment to powerful special interests opposed to change. 
The Republican leadership could have called the Patients' Bill of Rights at any time for a full and fair debate. Instead, proposed a series of phony `consent' agreements that would prevent fair debate and make passage of real reform impossible. These stalling tactics were clearly meant to run out the clock, so that managed care reforms cannot be passed before Congress adjourns, and so that the Republican leadership can avoid responsibility for its defeat. 
The record of Republican attempts to avoid the blame for inaction would be laughable, if the consequences for patients across the country were not so serious. 
On June 18, Senator Lott proposed to bring up the bill, but on terms that made a mockery of the legislative process. His proposal would have allowed the Senate to start considering HMO reform, but he would have been permitted to end the debate at any time. The proposal also barred the Senate from considering any other health care legislation for the rest of the year. So if Senator Lott did not like the direction the bill was headed, he could kill it and tie the Senate's hands on HMO reform for the remainder of the year. 
On June 23, 43 Democratic Senators wrote to Senator Lott to urge that he allow a debate and votes on the merits of the Patient's Bill of Rights. We requested that the Senate take up this issue before the August recess. 
In response, on June 24, Senator Lott repeated his earlier unacceptable offer. 
On June 25, Senator Daschle proposed an agreement in which Senator Lott would bring up a Republican health care bill by July 6, so that Senator Daschle could offer the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights, and other Senators could offer amendments on HMO reform. We would agree to avoid amendments on any other subject. Only amendments related to the Patients Bill of Rights would be eligible for consideration. Senator Lott rejected this offer as well. 
On June 26, he offered once again an agreement that allowed him to withdraw the legislation at any time, and bar any further consideration of any health care legislation for the remainder of the year. 
On July 15, Senator Lott made yet another offer. This time, he proposed an agreement that permitted only one amendment. He could bring up bill. We could bring up ours. And that would be it--all or nothing. No votes on key issues. 
On July 29 and on September 1, the Republican leadership offered variations of this proposal, with amendments restricted to three for Democrats and three for Republicans. 
Senator Daschle offered yet another reasonable approach to resolve the impasse that Senator Lott had created by his efforts to prevent meaningful reform. He offered to agree to let the Senate debate other bills during the day, and use evenings to debate the Patients' Bill of Rights--but the Republican leadership said, `no.' 
Our patients' Bill of Rights was introduced in March--and a predecessor bill was introduced by Congressman Dingell and myself more than eighteen months ago, at the beginning of this Congress. 
Senator Daschle, in an effort to be responsive to the Republican Leader's ultimatum that an agreement on the terms of the debate must be reached before the debate can begin, has offered reasonable proposal after reasonable propsal--and every one was rejected. 
Yet the Republican leader has allowed the Senate to debate many other bills this year, with ample time and ample opportunity for amendments. 
We had 7 days of debate on the budget resolution, and considered 105 amendments. Two of those were offered by Senator Nickles. 
We had 6 days of debate on the defense authorization bill, and considered 150 amendments. Two of those were offered by Senator Lott and he cosponsored 10 others. We had 8 days of debate on IRS reform and considered 13 amendments. 
We had 17 days of debate on tobacco legislation--a bill we never completed--and considered 18 amendments. 
We had 5 days of debate on the agriculture appropriations bill and 55 amendments. 
We had 19 days of debate on the highway bill, with 100 amendments. 
The Republican leadership has allowed 5 days of debate and 24 amendments to the bankruptcy bill. 
They have allowed 36 amendments and 2 days of debate on the FAA bill. 
All these bills were important, and all deserved reasonable debate and opportunities for amendments. They were brought up without any undue restrictions on debate. That is the normal way of doing business on important pieces of legislation in the Senate. 
The Republican leadership was willing to have an adequate opportunity to debate and 
vote on these other important measures. But when the issue is protecting American families instead of insurance industry profits, different ground rules apply to protect the industry and deny the rights of patients. 
The reason the Republican leadership was unwilling to engage in a fair debate is obvious. Senator Lott knows his legislation is deeply flawed, and that it cannot possibly be fixed with just three amendments. He believes that he and his special interest friends can hold most of the Republican Senators for a few votes, but he feared that the would not be willing to stand before the American people on the Senate floor and cast vote after vote for the special interests and against the interests of American families. The fundamental flaws in the Republican bill mean greater profits for insurance companies and lesser care for American patients. Senator Lott does not want the Senate to vote to fix these flaws. He does not want a vote: on whether all Americans should be covered, or just one third of Americans as the Republicans shamefully propose; on whether there should be genuine access to emergency room care; on whether patients should have access to the specialists they need when they are seriously ill; on whether doctors should be free to give the medical advice they deem appropriate, without fear of being fired by their HMO; on whether patients with incurable cancer or Alzheimer's disease or other serious illnesses should have access to quality clinical trials where conventional treatments offer no hope; on whether patients in the middle of a course of treatment can keep their doctor if their health plan drops them from its network, or their employer changes health plans; on whether the special health needs of the disabled, and women, and children should be met; on whether patients should be able to obtain timely independent review of plan decisions that deny care; or on whether health plans should be held responsible in court for decisions that kill or injure patients. 
The list of flaws in the Republican bill goes on and on. 
The Republican leadership's record on this issue is painfully clear. Their cynical strategy is to protect the insurance industry at all costs, by blocking any reform at all, or by passing only a minimalist bill so weak that it would be worse than no bill at all. And today, they finally ended the charade--by moving to table a motion to bring the bill passed by Republicans in the House before the Senate. 
Last Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee held a $25,000-a-person fundraiser for a `select group' of health care industry executives. The heading for the article was, `Politicians seek to profit from the debate over health care policies.' 
The American people are sick of health insurance companies that profit by abusing patients. And it is equally unacceptable that politicians should profit by protecting those exorbitant industry profits. 
Every family in this country knows that it will some day have to confront the challenge of serious illness for a parent, or grandparent, or a child. When that day comes, all of us want the best possible medical care for our loved ones. Members of the ?Senate deserve good medical care for their loved ones--and we generally get it. Every other family is equally deserving of good quality care--but too often they do not get it, because their insurance plan is more interested in profits than patients. 
The Patients' Bill of Rights provides simple justice and basic protection for every one of the 160 million Americans with private insurance. It is supported by the American Medical Association, the Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities, the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the National Partnership for Women and Families, the National Association of Children's Hospitals, the AFL-CIO, and many other groups representing physicians and other health care providers, children, women, families, consumers, persons with disabilities, Americans with serious illnesses, small businesses, and working families. 
It is rare for such a broad and diverse coalition to come together in support of legislation. Both they have done so to end these flagrant abuses that hurt so many families. 
We serve notice today that this struggle is not over. The Republicans in Congress and their friends in the insurance industry may have won this year's battle, but they will lose in the end. 
Democrats in Congress intend to make the Patients' Bill of Rights the first order of business when the new Congress convenes next January. We will continue to fight for meaningful patient protections until they are signed into law. We will not give up this struggle until every family can be confident that a child or parent or grandparent who is ill will receive the best care that American medicine can provide.  
Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as the Nation is focusing on a number of matters today, I want to say what a really important achievement the Senate will accomplish in a few moments when we pass this very extensive authorization legislation, about $35 billion over the next 5 years. 
The legislation has been described by our colleagues and friends, but I join in echoing the sentiments that have been expressed this morning in paying tribute to our friend and colleague from Indiana, Senator Coats, the staff who have worked with him, others on the committee, and our chairman, Senator Jeffords, in moving this legislation forward. 
I remember back to 1994--maybe the Senator from Indiana remembers--when we were working at that time on the reauthorization of the Head Start Program. Many of us had been long-time supporters of that program. It is fair to say, at that time, that legislation, or the legislation that we are considering here, would not have been reauthorized unless it had the active involvement and leadership of the Senator from Indiana. That was a time of great crisis in the Head Start Program. I think the accolades that have been given about the Senator are well-deserved. 
I thank him, in particular, for saving the program back in 1994, but also for the continued commitment that he has had, along with my colleague, Senator Dodd, for these past years. As Senator Coats has pointed out, he was working as a cochair of the children's caucus in the House of Representatives. Our colleague and friend Senator Dodd is cochair of the children's caucus in the Senate. Both of these Senators have probably spent more time focusing on the needs of children in our country than any others and have worked in a very important bipartisan way. 
I join with those who pay tribute to the Senator from Indiana, and naming this legislation after him is really well-deserved. I welcome the opportunity to stand with those who say he has made an indispensable contribution to the needs of poor children in our society. I say that with great sincerity and appreciation, because he has made a very, very important difference, not just in shaping these programs, but basically in helping our country respond to these particular needs. 
There have been times when we have had differences on various policy issues. But we are friends, and the Senate is at its best when we have differences on some matters, but we are able to work them out and, most of all, to respect the individual integrity which Members bring to these issues. The legislation before us today--and I urge our fellow Members to support it--is really the product of our best efforts. I think it will make an important difference in the lives of children. I join with those in congratulating the Senator and in appreciating his leadership. 
Mr. President, at a time when we have extraordinary prosperity, it is important that we look primarily at the needs of children, particularly the poor children. This bill invests in America's future by providing urgently needed assistance to low-income families and children. 
This bill reauthorizes the Head Start program, the comprehensive early childhood development program for low-income children. 
For more than thirty years, Head Start has been providing educational, nutritional, medical, and social services to help young children and their families reach their full potential. The advances made by this bill will ensure even greater success for the program in meeting the needs of today's families. 
In preparing this bill, we've made significant efforts to improve program quality. That was particularly a matter that the Senator from Indiana was strongly committed to. We've established new education performance standards, to ensure that Head Start children enter school ready to learn. We've strengthened teacher qualifications, so that children will receive the very best care. 
We've also worked to encourage closer cooperation by Head Start with other agencies so that full-day, full-year services will be more readily available to working families who need this kind of extended care. 
More than 830,000 children currently receive the benefits of Head Start and they will continue to do so. Just as important, this bill makes it possible over the next five years to reach out more effectively to the 60% of eligible children who are not now receiving these services. 
Head Start has demonstrated its success in lifting families out of poverty. With the program's support, many families obtain the boost they need to achieve economic self-sufficiency. 
A letter I received from Monica Marafuga, a Head Start teacher in Massachusetts, makes this point well:  
I believe that Head start is sometimes the only hope for some families. As a teacher, I see the many families and children who need someone to guide them and point them in the right direction for a better life. 
The Early Head Start program is also greatly enhanced by this bill. This program was established four years ago to provide high quality comprehensive services to very young children, from birth to age 3, and their families. There is nothing that can replace a parent and a home that is supportive and loving. But as we have seen, many of the children in our society are missing the support which can help them develop at a very critical and important time of their development. 
We know that the first three years of life are a critical period in every child's development. We are mindful of the excellent studies that have been done by the Carnegie Commission about the importance of the development of a child's brain in the first months and years of life. The Early Head Start Program helps in developing those cognitive, emotional, and social skills that can help children seize future opportunities and fulfill their highest potential. This is something we want to encourage. 
I welcome the fact that we are able to see an important enhancement of the Early Start Program. I'm especially pleased that this bill includes provisions to establish a new training and technical assistance fund, which will reinforce the program's commitment to provide quality services through on-going professional support for program staff. 
The Early Start Program is having an important impact, and in this bill we continue a gradual expansion of the program so that more young children can be served. Currently, less than 2% of those eligible are receiving its benefit. This bill will expand the program over the next five years to cover an additional 40,000 babies and toddlers. This is a modest expansion, but one which I think, with its success, can be built on over future years. 
In addition, the bill also renews our commitment to reducing poverty by reauthorizing the Community Services Block Grant. This program helps communities by providing assistance to address the specific needs of localities, marshaling other existing resources in the community, and encouraging the involvement of those directly affected. 
Funds may be used for a variety of services, including employment, transportation, education, housing, nutrition, and child care. 
I remember when Senator Robert Kennedy sponsored the initial Community Development Corporation more than 30 years ago, which was the precursor to the Community Services Block Grant. This program has a proven record of fostering innovative methods for eliminating the causes of poverty. The need today is as great as it has ever been. Poverty continues to be a significant problem across the nation. 
We know that 37 million of our fellow citizens live in poverty. Children are particularly vulnerable, representing 40% of those living in poverty despite the fact that they make up only 25% of the overall population. These figures are particularly disturbing because studies show that children living in poverty tend to suffer disproportionately from stunted growth and lower test scores. The Community Services Block Grant can help alleviate these conditions and benefit these children. 
The legislation also reauthorizes the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program for the next five years. The funding levels provided for this important program will ensure that LIHEAP continues to help low-income households with their home energy costs, particularly in extreme weather. 
I am especially pleased that this legislation includes a provision to clarify the criteria for the President to release emergency LIHEAP funds. This assistance will enable many families hurt by hot or cold weather, ice storms, floods, earthquakes, and other natural disasters to get through the season. 
In addition, it will enable the release of emergency LIHEAP funds if there is a significant increase in unemployment, home energy disconnections, or participation in a public benefit program. 
There is clearly a continuing need for a strong LIHEAP program. 95% of the five million households receiving LIHEAP assistance have annual incomes below $18,000. They spend an extremely burdensome 18% of their income on energy, compared to the average middle-class family, which spends only 4%. 
Without a strong LIHEAP program, families will be forced to spend less money on food and more money on their utility bills--the so-called `heat or eat effect.' The result is increased malnutrition among children. 
Without a strong LIHEAP program, children will fall behind in school because they will be unable to study in their frigid households. 
Without a strong LIHEAP program, low income elderly will be at an even greater risk of hypothermia. In fact, older Americans accounted for more than half of all hypothermia deaths in 1991. 
LIHEAP is clearly a lifeline for the most vulnerable citizens in society, and I commend the House and Senate for strengthening this vital program. 
This bill also establishes a new and innovative approach to helping low-income individuals achieve financial independence, and again, I commend Senator Coats for his leadership on this new program. Individual Development Accounts are designed to promote economic self-sufficiency by providing matching funds for deposits made into qualifying savings accounts. Funds can be used to purchase a first home, open a small business, or pay for college education. 
This program shows great promise for improving the lives of many individuals and families in communities across the country. 
Mr. President, I want to just use the last minute in sharing my commendation for the wonderful staff, Republican and Democrat, who worked very closely together. This bipartisan effort is really the most effective way to develop the best possible legislation. 
I want to also recognize Stephanie Monroe, who will be leaving the Senate and has been really a stalwart. Everyone has enormous respect for her. She has worked with Senator Coats, but I think all of us have had enormous confidence in her leadership. She has done really an outstanding job. I also thank Suzanne Day and Kimberly Barnes O'Connor, and Amy Lockhart, a Congressional Fellow in my office, and Stephanie Robinson of my staff who is an enormously gifted, talented and committed individual. 
The Clinton Administration worked effectively with us in the development of this legislation, and they also deserve great credit. I want to particularly recognize Helen Taylor who is the Associate Commissioner of the Head Start Bureau at the Department of Health and Human Services. Ms. Taylor has dedicated her professional career to improving the lives of young children and has had over 30 years of distinguished service in the field of early childhood development. Her knowledge and experience proved invaluable in this process, and I thank her for her true commitment to the children of Head Start. 
This bill ensures the continuation of these important programs into the 21st century. Again, I thank the chairman of our committee, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Dodd, and Senator Coats who really have done an extraordinary job in bringing this legislation to where it is today.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this reauthorization of the Vocational Education Act, the Carl Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Amendments of 1998. This bill, along with the Workforce Investment Act passed earlier this year, are important steps to improve the quality of the nation's workforce. Well-educated and well-trained workers are essential for the nation's future. As students prepare to enter the workforce, they should have a variety of choices, and this bill gives it to them. 
It encourages more effective integration of academic skills and job skills. It helps school districts form partnerships with community colleges, area technical schools, and businesses of all sizes to combine quality academic instruction with real-world work experiences. These partnerships will provide internships, apprenticeships, and practical job experience that will teach students about many difficult aspects of the world of work. 
It also encourages schools to use state-of-the-art techniques and equipment in teaching, so that students are offered challenging courses, and so that graduates can continue their education or enter the workforce better prepared for good careers. 
States are also guaranteed a greater flexibility in providing funds to local schools to improve their vocational and technical education programs. 
The Perkins Act has had a highly positive effect on the quality of vocational education across the nation. Its goal is to encourage innovation and ensure fairer opportunities for all students--especially those who have historically been denied access to high-level careers, and have suffered the most from the inequities in the job market. 
The bill also recognizes the importance of preparing students and trainees for non-traditional employment. Supporting these underserved populations is increasingly important if we are to meet the demands of the 21st Century economy. 
Finally, this legislation retains our commitment to the important role of gender equity in vocational education. Gender equity issues must continue to be part of every state's priority. Every student should be convinced that good careers are not out of reach because of such discrimination. Vocational education must expand opportunities, not restrict them. 
Overall, this legislation enables the nation to move forward in all of these important ways. I urge the Senate to support it, and I'm confident it will be effective in bringing us closer to the goals we share for vocational education in the years ahead.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Charter School Expansion Act, and I commend Senator Coats for his leadership in bringing it before the Senate. The legislation builds on the current Charter School Program to ensure that these schools are given the greater flexibility that they have been promised, and to reaffirm that they must be accountable to the same high standards that we expect of all public schools. 
In recent years, in response to the widespread movement to improve the quality of education in the nation's public schools, the innovative idea of charter schools began to develop broad bi-partisan support. Educators and community leaders took active parts in designing new schools that would receive public funds, like traditional public schools, but that would be free of many local regulations, and would also be held accountable for achieving the goals of their charter. 
States have the primary role in defining the role of charter schools--34 states have now passed enabling legislation, and they vary widely in their applications of this innovative idea. The Charter School Expansion Act continues to use Federal start-up grants as an incentive for local communities to design charter schools that provide significant options for parents within the public school system. The Act encourages the sharing of ideas and practices between charter schools and other public schools, so that schools benefit from the best lessons of each. 
The pending legislation strengthens the accountability provisions for charter schools by giving funding preferences to states that review and evaluate the performance of their charter schools at least once every five years. Charter schools must continue to be open to all students. President Clinton has set a goal of having 3,000 charter schools in operation nationwide by the year 2002. 
The Department of Education is conducting an ongoing study of charter school and the degree to which they are successful in improving student achievement. The results of that study will be very important in guiding the future of these schools. 
The Charter School Expansion Act is an essential part of our overall effort to improve public schools, and I urge the Senate to approve it. We must continue to do all we can to ensure that all public schools get the support they need to provide every child a good education.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, next week, on October 14th, the National Crime Prevention Council will honor Christopher F. Hayes of Boston as one of the seven recipients of this year's Ameritech Award of Excellence in Crime Prevention. The award recognizes individuals who demonstrate outstanding leadership, courage, and dedication to crime prevention in their neighborhoods, states, or nationally. 
This honor is a well-deserved tribute to Christopher Hayes and his 13-year career as Founder and Director of the Neighborhood Crime Watch Unit of the Boston Police Department. 
Mr. Hayes founded the Neighborhood Crime Watch Unit in 1985 as a one-person organization based on the philosophy that the key to crime prevention is to rely on connections from neighbor to neighbor. He urged people to work together and with the police to create innovative solutions for reducing local crimes. The initial model for his crime watch group was simple phone tree and whistle alert system that allowed neighbors to keep in touch with each other. 
Today, the Neighborhood Crime Watch Unit offers support and training for such neighborhood groups, which now total 962 in Boston and account for a third of all streets in the city. The successes have been impressive. Entrenched drug dealers have been exposed and forced out. Muggings have been averted. Suspects have been arrested. Drugs have been seized. Vacant lots have been reclaimed. Neighborhoods have been reborn. Neighborhood watch units have been a vital part of the effort to reduce the crime rate in Boston to the record lows the city is now enjoying. 
I commend Christopher Hayes for his innovative leadership and his extraordinary contribution to our city.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President. It is an honor to call to the attention of my colleagues that Dr. Shukri F. Khuri of the Brockton/West Roxbury, Massachusetts Veterans Affairs Medical Center, has been awarded the 1998 Frank Brown Berry Prize in Federal Medicine. This high honor is bestowed each year in memory of Dr. Frank Brown Berry, a thoracic surgeon and brigadier general who served in both World War I and World War II, and who served for seven years as the top medical officer in the Department of Defense. The award is presented jointly by U.S. Medicine newspaper and the Science Applications International Cooperation. 
Dr. Khuri was chosen for this high honor from a large pool of nominees by a committee of representatives from the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense, the Veterans Health Administration, and the staff of U.S. Medicine. 
Dr. Khuri received his medical education at the American University of Beirut before coming to the United States in 1972. Many of us know AUB well as one of the premier institutions of higher education in the Middle East, and as one of the strongest bulwarks of American ideals and values in that part of the world. Dr. Khuri's recognition as one of the leading medical practitioner-scientists in the United States reminds us of another important fact about AUB. Many of its graduates--5,000 distinguished alumni--live here in the United States and make major contributions to life and society in America. In fact, Dr Khuri serves as President of AUB's Alumni Association of North America. 
Dr. Khuri is now Chief of Surgical Services and Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Brockton/West Roxbury VA Medical Center, the largest open-heart surgery program in the VA health care system. He also serves as the Vice-Chairman of the Department of Surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital and is a Professor of Surgery at the Harvard Medical School. 
Dr. Khuri was honored with the Berry Prize for his accomplishments in three important areas of medical research and innovation. First, he developed a device that monitors on-line myocardial protection during open heart surgery, a device which enables surgeons to monitor the effect of open heart surgery on the patient and to reduce the chance that the surgery will cause irreversible damage. Dr. Khuri's device is a major innovation, and it seems likely to become a standard piece of equipment in all cardiac surgeries. 
Second, in cooperation with the Navy, Dr. Khuri devised strategies to increase the conservation of blood during open-heart surgery. Third, he directed the creation of a model system to assess the quality of care that patients receive by using risk adjustment outcomes. These innovations have significantly affected the practice of medicine in the United States. 
I congratulate Dr. Khuri on the Berry Award and for his important contributions to American medicine. I ask unanimous consent to insert at this point in the Record an article from the August 1998 issue of U.S. Medicine, which describes Dr. Khuri's accomplishments in greater detail.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to pay tribute to Bill Shields of the Department of Defense, who is retiring after two decades of impressive service to the Nation. He is an outstanding attorney whose intellectual skills and dedication have helped to maintain and improve our country's military. 
Bill is a native of Buffalo, New York. He received his BA and JD degrees from the University of Buffalo, and a L.LM from the National Law Center at George Washington University. 
Bill then served in a number of legal positions in the Department of Defense, including assistant in charge of a legal office in Florida, counsel for an air station in Maine, and international law attorney in Japan. 
I first met Bill in 1987, when he joined my staff as a Congressional Fellow with the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. As Chairman of that Committee I was extremely impressed with Bill's work on the Polygraph Protection Act and the Minimum Wage Act. He spent endless hours researching these issues, drafting the statutory language, and preparing witnesses and Senators for hearings. His efforts were indispensable in obtaining enactment of those two critical pieces of legislation. 
After leaving the Committee, Bill served as Deputy Assistant for Civil Affairs and as Deputy Director of the Appellate Government Division in the Department of the Navy, and excelled in both assignments. 
In 1993, he became Legislative Counsel in the Secretary of the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs. In that position, he worked closely with us on the Senate Armed Services Committee on key issues such as acquisition reform, the A-12 aircraft contract termination, and the Seawolf submarine. 
In 1994, Bill was appointed as Counsel and Special Assistant for Legislative Affairs in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. In that position, he has been deeply involved in issues such as research and development, test and evaluation, acquisition policy, major weapons systems, and intelligence. Bill was primary liaison with Congress for the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, the Director of Defense Research and Engineering, the Director of Test Systems Engineering and Evaluation and the Director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. 
In this capacity, Bill worked with Senators and staff on a daily basis to ensure the effective use of scarce defense resources during a period of major defense restructuring. He was responsible for overseeing the authorization of $67 billion of the annual DOD budget for such projects as the F/A-18, F-22 and Joint Strike Fighter aircraft, the New Attack Submarine, the Commanche helicopter, numerous medical research projects and the Technology Reinvestment Program. On all of these issues, Bill's leadership, intelligence, and integrity have contributed significantly to the readiness and ability of our troops in the field. 
Congress and the nation owe a debt of gratitude to Bill Shields. His skillful leadership will continue to have a lasting impact on our national security for years to come. It has been an honor to be associated with this exceptional public servant. His distinguished service will genuinely be missed, both in the Pentagon and in Congress. 
All of us who know Bill are grateful for his leadership and his friendship. We wish him every success in his new position as General Counsel for the American College of Radiology. We know that his wife Maryann, and his three children, Andrew, Molly and Brian, are proud of him as he reaches this special milestone, and all of us in Congress are proud of him too.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate is enacting this legislation to extend the period of copyright protection for an additional twenty years. This extension is needed to coordinate the term of copyright for our creative authors and artists with their European counterparts. 
The principles of copyright are established in the Constitution. They reflect our enduring belief that our nation prospers when it advances knowledge, understanding and the arts. As President Kennedy said, `There is a connection, hard to explain logically but easy to feel, between achievement in public life and progress in the arts. The age of Pericles was also the age of Phidias. The age of Lorenzo de Medici was also the age of Leonardo da Vinci. The age of Elizabeth was also the age of Shakespeare.' 
Effective copyright protection is an important national priority. If the United States is to continue its leadership in world of ideas and creativity, we must continue to provide a climate that encourages America's authors, artists, inventors and composers and the important work that they do. 
The pending legislation also includes an important compromise on the music licensing issue that has prevented adoption of copyright term legislation until now. I am pleased that agreement has been reached between the business and the music licensing communities so that musical authors and composers can enjoy an appropriate return from their creative achievements. 
Finally, the bill also includes an important reference to the current negotiations between the film industry and its guilds. It is gratifying that negotiations will be taking place on the appropriate division of residuals from the earliest films, and I hope that the negotiations will be resolved to the satisfaction of both sides on this important issue of fairness. 
Overall, I commend the bipartisan cooperation that has produced this worthwhile legislation. Our cultural heritage will be strengthened by this measure, and I urge the Senate to approve it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Chairman Jeffords for his leadership in making child literacy a priority and developing this strong legislation. I also commend Senator Coverdell for helping to make this bill a priority in the Senate, and Senator Murray and Senator Dodd for their leadership in issues involving young children. 
I also want to thank Congressman Goodling and Congressman Clay for working effectively to ensure that the Senate and House could reach agreement on this important measure. 
I commend and thank all the staff members of the working group for their skillful assistance in making this process successful: Sherry Kaiman of Senator Jeffords' staff; Townsend Lange of Senator Coats staff; Suzanne Day of Senator Dodd's staff; Elyse Wasch of Senator Reed's staff; Greg Williamson of Senator Murray's staff; Bev Schroeder of Senator Harkin's staff; and Danica Petroshius of my own staff. I also commend the hard work of the House staff on the working group, including Vic Klatt, Sally Lovejoy, D'Arcy Philps, Lynn Selmser, and Bob Sweet of the House Committee majority staff; Alex Nock, Marci Phillips, Mark Zuckerman, and June Harris of the House Committee minority staff; and Charlie Barone of Represenative George Miller's staff. 
Learning to read well is the cornerstone of every child's education. We know that reading skills are fundamental to effective learning in all subjects. The ability to read effectively is the gateway to opportunity and success throughout life. 
Many successful programs are helping children learn to read well. But too often, the best programs are not available to all children. As a result, large numbers of children are denied the opportunity to learn to read well. 40 percent of 4th grade students do not achieve the basic reading level, and 70 percent of 4th graders are not proficient in reading. 
Children who fail to acquire basic reading skills early in life are at a disadvantage throughout their education and later careers. They are more likely to drop out of school, and to be unemployed. We need to do more to ensure that all children learn to read well--and learn to read well early--so that they have a greater chance for successful lives and careers. 
In October 1996, President Clinton and the First Lady initiated a new effort to call national attention to child literacy by proposing their `America Reads Challenge.' Many of us in Congress strongly supported their call for increased aid for reading tutors and other steps to improve child literacy. Today, over 1,000 colleges and universities are committed to the President's `America Reads Work Study Program,' and 59 of these institutions are in Massachusetts. 
Many of the reading difficulties experienced by teenagers and adults today could have been prevented by better attention during early childhood. By working to ensure that all children learn to read well in the early grades, we can reduce the need for costly special education instruction in later grades. We must make every effort to give our public schools the resources necessary to ensure that all children obtain the reading skills they need--at an early age. 
This bill is a major step toward meeting that goal. It provides children, parents, schools, and communities with the resources and opportunities they need to improve child and family literacy--and the help can't come a minute too soon. 
This bill also recognizes that teachers must have adequate resources and proper training in order to be prepared to teach reading well. Teachers must often provide special assistance to children who are having difficulty learning to read. Too often, teachers lack the time, the skills, and the resources to provide children with that assistance. Building on the successful Eisenhower Professional Development Program, which trains teachers in math and science, this bill creates new opportunities for teachers to obtain the training they need to teach reading effectively. 
Communities across the country are initiating innovative projects on reading. At Boston College, a fundamental part of teacher education is training teachers in the best research and practice on ways to teach reading, including helping children develop skills in phonics, sound-and-symbol relationships, and reading comprehension. 
This bill encourages local school districts to build partnerships and work in cooperation with community organizations and state agencies. It ensures that local, state, and national efforts to improve literacy are coordinated, and that the most effective resources and practices are used to meet the needs of children. It also provides communities with support to provide children with trained tutors to give them the opportunity to practice reading with adults. 
In Massachusetts, 59 colleges and universities are providing trained tutors to school children through the Federal Work Study Program. At Boston University, 150 reading tutors are helping 400 needy children learn to read. Students at Worcester Polytechnic Institute serve as reading tutors at the Belmont Community School. The Reading Excellence Act builds upon these successful programs to help communities find and train tutors who can make a difference. 
In addition, children need to have useful reading materials outside of school to help them develop a love of reading early in life. To meet this goal, the bill encourages strong links to a variety of programs for early childhood literacy, and encourages cooperation between community, state, and national organizations to ensure that every child has access to good reading materials. 
Physicians are also part of the effort. Successful pediatric programs, such as Reach Out and Read, can benefit even more children as a result of this bill. This program was created by a team of pediatricians and early childhood educators at Boston City Hospital in 1989. Pediatricians are encouraged to prescribe reading activities as part of childhood medical check-ups, and to see that children leave the doctor's office with a good book in hand. Now, 4,500 health care providers in 46 states have been trained to help nearly one million children and their families. Parents who participate in Reach Out and Read are 8 times more likely to read to their children than parents who do not participate in this pediatric program. 
Children whose parents are involved in their education, who read to them, and who work with them on language skills are more likely to become successful readers. They achieve higher test scores. They have better school attendance records. They graduate at higher rates. And they are more likely to go to college. But children whose parents lack a strong educational foundation are less likely to do so. 
Many parents want to help, but too often they are unable to do so because the parents themselves lack basic reading skills. We can do more to help parents acquire the skills and resources needed to help their children learn to read. This bill will expand local family literacy initiatives, and help states to increase parent involvement. 
Family literacy efforts, such as the Home Instruction Program for Preschool Youngsters in Worcester, Massachusetts, concentrate on providing parents with the education and skills they need to be their children's first reading teachers. These programs teach parents how to read aloud and work with their children at home, and give parents the opportunity to attend literacy and other classes. 
Funds will also be available to the National Institute for Literacy to gather and disseminate information about the best practices for improving child literacy, so that every school and community can take advantage of them. 
This bill targets funds for literacy programs on schools where the needs are greatest. Children in poor schools are more likely to live in homes with parents who have not completed high school and are unemployed. Children from such homes are 5 to 6 times more likely to drop out of school than other children. We should help ensure that they get the opportunities they need to learn to read well. 
Recent successes in Boston prove that targeted efforts to improve schools and student performance can produce real results. After three years of reforms in Boston emphasizing early literacy, high academic standards, and the best teaching practices, students in almost every grade showed significant improvements in math and reading scores on city-wide achievement tests. 
The Samuel W. Mason School in Boston, where 91 percent of the children come from poor families, has gone from one of the lowest-performing schools in the city to scoring in the top quarter of all public schools in the city in reading achievement. They have implemented a school reform approach that focuses on literacy. Teachers were trained in the best reading practices. In addition, they adapted teaching styles to fit children's learning styles, tested the children every six weeks to measure improvement, and focused on improving family literacy in the community. 
The bill will help provide children with the readiness skills and support they need to learn to read once they enter school. It will help teach every child to read in these early years--from preschool though the 3rd grade. And, it will improve the instructional practices of teachers and other staff in elementary schools with the greatest need for extra help. 
The bill provides competitive grants to states to improve child literacy. Each state will create a plan to address the needs of its teachers and communities for improving student achievement in reading. Eligible school districts will be able to apply to the state for funds to support teacher training in how to teach reading well in elementary schools with the greatest need for help, and to support partnerships among eligible school districts and community organizations that support early learning, tutoring, adult literacy, and that provide children and families with access to books. 
The lowest-achieving and poorest schools will benefit. Local school districts that are eligible for subgrants fall into three categories: (1) districts that have at least one low-performing school in school improvement under Title I; (2) districts that have schools with the highest and second highest number of poor children in the state; and (3) districts that have schools with the highest and second highest poverty rates in the states. 
The bill amends Title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and authorizes $260 million each year for fiscal years 1999 and 2000. 
By building on successful programs such as the Eisenhower Professional Development Program, the College Work Study Program, and the Even Start Program, this bill provides state and local education agencies with the support they need to bring successful programs to their teachers, students, and communities. 
Children do not learn to read on their own. Children need well-trained teachers who can give them the assistance they deserve. Children need trained tutors who can work with them outside the classroom. They need involved parents who know how to read and know how to work effectively with their children at home. Children need access to effective reading materials at home. And, children need the opportunity to acquire reading readiness skills early, so that they come to school ready to learn to read. 
The Reading Excellence Act ensures that the best methods and resources are more widely available to schools, families, and children across the country. I urge the Senate to pass this important legislation.

Mr. KENNEDY. I have before me--and I will include in the Record--an excellent letter written by representatives of 30 different organizations representing women. I would like to ask if the Senator would agree with me that this issue involving the Patients' Bill of Rights has special importance to women. It does--as I will mention in just a moment--to those who have been afflicted with breast cancer. And, of course, the nurses in this country are all in support. 
But would the Senator agree with this letter, which is sponsored by the 30 organizations? I will include it in its entirety. 
Few issues resonate as profoundly and pervasively as the need for quality health care, and women have a particular stake in the changes in our health care delivery system. Women are the primary consumers of health care services in this country, and we have unique health care needs. Women also take care of the health care needs of our families, from children to elderly relatives. Because of the great impact any patient protection bill will ultimately have on women, we ask that you support real reform that will truly improve women's health. 
The Patients' Bill of Rights Act (S. 1890) takes the needs of all consumers seriously, and it pays particular attention to the needs of women. The genuine and often unique concerns of women are woven into the fabric of this bill. S. 1890 recognizes that women's health can only be improved by comprehensive reform. 
I am just wondering if the Senator would agree, first of all, as a strong supporter of the legislation, that he believes that the Republican leadership is derelict in its duty by failing to bring up legislation that can have that kind of importance to the mothers and to the wives, to the sisters, to the daughters, of families in this country?  
This is supported by 30 organizations that represent women, children, and families. 
Does the Senator not agree with me that the Republican leadership has been derelict in failing to give us an opportunity to address these issues which are central to the concern of women in our society and their health care needs?

Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator agree that is one of the most important issues before families in this country? We believe, as supporters of the Patients' Bill of Rights, Senator Daschle's bill, that doctors ought to be making decisions with regard to the health of women in our society. That is the key underlying difference between the Patients' Bill of Rights and other substitutes, but this is a matter of urgency, a matter of importance.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are reaching the final days of this Congress, and the leadership is deciding about which measures the Senate is going to consider during these final few days. 
As I mentioned previously, we have identified a number of different pieces of legislation that I don't believe, and I don't think the American people believe rise up in importance as to protecting the families of this country with the kinds of protections that we would have with our Patients' Bill of Rights. But, we have been unable to have this legislation up before the Senate, to have it debated and discussed, and to have a resolution by this body in a timely way. 
As I have mentioned on other occasions, it is Friday afternoon at 2 o'clock and most Americans are still working. The Senate should be, on an issue of this importance, still here and debating these issues and resolving these matters in ways which I think, with a full debate and an open discussion, resolve these matters in favor of the families, in favor of the patients, in favor of this country. 
It is a very basic and fundamental issue--whether we are going to have the medical professionals--the doctors and nurses--make the ultimate judgment in terms of health care, or whether those decisions are going to be made by the HMOs, the insurance companies, and their accountants. 
For all Americans who are participating in these HMOs, they have paid the premiums and they expect their medical treatment will be decided by medical professionals, and not accountants in the insurance industry. 
I doubt very much whether these HMOs--when they are out recruiting new members to join and pay their premiums from their hard-earned money which they work for every single day--are saying, `Well, we want you to know that the people who are going to be making decisions about your health care are going to be the accountants, and not the doctors we are referencing in our pamphlets.' 
Mr. President, this morning in the Wall Street Journal on the front page there was a rather ominous report. This is from this morning, Friday, October 2nd, on the front page of the Wall Street Journal: `Politicians seek to profit from the debate over health-care policies.' 
This is the debate--the one issue--that is before the U.S. Senate, the Patients' Bill of Rights. There are other health care issues. But this is the health care issue that commands the wide-range support of over 180 different organizations reflecting all of the various medical professionals--all the nurses, all the cancer patient organizations, all of the children's organizations, all of the disability organizations, and all of the women organizations. They have all virtually embraced and endorsed this health care debate that we have been trying to have. The debate has been rather one-sided since we have not been able to have engagement from the other side on this issue. 
We have the Wall Street Journal saying the following. This is an exact quote:  
The GOP's congressional campaign committee invites a `select group' of health-care-industry leaders to a meeting Tuesday on the issue. The ticket price: $25,000 each.' 
$25,000 each. 
The meeting `will last one hour' only, says an invitation signed by Illinois Representative Hastert and California Representative Thomas. That would exceed $400 a minute per person for the fundraiser. 
These are the two leading Republican House Members that have been opposed to the Patients' Bill of Rights. Evidently, Mr. President, we have been unable to get this measure before the Senate of the United States--we find that because of the fact that the legislation has been shelved, pigeonholed, the result is that our Republican friends are having a `select group' of health care industry leaders who will pay $25,000 to go to a meeting. 
Mr. President, let us look at the most recent report of last month, a new study by Common Cause, which I saw this morning. I asked my staff to get the most recent study by Common Cause about contributions to the Republican National Committee by this industry. They reported that the industry which gave the most soft money to the Republicans of any group was the insurance industry. 
It is very interesting that here we have the industry paying $25,000 each for each of their personnel to go to a fundraiser with people who have been effectively there to sidetrack this legislation. Then, when we look back, we find out the insurance industry has opened up its coffers to the party that is keeping us from debating this and resolving this in the U.S. Senate. 
That is what is happening. The American people do not understand that. If they don't understand very much, they understand this: That Common Cause reported that in the first 6 months of this year they gave $5.5 million. This is where they have contributed. 
I daresay we will find out as we move on through, month by month, and then at the end of the year the reports will come in after the election about what they have done in terms of the various candidates. 
This is what we are faced with on the one hand. This is what we are faced with: Big money and powerful special interests denying the opportunity for the interests of these various organizations and the people they represent--not just Members of the U.S. Senate who favor this position but those who are really the constituencies of these organizations. We are talking about the Children's Legal Defense Fund that has represented the interests of the children. We are talking about the range of different groups that have been representing the disabled. We are talking about the medical societies representing the doctors and nurses societies--denying those particular interests the opportunity for debate on this legislation. 
Mr. President, earlier today we heard some very moving testimony. It has been typical of the testimony that we have been hearing over the period of recent weeks and months. 
This is by Mr. A.G. Newmyer of The Epilepsy Foundation.

Mr. KENNEDY. Let me highlight what we heard this morning. 
Good morning. My name is Newmyer and I'm here on behalf of the 2.5 million Americans who have seizure disorders, and their families. Some of these folks are well known to you--former Congressman Tony Coelho, Representative Neil Abercrombie, Congressman Hoyer's late wife. Others are total strangers--like me. And a couple hundred people on the Hill either have epilepsy or someone in their family does, but you don't know about it because stigma and fear keep these folks in the closet. 
The Epilepsy Foundation urges passage of strong patients' rights legislation. Today's health insurance system is a mean-spirited, predatory mess. But it's far worse for people with special medical needs. 
Those of you who cover this debate may recall that Tracy Buccholz from MN was the first public witness before the President's commission on health care. Tracy has epilepsy and led a rather normal life until her health plan started playing games with her life. She explained to the commission, when she came to Washington to testify, that she had been waiting eight months for permission to see her neurologist, because the literature and promises of her plan. 
I'd like to make three brief points this morning. 
First, the member satisfaction statistics are pure nonsense. If I asked each of you how you like your life insurance, you'd think I was nuts. You'd tell me that you think it's fine--you never had to use it. The same thing's true for the 80% of Americans who have no significant medical need in any one year. I urge the press to focus on satisfaction among plan participants who have faced a serious medical need. 
That is important, Mr. President. 
Second, to those members who say they don't want to interfere in the insurance market, let's be serious. The user isn't the customer. Most patients get insurance at work and have very little choice. When the person making the purchase decision isn't the user of the service, it's not a market. It's an anomaly. And it needs to be fixed. Now. 
That is a very important point, Mr. President. 
Finally, I know of no other segment of our society where some people elect to engage in predatory behavior knowing that the victims can't go to court. No patients want more lawsuits. Patients want health plans to stop horsing around. Patients want to fix a system where some people prosper by denying care. The key is ERISA reform, which is why it's being fought so hard by for-profit managed care plans. 
Do you really think these plans can't afford for people with seizures to have easy access to decent care? 
That is very moving, Mr. President, and clearly all of the organizations want us to debate and resolve these issues, because every single day they know that the lives of their members, like other Americans' lives, are being threatened by the abuses in the HMO system. 
Finally, Mr. President, there is Debra Ness, executive vice president of the National Partnership for Women & Families. 
We need a full and fair debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights Act before the end of this session. Every day Congress delays, patients suffer: 
Imagine your father being sick, and watching helplessly as his insurance company overrules his doctor about what treatment is best for him. 
And yet . . . Congress delays. 
Imagine your wife being told she can't participate in a clinical trial that might be the only opportunity to save her life. 
And yet . . . Congress delays. 
Imagine your child becoming permanently disabled because your insurance company wouldn't let you go to the nearest emergency room. 
And yet . . . Congress delays. 
Imagine the chronic disease you have managed for years suddenly going awry because your cost-conscious health plan refused to let you continue using the medication that helped stabilize your condition. [This happens, Mr. President. This happens.] 
And yet . . . Congress delays. 
We've talked with women around the country who told us with great passion how they believe the health care industry has abandoned patients for profits. They desperately want health plans to provide quality care, and they are convinced that government must play a role in setting quality standards. 
And yet . . . Congress delays. 
Just one bill responds to these legitimate and deep-felt concerns, and that is S. 1890, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act. It is the only bill that gives patients real protections, not phony substitutes. The Senate has an opportunity--and an obligation to Americans--to enact meaningful patient protections by passing S. 1890, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act.

Mr. KENNEDY. There are now more than 180 organizations that are supporting it. The time is running short, but, as we have seen in the paper, there is a great deal of work yet to be done. We have not lost faith that still, somehow, the central concerns of families across this country can be listened to and responded to with a positive answer that, still, we might be able to, even in these last days of this session, have action to protect our families in this country.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the conference report on the Fiscal Year 1999 Defense authorization bill. The House and Senate conferees have produced a worthwhile defense bill that deserves to be approved. 
Before the conference, the House version contained several provisions that the administration had threatened to veto. We worked effectively in our deliberations with the House to resolve these differences and find satisfactory solutions. 
Gender integration in basic military training is the first of these important issues. In the Fiscal Year 1998 Defense Authorization Act, Congress established a bipartisan panel to review gender integration in basic military training. That commission has started its work and will report to us next year. The conference compromise on this issue will enable the commission to finish its work, while requiring each of the services to provide separate, safe and secure housing for male and female recruits with the sleeping areas separated by permanent barriers and limited access. 
The second of these issues is production of tritium for the nation's strategic arsenal. The Secretary of Energy has already initiated a comprehensive analysis to determine the best way to produce this material. That study will be concluded by December 31, 1998. The conference report includes a provision to withhold funds for the implementation of the Secretary of Energy's recommendation until full and complete congressional review next year. 
The conference report provides needed support for our military forces while maintaining a realistic balance between readiness to take care of immediate needs, and investment in new systems for the future. The report also includes a fully funded and well-deserved 3.6 percent pay raise for military personnel. 
We also tried to deal with the important and complex issue of military retiree health care. The report includes a provision for the Department of Defense to initiate a comprehensive test plan to evaluate the best method to provide health care to retired military personnel and their families. The Department of Defense will establish two demonstration plans, which will be evaluated before any future implementation. The first plan will allow selected retirees to enroll in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan. The second plan will implement a redesigned pharmacy benefit for Medicare-eligible DOD beneficiaries at two sites. This plan will also provide needed information for reducing out-of-pocket costs for military retirees. 
Protecting the safety of our service men and women was also high on our priorities in the conference. The daily operations of our military forces have obvious risks and dangers. All branches of the Armed Forces have made progress in improving safety, but more remains to be done. I commend the Department of Defense for its accelerated installation of needed additional safety systems on military aircraft that carry passengers. The conference report includes additional funding for aircraft safety modifications. 
Our troops are at risk from high tech attacks as well. The growing frequency and sophistication of such attacks on the Pentagon's computer networks demonstrate the need for improved protection of critical networks. The conference report recognizes the importance of this effort and supports the Air Force cyber-security program. 
In the past 8 years, the Navy-Marine Corps team has responded to over 90 contingencies--almost one per month. As the ranking Democrat on the Seapower Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, I am pleased that the conference report provides the support necessary for our naval forces as they modernize to meet the challenges of tomorrow. 
The report includes the necessary advance procurement funding for fiscal year 1999 for the Navy's next aircraft carrier, CVN-77. The Navy's procurement schedule for this carrier, revised from its budget submission of last year, will be under the cost cap mandated in last year's Defense Authorization Act. Also, much of the new technology being developed for the next generation aircraft carrier, the CVX, will be included in CVN-77. 
The budget request for the 30 Navy F/A-18E/F Super Hornet fighters is included in the report. The Super Hornet combines the outstanding characteristics of earlier F/A-18 models with cutting edge technology in an affordable aircraft with significantly improved performance and endurance. 
In addition, the Marine Corps' MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft procurement for next year was increased to eight. The Osprey is a vertical take-off and landing aircraft designed to replace the Marine Corps' aging fleet of CH-46 and CH-53 helicopters. 
The constructive compromises we reached during the conference on critical issues have produced a comprehensive bill which provides effectively for our national security, and which contains no provisions that would draw a veto. 
I also join in commending the distinguished leadership of the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond. He has worked effectively with all of us to see that our national security and the needs of our service men and women are met in this legislation. It has been a privilege to work with Senator Thurmond as chairman, and I look forward to continuing our work together on this important issues. It is especially fitting that this bill is named in his honor. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Strong Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999.

It does seem to me to suggest that we ought to spend our time addressing those matters which are of central importance and consequence and seriousness to the American people. 
I know on the issue that is before the Senate at the present time that this will be disposed of either later this evening--and I will not interfere should the managers themselves want to have the final disposition of that this evening--but I have understood that the final disposition on this particular proposal would probably carry over to tomorrow.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the matter that I want to address, again, is the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is time for our Republican leadership to stop the blocking of the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is time for them to stop protecting the insurance company profits and start protecting the parties. It is time for them to stop manipulating the rules of the Senate to deny the American people the protections they deserve. 
It is clear what is going on here. It is clear to every Member of the Senate. It should be clear to the American people. The American people want Congress to pass strong, effective legislation to end the abuse by HMOs, the managed care plans, and the health insurance companies. 
The Patients' Bill of Rights, sponsored by Senator Daschle and Senate Democrats, provides the needed and long overdue antidote to the festering and growing abuses. Our goal is to protect patients and see that insurance plans provide the quality care they promise but too often fail to deliver. 
Two hundred groups of patients, doctors, nurses, and families have announced support for our bill and are begging the Republican leadership to listen to their voices. I have the list of the various groups supporting our legislation. They represent virtually all of the major doctor and nurse organizations and consumer groups, starting with the American Medical Association, the various cancer societies, the National Breast Cancer Coalition, and all of the American nursing associations. The supporters also include those groups that are most interested in the health care of children including the Children's Defense Fund and the American Academy of Pediatrics. These groups also represent our senior citizens including the National Council of Senior Citizens. The bill is also supported by groups that are most interested in mental health, the Mental Health Association, and those groups most concerned about disability policies including the Multiple Sclerosis Society, United Cerebral Palsy, the American Academy of Neurology, and the Center on Disability and Health. 
This, Mr. President, is only one page of a series of pages of different groups where it can be said, without contradiction, that every major medical association in our country supports the Daschle proposal which is sponsored by the Democrats. Virtually every single doctors organization, every single nurses organization, every single consumer organization, every organization that has represented children in our society, every association that represents cancer victims, every association that represents the disability community--every one of those organizations, plus many others, support our particular proposal. There is not one organization, not a single organization, that supports the alternative Republican proposal. We have asked day in and day out for them just to find one organization representing any of the doctors or nurses, children's groups, women's groups, cancer victims groups, disability groups, any of those groups in our society, and all we have is silence. 
This isn't a matter that we are advocating because of our particular interest. We are advocating on behalf of all of these organizations and all of the various patients and all of the various families that are part of this central concern about how we best can protect the families in this country. The best way those families can be protected is, at least, through debate on a Patients' Bill of Rights and, I believe, by the enactment of this legislation. 
As we have said on many different occasions, these are commonsense solutions to the kind of problems that are real problems out there and that are being faced by families every single day. If a child is sick and the parents of that child belong to one HMO, that ambulance has to drive by the nearest emergency room and go to an emergency room across town because it is on the list of that HMO. When that child is in an emergency situation, they ought to be able to go to the nearest hospital--that is one of our bills' protections. It is listed right here. We believe that child ought to have the opportunity to go to the nearest emergency room and have the kind of immediate attention, but also the follow-up attention that they need. 
That right would be guaranteed under our Patients' Bill of Rights. We want to debate that issue. That is a commonsense proposal. It is a commonsense proposal that any family can understand. If there is going to be an emergency affecting a child, it makes no sense to drive them by the nearest emergency room and take them clear across town to a more distant emergency room if that child needs immediate medical attention. 
That is common sense. That protection is here. We ought to be able to debate that particular issue, but we are denied that opportunity. We ought to be able to get to it. I believe it wouldn't take a great deal of time. 
The list goes on. Our bill was introduced in March. But, the Senate has taken no action because the Republican leadership has been using every trick in the procedural playbook to prevent a meaningful debate. The Republican leadership is abusing the rules of the Senate so that the health insurance companies can continue to abuse patients. That happens to be the fact. 
We have too many instances of reports from patients that say, every single day we fail to provide these guarantees, members of their family are put at risk. Every day we continue to deny women who have breast cancer the opportunity to be involved in clinical trials at places like the Lombardi Center, we are putting those particular women at risk. 
As I mentioned yesterday, out at the Lombardi Center they have eight professional individuals whose only job is to argue with the HMOs to permit the parties involved, access to the clinical trials their doctors say are necessary but that the HMO will not permit them access to. 
Our bill provides these kinds of protections. It is common sense. Without these kinds of protections, we are endangering the lives of those individuals who ought to be a part of the clinical trials. That is a very important protection. 
Every day, we are denied that kind of debate and resolution, but we still find that patients are abused by too many of the HMOs. The Republican leadership wants to gag the Senate so that HMOs can continue to gag the doctors who tell patients about needed treatments that are too expensive for the HMO balance sheet. 
I use those words `gag the Senate' because all we have had on the other side is the proposal that you can have one, two, or three amendments but no other. You can't have any others. We are not going to take the time of the U.S. Senate to do it, 
although we did find time to have a debate on the issue of salting; we had time to debate that issue. We had time to debate the issues on the Vacancies Act. We have had time to debate issues like bankruptcy which affects 1.2 million people. But our patient protections bill, which affects tens of millions of our fellow citizens, we evidently, haven't got the time to debate that. 
The Republican leadership wants to deny a fair debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights so HMOs can continue to deny the needed patient care. The Republican leadership wants to avoid accountability in the U.S. Senate so that managed care plans can avoid accountability with their unfair decisions, when their unfair decisions kill or injure patients. The Republican leadership has found time to call up the Vacancy Act, the salting bill, the Child Custody Act, the Bankruptcy Act, and the Internet tax bill. So it is clear that protecting patients from abuse by HMOs and health insurance companies is a priority for American families, but not for the Republican leadership. 
How else can that be explained? How else can you explain the fact that the Republican leadership has called up these different pieces of legislation, but denies us the opportunity to debate this issue, which is of essential importance? 
Listen to this, Mr. President. The Republican leadership, just yesterday, agreed to a unanimous consent agreement on the Internet tax bill that would have allowed all relevant amendments--no limitation on the number of amendments, no limitation on the time to debate each amendment, and no limitation on the time for the overall debate. We should have the opportunity to do that on the Patients' Bill of Rights, but, oh, no, we can't do that with the Patients' Bill of Rights--even though the failure to provide these protections puts at risk so many fellow citizens every single day. 
But no, the Republican leadership said instead we will have a consent agreement on the Internet tax bill. I wonder how many people here in the Senate, let alone those who are watching, would feel that particular issue is of more importance than the Patients' Bill of Rights. We have moved ahead now on the questions of that particular legislation, and I intend to support it. It is important legislation, particularly for a State like mine, Massachusetts, with a lot of high tech and similar kinds of issues. But, Mr. President, to put this bill on the same level as what we are talking about with the Patients' Bill of Rights, it just shouldn't be. 
Senator Daschle asked Senator Lott for a similar agreement on the Patients' Bill of Rights on June 25. He asked him for an agreement on July 29. He asked him on September 1, and he asked him on September 9. Each time, Senator Lott, the Senate Republican leader, said no. Do we understand that, Mr. President? On June 25, on this legislation--the Patients' Bill of Rights, Senator Daschle asked for the same kind of agreement made yesterday by the Republican leadership on the Internet tax bill. He asked for it on July 29. He asked for it September 1. He asked for it on September 9. Each time, Senator Lott and the Senate Republicans said no. 
Senator Daschle also offered to agree on May 12 and on July 16, to a far more restrictive agreement, limiting the number of amendments, but Senator Lott and the Republicans said no. Senator Lott and the Senate Republicans are perfectly willing to agree to essentially unlimited debate on the Internet tax bill, but they are not willing to allow any reasonable opportunity to debate, amend, and vote on the Patients' Bill of Rights. This record of abuse should be unacceptable to the Senate, and it certainly is unacceptable to the American public. 
What does our legislation do, and why is the Republican leadership so anxious to prevent its consideration? Our bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights takes insurance company accountants out of the practice of medicine and returns decisionmaking to patients' doctors, where it belongs. That is it. When you come right down to it, there it is. When you are going to the emergency room, an accountant can say, `No, you can't go there, you have to go across town.' Our bill says if you have an emergency, go to the nearest one. If you need access to a specialist and the primary care physician says go to a specialist, you can go to a specialist. Or if you need a pediatric specialist, where a child has cancer--you can go to an oncology specialist for children. These are common sense protections. It is the doctors, the patients, the medical professions making the decision, not the accountants. That's the bottom line. 
Mr. President, when we say these are commonsense solutions, I daresay that 99 percent of the American people would agree that doctors and nurses ought to make the decisions with regard to health care issues for your family and for your children, not accountants. That is what we are trying to do and that is at the heart of this debate. But we are denied the opportunity to have that debate because once you go and say you are going to have the medical decisions affecting your family decided by doctors and trained medical professionals, it somehow may threaten the profits of the health delivery system, the HMOs. Those HMOs have layers of different individuals that say `no.' 
I am reminded of when President Clinton said just a week ago, `You never find an accountant in an HMO that loses his job for saying `no.' They don't get fired. The ones that get fired are the ones that say `yes.' Yes, they need to go to a specialist; yes, they need additional kinds of important types of prescription drugs; yes, they need to have the kind of care that may be more costly, but, more importantly, may save the life of that individual; and, yes, it may very well be if those people get better, it would be less costly to the HMO over a long period of time. That is the issue, Mr. President. That is the bottom line. 
Our program simply guarantees people the rights that every honorable insurance company already provides, and provides an effective and timely means to enforce these rights. The good, honorable insurance companies do that, Mr. President, and so do some of the HMOs. But, many of them do not. And what happens is they obviously have the competitive advantage over the good ones. That is wrong. They have the competitive advantage because they shortchange the protection of their consumers, and that is what is at the heart of this whole debate. The protections we provide, as I mentioned, are commonsense components of good health care that every family believes they were promised when they purchased their health insurance and paid the premiums. Virtually all of the protections in this legislation are already available under medical care. 
As I mentioned, of these 15 protections which are at the heart of our legislation, over half of them are already in the law under Medicare. Over half of them have been unanimously recommended by the President's bipartisan commission--not in legislation, but recommended as being essential in terms of good health care. And we know that many of them have been recommended by various health care plans, and many have even been recommended by the insurance commissioners that have responsibility--made up of Republicans and Democrats alike. 
You cannot find on this list a single one of these commonsense protections that haven't been recommended by at least one of those four groups. And most of them have been recommended by two, or even three, of those groups. These aren't off-the-wall kinds of protections. These are commonsense protections. They are recommended by those who understand what the opportunity and the problems are in terms of health care delivery by HMOs. That is it. Why don't we have the opposition saying, `Where did you find 5, or 6, or 7, or 10 of those various recommendations? Where in the world did they come from? Who thought those up?' That isn't an argument that is made. 
All 15--are either recommended by the bipartisan President's commission, the health plan agencies themselves, Medicare, or the insurance industry themselves. That is why, when we say these are common sense, they are, Mr. President. 
If you are not going to find the various health plans responding to these recommendations and enforcing them, at some time you are going to have to go ahead with this. I daresay that the very good HMOs are complying with this now. They have nothing to fear. That is why many of the HMOs endorse this, because they are already doing it. The good ones are already doing it. The good ones have absolutely no fear about it. It is just the other ones. Those are the ones that result in the kinds of tragedies that have been listed by so many of our colleagues over the preceding weeks and months. These are commonsense rights that provide access to the appropriate specialists when the patient's condition requires specialty care. They allow people with chronic illnesses and disabilities to have referrals to the specialists that they need on a regular basis. They provide for a continuity of care so the people will not have to interrupt their course of treatment and find another doctor because their health plan drops their physician or because their employer changes health plans in the middle of a treatment, for example. 
When a member of the family is being treated with chemotherapy and has to have a combination of treatment over 6 or 12 months, or 18 months, to find out in the middle of that, after 5 months, with all the kinds of anxieties that people are affected by, that the particular company has changed HMOs and suddenly that doctor and the nurse and the treatment are pulled out from underneath you, we think that family ought to be protected. That individual who is going through that particular chemotherapy, or specialized care, ought to be able to complete that particular treatment. 
Is that such a radical idea, when you have an individual who has had all of these kinds of concerns--not just financial concerns, but the emotional, the pain, and the suffering--and finally to have what is so important, the doctor-patient relationship, the trust and confidence in that doctor, and then, because some bureaucratic decision is made to pull that doctor away from that particular patient--we think there ought to be a guarantee that there can at least be the continuation of care for that particular incidence of care. 
Is that so dramatic? Is that so unreasonable? Is that so outrageous? It seems to me that is common sense. 
No patient with symptoms of a stroke should be forced to delay treatment to the point where paralysis and disability are permanent because a managed care accountant does not respond promptly and appropriately. 
Patients with serious illnesses, like cancer, Alzheimer's, osteoporosis, or rheumatoid arthritis, who cannot be helped by standard treatment, should have the right to participate in the quality clinical trials that can help find a cure or offer the hope of improvement. Traditionally, insurance has allowed patients this opportunity. But, no; managed care is saying no to both the patients and medical personnel. Now, too many of the managed care companies are saying no to both. Patients and medical research are suffering. 
It was unthinkable 5 years ago that when a doctor recommended that a child participate in a clinical trial, the insurance wouldn't cover them. They all did. It has only been in the most recent times where it is becoming a pattern and practice of too many HMOs that say no, we are not going to permit you to participate, even though a doctor believes that it is in the health interests of the individual to participate in those particular clinical trials. 
Mr. President, the thing that is really so shocking is that we are now seeing extraordinary breakthroughs--every single week there are new medical breakthroughs. Particularly in the areas of cancer, there are new medical breakthroughs, and specifically in the area of breast cancer. 
Look at all of the work that has been done in terms of the mapping of the human gene and isolating the various DNA through research. Look at the extraordinary work that is being done out at NIH and a few of the other great research centers, and the new kinds of opportunities that are available through research that are targeting these kinds of illnesses and diseases. I personally believe that the next century is going to be the century of the life sciences. Just at a time when we have the greatest opportunity for cures of the most dreaded disease, we are closing down the opportunities for participating in these clinical trials. It is just extraordinary. 
In the testimony that we have seen, it is clear that there isn't really any additional cost to the various HMOs, because all they are asking for is continuity of care for the patient, and just to continue to pay the outlay--not for the particular analysis of the various clinical trials, not for the new kinds of medications that might be rare and expensive, not to do summations, or pay, or participate in terms of these other kinds of studies. Absolutely not. All the HMO has to do is the continuity of care--just provide the kind of care that they would otherwise be providing. 
That is the amazement of some of the top researchers who appeared before our forums, who were in charge of some of the most important clinical trials in this country, because they say it really doesn't cost the HMO any more. The fact is, if the patients participate, they may very well and so often do get much better, and it saves the HMO a great deal of resources and funding. That is why there is an absolute disbelief on the part of so many of the top researchers. 
They pointed out that not only were we disadvantaging so many individuals, particularly in the area of cancers, and specifically in the area of breast cancer and clinical trials, but also that the research progress was being hurt here in the United States because of the failure of participation of many of these patients. 
As I mentioned just a moment ago, in all of the various forums that we had, there were many different facts that stood out. But when you have the top clinicians say that at the Lombardi Clinical Research Center, here within the shadow of the Nation's Capitol, they have eight highly professional people who are spending all of their time all day long wrestling with HMOs based on the fact that doctors have recommended that their patients participate in these clinical trials, but yet still have to spend all of their time arguing with the HMO to permit those individuals to actually participate in these clinical trials. It is absolutely beyond belief to me, absolutely beyond belief.

Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield for a question. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOCNO>105-kennedy-ma-3-19981001</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. KENNEDY. If I could just add to what the Senator has pointed out, would you believe that in the Republican proposal, for example, any medical procedure that wasn't over $1,000 could not be appealed? And so for the kind of situation that the Senator is talking about, under the Republican proposal, they say, oh, look, we have taken care of that, except if that medical procedure is less than $1,000. Then there is no opportunity for appeal. So, effectively, you are saying there are no MRIs for any child who falls off a bicycle, gets hit playing football, falls down or has an accident playing hockey. And the Senator from Illinois knows families as I do that deny their children the opportunity to play sports because they haven't got health insurance or because they are not going to be able to get any kind of coverage for sickness or illness. 
As bad as it is, as the Senator has pointed out, we ought to have an opportunity--would the Senator not agree, to debate this sort of phony protection advanced by the Republicans, saying we will guarantee some opportunity for appeal but not if it was under $1,000. 
Patients should have the right to appeal decisions of their plans to independent third parties. Today, if a health plan breaks its promise, there is no remedy that can provide relief in time to save a life or prevent a disability. 
Independent review was recommended unanimously by the President's Commission. It has worked successfully in Medicare for over thirty years. Families deserve the basic fairness that only an impartial appeal can provide. Without such a remedy, any `rights' of patients exist on paper only--and they are often worth no more than the paper on which they are printed. When the issues are sickness and health--and often as serious as life and death--no health insurance company should be allowed to be both judge and jury. 
In addition, when the misconduct of managed care plans actually results in serious injury or death, patients and their families should be able to hold the plans liable in court. Every other industry in America can be held responsible for its actions. Why should health plans, whose decisions truly can mean life or death, enjoy this unique and unfair immunity? 
Under current law--the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act--patients whose lives have been devastated or destroyed by the reckless behavior of their health plan have no right to go to court to obtain an appropriate remedy under state law. ERISA `preempts' all state remedies. Patients are limited to the narrow federal remedy under ERISA, which covers only the cost of the procedure that the plan failed to pay for. You can be crippled for life by cancer because your plan refused to authorize a test costing a few hundred dollars to detect the cancer in its early stages--and all you can get back to help support your family is the cost of the test you failed to get. 
During the debate on the tobacco legislation, Republicans and Democrats alike voted overwhelmingly to support the principle that no industry in America should be exempt from accountability for its actions. Because of ERISA preemption, one industry alone--the health insurance industry--enjoys this protection today. That is wrong--and the Senate should say it's wrong. 
During the debate on welfare reform, many on the other side of the aisle spoke strongly in favor of the need for individuals to take responsibility for their actions. It is ironic that some of those who spoke most strongly for responsibility for poor single mothers are opposed to responsibility for a powerful industry that earns tens of billions of dollars in profits every year. 
What most Americans do not know--and what the opponents of change ignore--is that ERISA pre-emption does not apply to state and local employee health plans. Employees of the city government or state government, whose health benefits are provided by taxpayers, can hold their health plan accountable in court if it kills or injures them. But equally hardworking families down the street are defenseless--because they happen to work for private industry. 
Our legislation is truly a Patients' Bill of Rights that will provide these protections and more. It is a moderate, responsible, and effective response to the widespread problems patients and their families face every day. That is why it is supported by a broad and diverse coalition of doctors, nurses, patients, and advocates for children, women, and working families. That is why it enjoys bi-partisan support from members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, including a courageous physician, Dr. Greg Ganske, a Republican Congressman from Iowa, who has seen the abuses of managed care first-hand. 
The Republican leadership plan, by contrast, is not supported by any group of doctors or nurses or patients. It has no bi-partisan support. It is an industry profit protection program, not a patient protection program. It is not a Patients' Bill of Rights. It is a Patients' Bill of Wrongs. That is why we need a full debate--so that it can be amended and improved until it provides the protections patients need. 
If the Majority Leader will stop abusing the rules of the Senate and allow this debate to proceed, I believe that the Senate will pass strong reforms that will be signed into law by the President. The American people deserve real reform, and I believe that when the Senate votes in the clear light of day, it will give the American people the reforms they deserve. This issue is a test of the Senate's willingness to put a higher priority on the needs of families than on the profits of special interests. And it is time for the Senate to act. 
The choice is clear. The Senate should stand with patients, families, and physicians, not with the well-heeled special interests that put profits ahead of patients. 
The American people know what's going on. Movie audiences across the country erupt in cheers when actress Helen Hunt attacks the abuses of managed care in the film `As Good As It Gets.' Helen Hunt won an Oscar for that performance, but managed care isn't winning any Oscars from the American people. Everyone knows that managed care today is not `as good as it gets.' 
Too often, managed care is mismanaged care. No amount of distortions or smokescreens by insurance companies can change the facts. The Patients' Bill of Rights can stop these abuses. Let's pass it now, before more patients have to suffer. 
I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there are just a few remaining days in this Congress, and the Republican leadership continues to block action on a Patients' Bill of Rights. It is clear what is going on here. It is clear to every Member of the Senate. It should be clear to the American people. The American people want Congress to pass strong, effective legislation to end the abuses by HMOs, managed care plans, and health insurance companies. 
The Patients' Bill of Rights, sponsored by Senator Daschle and Senate Democrats, provides the needed and long overdue anecdote to these festering and growing abuses. Our goal is to protect patients and see that insurance plans provide the quality care they promise but too often fail to deliver, and to make sure that the plans, having given assurances to those who sign up for the plans, include the protections they say are going to be there. They aren't in too many of the cases today. And we want to remedy that. 
Our bill was introduced last March. Earlier legislation was introduced more than a year and a half ago, but the Senate has taken no action because the Republican leadership has been using every trick in the procedural playbook to prevent a meaningful debate. 
The Republican leadership is abusing the rules of the Senate so that health insurance companies can continue to abuse patients. The Republican leadership wants to gag the Senate so that HMOs can continue to gag doctors who tell patients about needed treatments that are expensive for HMO balance sheets. The Republican leadership wants to deny a fair debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights so that HMOs can continue to deny needed patient care. The Republican leadership wants to avoid accountability in the U.S. Senate so that managed care plans can avoid accountability when their unfair decisions kill or injure patients. 
This record of abuse should be unacceptable to the Senate, and it is certainly unacceptable to the American people. Almost 200 groups of patients, doctors, nurses and families have announced their support for our bill and are begging the Republican leadership to listen to their voices. 
Mr. President, here on the Senate floor we have listed some of the various groups that support the Patients' Bill of Rights, which, as I have pointed out, was introduced last March. We introduced similar legislation a year and a half ago. We were denied effectively any hearings; denied any consideration by the committee; denied any consideration here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
On this chart is the list of some of the organizations that support this legislation that we are trying to debate, even in the final days of the session, in which we have been denied the opportunity to debate. You can see them and read them. They have been put into the Record constantly: the American Medical Association, the American Cancer Society, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the National Partnership for Women and Families, the National Association of Children's Hospitals, the AFL-CIO, the American Nurses Association, the American Heart Association, the National Breast Cancer Coalition, the Children's Defense Fund, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the National Council of Senior Citizens. 
There it is--the doctors, the nurses, representatives of the working families, the associations representing the children, the associations representing women--the National Lung Association, the Paralyzed Victims of America, the American Psychological Association, the Consumers Union. The list goes on and on, all the way to the Multiple Sclerosis Society, the American Academy of Neurology, and the Center for Disabilities, representing the various disability groups. All 170 of them are supporting our effort to bring this legislation to the floor of the Senate to enact it or debate it or even bring the proposal that our Republican friends want and permit us to have debate on it and attempt to amend it. 
Over the course of this debate, there are some who have criticized those of us who have been trying to have this legislation considered on the floor of the U.S. Senate. But it is interesting. They do not have a chart like this. They don't have a chart that lists the organizations that support their proposal because they haven't got any. 
I have stated repeatedly on the floor of the U.S. Senate that we are waiting for one of our colleagues who is supporting the Republican position, or who is part of the Republican leadership, to indicate to us one association that represents doctors, one association that represents nurses, one association that represents consumers, one association that represents any group of health professionals. Just give us one. They can't. There is silence over there. 
We have here the partial listing of virtually every single professional medical association in America, every nursing association, every consumer rights association, virtually every one of those associations. Mr. President, every one of them, as I will show in just a few moments, is advocating that we move ahead with legislation now--not tomorrow, not the next day, but now. Move ahead, start the debate and see us resolve these issues in the period of the next few days. 
But what does the Republican leadership say? No, no. The Republican leadership says they have other things in mind. They want to debate and consider the Vacancies Act. This is what the Republican leadership is telling us--that the Vacancies Act is more important than debating and considering how we are going to treat a child with cancer in our country. 
That is effectively what they are saying. They want us to debate the Vacancies Act. They want us to debate the Internet tax issues. We are going to have a cloture vote tomorrow. We are not going to schedule the consideration of this legislation tomorrow. We are going to have a cloture vote on the Internet tax proposal. And we had, just last week, the consideration of the salting legislation--salting legislation. The Republican leadership said we ought to consider the salting legislation. Then they had other pieces of legislation they brought up--child custody, bankruptcy, affects 1,200,000 people every year. They wanted us to consider that legislation, which we did. There were initially close to 40 amendments on there and still the leadership scheduled it even when Senator Daschle had offered a more limited list of amendments if we considered the Patients' Bill of Rights. And now we are considering the financial services legislation. These are all pieces of legislation that we either had last week or this week or will have the first of next week while we are virtually silent on the consideration of legislation that is in such extraordinary demand across this country. 
Mr. President, just this week a letter arrived from 52 rehabilitation hospitals and other providers of rehabilitation services to people recovering from terrible injuries, strokes, heart disease or coping with disabilities. These facilities deal with some of the most seriously ill people in our society, and here is what they said. Here is what they said:  
We encourage you to continue your fight on this issue. We support S. 1890 because it offers the greatest level of protection for patients with disabilities and chronic conditions. We feel that enactment of S. 1890 should be of the utmost importance to Congress. Enactment of the Patients' Bill of Rights is a priority for patients needing rehabilitation services, but it is not a priority for the Republican leadership. 
This is effectively the total leadership in this country that is reflecting their concern and their support for the Patients' Bill of Rights, saying that we ought to act on it and we ought to act on it now. We are prepared to act on it. We are prepared to deal with this issue as the next order of business. We are prepared to call the roll on whether this legislation provides for the kind of protections that those individuals in our society who have physical and mental disabilities--I call them challenges--should be able to have. We ought to be able to debate that. 
Virtually every organization that represents those individuals says we want this now in this Chamber. But not the Republican leadership. No. No, not the Republican leadership. They say let's debate the Vacancies Act. Virtually every organization that is concerned about cancer in our society says start the debate and start on it now. Not the Republican leadership. No. No, they want to consider the Internet tax bill. 
Every child organization--the American Academy of Pediatricians, every group that represents children in our society says start the debate now, start calling the roll, start the debate on how we are going to protect the children in our society. We can't wait. Too many children are in need today. Not the Republican leadership. They say we want to debate salting. We want to debate salting; we are not going to listen to the various organizations that are out there representing children in our society. We are not going to listen to the organizations that are out there representing the cancer patients in our society. We are not going to listen to the organizations that are out there representing the disabled in our society. We are not going to listen to the organizations that represent the doctors and nurses and consumers in our society. 
No, because, as the Republican leader says, we are in the majority, and we are going to set the schedule. We are in the majority, and we are going to set the schedule. And the schedule they have set is financial services, bankruptcy, child custody, salting, and the Vacancies Act. And the list goes on. 
But not with regard to the Patients' Bill of Rights, Mr. President. Last week, there was a march on Washington by cancer patients and families of cancer patients from all over the country. Cancer is a disease that has touched almost every family in our country. It is perhaps the most dreaded diagnosis that any person can confront. The marchers called for expanded cancer research and assured access to the best possible care for every cancer patient. 
The Patients' Bill of Rights deals with both of those issues. That is why it is supported by virtually every major cancer organization in this country. The Patients' Bill of Rights guarantees access to quality clinical trials. It assures timely access to needed specialists and centers of excellence equipped to treat patients, particularly cancer patients. 
We have more than 14 cancer centers around this country that specialize in different forms of cancer. They have been enormously positive in terms of remedies and new modalities in the treatment of this disease. We have one in my own State of Massachusetts that deals with children's disease and the progress that has been made has been absolutely incredible--absolutely incredible. There should be no debate over a child who has cancer getting the kind of specialized care that that child needs and deserves. 
The progress we have made in the war on cancer over these past years has been greater in children than any other group, and they need specialty care; they need primary care, as all children do. They need preventive care, as all children do. Children are the healthiest group in our society. The totality of children only account for about 6 percent of the health budget in our Nation. They don't drain the health care budget, although more of them are living in poverty than any other group in our society. But we ought to be able to say, if a child is going to be attacked by cancer, we ought to give them a specialist. That is what this bill does, Mr. President. That is what this bill does. The Republican bill doesn't do it. If they think theirs is better, let's have the opportunity to debate it. 
Our legislation also, with regard to treating the particular needs of either children or those who are afflicted with cancer, requires the HMOs to give the patients access to the needed prescription drugs, not just the drugs that happen to be on the plan's list because they are the cheapest. 
I don't know how many of our colleagues remember the testimony that we had the other day from those who were representing many of the mentally ill and who were part of HMOs and what they were told when they needed certain kinds of prescription drugs--that they had to take the prescription drugs that were on the list of the HMO rather than the prescription drugs that was being recommended by the doctor. They had to take that and demonstrate that it wasn't working for them not just once but twice. And then the third time perhaps they would have the opportunity to be able to get the prescription drugs that were needed. 
The tragic circumstances that flowed from those kinds of requirements shouldn't happen here. When the individual was signing up, they could look over and they could see formularies that deal with some of the problems in terms of mental health. They figured that their particular needs, if they were going to require them, were going to be attended to. And then comes the time that they need those various prescription drugs and they say, no, you have to take these here, and you have to show they don't work. Then you come back again and you have to take them again and show that they don't work and have a doctor certify, and then maybe, maybe, we will give you the kinds of drugs that the doctor prescribed in the first place. That is happening today. That is happening today. And we want to remedy that. 
This legislation assures continuity of care so that someone in the middle of a course of a cancer treatment will not be forced to change doctors because their employer changes plans or because their health plan changes the providers in its network. We want to say that if you have a life-threatening situation and you are being treated with chemotherapy or a member of your family is, and then suddenly your employer goes out and changes delivery, we don't want the circumstance when you are at a time of enormous personal stress and tension to be told, Oh, no, you can't go to your doctor anymore. You have to go to another doctor. 
Oh, I know that doctor didn't know your case before. I know the doctor hasn't examined you before. I know the doctor hasn't been a part of this whole process over the last year, year and a half, but you are not able to go ahead and have your old doctor who has been treating you, with whom you have established a relationship, who understands your case, understands those particular needs of yours. No, no. You can just be dropped there. 
We prohibit that. We insist in those circumstances that a patient be able to continue that kind of care until there is some resolution of that particular illness. It is very important, Mr. President, very important, in terms of treatment, in terms of quality, in terms of what we as a society like to believe we have established in terms of a doctor-patient relationship--one of trust, one of intimacy, one of understanding, one of caring, which is so important. 
That has an enormous impact. All of that has an impact on recovery. If you provide the opportunity for a parent to be with a sick child at the time of a critical illness, they can demonstrate that the child's recovery is 30 to 40 times more rapid than it would be without that parent. We can demonstrate that. 
It has a dollar-and-cents saving, obviously; but the important point is that once in a while, at least we feel on this side, we ought to give some attention to the child and the parent and the family, and quality. That is what we are talking about when we insist that that doctor-patient relationship, in terms of special needs, is going to be protected, particularly in the area of cancer, but it is important in any critical illness. 
Access to the quality clinical trials is particularly important. These trials are often the only hope for patients with incurable cancer or other diseases where conventional treatments are ineffective. They are the best hope for curing these dread diseases. 
Insurance used to routinely pay the doctor and hospital costs associated with clinical trials. They used to always do that. But managed care plans are refusing to allow their patients to participate or to pay these costs. Our bill requires them to respond to this need. The Republican bill does not, and the Senate leadership does not want to debate this bill. 
Listen to what Bruce Chabner, who is the clinical director of MGH Cancer Center, a professor of medicine at Harvard University, and the chief medical officer at the Dana Farber Partners Cancer Care, one of the outstanding cancer researchers and cancer personnel in the country, has to say:  
I am here to support the bill that would require HMOs and insurance companies to support clinical research. I would like to explain briefly the role of insurance coverage in research. 
This is important, Mr. President, because we have heard so much about the costs of various proposals. Listen to this: 
Most of the costs in clinical research are associated with the cost of discovery. Laboratory experiments and the development of new treatments are supported by Government grants, by industry and by institutional commitments from hospitals and medical schools. These contributions provide the hundreds of millions of dollars that lead to new treatments and hope to millions of our patients with cancer. However, the clinical treatment of these patients requires support for the routine care associated with these clinical trials. The only source of such support for routine care costs is health care insurance and HMO contribution. This is the final step in proving that a new treatment or a new device actually works in people. Without this step, research is meaningless and has no impact on people, nor does it save lives. We are not asking the insurance companies and HMOs to support the vast effort to discover new treatments. 
Do we understand that, Mr. President? The researchers and the centers of research are not asking the HMOs for additional resources for breakthroughs. What they are basically asking is: 
We are not asking for support for the cost of analyzing data and support during the clinical trials. We are only asking them to continue support for patient care costs. 
Just continue the costs for treating the patients and permit them to go into these trials. That is the only thing they are asking. Isn't that amazing? One would think the HMO would say, `Gee, if our patient gets better, it will be less costly for the HMO.' One would think somebody in the financial system would say that. But, no, they just won't let them and, in too many instances, will not give them the assurance that if a doctor says it is in your best interest that you should be in a clinical trial because you have breast cancer--and the enormous progress we have made in the area of breast cancer is just absolutely extraordinary. Still, one out of every seven women in our society--is afflicted by breast cancer. That number is enhanced every year, tragically, even with the progress we have made. 
We are saying: Look, we have made important progress; we are continuing to make progress; let us have those individuals who can benefit go into these clinical trials at really no extra cost to the HMO. If that patient is going to be able to be cured, then, obviously, there is going to be less cost. The patient obviously is going to be better off. But the costs will be reduced as well. 
Dr. Chabner continues: 
I am sure that every Member of Congress, if faced with the awful dilemma of cancer, would want this kind of continued support for their family member. 
Meaning the clinical trials: 
This research provides the only hope our patients have of conquering this disease and the only hope our society has for curing cancer. 
There it is, Mr. President, with regard to cancer. Our bill insists on it, and no such provision is in their proposal at the current time, even though it is recommended by every part of the medical profession. But it is still not there. 
As Dr. Chabner points out, access to clinical trials is critical if we are to make progress in conquering this dread disease, but it is also critical for patients. Often, particularly in the case of cancer, clinical trials offer the only hope for cure or improvement. Too often, managed care is locking patients out of the clinical trials that offer potential benefit--in effect, passing a death sentence. 
Yesterday, I read extensively from the statement of Diane Bergin, a mother of two and a patient with ovarian cancer, about her struggles to obtain access to clinical trials and the emotional roller coaster she faced in dealing with her plan. I will not repeat her full statement today, but I would like to read the conclusion to her comments, because she speaks for similarly situated patients all over this country. She says: 
No one facing a serious illness should be denied access to care because that treatment is being provided through a clinical trial. Sometimes, it is the only hope we have. 
That is where we stand, Mr. President. That is where we firmly stand, those of us who believe in a Patients' Bill of Rights. We stand for hope for these patients. This is what she says:  
Sometimes, it is the only hope we have. And the benefit to me, whether short or long term, will surely help those women who come after me, seeking a cure, a chance to prolong their life for just a little while, just so they can attend a graduation, or a wedding, or the birth of a grandchild. 
That is what is at issue in this Patients' Bill of Rights, Mr. President. That is what we ought to be debating here. And still, the Republican leadership says, `Oh, no; you have to debate the Vacancies Act, salting, child custody, and the Internet tax; you can't debate this kind of critical issue.' 
We find that completely unacceptable. But Republicans have made the judgment and decision of denying, not just those of us in the U.S. Senate who support it--it isn't denying us, it is denying the representatives of all the medical societies in our country, the doctors, all the nurses, all the representatives of the cancer groups in this country. That is who they are denying, and it is denying the people they represent--their patients. 
Diane continues: 
I strongly support, and my family is right there with me, requiring insurers to pay for the routine costs---- 
Routine costs---- of care that are part of an approved clinical trial.  I think the cures of the future depend on it. 
Diane Bergin is a patient at Georgetown University's Lombardi Cancer Center. Now listen to this, Mr. President. Listen to this. At the same forum where Diane spoke, we also heard from Karen Steckley, a nurse who is the director of clinical operations at the Lombardi Cancer Center, where Diane Bergin is a patient. She has eight full-time master's level nurses on her staff who spend virtually all of their time arguing with managed care companies that do not want to pay for clinical trials, even when that is clearly the best treatment available for a patient. 
Do we understand that, Mr. President? Let me just mention that. Here at the Lombardi Cancer Center, in the shadow of the Capitol, one of the great medical centers in this country, dearly named after one of the great American heroes of our Nation, here is the director saying they employ eight full-time professional nurses to spend their whole time arguing with HMOs to permit these patients to participate in these clinical trials when their doctors have suggested that that offered them the best hope and opportunity for survival. 
Imagine that. We hear from our friend from Texas about bureaucracy and red tape. Imagine having those top-flight nurses out there participating and working with doctors to try to ease the pain and be a part of a team to try to find some breakthroughs in these cancers. That is what is happening. Here is the documentation. And it is not just in the Lombardi Cancer Center, it is in all of these major centers across the country. And we cannot find time to debate whether that is in the interest of the health of our American people, Mr. President, when that is happening today? 
I do not know how many people are being turned back today. I do not know how many women who have breast cancer are being told no by their HMO and are being closed out from participating in those clinical trials at the Lombardi Cancer Center and are virtually taking a death sentence in many of those instances, Mr. President. I read into the Record yesterday what the results are when you do not have that kind of participation, particularly in the early times of diagnosis. But that is what is happening. 
Mr. President, the opponents of this legislation talk a lot about costs associated with our bill. We know that every independent analysis of our legislation has concluded that the cost will be negligible because it simply requires all health plans to provide the services they promise when they collect the premiums. 
That is basically what we are trying to do, Mr. President, to say when you go out and you sell this product--the HMO--make sure you are going to comply with what you represent. That is often not the case. 
I gave the tragic instance just a few days ago about what happened in my own State of Massachusetts when patients with mental illness were guaranteed a certain number of days in-house, and then they were denied them--tragic circumstances where a patient went out and committed suicide. He still had 17 days left, but the HMO would not put him in there. That had a devastating impact on the three children and the wife as a result of that decision by the HMO, and the fact that there is no recovery at all; that family is absolutely devastated, Mr. President. And we have remedies for them as well. 
Mr. President, 14 leading organizations of cancer patients, representing 8 million Americans surviving with cancer, and the 1.5 million Americans who will be newly diagnosed with cancer this year, have spoken out strongly on the need for this amendment. These are organizations that patients and physicians, alike, look to for guidance on cancer issues--the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, Cancer Care, Incorporated, the Candlelighters Childhood Cancer Foundation, the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, the National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations, the North American Brain Tumor Coalition, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the Alliance for Lung Cancer Advocacy, Support and Education, the Friends of Cancer Research, the Leukemia Society of America and the Oncology Nursing Society. That is about it, Mr. President; all of them say, `Pass this, and pass it now, there is nothing more important that we can do'--every one of them. But no, the Republican leadership says, `No. We're deciding--we're deciding what the agenda is going to be.' And that legislation is not part of the agenda. 
Meanwhile, these abuses continue every single day, Mr. President. And here is what those groups in a joint statement said: `Clinical trials represent the standard of care for cancer patients. Patient care in clinical trials is no more expensive than standard therapy.' 
So now, Mr. President, we know what needs to be done. 
I can continue. I see my colleagues here on the floor of the Senate. I will just wind up with what we have said before, Mr. President, that every one of these protections in the Patients' Bill of Rights has either been recommended unanimously by a bipartisan group that was set up by the President of the United States--you had to have virtual unanimity in order to get the recommendation. The vast majority of these protections were recommended by that President's panel--not in the form of legislation, but as protections for consumers. 
The vast majority of these are in effect in Medicare, and they are working to provide protections for our senior citizens. A vast majority of these are recommended by the health plans themselves, the HMOs themselves. They say they ought to have these kinds of inclusions and protections, but they are not written into the law. A large proportion of them are recommended by the insurance commissioners, a bipartisan group, across this country. There is not a single protection on here that does not have the recommendation of one of these groups. This is a commonsense approach to try to ensure that we are going to have quality care for every American, supported by virtually every one of the health care provider groups in our society. 
All we are asking, Mr. President, is that we have the debate. It is no secret about the various provisions that we have included in this. There is no secret here, Mr. President. We all understand it. We all know we can debate these issues and reach a resolution. But let us get about doing the country's business. 
Let's do something in terms of protecting the American family. Let's do something about protecting children to make sure they get the specialty care; for women who have breast cancer, to make sure they are going to be in the clinical trials; to the emergency cases, to make sure they are not going to have the ambulances drive by the nearest hospitals. Let's go out and protect the doctors and the nurses so they can recommend the medical procedures in the best interests of those patients. Let's go out and protect the American people. Let's continue to demand that we are going to have the Patients' Bill of Rights as the piece of legislation that we are going to debate before this Congress adjourns. 
There are just a few remaining days in this Congress, and the Republican leadership continues to block action on a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
It is clear what is going on here. It is clear to every member of the Senate. And it should be clear to the American people. 
The American people want Congress to pass strong, effective legislation to end the abuses by HMOs, managed care plans, and health insurance companies. The Patients' Bill of Rights sponsored by Senator Daschle and Senate Democrats provides the needed and long-overdue antidote to these festering and growing abuses. Our goal is to protect patients and see that insurance plans provide the quality care they promise, but too often fail to deliver. 
Our bill was introduced in March. Earlier legislation was introduced more than a year and half ago--but the Senate has taken no action because the Republican leadership has been using every trick in the procedural playbook to prevent a meaningful debate. 
The Republican leadership is abusing the rules of the Senate, so that health insurance companies can continue to abuse patients. 
The Republican leadership wants to gag the Senate, so that HMOs can continue to gag doctors who tell patients about needed treatments that are expensive for HMO balance sheets. 
The Republican leadership wants to deny a fair debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights, so that HMOs can continue to deny needed patient care. 
The Republican leadership wants to avoid accountability in the United States Senate, so that managed care plans can avoid accountability when their unfair decisions kill or injure patients. 
This record of abuse should be unacceptable to the Senate--and it is certainly unacceptable to the American people. Almost 200 groups of patients, doctors, nurses, and families have announced their support for their bill and are begging the Republican leadership to listen to their voices. They range from the American Medical Association to the AFL-CIO, from the American Heart Association to the American Academy of Pediatrics, from the Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities to the American Cancer Society, from the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill to the National Partnership for Women and Families. 
Just this week, a letter arrived from 52 rehabilitation hospitals and other providers of rehabilitation services to people recovering from terrible injuries, strokes, heart disease, or coping with disabilities. These facilities deal with some of the most seriously ill people in our society--and here is what they said: `We encourage you to continue to your fight on this issue. [We] support S. 1890 because it offers the greatest level of protection for patients with disabilities and chronic conditions. . . . We feel that enactment of S. 1890 should be of the utmost importance to Congress.' Enactment of a Patients' Bill of Rights is a priority for patients needing rehabilitation services--but it is not a priority for the Republican leadership. 
Last week, there was a march on Washington by cancer patients and families of cancer patients from all over this country. Cancer is a disease that has touched almost every family in our country. It is perhaps the most dreaded diagnosis that any person can confront. The marchers called for expanding cancer research and assuring access to the best possible care for every cancer patient. 
The Patients' Bill of Rights deals with both those issues. That is why it is supported by virtually every major anticancer organization in this country. The Patients' Bill of Rights guarantees access to quality clinical trials; it assures timely access to needed specialists and centers of excellence equipped to treat the patients' particular cancer; it requires HMOs to give patients access to needed prescription drugs, not just the drugs that happen to be in the plan's list because they are the cheapest. It assures continuity of care, so that someone in the middle of a course of cancer treatment will not be forced to change doctors because their employer changes plans or because their health plan changes the providers in its network. 
Access to quality clinical trials is particularly important. These trials are often the only hope for patients with incurable cancer or other diseases where conventional treatments are ineffective. They are the best hope for learning to cure these dread diseases. Insurance used to routinely pay the doctor and hospital costs associated with clinical trials--but managed care plans are refusing to allow their patients to participate or to pay these costs. Our bill requires them to respond to this need--but the Republican bill does not, and the Senate leadership does not want a debate on this issue. 
Dr. Bruce Chabner, a distinguished oncologist, commented on the importance of this provision. 
As Dr. Chabner points out, access to clinical trials is critical if we are to make progress in conquering this dread disease. But it is also critical for patients. Often, particularly in the case of cancer, a clinical trial offers the only hope of cure or improvement. But, too often, managed care is locking patients out of clinical trials that offer potential benefit--in effect passing a death sentence. Yesterday, I read extensively from the statement of Diane Bergin, a mother of two and a patient with ovarian cancer, about her struggles to obtain access to clinical trials and the emotional roller coaster she faced in dealing with her health plan. I will not repeat her full statement today, but I would like to read the conclusion to her comments--because she speaks for similarly situated patients all over this country. 
She says, `No one facing a serious illness should be denied access to care because that treatment is being provided through a clinical trial. Sometimes, it is the only hope we have. And the benefit to me, whether short or long term, will surely help those women who come after me, seeking a cure, a chance to prolong their life for just a little while, just so that they can attend a graduation, or a wedding, or the birth of a grandchild. 
`I strongly support, and my family is right there with me, requiring insurers to pay for the routine costs of care that are part of an approved clinical trial. I think the cures of the future depend on it.' 
Diane Bergin is a patient at Georgetown University's Lombardi Cancer Center. At the same forum where Diane spoke, we also heard from Karen Steckley, a nurse who is the director of clinical operations at the Lombardi cancer center, where Diane Bergin is a patient. She has eight full-time masters level nurses on her staff who spend virtually all their time arguing with managed care companies that do not want to pay for clinical trials, even when that is clearly the best treatment available for a patient. Often, they are able to get patients into trials--but sometimes they fail, and patients die or suffer needlessly as a result. 
Mr. President, the opponents of this legislation talk a lot about the costs associated with our bill. We know that every independent analysis of our legislation has concluded that the cost will be negligible, because it simply requires all health plans to provide the services they promise when they collect premiums from their subscribers and that good plans provide as a matter of course. But think of the high cost and waste in the current system--when patients are denied timely care, so that they must be treated when their illnesses have become much worse and much more costly to treat. And think of the criminal waste involved when eight master-level nurse practitioners must spend their time arguing with insurance companies instead of caring for patients. 
Fourteen leading organizations of cancer patients, representing the eight million Americans surviving with cancer and the 1.5 million Americans who will be newly diagnosed with cancer this year, have spoken out strongly on the need for this amendment. These are organizations that patients and physicians alike look to for guidance on cancer issues. They include the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, Cancer Care, Incorporated, the Candlelighters Childhood Cancer Foundation, the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, the National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations, the North American Brain Tumor Coalition, US TOO International, the Y-ME National Breast Cancer Society, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the Alliance for Lung Cancer Advocacy, Support and Education, the Friends of Cancer Research, the Leukemia Society of America, and the Oncology Nursing Society. 
Here is what they say: `Clinical trials represent the standard of care for cancer patients. Patient care in clinical trials is no more expensive than standard therapy. Cancer will strike roughly one in three Americans during their lifetimes. Even those who escape the diagnosis will have friends and family touched by the disease. Any patient rights or quality care legislation will be a shallow promise for people with cancer if it does not include provisions ensuring access to clinical trials.' 
A shallow promise. Our program has it. The Republican plan does not. That is one of the reasons why these organizations and the patients they represent conclude: `Among the various proposals being considered by the Congress to improve access and quality for the patients under managed care, the only one that provides meaningful relief for people with cancer is the one sponsored by Senators Daschle and Kennedy in the Senate and Congressmen Dingell and Ganske in the House, S. 1890 and H.R. 3605. We urge you in the strongest possible terms to support the Patients' Bill of Rights. This legislation . . . is a necessity for people with cancer. Nothing less is acceptable.' 
These organizations also point to another issue that is critical for patients with cancer--access to specialty care. They say, `the primary alternative proposals [to the Patients' Bill of Rights] does not offer significant assurances of access to specialty care that may mean the difference between life and death for a person with cancer.' The difference between life and death for a person with cancer. That is what this debate is about--but the Republican leadership won't even bring legislation to the floor. 
The American public wants action to provide better care for cancer patients. They want to guarantee that any family member with a member afflicted by this dread disease will get the best possible care. But, too often, managed care plans say, `no'. And now, the week after the great cancer march, the Republican leadership continues to say `no' to cancer patients and their families--and yes to protecting insurance company profits. That is just plain wrong. 
We have held a series of forums focussing on the needs of children, families, cancer patients, the disabled, small businesses, women and others. At each one, the message to the Republican leadership is the same. Stop delaying action through procedural maneuvers. Patients and families are suffering. Allow a full and fair debate, so that the Patients' Bill of Rights can pass. Stop putting industry profits ahead of patients. It is because patients and families and doctors and nurses all over this country understand the need to stop insurance company abuse with meaningful reform that almost 200 organizations representing them have endorsed the Patients' Bill of Rights, but not one has endorsed the Republican alternative. And all of these organizations want the Senate leadership to stop hiding behind procedural tricks and abuse of the rules and bring legislation to the floor. 
But Senator Lott continues to say no. Last Wednesday, Senator Lott even circulated a consent agreement that would have allowed unlimited debate and amendments to the Internet tax bill--with one exception. No health amendments. 
It is clear that the Republican leadership will go to almost any lengths to prevent a debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights. Earlier this month, they forced the Senate into a meaningless quorum call for six hours and then forced the Senate to adjourn--not just to block consideration of the Patients' Bill of Rights but to stop Senators from even talking about the issue. We have only two weeks left in this session. We have many bills to consider and act upon. But the Republican leadership would rather close down 
the Senate than allow even a discussion of managed care reform, much less a vote by the Senate. 
The Republican leadership was willing to shut down the entire federal government three years ago in order to slash Medicare and provide tax breaks for the wealthy. Now they're willing to shut down the entire Senate in order to protect the profits of HMOs. 
All we want is a fair and full debate on the Senate floor. But the Republican leadership continues to say, `no,' because they don't want the loopholes in their plan exposed and fixed. 
The fundamental flaws in the Republican bill mean greater profits for insurance companies and lesser care for American patients. Senator Lott does not want the Senate to vote to fix these flaws. He does not want a vote: on whether all Americans should be covered, or just one third of Americans as the Republicans shamefully propose, on whether there should be genuine access to emergency room care, on whether patients should have access to the specialists they need when they are seriously ill, on whether doctors should be free to give the medical advice they deem appropriate, without fear of being fired by their HMO, on whether patients with incurable cancer or Alzheimer's disease or other serious illnesses should have access to quality clinical trials where conventional treatments offer no hope, on whether patients in the middle of a course of treatment can keep their doctor if their health plan drops them from its network, or their employer changes health plans, on whether the special health needs of the disabled, and women, and children should be met, on whether patients should be able to obtain timely independent review of plan decisions that deny care, on whether health plans should be held responsible in court for decisions that kill or injure patients. 
The list of flaws in the Republican bill goes on and on. 
The Republican leadership's record on this issue is painfully clear. Their cynical strategy is to protect the insurance industry at all costs, by blocking any reform at all, or by passing only a minimalist bill so weak that it would be worse than no bill at all. 
This obstruction has been going on for more than a year. HMO reform never appeared on any priority list of the Republican leadership. The Republican Policy Committee issued periodic attacks on any attempt to prevent insurance abuses. No Senate committee was permitted to consider any legislation to protect patients and American families. 
Meanwhile, the momentum for reform across the country continues to grow. This summer, the stonewall strategy finally collapsed in the face of public pressure. So the Republican leadership did the next worse thing. They introduced a bill that had the name of reform--but not the reality. They dug in their heels again, and refused to allow a fair debate by the Senate to change that bill from a sham to genuine reform--from a bill that protects industry profits to a bill that protects patients--from a bill that would be deservedly vetoed by the President to a bill that could be signed into law as a genuine achievement for every family. 
Bill Gradison, the head of the Health Insurance Association of America, was asked in an interview published in the Rocky Mountain News to sum up the strategy of the special interests committed to blocking reform. According to the article, Mr. Gradison replied `There's a lot to be said for `Just say no.' The author of the article goes on to report that `At a strategy session * * * called by a top aide to Senator Don Nickles, Gradison advised Republicans to avoid taking public positions that could draw fire during the election campaign. Opponents will rely on Republican leaders in both chambers to keep managed care legislation bottled up in committee.' 
Instead of participating in a genuine debate on how to assure that all patients have the protections now available only to those fortunate enough to be enrolled in the best plans, insurance companies and their allies in the business community have heeded the call of the Republican leadership. A leadership aide told the industry to `get off their butts and get off their wallets' and block reform. They directed their special interests friends to write the `definitive paper trashing all these bills.' 
The Republican leadership could have called up the Patients' Bill of Rights at any time for a full and fair debate. Instead, they have proposed a series of phony `consent' agreements that would prevent fair debate and make passage of real reform impossible. These stalling tactics are clearly meant to run out the clock, so that managed care reforms cannot be passed before Congress adjourns, and so that the Republican leadership can avoid taking responsibility for its defeat. 
The record of Republican attempts to avoid the blame for inaction would be laughable, if the consequences for patients across the country were not so serious. 
On June 18, Senator Lott proposed to bring up the bill, but on terms that made a mockery of the legislative process. His proposal would have allowed the Senate to start considering HMO reform, but he would have been permitted to end the debate at any time. The proposal also barred the Senate from considering any other health care legislation for the rest of the year. So if Senator Lott did not like the direction the bill was headed, he could kill it and tie the Senate's hands on HMO reform for the remainder of the year. 
On June 23, 43 Democratic Senators wrote to Senator Lott to urge that he allow a debate and votes on the merits of the Patients' Bill of Rights. We requested that the Senate take up this issue before the August recess. 
In response, on June 24, Senator Lott repeated his earlier unacceptable offer. 
On June 25, Senator Daschle proposed an agreement in which Senator Lott would bring up a Republican health care bill by July 6, so that Senator Daschle could offer the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights, and other Senators could offer amendments on HMO reform. We would agree to avoid amendments on any other subject. Only amendments related to the Patients Bill of Rights would be eligible for consideration. Senator Lott rejected this offer as well. 
On June 26, he offered once again an agreement that allowed him to withdraw the legislation at any time, and bar any further consideration of any health care legislation for the remainder of the year. 
On July 15, Senator Lott made yet another offer. This time, he proposed an agreement that permitted only one amendment. He could bring up his bill. We could bring up ours. And that would be it--all or nothing. No votes on key issues. 
On July 29 and on September 1, the Republican leadership offered variations of this proposal, with amendments restricted to three for Democrats and three for Republicans. 
The reason the Republican leadership wants to restrict amendments so drastically is obvious. Senator Lott knows his legislation is deeply flawed, and that it cannot possibly be fixed with just three amendments. He believes that he and his special interest friends can hold most of the Republican Senators for a few votes, but he fears that they will not be willing to stand before the American people on the Senate floor and cast vote after vote for the special interests and against the interests of American families. 
Our Patients' Bill of Rights was introduced in March--and a predecessor bill was introduced by Congressman Dingell and myself more than eighteen months ago, at the beginning of this Congress. 
Senator Daschle, in an effort to be responsive to the Republican Leader's ultimatum that an agreement on the terms of the debate must be reached before the debate can begin, has offered reasonable proposal after reasonable proposal--and every one was rejected. 
Yet the Republican leader has allowed the Senate to debate many other bills this year, with ample time and ample opportunity for amendments. 
We had 7 days of debate on the budget resolution, and considered 105 amendments. Two of those were offered by Senator Nickles. 
We had 6 days of debate on the defense authorization bill, and considered 150 amendments. Two of those were offered by Senator Lott and he cosponsored 10 others. We 8 days of debate on IRS reform and considered 13 amendments. 
We had 17 days of debate on tobacco legislation--a bill we never completed--and considered 18 amendments. 
We had 5 days of debate on the agriculture appropriations bill and 55 amendments. 
We had nineteen days of debate on the highway bill, with 100 amendments. 
The Republican leadership has allowed five days of debate and 24 amendments to the bankruptcy bill. 
They have allowed 36 amendments and two days of debate on the FAA bill passed last Friday. 
All these bills were important, and all deserved reasonable debate and opportunities for amendments. They were brought up without any undue restrictions on debate. That is the normal way of doing business on important pieces of legislation in the Senate. 
The Republican leadership was willing to have an adequate opportunity to debate and vote on these other important measures. But when the issue is protecting American families instead of insurance industry profits, different ground rules apply to protect the industry and deny the rights of patients. 
Senator Daschle has offered yet another reasonable approach to resolve the impasse that Senator Lott has created by his efforts to prevent meaningful reform. He offered to agree to let the Senate debate other bills during the day, and use evenings to debate the Patients' Bill of Rights. The American people expect us to work for them--and if that means a few late nights, so be it. Senator Lott continues to say my way--or no way. And his way is not the way that serves the interests of the American people. The American people deserve a Senate that works as hard as they do. They deserve managed care reform. 
Last Friday, we recessed at 1:00 pm. Most of the time the Senate was in session was spent in morning business rather than doing legislative work. Monday, we did not come in until noon and we did not do legislative business until 3:30. Throughout this year, we have effectively worked less than a four day week. There is no excuse for our not doing the people's business--and one of the highest priorities for American families is a Patients' Bill of Rights. There is no excuse for not acting this year. 
If the Majority Leader will stop abusing the rules of the Senate and allow this debate to proceed, I believe that the Senate will pass strong reforms that will be signed into law by the President. The American people deserve real reform, and I believe that when the Senate votes in the clear light of day, it will give the American people the reforms they deserve. This issue is a test of the Senate's willingness to put a higher priority on the needs of families than on the profits of special interests. And it is time for the Senate to act. 
The choice is clear. The Senate should stand with patients, families, and physicians, not with the well-heeled special interests that put profits ahead of patients. 
The American people know what's going on. Movie audiences across the country erupt in cheers when actress Helen Hunt attacks the abuses of managed care in the film `As Good As It Gets.' Helen Hunt won an Oscar for that performance, but managed care isn't winning any Oscars from the American people. Everyone knows that managed care today is not `as good as it gets.' 
Too often, managed care is mis-managed care. No amount of distortions or smokescreens by insurance companies can change the facts. The Patients' Bill of Rights can stop these abuses. Let's pass it now, before more patients have to suffer.  
Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut, 4 minutes to the Senator from Rhode Island, and I will yield myself, now, 4 minutes. 
Mr. President, I want first of all to express my appreciation to my friend and colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, for his leadership in this area. It follows a long tradition of Vermont Senators being committed to education policy. Senator Stafford, a long-time friend, was strongly committed to education. At a time when there are differences that are all too obvious between the two political parties, Senator Jeffords constancy and commitment in the area of higher education, I think, have been very, very impressive. All of us have enjoyed the opportunity to work with him. 
I commend my friend and colleague, Senator Dodd, who has been extremely active and involved in the workings of the higher education legislation, both in the committee and the conference, and has been a key player in his involvement and commitment in higher education. 
I see, as well, my friend Senator Reed, who has a particular interest in teacher training programs and has a long tradition, with Senator Pell of Rhode Island, and also in the House, of commitment to higher education. We have a number of others who I will describe in greater detail as time permits, but I am particularly appreciative of my colleagues' strong support. 
The Education Act of 1998 is a strong and bipartisan bill that deserves the support of all Members. It renews our commitment to make higher education more affordable and more accessible to qualified students. The House and Senate passed the original versions of the bill almost unanimously, and the conference report preserves most of the best features of both bills. It enhances benefits for students, particularly for students who want to be teachers. It increases the maximum authorization for the Pell grants for the neediest students and expands the formula for calculating their financial need in order to protect a larger amount of income for working parents and students with greater opportunity for eligibility for those Pell grants. 
The bill also reduces the cost of Pell grants by almost 1 percentage point. This reduction can make a significant difference for students who may face a mountain of debt when they graduate. This change will result in savings of $700 on the average debt of $13,000, and savings of over $1,000 on a debt of $20,000, which is enormously important to make these loans--and college--accessible for the sons and daughters of working families. 
I am disappointed, however, we could not extend this benefit to all recent graduates. Under the bill, the rates for consolidation loans will be permanently lowered in both programs from their previous statutory rates. The bill does create a short time window for recent graduates to consolidate their existing loans under the Direct Lending Program at the same low rates applicable for new loans. This opportunity will be available for another 4 months in addition to the 3-month window already in effect, so the students will have a total of 7 months to consolidate their loans. Many of us would have liked to have had a longer period of time, but budgetary restraints constricted us. I think it is going to be enormously important that students and their parents look into the consolidations that can save them a great deal of money. 
One of the key features of the bill is improving the training of teachers. The legislation supports local partnerships that include elementary-secondary schools and colleges and provides competitive grants to States. This assistance is urgently needed to strengthen teacher training. If we are to find an area of greatest need, probably in our whole education system, it is putting a well-qualified teacher in every classroom in this country. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Connecticut.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Higher Education Act of 1998 is a strong, bipartisan bill that deserves the support of all Members of the Senate. It renews our commitment to make higher education more affordable and more accessible for all qualified students.

The bill does create a short window for recent graduates to consolidate their existing loans under the Direct Lending program at the same low rates applicable for new loans. This opportunity will be available for another 4 months, in addition to the 3 month-window already in effect, so students will have a total of 7 months to consolidate their loans. 
One of the key features of the bill is improving the training of teachers. The legislation supports local partnerships that include elementary and secondary schools and colleges, and it also provides competitive grants to states. This assistance is urgently needed to strengthen teacher training. The bill also provides assistance for recruitment of new teachers, a critical need for many school districts. In addition, it provides loan forgiveness on student loans of up to $5,000 for those who teach for five years in high-need schools. I hope that we can build on this incentive in future years, as an important way to encourage more students to become teachers. 
The bill also includes an early intervention initiative to encourage more middle-school students to understand that college is not out of reach. It incorporates ideas from the Administration and from Senator Jeffords in a new program, `Gear Up.' We need to reach out to middle-school children to help them understand that a college education is attainable and affordable. 
The bill also continues the program of Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need, as a critical investment in graduate education. I am particularly pleased that the conference report preserves the portable Javits Fellowships for talented students in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. 
The bill contains a new program based on initiatives sponsored by Congresswoman Meek in the House and by myself in the Senate to encourage a higher quality of college teaching for students with disabilities. In recent years, it has become possible for many more students with disabilities to achieve the dream of a college education, and we need to do more to ensure that faculty members have the experience to teach them. This bill reaches out to all colleges and universities, and can include training for graduate teaching assistants--the faculty of the future. 
The bill also expands federal aid for learning through distance education. Distance learning can open the doors of higher education to many students who cannot attend classes on college campuses because they live in remote areas, or because of their job and family responsibilities. The Department of Education will monitor the institutions participating in the distance program, and report to Congress on the results. Our goal is to ensure that distance education is of the same high quality as traditional education. 
The bill also helps improve the delivery of federal financial aid, by creating a Performance Based Organization in the Department of Education. Its goal is to streamline and improve the financial aid functions of the Department, and give it more flexibility to deal with many aspects of federal aid. A principal goal of the PBO is to improve services for students, and the bill creates a new position called the Student Loan Ombudsman, which student groups have urged. 
The bill also encourages improvements by guaranty agencies, by enabling them to enter into voluntary, flexible agreements with the Secretary of Education. Under these agreements, the agencies can do more to prevent defaults, instead of collecting from students after they have defaulted on loans. These voluntary flexible agreements will encourage the agencies to be more business-like and responsive to students. 
This bill sets the stage for future reforms in student loans. The controversy about what level to set interest rates on these loans makes clear that Congress should stop setting the rates for banks. The best solution is to accept a market-based system for student loans, and let competition set the rates for lenders. 
Many Members on both sides of the aisle and in both Houses are interested in this fundamental change, and I am pleased that the bill calls for a study of competitive mechanisms for the loans. This study will help Congress make thoughtful changes in a system that is now far too costly and inefficient. 
I am disappointed that the conference report does not contain the amendment to the welfare reform act proposed by Senator Wellstone and passed by the Senate. Senator Wellstone's amendment would help welfare recipients attend college for two years. We have heard from many students who have been forced to abandon their pursuit of college education because of the harsh provisions of the welfare reform law. Senator Wellstone's amendment is well-designed to reduce this serious problem, and it deserves to be enacted. 
Overall, the numerous positive changes in this legislation will strengthen higher education. I commend the constructive bipartisan spirit that has brought us to this point. It is fitting to enact this legislation at the beginning of the academic year, and I look forward to its adoption and its successful implementation. 
Mr. President, on the teacher training provisions of this Act, which our friend and colleague, Senator Reed, is so very interested in, one of the new features is a loan forgiveness program--$5,000 for a teacher who teaches for 5 years. This is a very modest forgiveness, but it really builds on the old National Health Service Corps which provided loan forgiveness for doctors to go into underserved areas. The forgiveness program was an important incentive and was really very, very important and has been effective. We hope this program will be as well. 
Also, I want to mention the new program that builds on some initiatives of Senator Jeffords and the TRIO Program, which targets middle school classes to move the whole class toward continuing education. This has worked in different parts of the country. Now we have a program to encourage other schools to do that. 
If any one of us goes to any school in this country, in an elementary and secondary class, and asks children, even in the most underserved part of our Nation, how many want to go to college, before you even get the words out of your mouth, every hand goes up. They get discouraged in later years. If they know they have the opportunity to continue their education if they apply themselves to their studies, it can have a dramatic impact in reducing dropouts and also antisocial behavior. This is a modest program, but it is very important. 
I want to also mention, Mr. President, that this bill sets the stage for future reforms in student loans. The controversy over what level to set interest rates on these loans makes clear that Congress should stop setting the rates for banks. The best solution is to accept a market-based system for student loans and let competition set the rate for the lenders. We believe in competition. This is a good area in which to try it. We have many examples in different public policy areas of where auctions work. There is an excellent initiative in the House of Representatives by Republican Congressman Petri to try an auction-based system. I am very hopeful we can find a bipartisan effort in this area to find the savings and return them to the students. It makes sense. That is a way we should proceed. We have a study of that program in this conference report. 
Finally, I agree with my other colleagues. I am disappointed the conference did not accept what I think is the superb amendment of Senator Wellstone, which was adopted in this body, about continuing education and how this dovetails with the welfare reform program. Senator Wellstone will be over here to speak to that issue later on. I regret he was not successful, and I will certainly support his efforts later on to try to implement that program.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend my colleagues on the Labor Committee for their skillful work on this bill. Senator Jeffords worked hard to accommodate all the concerns of all the members of the Committee, and kept the interests of students firmly in mind. Senator Coats and Senator Dodd likewise contributed to the bipartisan spirit. 
I also thank the following: 
On Senator Jefford's staff, Susan Hattan, Jenny Smulson, Scott Giles, Cory Heyman, and Pam Moran. 
From Senator Coats' staff, Townsend Lange. 
From Senator Dodd's staff, Suzanne Day and Megan Murray. 
From my own office, Marianna Pierce, Jane Oates, and former fellows Gloria Corral, Jennifer Kron, Maria McGarrity, and Eileen O'Leary. 
I also thank Debb Kalcevik from CBO; Margot Schenet, Jim Stedman, and Barbara Miles from CRS; and Mark Sigurski from the office of legislative counsel. 
They have all done an excellent job, and deserve a large share of the credit for this achievement. 
Mr. President, I want to single out, in particular, Marianna Pierce who is my chief of staff in the area of education. The members of the staff performed absolutely superbly and have played an indispensable role in helping all of us reach this point. I am enormously grateful to her and the other staff.  
Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. I want to address the Senate this afternoon because of my continued concern that we are not addressing one of the most important areas of concern for American families, and that is the legislation which is known as the Patients' Bill of Rights. I and a number of our colleagues have cosponsored Senator Daschle's legislation. I had hoped that we could debate and reach conclusion on this legislation. I believe the overwhelming majority of our colleagues on this side of the aisle are in support of this legislation and, if we had an opportunity to debate this issue, I think we would have support as well from Members on the other side. 
Basically, it is a fundamental issue that I think all Americans can understand. This issue centers around whether doctors are going to make decisions with regard to the treatment of patients in our country, or whether we are going to have those decisions made by accountants--whose primary interest is enhancing the profits of the HMOs rather than the health of its patients. That is really at the heart of the Patients' Bill of Rights. There are other important protections, but that is at the heart of it. 
This issue affects about 160 million American policy holders. Our legislation is supported by more than 180 leading health care organizations--virtually all of the major doctors' organizations, nursing organizations, and consumer organizations. 
I have read the comments of some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. They distort the provisions of this legislation and talk about it as legislation which is unnecessary and legislation that will complicate the current practice of medicine. But, listen to the doctors. They say it will simplify the practice of medicine. 
It does seem to me valuable to consider what the doctors say about this, what the nurses say about this, and what the overwhelming, virtually unanimous sense of the health professionals is about it, and they say that they strongly support our legislation. They are opposed to the Republican legislation. But all of them are asking when will the Republican leadership yield and permit us--permit us meaning the Senate--to take up this legislation and debate it and reach a resolution on these various issues. That is the matter I am addressing here this afternoon. 
Over the period of the last 2 weeks in the Senate we have had votes on the salting legislation. I bet if we asked the Americans who are listening or watching this afternoon what the salting legislation is really all about and where it fits on their list of priorities, many of them would not know what it is all about. It is basically a technique which is used--and used effectively and legitimately according to the Supreme Court with its unanimous vote--to permit the organization of workers in sites across this country. But some of our Republican friends desired to repeal that legislation. So we had votes on that. 
We have had votes on the bankruptcy legislation which affects about 1,200,000 of our fellow citizens. We have had votes on the so-called Child Custody Protection Act. We have now been debating in the last day or two the Vacancies Act. We are also considering the Internet tax provision. The majority leader has talked about financial services legislation. And then we are going to come into a situation, perhaps next week, where we are going to have the opportunity to address the tax cut proposal of our Republican friends in the House of Representatives. They want to use tax revenues which have been paid into the Treasury, which are Social Security revenues, to provide tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals in our country. 
But we understand the surplus this year and in future years is the result of funds that have been paid in by workers to fund Social Security benefits. When you exclude these Social Security benefits, you see that we really do not have a surplus. What we have is money raised by working families to pay for Social Security. Our Republican friends want to take some $80 billion of that and use it for tax breaks that would primarily benefit the wealthiest individuals in our society. 
I see one provision in their plan will decrease the estate tax for millionaires. Let me tell every taxpayer who might be watching that you will have an interest in this provision only if you intend to leave more than $600,000 to one of your children. This Republican-sponsored provision will permit you to leave $1 million. It affects only 2 percent of the taxpayers, but it will cost some $18 billion--$18 billion out of funds that are paid in by workers to pay for Social Security. The majority plans to take that money out and use the $18 billion to offset the revenue losses that will result if the Republicans pass their particular proposal to expand the estate tax. We will have a chance to debate that issue. 
But, Mr. President, where in this agenda is the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights, something that is of fundamental concern to virtually every working family? Are we trying to suggest that the salting legislation or the Vacancies Act or even the Internet tax issue is of nearly the consequence or importance of the Patients' Bill of Rights? Not so. But still the majority leader refuses to permit us to debate and discuss it in the Senate. 
The Republican leadership didn't permit it last Friday when most Americans were out working and the Senate effectively closed down at about 11 o'clock. There were Members who spoke after 11 o clock, including myself, and we pointed out that we could have been debating HMO reform on Friday afternoon. We could have been debating it on Monday--when most of the afternoon was taken up in quorum calls before the vote in the late afternoon--or even debated it on Monday evening. 
Mr. President, I am not going to take the time to review with the Senate the amount of hours we have spent in quorum calls over the period of the last 2 weeks. We could have debated this, taken votes on these measures, and resolved these matters in a way that I think would have yielded some very important and basic protections for families. 
I think we would have resolved this in favor of protecting children in our country. I think we would have carried overwhelmingly in the Senate the provisions that would have permitted families with a sick child to bring that child to the nearest emergency room. I think we would have won that in the Senate. I can understand why our Republican friends do not want to vote on that issue, and show the American people where they stand. I hope that at least a majority of them would have supported our provision, if they were given the opportunity. 
I think they would have supported our provision to guarantee specialty care for children who have dread diseases like cancer. I think they would have supported ensuring that a child with cancer should have access to an oncologist who is trained to work with children and with the cancer of the particular child. I think we would have done that, just as I think we would have provided additional specialty care protections for adults who have certain medical needs, whether it is physical or mental disabilities or challenges or chronic conditions like arthritis or diabetes. I think we would have won those. 
I think we would have been successful in debating and reaching a successful conclusion in ensuring access to clinical trials for women who have breast cancer and other patients with life-threatening diseases. With all the possibilities that are out there for breakthrough therapies, why are we continuing to deny women the opportunity to go into clinical trials? We guarantee that in our Patients' Bill of Rights. The other side does not. Why aren't we debating whether we are going to increase access to clinical trials for women or children who have cancer, or patients with other diseases that do not respond to conventional therapies? I think we should be able to debate that issue. 
I think we ought to be able to debate the issues around having access to the kind of prescription drugs that are recommended by doctors, instead of being limited to the medications preferred by the plan. We have had heard testimony from the mental health community that indicates that many of the individuals who need certain kinds of prescription drugs are required to take older, less effective drugs that are on the HMO's list. Before the plan will even consider giving them access to the drugs that the doctor knows is best, the accountant in that HMO says, No, you can't use that one until you have shown that the previous two failed to work. Mr. President, these patients are only given access to the drugs that the doctor knows are best after they have shown that the plan s drugs failed to work at least two times. I think we could have debated that. And I think we could have been successful in that debate as well. 
And the list goes on, Mr. President, 
including whether patients should have the right to a timely and independent review, if an HMO denies care. I think we could have won that particular measure, too. 
We also should address whether we are going to say that HMOs should be held accountable if their actions, as a result of negligence, result in the loss of life or grievous bodily injury. 
Who else is going to be the breadwinner for a family if an insurance company's negligent actions result in the loss of life of that individual? Why is the Republican leadership allowing the insurance industry to remain the only particular protected industry in the United States of America? If these companies are going to take certain action that is going to result in the death or serious disability to an individual, why should they be free from accountability? They should not be. We ought to be able to debate that in the U.S. Senate. 
These are just some of the points that are in the Daschle legislation which we wanted to debate. But, no. Instead, we are debating salting legislation, we are debating the Vacancies Act, the Internet tax, and we will soon be debating financial services legislation, but not the issues that affect the quality of life of our children, our parents, our loved ones, our families. Why? Because the Republican leadership refuses to do it. Why? Because evidently they think we may have the votes to pass it. 
We are still asked, is there enough time to pass this? Absolutely. Evidently our Republican leaders think there must be, too, because they continue to refuse to let us have the chance to debate this. 
Senator Daschle has requested time and time again the opportunity to debate these issues. `No way,' says the Republican leadership. `No way.' They even closed the Senate down a little over a week ago when they refused to let Members speak on the floor of the U.S. Senate. `No,' the Republican leader said, `We set the calendar, we set the schedule, and you are not even going to have the time-honored process that is guaranteed under the rules of the Senate of being able to amend a piece of legislation, because if you are not going to behave yourselves'--in other words, `if you are not going to accept our gagging you,' as so many of the HMOs are doing in terms of gagging doctors from making recommendations about what is the appropriate kind of health treatment for the illness and sickness of the patients they are dealing with--`we are not going to even debate that bill. We are going to pull the bill. We are going to take it off the floor, and we are going to put it back on the calendar,' as he has done. 
That is what is happening in the U.S. Senate these days. We were fortunate to have just had an opportunity to debate raising the minimum wage. We said that working men and women in this country, who work 40 hours a week and 52 weeks a year, ought to have a livable wage. We were not successful on the issue. We lost on that, but we had the opportunity to debate and go on record with our positions. What we are saying now is: Let us have a debate; let us have the debate on the questions of health care quality. This is something which is of enormous importance. 
Mr. President, as I mentioned, this isn't just something a number of us have been in strong support of. I want to mention an editorial in Sunday's Washington Post that cut through the Republican leadership's smokescreen of evasion and distortion on managed care. The editorial was entitled `Double Loss on Managed Care.' The author says:  
Mr. Clinton . . . took the lead months ago in proposing that Congress pass a `Patients' Bill of Rights' to limit how far managed care companies and other insurers can go in denying care in order to cut costs. Democrats in both Houses built on his proposals. The initial reaction of House Republican leaders was to say no bill was necessary. By July, that had ceased to be a comfortable position and, to give their members more cover, they allowed a mostly token bill to pass. 
In the Senate, the leadership also produced a token bill but refused to bring it to the floor unless the Democrats agreed to limit themselves to a handful of amendments, which the Democrats said would make a shell of the proceedings. To thwart the Democrats when they have tried to bring up their own bill, the Republicans have all but shut the Senate down. 
There it is, Mr. President. That isn't Senator Daschle saying that or myself saying that or any number of my colleagues--Senator Boxer, Senator Murray, Senator Durbin. You can call the roll on so many of our colleagues. That isn't any individual Member saying that. Here it is in a Washington Post editorial, which has captured in two paragraphs exactly what we have been saying day after day after day, week after week after week, month after month after month. They understand it, Mr. President, and the American people understand. 
The editorial goes on to say that it disagrees with some provisions of the Democratic bill but, in its words: 
That could be dealt with in the normal legislative process, if only the Republicans would allow the process to occur. For a combination of political and doctrinal reasons, they won't, anymore than earlier in the year, they allowed tobacco or campaign reform legislation to pass. They ought to be made to answer for their record, but so far they have not. 
There it is, Mr. President, clear as can be for all to see, and the American people are increasingly aware of the current situation. That editorial captures it. It is clear what is going on here. It is clear to the Washington Post. It is clear to every Member of the Senate. It should be clear to the American people. 
The American people want Congress to pass strong, effective legislation to end the abuses by HMOs, managed care plans and health insurance companies. The Patients' Bill of Rights, sponsored by Senator Daschle and other Senate Democrats, provides the needed and long overdue antidote to these festering and growing abuses. Our goal is to protect patients and see that insurance plans provide the quality care they promise in brochures but too often fail to deliver. 
Our bill has been on the Senate calendar since March. Earlier legislation was introduced more than a year and a half ago, but the Senate has taken no action because the Republican leadership has been compounding the HMO abuses by abusing the rules of the Senate to block meaningful reform. 
This record of abuse should be unacceptable to the Senate, and, certainly, unacceptable to the American people. One of the most indefensible gaps in the Republican plan is its failure to cover public employees. The GOP plan offers no protection for the 23 million people who serve the public by working for State and local governments. The Republican leadership is saying `No' to the police officers and the firefighters who put their lives on the line every day to safeguard the public; `No' to the schoolteachers who educate our children; no to nurses; `No' to social workers, doctors, and others who spend their days caring for people in public health agencies and State and county hospitals; and `No' to countless other professionals who serve the public through State and local governments.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at other forums we heard about the need for access to specialty care--one of the most important ways in which managed care plans shortchange patients. This is a right guaranteed in our Patients' Bill of Rights but not in our Republican plan. 
Dr. Mirtha Casimir, a distinguished oncologist from Houston, Texas, outlined the tragedy she sees every single day because HMOs unduly restrict access to specialists. This is what Dr. Casimir's statement was: 
Cancer patients today are facing a painful irony. At a time of unprecedented progress in the understanding of the genetic and cellular origins of cancer, as well as parallel advances in drug development and design, the insurance industry is exposing new cost containment. 
Many medical oncologists are concerned about timely access to cancer care and how the significant delays and referrals are impacting early diagnosis and the outcome of therapies in the first and subsequent courses of treatment. Not uncommonly, I now see in my practice delays of 2 to 4 months in a diagnosis of a new primary cancer or the detection of a recurrence. 
And what the doctor continues to point out is that when she finally sees these cases, it is often too late. For example, she sees women in her practice who have started out with a very, very small tumor in their breast, and then they have been delayed access to a specialist and denied various kinds of treatment. Their appeals go on and on through the HMOs, and finally, when they get to a skilled oncologist, after weeks and months, often it is too late--often it is too late. The tumor has spread too far. 
And Dr. Casimir said that more often than not when she flips to the front part of the chart, she will see that the patient is covered by an HMO. She will see that the initial request was denied for the kind of treatment that she could provide. And more often than not, she believes, as a skilled physician, that she could have saved the life of that individual if they had been able to get the prompt kind of a treatment and care. She wraps up in her statement by saying: 
Poor quality of care is always more expensive, both in human terms as well as in the resources expended to try to right the wrong. If the Patients' Bill of Rights is not passed, patients will continue to experience the hostility of this turbulent health care environment in which care is constrained, physicians are controlled, needs of cancer patients are not addressed, and critically important quality of life interventions are viewed as dispensable. 
That is the statement from one of the top oncologists in the country, and the rest of the testimony spells out additional reasons in support of those points. 
On September 15, we heard from the past president of the American Academy of Neurology, Dr. Ken Viste from Wisconsin: 
This country needs fair and compassionate legislation establishing the national standard for all health plans in order to help not harm people with chronic conditions or disabilities. 
The American Academy of Neurology said: 
The House Republican leadership's bill, which passed the House, fails to protect the rights and address the needs of patients. 
There it is, Mr. President, from the American Academy of Neurology. Dr. Viste continued: 
It is critical for people who need a medical specialist's care to be able to seek the treatment from them directly, immediately, and without penalty. The Daschle-Kennedy bill answers this need by assuring that people with complex, chronic conditions have direct access to specialists within a health plan. And, if no specialist exists in the plan, consumers have a right at no cost to seek a specialist outside of the plan. We believe any adequate patient protection legislation must include these provisions. 
Willis Lester, one of the speakers at the rally, explained when his employer switched to a managed care plan, his new primary care doctor took him off his blood pressure and cholesterol medications. Consequently, Lester suffered a stroke. According to Dr. Nancy Futrell . . . the stroke is a direct result of high blood pressure and high cholesterol, which would have been controlled by his medications. 
Dr. Futrell added that Lester's plan has limited his physical therapy, `essentially impairing his recovery.' 
Explains Dr. Viste: 
With the rise of managed care, we've seen many patients with chronic conditions denied access to quality, specialized medical care that they need. As a result, some of these patients suffer long-term effects and end up on disability, driving up costs to employers. Patients need a law with `teeth' that guarantees they will be able to see a specialist, appeal to obtain a medically necessary drug when denied such under a prescription plan, and appeal denial of care to an independent decison-making body. 
Not only will the patient benefit, but in the end, the employers, as well. 
The Epilepsy Foundation, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, United Cerebral Palsy, the American Parkinson's Disease Foundation, the Brain Injury Association, the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities joined the [American Academy of Neurology] leaders and members . . . in advocating the passage of S. 1890. 
The Epilepsy Foundation, National Multiple Sclerosis Society, United Cerebral Palsy, Parkinson's Disease Foundation, Brain Injury Association--every one of these groups say that our legislation provides the protections which are necessary for our families, and the GOP bill does not. 
We don't even have an opportunity to debate or discuss this. The majority refuses to debate. We are still waiting to hear the name of that first major medical society that supports the Republican proposal. We are still waiting. They haven't been able to come up with one, not one. Virtually every major health care group supports our program. They all do. 
We will make adjustments and changes in any legislation to try and move the legislation forward, but we are not going to compromise on vital protections. Every major medical professional group supports ours. None, not one, support theirs. 
The list goes on. This is from a statement of Jeanne Carpenter, the president of the Epilepsy Foundation, in support of the Patients Bill of Rights:  
The Epilepsy Foundation historically has been a strong advocate for patients rights. We support affordable and quality health care for all Americans. And that begins with giving consumers the choice of health plans, a feature we are pleased to see included in the proposed legislation. 
We especially support several key provisions [in the legislation]--access to specialists and provider choice, detailed patient information, independent internal and external review of service denials, and coverage for nonformulary prescriptions where medically necessary. 
Many patients and families tell us they are deeply frustrated being denied referrals to specialists and the full range of treatment options that specialized treatment centers can provide. Not only is patient quality of life adversely affected, but denial of services is a false economy. It produces added cost for unnecessary emergency room and dental services, lost productivity and other seizure-related expenses. 
Seizure control for many epilepsy patients is a complex matter with important subtleties not always recognized in the primary care setting. Families whose children continue to have seizures need and deserve the opportunity to have their cases reviewed by third parties with full knowledge of the disorder and rapid progress is now being made in its treatment. 
Patients' rights legislation is long overdue. Each day of delay, there are children whose chances in life are being jeopardized because of ongoing seizures. We strongly urge passage of these protections during the current session of Congress and at the earliest possible moment. 
Do we hear that? Every day of delayed debate and inaction we are putting at risk children whose lives are being jeopardized because of ongoing seizures. How many are being jeopardized if we don't complete the Vacancies Act? Or the salting act or the Internet tax or the financial services legislation? How many? Here, Mr. President, are the real issues. This is what is really important in our remaining time this year. 
It is very clear why all of these organizations support this proposal. We have built into it not only the guarantee of specialty care, but real internal and external appeals. 
I will make a brief comment about the appeal procedures under the Republican proposal. Under their plan, the decision to allow a patient to proceed to a so-called independent appeal will be made by the HMO itself, in consultation with their lawyers. Talk about having the fox guard the hen house, this is putting the fox in there. Do you know what will happen under the Republican House plan? Even if the patient wins on the appeal, the plan doesn't have to accept it. If they choose, they don't have to follow it. So they can show a brochure to anybody buying insurance, look you have an appeal. But they probably don't explain that it is decided by the plan and that the plan doesn t have to follow the ruling if it benefits the patient. 
Our Republican friends say yes, we have an appeal provision. They say yes, we have it in our proposal. But this is the appeal they have. It doesn't work in quite the same way as ours. 
I see two of my good friends and colleagues here, so I will wind up. It is important to understand that this issue is not going to go away. 
As I have mentioned many times, the provisions listed on this chart and included in our legislation have either been recommended by the President's bipartisan commission--which required unanimous support by its members-- 
or were put in Medicare by the Congress or have been endorsed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners or recommended by the American Association of Health Plans, which represents HMOs across the country. 
And, while the President's Commission did not specifically draft legislation, they did not rule out legislation either. They simply said that all Americans should have these protections. Most of our bill reflects the Commission's recommendations. Many of these provisions currently protect our seniors in Medicare. There is a lot of overlap here. The HMO trade group and the State insurance commissioners--again, Republicans and Democrats alike--have said these are important protections. Virtually all of our proposals have been recommended or adopted by other health care programs or experts. Talk about a modest proposal. 
This is really a reflection of the best of those who understand this issue and have studied it for some period of time--probably for 8 to 10 years. 
That is what this is all about. It is sensible. It is responsible. It is common sense. It is common sense to take a sick child to the nearest emergency room and not across town. It is common sense to get a specialist to take care of a particular kind of need. That makes sense. It is common sense to give the best medical prescription drug to somebody who is ill. It is common sense, with the breakthrough technologies and unprecedented progress that we are making in medicine, to allow people who can benefit from clinical trials to be able to participate in those clinical trials. It doesn't cost the HMOs very much more because they are going to have to pay for the basic routine care in any event, and that care will continue. The clinical trial pays for the additional treatment. So the cost isn't that great. But too many patients don't have this right, and those who think they do are increasingly denied it. 
The list goes on. These are common sense proposals, Mr. President. It is common sense to hold people accountable for their actions. When you hold them accountable, you get better performance. The best testimony on the issues of appeals and accountability that we heard was when Senator Specter had his excellent hearing. We learned that court cases rarely occur, even when patients can hold their plans accountable. The 23 million employees of state and local governments can take their plans to court, as can the 15 million patients with individual health insurance. We know how that works. It is rarely used. Why? Because it is there. In most cases, the internal and external appeals resolve it before it needs to go to court. In the end, with few exceptions, it doesn't involve a court case. But what is clear--and the testimony is overwhelming because it is there--is that you get better quality. These plans can be held accountable for their actions, but we see that there is not as great a need when that right exists for patients. 
That is what we are interested in. We are interested in the best quality. We believe the American people should be entitled to it. 
These are some of the stories that we have heard in recent times. We can go right down the list of protections in our bill and in every one of these areas on this chart, you can find compelling stories. We just ask to debate and vote on these issues. 
All we ask is that we cut back on some of the quorum calls that we have had here lately. All we ask is that we follow Senator Daschle's suggestion that we may debate these in the course of the evenings, at the end of this week and part of next week, and have some resolution of these issues. All we ask is that we give the American people at least an understanding that this institution is addressing something that is fundamentally important to their lives and the lives of their loved ones. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I supported Senator Wellstone's amendment to the Higher Education Act and I regret that it was not included in the conference report. The amendment would have increased educational opportunities for people on welfare. It passed the Senate with a bipartisan majority, but was rejected by House Republicans, even though it was also supported by the White House, and by more than 150 social welfare groups. 
The goal of this amendment is to correct a serious deficiency in the harsh welfare reform law enacted two years ago. Too often, welfare reform around the country has focused on immediate work experience as a means to achieve financial independence, but the focus is excessive, because it reduced options for welfare recipients who wish to complete to two- or four-year college degrees. 
Welfare reform around the country has tended to focus on immediate work experience as a means to achieve financial independence. The new direction of welfare reform at both state and federal levels has generally reduced the options available for welfare recipients who wish to complete a two- or four-year college degree. It is extremely difficult for single parents to be full-time students and work part-time and still give adequate time to their families. 
The welfare reform program called Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, is based on the idea that work is the best way to achieve independence, especially if the work comes with job security and fair wages. For many people, education is the best road to jobs that achieve these goals. Higher education is often the best way to earn higher wages, achieve independence from welfare, and provide protection from future poverty and unemployment. 
Recent studies have found that the average wage for a person who was previously on welfare and then earned a degree is $11.00 an hour, and that each year of education completed by welfare recipients increases wages by as much as $1.14 per hour. A study of 4,500 working mothers in the Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation found that a college degree is worth an additional $2.58 per hour for working mothers, compared to the wages of high school graduates. The special importance of higher education for women is emphasized by other data showing that women need a college degree to make the same amount of money that men earn with only a high school education. 
The results of these studies are hardly surprising. We know the importance of higher education and the advantages it opens up. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in March 1995 that adult workers with less than a high school diploma earned an annual average of only $13,697. Adult workers with a high school degree earned $20,248. With an associates degree, they earned $26,363, and with a bachelor's degree they earned $37,224. 
The job and career benefits of higher education are also demonstrated by the poverty statistics of the Department of Labor. In 1995 only 1.5 percent of those with a four-year college degree were living in poverty compared to 3.3 percent of those with an associates degree, 6.1 percent of those with a high school diploma, and 17.2 percent of those without a high school diploma. 
The evidence for the Wellstone amendment is overwhelming, and a bipartisan majority of the Senate was right to pass it. Under its provisions, 24 months of post-secondary education or vocational educational training would be permissible work activities under welfare reform. 
I commend Senator Wellstone's leadership on this important issue. States should have the flexibility to create responsible ways to move people from welfare to work, by allowing welfare recipients to include higher education as a part of their effort to achieve financial independence and provide effectively for their families. The House conferees were wrong to reject this positive reform, and we should do all we can to enact it as soon as possible.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this weekend, the New York Times reported on the latest data on Americans without health insurance. According to the Census Bureau, the number of uninsured has now reached 43.4 million of our fellow citizens--an increase of 1.7 million since last year. This increase is on top of the growth in the uninsured of one million last year. The proportion of Americans without health insurance is now higher than it has been for more than a decade. It is especially ominous that this increase in the number of uninsured has occurred at a time when the economy is strong and joblessness is low. 
Congress should be addressing this issue, but the Republican leadership is just not interested. What is important to average families is not important to them. Whether the issue is protecting patients against the abuses of managed care, or protecting the public against the tobacco industry, or saving social security, or raising the minimum wage, or improving education, or closing the loopholes in the campaign financing laws, the Republican leadership just doesn't think it is a priority. Their primary goal is to protect the special interests--not to protect American families. 
The plight of workers without health insurance--and of families that may be protected today but could lose their insurance tomorrow--is a particularly compelling example of the need for action. Under President Clinton's leadership, Democrats in Congress have repeatedly tried to address this problem four years ago--Republicans always say, `no.' Millions of Americans have suffered because we failed to act. Addressing this crisis is clearly a priority for Democrats and the nation, and it ought to be a priority for Republicans too. 
We have taken incremental steps in recent years. We have made it easier for workers who change jobs to keep their health insurance, and we have expanded coverage for children. These efforts were resisted every step of the way by the Republican leadership in Congress. The new Census Bureau report confirms what everyone who deals with this problem already knows--these limited steps, as important as they are, are not nearly enough. 
It should be unacceptable that 43 million Americans have no health insurance today. It should be intolerable that no American family can be confident that the health insurance they have today will be there for them tomorrow, if serious illness strikes. It is indefensible that this Congress is doing nothing to keep this problem from getting worse every year. 
The vast majority--85%--of uninsured Americans are workers or members of their families. These citizens work hard--40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year in most cases--but all their hard work cannot buy them the health insurance they need to protect their families, because they can't afford it and their employers won't provide it. 
Every uninsured American is an American tragedy waiting to happen. Infants lose their chance to grow up strong and healthy because they do not get basic prenatal and post-natal care. 
A young family loses its livelihood because a breadwinner cannot afford needed medical care. Middle-aged parents see their savings swept away by a tidal wave of medical debt. 
Earlier this year, I proposed legislation that be an important step toward the day when every job carries with it a guarantee of affordable health care, so that every family can be confident that the quality of its health will not be determined by the amount of its wealth. 
Every business is expected to pay a minimum wage, and to obey the child labor laws. Every business is expected to provide safe and healthy working conditions, and to protect against injury on the job through worker's compensation. Every business is expected to contribute to retirement through Social Security, and to the health needs of the elderly through Medicare. It is long past time for businesses also to contribute to the cost of basic health insurance coverage for their workers. 
Some small firms may have special problems that call for special solutions. But there is no excuse for large firms to avoid their responsibility to provide affordable health insurance for their workers. 
Under the bill I proposed, businesses with 50 or more workers will be required to provide health insurance coverage. Approximately half of all uninsured employees and their families--15 million people--will gain the coverage they need and deserve. This legislation is a giant step toward the day when every American will be guaranteed the fundamental right to health care. 
Many--even most--businesses already provide insurance. The vast majority of large businesses fulfill this obligation. But too many others do not. In more and more cases, unfair competition from firms that refuse to provide insurance for their workers is compelling other firms to reduce health benefits or drop coverage altogether. 
Health insurance for working Americans does not have to mean complex regulations or excessive government intervention. The legislation I introduced was simple--less than ten pages. it will not cost taxpayers a dime. It includes no specific mandated benefits or burdensome red tape. it simply says that every business with 50 workers or more must offer its employees coverage equal in value to the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Standard Option Plan that is available to every Senator and Representative, and must pay at least 72% of the cost--the same proportion that taxpayers contribute for every member of Congress. 
The American people deserve health care for their families that is every bit as good as the health care they provide to every member of Congress. Shame on the Congress for ignoring this need. Shame on the Republican leadership for its misguided priorities. 
When the people go to the polls in November, they deserve to know who stands with the special interests and who stands with families who need affordable health coverage. 
When the new Congress returns next year, I will do everything I can to assure that health care for every American is as high on that Congress's priority list as it is on the priority list of American families. It is time to end the suffering. It is time for Americans to join every other country in the industrialized world and guarantee its citizens the basic right to health care.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to again thank Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye for their efforts and leadership in putting the Fiscal Year 1999 Department of Defense Appropriations Conference Report together. I would also like to thank my colleagues for their continued support of photonics research and their leadership in providing continued funding for one of our most critical technologies. The vital nature of this photonics effort has been highlighted in recent Critical Technologies Reports to Congress. 
Mr. President, I would like to clarify one point in the Conference Report before us, and to confirm the legislative intent of the Committee. I would like to ask the senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, and the Senator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, if the $2.5 million provided for photonics research in the RDT&E/Army section was intended to be provided to the Photonics Research Center which was funded in the Fiscal Year 1996 Defense Appropriations Bill?

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, here we are, Friday at 11 o'clock. Most Americans are out working the fifth day of the week, and the Senate is in a quorum call while we have important business to attend to. None is more important, I think, than the consideration of the Patients' Bill of Rights. I took time yesterday on the floor of the Senate when we had a long quorum call, asking why we weren't debating the Patients' Bill of Rights, as I did the day before. And here we are midmorning on a Friday--a workday for most Americans--just going through the motions before recessing, with a cloture vote scheduled late Monday afternoon. 
We could debate this issue all day today, could debate the issue all day on Monday, and we could have some resolution to the kinds of protections that we are talking about in the Patients' Bill of Rights. We have written these protections into legislation and we have described these protections on the floor. We have challenged our friends on the other side, the Republican leadership, to permit us an opportunity to debate and vote on the kind of protections that are outlined in the legislation introduced by Senator Daschle. 
However, we have been denied the opportunity to bring up this legislation, and to debate these various protections. Instead, we have continued in the Senate to move forward on other pieces of legislation which, as important as they are, don't measure up to what I think most families are concerned with--and that is ensuring the protection of the health of themselves, their children, and their parents. 
Endorsements of various groups and individuals are important in some instances, less so in other instances. But I daresay that in this particular instance virtually all of the leaders in the health debate--certainly the doctors, nurses, and patient coalitions--have endorsed our proposal. We have been asking the Republican leadership for the names of the organizations that endorse their program. And we are still waiting to hear from the other side which medical professional groups have endorsed or supported the Republicans in this debate. I do not think there are any leading groups that support their plan, while virtually all support our legislation. Still, we are denied the opportunity to debate these issues. 
Now, yesterday Senator Gramm took the floor for an extended period of time to attack our plan. He said that the Republican solution was a new kind of insurance policy called medical savings accounts. The fact is that our bill takes medical decisionmaking out of the hands of the insurance company accountants and puts it back where it belongs, with the patients and the doctors. The Republican program is a sham and it gives the appearance of reform without the reality. 
I was struck by the fact that my friend, Senator Gramm, accuses the American people of wanting something for nothing, of wanting a `free lunch.' I object to this characterization of the patients who want protections from the health insurance company abuses. That is what we are basically talking about. What is at the heart of the legislation that we support is ensuring that medical professionals--doctors, nurses, and the trained medical professionals--make medical decisions. Those who are opposed want to maintain the status quo. They want to permit, in too many instances, insurance company accountants to make medical decisions. 
Now, a number of HMOs work well. Managed care in its best form can be good for patients. There are even a number of HMOs that support our particular proposal. And portions of our legislation are drawn from standards adopted voluntarily by some plans. But the problem is the bad apples that reach their medical decisions not on the basis of what is necessary from a medical point of view, but what is necessary from a bottom line point of view or the profit point of view of the HMO. That is the fundamental, basic issue. That is it. 
The good HMOs are complying with the kinds of protections that we have here. But a great many of other HMOs are not. We want to make sure that the patients are going to get what they pay for and what they are entitled to, and that their medical decisions are made by medical personnel and not accountants for insurance companies. 
Now, that fact is not understood by the Senator from Texas. What he has basically done in his presentation yesterday is accuse the American people of wanting something for nothing--I use his words: `a free lunch.' Those are the words the Senator used. Mr. President, I object to the characterization of patients who want protection from health insurance company abuse as patients who want a free lunch. 
I don't think a cancer patient who needs access to a specialist or a cancer treatment center wants a free lunch. I don't think that a family with a child experiencing seizures is asking for a free lunch when they want to rush their child to the nearest emergency room, and their HMO, in an emergency, requires instead that they go all the way across town to another emergency room. That type of response can risk the life and the health of that particular child. I don't think those parents who are saying, `Why can't I take my child to the nearest emergency room?' are asking for a free lunch. I don't think a woman whose doctors say she needs to stay in the hospital after a mastectomy, even though her insurance company wants to send her home in pain, with tubes still dangling from her body, is asking for a free lunch. 
All of these examples I am using are examples we have presented to the U.S. Senate day in and day out over the period of the past many months. All of those particular situations are addressed in our Patients' Bill of Rights. 
I would have hoped that the Senator from Texas at least would have urged the Republican leadership to permit us to debate this and let the Senate resolve these particular issues. That is where we would have the opportunity to make our respective presentations and call the roll on these matters, as to whether these requests amount to `free lunches.' Let him make his presentation, and those of us who are strong supporters of the Patients' Bill of Rights can respond and make a presentation to the Senate. Then let the Senate make a decision as to whether those individuals are trying to have a free lunch. 
I don't think a doctor who is penalized for telling patients about the best available treatment is asking for a free lunch. In too many HMOs, when doctors make that kind of judgment and tell that patient they ought to have a treatment that is not on the plan's list, is that they are effectively fired, or they are not rehired at the end of the year. The insurance companies and Republicans can say this isn't a gag rule. But the fact that they are not hired back when they are dismissed is effectively a gag rule. That is what is happening in too many circumstances. I don't think that the patient who is getting the best advice from that doctor, at the risk of that doctor's employment, is asking for a free lunch. 
I don't think an individual suffering from terrible mental illness, like schizophrenia or clinical depression, who wants effective pharmaceutical products to treat the illness rather than the older, ineffective, but cheaper medication that happened to be on the plan listing, is asking for a free lunch. That is happening in America today and will continue today and tomorrow, and it will continue day after day in the future unless we address that issue here. 
This isn't just my opinion or the opinion of our cosponsors. We have the strong support of the leaders of the medical organizations, doctors, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nurses, and others who know firsthand that the various HMOs are doing these things. We have heard from countless patients who have been told, `You can't get the good kind of medications that are necessary to meet your particular health care needs until you use these other ones and demonstrate to us, not just once, but twice, that they just don't work.' This puts a patient's health at risk. That is happening today. Look right here on the chart, Mr. President--`access to the doctor prescribed drugs.' But the Senator from Texas says, well, that particular patient is just looking for a free lunch. These Americans don't want something for nothing, and it is insulting of the Senator from Texas to suggest that they do. They have faithfully paid their premiums and they deserve quality care. 
These companies don't mind going out and representing that they have a whole range of different quality programs to get individuals into their HMO. But, too often, insurance companies then deny the individuals the kind of health quality protections they need when they get ill. That is what is happening. 
That is where there is bureaucracy; the bureaucracy is in that HMO that refuses to give the best in terms of health care to the patient. All we are requiring is that they just give the patient what they paid for, what HMO represented in terms of quality health care. They are not doing it. They are not doing it in the ways listed on this chart, Mr. President. 
These are not just made up categories of care; these have been recommended by the President's nonpartisan commission, and by Congress for the Medicare program. These are recommendations that have come from State insurance commissioners. These are recommendations that have been made by the health plans themselves. They are the ones who made these recommendations. We didn't just pull this out of the blue. 
These are protections that those who know the condition of what is happening in America have recommended to us. That is what this debate ought to be about. 
Mr. President, the American consumer has faithfully paid for their premiums. They deserve quality care. The characterization of it by the Senator from Texas is typical of the attitude that the Republican leadership has taken toward this issue. They want to allow insurance companies to continue to put the profits first and patients last--all driven by the bottom line. 
You can solve these issues and problems by having the decisions affecting the quality made by the doctors. There is not a great mystery about what the solution is. 
But no. We do not hear that from the opponents. They want to allow the insurance companies to continue to put the profits first. That is why they have offered a sham bill. That is why they won't allow the Senate to have a chance to debate and vote on this issue. That is why they are trying to change the subject to medical savings accounts. They don't want to debate this issue. They refuse to debate this issue. They want to debate another issue and divert attention away from the real issues in this discussion. 
They do not want to talk about clinical trials and their importance for women with breast cancer. They do not want to talk about the ability to have the pediatric specialist for children with dread diseases. They don't want to debate those issues. They don't want to debate the question about giving the family the right to be able to go to the nearest emergency room rather than across town. They don't want to debate that issue. Which of these do they not want to debate? We challenge the Republican leadership to tell us. 
But day after day we go on with the charade of trying to get cloture to prohibit any kind of amendments and any kind of debate on these issues--day after day, issue after issue. That is wrong. It is absolutely categorically wrong. 
We are committed to trying to have this kind of debate and discussion on, as Senator Daschle has said on many occasions, a reasonable way to proceed. But, quite frankly, we see day in and day out the Republican leadership attempting to do to the U.S. Senate what many of these HMOs are doing to their patients--gagging their doctors so they can't give them the right kind of health advice. The Republican leadership is gagging the Senate by saying: We will only permit you to bring this up if we have one vote--one vote--and do it now with no debate. 
Why aren t we debating this on Friday at 11 o'clock this morning, or this afternoon, or on Monday when millions of Americans are going back to work? Why aren't we debating these issues? Why aren't we, Mr. President? It is silence on the other side. It is silence on the other side. They are trying to gag us from debating these issues. They are trying to protect the profits of those HMOs that refuse to provide the right kind of treatment by refusing us the opportunity to address these issues. They are basically protecting those various special interests and denying to virtually every major consumer group, and every major medical professional group their voice here in the Senate on these points. They refuse to let us even debate these issues. And the American people understand it. 
The American people want Congress to pass strong and effective legislation to end the abuses of HMOs, managed care plans, and health insurance companies. They want us to pass the Patients' Bill of Rights, which was introduced by Senator Daschle and Senate Democrats, to provide the needed and long overdue antidote to these festering and growing abuses. 
Our goal is to protect the patients and to see that insurance plans provide the quality plan they promise but, too often, fail to deliver. Our bill has been on the Senate calendar since March. An earlier version of the legislation was introduced more than a year and a half ago, but the Senate has taken no action because the Republican leadership has been compounding the HMO abuses by abusing the rules of the Senate to block meaningful reform. This record of abuse should be unacceptable to the Senate. It is certainly unacceptable to the American people. 
We held a forum Wednesday in which a letter was released from 36 groups representing patients, families, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and others concerned about quality health care for people with mental illness. As I discussed in a floor statement yesterday, these groups begged the Senate to act to pass a patients' bill of rights, because with every day that passes, patients and their families suffer needlessly because of abuses by managed care plans. 
The stories they told were tragic--they involved suicide, spousal abuse, anxiety attacks inflicted on a Vietnam veteran, successful courses of treatment cruelly interrupted--all because insurance companies are putting the bottom line first and their obligations to patients last. 
This forum was just the most recent one in which we have heard patients and doctors and nurses pleading with the Republican leadership to act on real managed care reform. In my statement yesterday, I reported on an earlier forum in which we heard from Dr. Charlotte Yeh, an emergency room doctor representing the American College of Emergency Physicians. Dr. Yeh described tragic cases in which patients had been denied the care they needed because of managed care penny-pinching. 
On behalf of the college, she endorsed our legislation, and she denounced the Republican leadership alternative as worse than inadequate. Only with a full and fair floor debate can we pass real protection for patients who need emergency care or who should be allowed to go to the nearest emergency room when the symptoms of serious illness strike. 
On July 24, we heard from cancer patients and their doctors who explained how critical the provision of the Patients' Bill of Rights was in assuring patients access to quality clinical trials. These trial are often the only hope for patients with incurable cancer or other diseases where conventional treatments are ineffective. They are the best hope for learning to cure these dread diseases. Insurance used to routinely pay the doctor and hospital costs associated with clinical trials--but managed care plans are refusing to allow their patients to participate or to pay these costs. 
We understand. When patients are in a clinical trial there isn't a significant increase in terms of the costs to the HMO. It is just the routine doctor costs and hospital costs that they would pay anyway. The trial itself pays for the kinds of additional attention and prescription drugs that are given to these patients. But the insurance companies won't even cover the minimal payments. 
Our bill requires them to respond to this need--but the Republican bill does not, and the Senate leadership does not want a debate on this issue. 
Fourteen leading organizations of cancer patients, representing the eight million Americans surviving with cancer and the 1.5 million Americans who will be newly diagnosed with cancer this year, have spoken out strongly on the need for this amendment. These are organizations that patients and physicians alike look to for guidance on cancer issues. They include the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, Cancer Care, Incorporated, the Candle- lighters Childhood Cancer Foundation, the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, the National Alliance of Breast Cancer Organizations, the North American Brain Tumor Coalition, US TOO International, the Y-ME National Breast Cancer Society, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the Alliance for Lung Cancer Advocacy, Support and Education, the Friends of Cancer Research, the Leukemia Society of America, and the Oncology Nursing Society--all groups that speak out for patients who have cancer. They have made their recommendations. They support our legislation. But we are being refused and denied the opportunity to even debate it. 
Here is what the combined cancer groups say about this:  
Clinical trials represent the standard of care for cancer patients. Patient care in clinical trials is no more important than standard therapy. Cancer will strike roughly one in three Americans during their lifetimes. Even those who escape the diagnosis will have friends and family touched by the disease. Any patient rights or quality care legislation will be a shallow promise for people with cancer if it does not include provisions ensuring access to clinical trials. 
That is what we are talking about--clinical trials for individuals who have cancer. Why can't we debate that on the floor of the U.S. Senate on a Friday at noontime? Why can't we call the roll for those who believe, as the cancer organizations do, that clinical trials are a critical aspect of treatment, and that most Americans believe when they sign those HMO contracts that they are going to get the best in terms of American health care? And they do with a better HMO. But there are too many that are denying that care. Too many that are risking their lives because they are being denied the opportunity for clinical trials that may offer new hope and opportunity of survival for an individual member of a family. That is unbelievable. But that is happening--denial. Too often the insurance companies offer a shallow promise. But our program ensures these protections. The Republican plan does not. 
Mr. President, we see that not one, not a single group that is concerned about the survival of cancer has supported the Republican program. But virtually every major cancer group supports our legislation and believes it is essential to protect American families. 
Why can't we debate that on the floor of the U.S. Senate? What is it about? Hard-working Americans--more than 160 million working Americans who are going to work today on Friday at noontime. 
Why aren't we debating that in the Senate? Why aren't we debating it at 2 o'clock or 5 o'clock or on this coming Monday morning or afternoon? We are prepared to debate these issues. But, no, the Republican leadership refuses to debate them. We are effectively seeing the manipulation of the Senate rules in such a way as to deny the opportunity for full consideration of something that is of core concern and importance to every American family, and that is the quality of their health care. 
So, Mr. President, I just want to again reiterate my strong support for our Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, who has indicated that we are going to still, even in the final days of this session, continue to pursue this. There are those who say, well, we haven't got enough time. But our Republican friends must think we do have enough time because they are continuing to resist our efforts. They must assume we do have enough time. It is amazing how quickly this body can act when we want to act on important pieces of legislation, and we do have time. So, Mr. President, we will continue to press these issues forward. 
I see other of my friends and colleagues in this Chamber. I will continue to address this issue at another time, but it is important to note that we have seen one more week go by and a denial of the request of our Democratic leader to at least have a reasonable period of time to debate these issues and resolve them in a way that would respond to the central concerns of every major medical professional group and society in our country. I am not aware of a single medical society or patient group that supports the Republican plan--not one. We have been waiting to hear one. They can't come up with one. In contrast, more than 180 groups support our particular proposal. 
Now, we may not have it all right, and we are interested in discussing adjustments that we may have to make. But 187 groups in our country, representing the cancer societies, the medical professionals, the nurses, the patient groups, working families, and others effectively support our proposal. 
Every major children's health organization in our society has endorsed this proposal because they know how important this is for children. Every major breast cancer group in our society that cares about women and understands the enormous possibilities of breakthroughs in terms of the new modern miracle drugs supports our proposal. Every major group that represents persons with disabilities in our country--individuals who are challenged mentally and physically every single day--supports our proposal. And still, because of the manipulation of the Senate rules, we are denied a full debate and discussion and ultimate resolution as to what this body would say to families of this country on such a matter. It is wrong, and we are going to continue to press our case. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is very interesting. I have seen those ads, but I believe they are going to be pulled very soon because what has happened, according to the most recent study by Bob Blendon at Harvard and the Kaiser Family Foundation, is that support for our bill has gone up, quite in conflict with the intentions of those who sponsored the ads that have been critical of the Patients' Bill of Rights. And so now the insurance companies and corporations that oppose the Patients' Bill of Rights are reviewing their television strategy because their campaign has had the reverse effect. They are sort of going back to the drawing board. 
But quite clearly, as the Senator implies, their ads certainly were not a fair representation of the legislation that we have introduced. As I mentioned, virtually every one of these proposals in our bill has either been suggested by the President's commission--which was bipartisan and reported its recommendations unanimously--as important for all patients, or included in Medicare at the present time and used in protecting our seniors, or have been embraced by the state insurance commissioners--which are the 50 commissioners around this country, Republicans and Democrats--or adopted voluntarily by the HMOs themselves through their trade association. 
This legislation reflects the best judgment of those groups that know this issue best. That is why we have a sense of confidence in this legislation. It has the strong support of those professionals who treat families and understand the kinds of protections that are necessary to give the best of health care to American families.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, yesterday marked the 35th Anniversary of the Senate's ratification of the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963. Unfortunately, we still have not achieved the larger goal of ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. In fact, the Treaty has languished in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for a year with no debate, no action, and no results. 
As President Kennedy said about the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, `The conclusion of such a treaty * * * would check the spiraling arms race in one of its most dangerous areas. It would place the nuclear powers in a position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest hazards which man faces in 1963, the further spread of nuclear arms.' Thirty-five years later, those words are truer than ever. 
Nuclear proliferation is one of the most serious national security threats we face. Earlier this year, the nuclear tests in India and Pakistan reminded us that we must do all we can to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as soon as possible. 
On Wednesday, at the United Nations, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan announced his intent to sign the test ban treaty within the next year. The Prime Minister linked this decision to the lifting of sanctions imposed in the wake of last May's nuclear tests. Yesterday, India's Prime Minister Vajpayee followed suit and announced to the U.N. General Assembly that his nation would also sign the Treaty within the year. 
If both Pakistan and India sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, only North Korea will remain outside the worldwide group of nations in continuing to develop their nuclear program. Prompt U.S. ratification of the Treaty would not only demonstrate our support for Pakistan and India, but also encourage North Korea to join the world and reject nuclear testing. 
The recent tests by India and Pakistan are ominous proof that the greatest threat to humanity is still the danger of nuclear war. The CTBT would give the United States access to a vast worldwide network of nuclear monitoring stations. These additional stations would blanket the globe with sensors that can detect radiation, feel the ground shake from a nuclear test, or hear the sounds emanating underwater from a nuclear explosion. This network is possible only through the cooperative efforts of the CTBT, and it will clearly strengthen our national security. 
We face a unique opportunity in the Senate, an opportunity to help the world pull back from the nuclear brink and end nuclear testing once and for all. Other nations look to the United States for international leadership. President Clinton has done his part, in signing the Treaty and submitting it to the Senate for ratification, as the Constitution requires. Now the Senate should do its part, and ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
Treaty ratification is the single most important step we can take today to reduce the dangers of nuclear war.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to point out once again to the Senate that we have been in a quorum call for about a half hour, and we are waiting to conclude the FAA legislation. As I understand, it has been tentatively agreed to be concluded later in the afternoon sometime--5 or 6 o'clock this evening--and we can anticipate perhaps one or two more votes. 
But I want to bring to the attention of the Senate again that we could be using this time to debate the Patients' Bill of Rights. We have by now seen the majority leader's priorities--the FAA bill, which is important to a number of communities, including my own State of Massachusetts is not a matter of insignificance--but we have had the salting legislation, we have had other pieces of legislation that have been advanced, and still the Republican leadership refuses to call up or permit our debate here on issues relating to the quality of health of some 140 million Americans, those Americans that are covered in various HMOs. 
In my own State of Massachusetts, we have some of the very best in terms of HMOs. The HMO program really took off, expanded, and we now find many high-quality HMOs. But in my State, and across the country, HMOs too often are making judgments and decisions based upon what insurance company accountants say, not what members of the medical profession recommend. 
I heard the President of the United States speak eloquently about his strong support for the Patients' Bill of Rights just a few days ago. And he made a point which I think is worth underlining here in the U.S. Senate this afternoon. He said that no one in these HMOs ever loses their job when they deny a procedure that a patient's doctor requests, because these HMOs are organized so that there are several different levels of approval required to receive medical care. 
The deep concern that many of us have is that these decisions be made at the ground level--by doctors and other trained medical professionals--so that American families receive the care that they need. 
And if decisions are going to be made that are in the interests of the profit of the HMO and not the health of the patient, and as a result of those decisions that that individual is killed or permanently disabled, there ought to be some form of remedy. That is a key part in our Patients' Bill of Rights. 
Why should we say that there is only going to be one industry in America that is going to be free from accountability to the American citizens? 
Why should they be the only one? They are, today, effectively the only one. 
Under existing law, the health insurance industry is the only industry in America where, if there is negligence resulting in the loss of life or serious bodily injury, they are essentially free of accountability. That is wrong. Most Americans believe that is wrong, and it is wrong. 
Accountability is an essential part of our Patients' Bill of Rights. Medical decisions should be made by medical professionals and not by accountants. And if a negligent decision was made, there should be accountability. Or what will happen to the family of the patient who died because an HMO refused to pay for a medical test? What will happen to the education of the children of the patient who is permanently disabled because she could not receive care at the closest emergency room? 
Our Republican friends say that is too bad, we don't want to change that provision. Why can't we debate that? Why are we taking time in a quorum, or the time used yesterday waiting for amendments to the FAA bill? We understand that there is no long list of speakers to come to the floor even this afternoon. Why aren't we debating managed care reform here on the floor this afternoon? Why aren't we able to make some decision that affects millions of families today, across this country, on the issues of accountability? 
It isn't just accountability. Another very important provision in our Patients' Bill of Rights would require HMOs to pay for routine medical costs associated with clinical trials for their patients. We know--I know from personal experience--the importance of clinical trials. These trials don't, in fact, add any substantial additional cost to the HMO, because most of the patient's expenses are covered by the trial protocol--the grant for that particular trial. There are very small additional expenses--very, very small additional expenses. 
And clinical trials are enormously important. They are enormously important for children who have cancer and other serious and dread diseases. My own son was involved in an NIH clinical trial when he had osteosarcoma. Only 22 children had been in that clinical trial prior to my son. He lost his leg to cancer. But his chances of surviving were 15-18 percent before he entered that clinical trial. And he survived, as about 85 percent of the children who got into that clinical trial did. Now the treatment used in that trial is a generally accepted procedure for children who have osteosarcoma, bone sarcoma. 
The idea of denying children the opportunity to enter clinical trials is outrageous. What are we supposed to say to a parent? `Yes, we know your child has osteosarcoma. We know there is a clinical trial that could save his life. But we are not going to permit you to enlist your child in that clinical trial'? 
That is happening in the United States today in HMOs. These families say, `My goodness, what will I do?' They appeal the decision, they wait, they go to desperate lengths requiring tremendous courage, and finally they get in the clinical trial weeks or months later. But it is too late; that tumor that was a fraction of a centimeter has enlarged. There can be no treatment now. 
Denying our citizens an opportunity to participate in the greatest advances that are taking place in the medical profession is effectively a death sentence. 
We have made great advances in the war on cancer, especially in children's diseases. And I don't know what we would have done if we didn't have clinical trials for these children, and for patients with other diseases. We now have some very important opportunities for treatments of breast cancer, colon cancer, ovarian cancer, cancer of the stomach, and colorectal cancer. 
Diseases like breast cancer are becoming more and more of a challenge. Yet we are experiencing these breakthrough therapies that can make an enormous difference in saving the lives of our fellow citizens. 
I seriously believe that the next millennium will be the millennium of the life sciences, breakthroughs in terms of medicine. It will offer enormous opportunities. The opportunities of mapping the human genome alone--which our good friend, the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, has been such a leader on here in the U.S. Senate--are just mind boggling. 
But we also have the opportunity now to make a difference in people's lives--to make sure that, when medical professionals recommend that patients enroll in clinical trials, these decisions are not overruled by insurance company accountants. That decision effectively denies them the opportunity to save their lives or to get the best in terms of medicine. 
Every single day we have examples of this type of situation. I will mention one, Diane Bergin. I have Diane Bergin's testimony from a forum that was held on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We talk about the Patients' Bill of Rights as a piece of legislation, but it is really an issue of lifesaving protections. That is what the legislation is really about, lifesaving protections, and we do it in a number of different ways. 
Mr. President, this is Diane Bergin's comment:  
My name is Diane Bergin and I was diagnosed with ovarian cancer two years ago. I had always been very healthy--so the news was particularly devastating. The only time I had been in the hospital was when I had my three children. My primary care physician referred me to a specialist at Georgetown, where I eventually had my surgery and received standard chemotherapy treatment. For three months, everything looked good. At my next checkup, however, the cancer had come back. 
My physician recommended that I consider getting a bone marrow transplant. Before I could get treated, however, I had to go through a round of medical testing to see if I was a good candidate for a transplant. All through the testing I kept hoping that I would qualify. I worked hard to keep my spirits up and be optimistic. But in addition to worrying about whether I would qualify for a transplant, I also had to worry over whether my insurance would cover the procedure. It felt like the insurance company held the balance of my life in their hands. I had no guarantee that if I qualified, I would be covered. 
My husband and family couldn't have been any more supportive. They told me to count on getting the transplant and that they would somehow find a way to pay for it. In my heart I couldn't accept that I would impoverish my family to have a chance at prolonging my life. 
Fortunately we weren't asked to make that decision. My insurer finally sent me a letter approving my treatment. 
Again I improved immediately after the transplant, but six weeks later I was not so lucky. I was sent to another specialist in Philadelphia who put me on tamoxifen. This was the only drug I could tolerate because my condition was so fragile after the transplant and there was some hope it would help me. Unfortunately I didn't improve. 
It was then that my physician suggested that I enroll in a clinical trial for a new treatment at the Lombardi Cancer Center. Even though I had been on an emotional roller coaster waiting for my insurer to approve other treatments, I never thought my insurer wouldn't pay now. 
But on the Friday before I was to start my treatment, I was called and told that my request had been rejected. I was devastated and didn't know how I could get through the weekend with my husband and son out of town. It struck me how arbitrary the insurance system was. They were acting as judge and jury on what medical care I could receive even though my doctors recommended this care. The denial felt like a death sentence--that I wouldn't have any more chances to fight for my very survival. 
I refused to accept that I couldn't get this treatment that I so desperately needed. I objected and started my appeal. When my family returned, they joined in the fight. Fortunately, my son works at the Cancer Center and is very involved in the clinical trial program there. With all our efforts, and the aggressive appeal by my clinical team at Lombardi, my insurer finally agreed to pay the routine costs of my care. I'm in the midst of that trial right now. 
I don't know if this trial will help me. And I don't know what will happen if I should need to seek treatment through another clinical trial. I anticipate another fight, only next time I may not be so lucky. 
I wanted to come today to tell my story because I believe that no one facing a serous illness should be denied access to care because that treatment is being provided through a clinical trial. Sometimes, it is the only hope we have. And the benefit to me, whether short or long term, will surely help those women who come after me, seeking a cure--a chance to prolong their life for just a little while, just so that they can attend a graduation, or a wedding, or the birth of a grandchild. 
I strongly support, and my family is right there with me, requiring insurers to pay for the routine costs of care that are part of an approved clinical trial. I think the cures of the future depend on it. 
Mr. President, letters signed by scores of groups supporting the right to get into clinical trials, and we have letters signed by scores of groups regarding access to specialists, such as pediatric oncologists. 
In our legislation, we also have provisions for guaranteeing that a child can see a specialist if that child has a serious illness. That is not in the Republican program. We in the Senate ought to be able to debate the merits of this provision. 
But the bottom line, at the end of the day, is what the additional costs are going to be. We ought to be able to debate these, as well. You will find out that the cost of our protections is approximately $2 per worker per month. I think most workers would be glad to pay that additional $2 a month for the kind of protections we are talking about here in terms of clinical trials and specialists for members of their family. Why not give us an opportunity to debate that? Why not call the roll on those particular provisions? 
We need to have a debate on the situation we see taking place around this country, where if you are a member of an HMO, your ambulance will drive by the nearest hospital and go to another hospital on the other side of town just because they are a member of that HMO. They will drive right by it. If a family goes to the closer hospital, the HMO will charge the family for the emergency care, which perhaps saved their child's life. We ought to be able to debate that. Why are we being shut out and denied? Why are we continuing in these quorum calls that last the course of the afternoon? Why didn't we take time yesterday and why aren't we taking time this afternoon to move ahead on this kind of legislation? 
Mr. President, many of the guarantees that have been included in the Patients' Bill of Rights are guarantees that were unanimously recommended by the bipartisan President's Commission on Quality Care. In fairness, I will say that the Commission didn't recommend that these recommendations necessarily be put in legislation. But if all of the HMOs had just accepted those requirements, then we would not be needing this legislation. The problem is that the good ones have it, but the others don't. 
So we are saying that we want to make sure that the protections are going to be across the board. If all of the HMOs complied with the legislation, we would not need it. 
But these are very sensible and responsible recommendations. Half of them have been recommended by the President's Commission, half of them by the American Association of Health Plans. We have more than half of them that are already in existence included in form of Medicare, and 32 million Americans get those protections. So they are working in the Medicare, but they are not available for other Americans. Other protections in our bill were recommended by the National Association of Insurance Commissions--again, a bipartisan group of insurance commissioners representing the States who have a pretty good understanding and awareness of what is needed. 
There is not one of our recommendations--not one of them--that has not been recommended by one of those four organizations or groups. Not one. 
Mr. President, what I am saying is that these protections have been well thought out. They are reasonable, they are sensible, they are responsible, and they will make a significant difference in terms of protecting the health care of the American people. Now, Mr. President, it is time to give us an opportunity to debate those and act on them. 
I will wind up with these final comments. We have every professional medical organization, every nursing organization, every consumer group in the country supporting our Patients' Bill of Rights. Not one is supporting the Republican proposal. Not one. No matter how many staffers go out and search, they can't find one. 
The doctors and the medical profession understand the importance of this, as well as the parents. Every children's group, every disability group, every women's group, every one of those groups support this because this is the way to protect children, the disabled, women, and families. 
With all respect to the importance of the legislation that we are currently considering, we have few days left to debate the Patients' Bill of Rights. We continue to implore the Republican leadership to bring up this legislation and permit the Senate to work its will so that we can do something to protect the American consumer in health care. 
Mr. President, I see my friend and colleague from Arizona on the floor. I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator from Arizona. 
I just wanted to join in expressing support for our leader's position in raising this extremely important issue, the Patients' Bill of Rights. Our leader, Senator Daschle, has indicated a willingness to enter into agreements that would be reasonable and which would permit debate and discussion of these important matters that are at the heart of concerns of millions of American families, and to do it in a way we would not interrupt the important legislation that the Senator from Arizona has identified. We have been frustrated in having that opportunity. 
We had similar difficulty earlier in terms of the minimum wage. We were able to address that, not with the outcome that some of us might have hoped but nonetheless we were able to at least get a judgment on that. And we wanted to try to also get a judgment on this matter which is of central concern to families all across this country. 
I want to just add my support to the objections of Senator Daschle and also to express appreciation to the Senator from Arizona. We know that this is not his decision at this time to be making, but it is a leadership decision. 
I thank him for his courtesy and recognize it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was over in my office earlier in the afternoon. I heard the quorum calls. Now again we are wasting time in the middle of the afternoon. We are talking about a Wednesday afternoon at about quarter of 5. The Senate is in a quorum call when we could be debating the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
I have taken the opportunity at other times to remind the Senate about the importance of that debate. Last week, we had the Republican leadership effectively close down the Senate for 5 hours, by essentially prohibiting Members of the U.S. Senate to speak at that time on the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights. And, as has been pointed out by our Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, the Republican leadership shows an unwillingness to debate this issue during the evening times, which would allow us to do the country's business and do the people's business. 
I rise again today to talk a bit about this issue, and the importance of it, because it is of such compelling importance to millions of Americans--more than 160 million Americans. 
Every time I go back to Massachusetts--and I think it is generally true with others as they travel across the country to their States--I run into the people who have faced the kinds of situations that I will mention in just a moment or two. These are situations that cry out for action. Still we don't take the action. 
We have considered other pieces of legislation that have some importance. But I daresay that none of the recent pieces of legislation that we have considered, I believe, rise to the importance of the debate and discussion on the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
Mr. President, I want to include in the Record today the testimony and the comments of some leading American citizens who are very concerned about ensuring adequate protections for consumers of mental health services--protections that are included in the Patients' Bill of Rights, which has been introduced by Senator Daschle, and are not included in the Republican proposal. 
In the forum that was held this afternoon, 36 groups--representing patients, families, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and others who are concerned about quality of health care for people with mental illness--begged the Senate to act to pass the Patients' Bill of Rights. With every day that passes, these patients and their families are suffering because of abuses by the managed care systems. In too many instances, the stories they told were tragic. They involved suicide, spousal abuse, anxiety attacks inflicted on a Vietnam veteran, and successful courses of treatment cruelly interrupted because insurance companies are putting their bottom line first and their obligations to patients last. 
One of our speakers, the president of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, NAMI, focused on an important provision of our legislation that has not received as much attention as some of the other issues--access to needed prescription drugs that are not on a health plan's approved list. For mental patients, the last few decades have seen a significant growth in the number of new medicines that can treat their diseases. For many patients, these new drugs represent genuine medical miracles and opportunities to resume lives that have been devastated by these cruel diseases. But too often managed care plans have said `no' to these patients and their doctors. They say: `The new drugs are too expensive. You will have to make do with older, cheaper drugs that are on our approved list. If they don't work for you, that is just too bad.' That should be unacceptable to every American. 
Our legislation will guarantee that no family with a mentally ill member will ever be subjected to this kind of abuse again.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we heard today from Jackie Shannon. She is the president of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, NAMI, and the mother of a son with schizophrenia. I would like to read from her very, very moving testimony. This passage refers to a woman named Pam Childs from Miami, Florida and her problems with manic-depressive illness: 
Pam was a Ph.D. psychologist who specialized in treating children and adolescents . . . Repeatedly, Pam's HMO told her that the treatment being recommended by her doctors were `not part of the plan.' On several occasions, doctors who made progress in treating Pam were later told that they were `being taken off the plan.' Pam Childs never got the treatment she needed, and this story did not have a happy ending. On July 2 of this year, at 34 years of age, Pam took her own life by leaping from the window of her father's 15-story apartment. 
Mr. President, Jackie Shannon also told us about the problems the mental health community faces in terms of access to various prescription drugs. The prescription drug formularies used by insurance companies limit access to the newest and most effective medications. I would like to read from her testimony: 
Over the past decade, the most far-reaching advances in the treatment of brain disorders such as schizophrenia and manic-depressive illness have all been in the area of prescription drugs. These new medications are highly effective in treating severe symptoms, without many of the disturbing side effects associated with older medications. While some of these medications may cost more at the front end, they deliver significant long-term savings through fewer and shorter hospitalizations, and, more importantly, a higher quality of life for consumers. 
Unfortunately, managed care plans too often use formularies--restrictive lists and bureaucratic rules--to limit access to the newer, more effective medications. What kind of rules? A 1997 survey of managed behavioral health plans by NAMI revealed widespread use of policies such as prior authorization, and what they call `twice-fail' requirements as parts of the formulary. 
These `twice fail' rules are especially offensive to the NAMI members. Our survey found that some managed care plans actually require patients to fail on older, cheaper medications multiple times before being able to access the newer medication. NAMI believes that psychiatrists and their patients should be able to select the medication that is right for them based on clinical effectiveness, not on a managed care plan's financial bottom line. The best treatment available should be the treatment of first choice. 
Do we understand that, Mr. President? The best treatment available ought to be the treatment of first choice. The Democratic version of the Patients' Bill of Rights guarantees that. It would allow the doctors to overrule a plan's restrictive drug formulary when it is in the patient's interests. The Republican bill would not. 
Now, Mr. President, this is an issue of particular importance to persons with mental illness who need these newer drugs. We hear case after case of patients who would be helped if they had access to the newest and most effective medications. We heard of one young person whose plan required him to use the cheaper drugs and demonstrate their failure not just once, but twice, before they would even be eligible for the right drugs. This is one of the reasons that we provide this kind of protection in our Patients' Bill of Rights. We believe it is important to ensure that the doctor can to say, This is the kind of prescription drug that is necessary to deal with your particular health need and that the plan will cover it, if the plan offers drug coverage. 
That is a very important protection. We would like to debate that issue. If the Republican leadership does not believe that we ought to provide that kind of protection, they should come to the floor of the Senate and let's call the roll. This is not a complicated issue. It is not a very complicated issue. But it is one of the very important protections that exist in our bill and which does not exist in the Republican bill. 
The American people have been effectively denied--with the various proposals that have been offered by the majority leader in terms of the debate of the Patients' Bill of Rights--from seeing where the Senate stands on these important issues. The leadership has said, in reference to their proposal, You can either take it or leave it. They are attempting to gag not only the doctors in this country from giving the best advice on health care needs, but they are also attempting to gag the Senate from having any kind of debate or discussion on these issues, let alone a vote on them. That is very, very important, Mr. President. The National Association of Mentally Ill feel that access to prescription drugs is of enormous importance to their membership. Their view is shared by all of the leading mental health organizations. That is why the 36 different groups have indicated strong support for the Democratic Patients Bill of Rights. 
Mr. President, I refer right here to this chart that compares our Patients' Bill of Rights, which puts patients before profits, and the Republican legislation. Right here, No. 11--access to doctor prescribed drugs--the question is whether you will be able to get the kind of prescription drug--new or old, perhaps somewhat more expensive--that your doctor recommends, or be forced to take only those medications that are listed on the HMO plan and just do not work for you. 
Mr. President, this forum that we had was just the most recent one in which we heard patients and doctors and nurses pleading with the Republican leadership to act on real managed care reform before the end of the year. 
At today s forum, I spoke about a particularly tragic set of circumstances surrounding the case of a man who died because his plan denied necessary treatment. In this case, however, like too many others, the plan was not held accountable for its abusive actions. Let me just tell you, Mr. President, about this very tragic case. 
Richard Clarke of Haverhill, MA, was struggling to deal with a serious problem of substance abuse. His health plan clearly covered 30 days of inpatient rehabilitation. But when Mr. Clarke's doctor admitted him to a detoxification program, the plan provided only 5 days of treatment. His treatment was cut short, and his pattern of abuse and inadequate treatment continued. Shortly after the first hospitalization, his doctor again tried to admit him. But his HMO approved just 8 days of inpatient rehabilitation. And 24 hours after this discharge, Mr. Clarke attempted suicide. Again, he was referred for additional inpatient treatment, but this time the HMO refused to pay for any additional services--even though his policy clearly should have covered 17 additional days. 
At this point, a judge committed Mr. Clarke to a State correctional center. Mr. Clarke was abused in that center and received only minimal treatment. Tragically, just a few weeks after being discharged from the correctional center, Mr. Clarke committed suicide at age 41. He left a widow and four children and 17 days of inpatient rehabilitation coverage on his insurance policy--17 days that were not used, 17 days that were repeatedly denied by the HMO. And he took his life. 
His widow took the insurance plan to Federal court. But Judge William Young had no choice but to reluctantly dismiss the case because the Federal law protected the HMO from accountability for its actions. 
Judge Young was frank in his opinion:  
Federal law has evolved in a shield of immunity that protects health insurers. . . and other managed care entities from potential liability for the consequences of their wrongful denial of health benefits. The Federal law thwarts the legitimate claims of the very people it was designed to protect. 
There it is, Mr. President, an example of an individual who needed help, consolation, rehabilitation, and attention, but was denied it by the HMO. A tragic, tragic ending, with the HMO responsible--I believe, just from a reading of these facts--or certainly contributing to the anxiety and ultimately to the untimely death, and the loss of this father of four children. And, under current law, the HMO is able to stand back and say, no, we can't be sued. And they cannot be, Mr. President. 
That particular issue is addressed in our legislation. Right here on the chart where we say `ability to hold plans accountable.' But it is not in the Republican legislation. We looked through their bill. It is not there, but it is in ours. Another issue to debate. Another issue to discuss. Another issue to vote on. It is not very complicated. Are you going to hold a plan accountable when its decisions result in the death or serious injury of an individual who may be the breadwinner for a family? Are you going to deny a family the opportunity to hold insurance companies responsible if a loved one has been the recipient of negligent treatment? 
We ought to be able to vote on that. It is not very complicated. But no, no, we cannot even bring that up. We cannot even debate it. It is a crucial matter, certainly, to the Clarke's or any other family in this situation. It is a crucial matter to millions of other families. 
Mr. President, there are millions of Americans who have that kind of protection today, but it is not guaranteed to over 120 million Americans who receive their insurance through employers in the private sector. It is not guaranteed. It is effectively excluded. Mr. President, more than 40 million Americans can hold their HMOs accountable, but more than 120 million others cannot. The others cannot. Why not, we might ask? Because the power of the special interests will not permit us to get to this legislation, to consider it, debate it, and call the roll on it. 
Mr. President, this forum was just the most recent one in which we have heard the patients and doctors and nurses pleading with the Republican leadership to act on real managed care reform. Several weeks ago, we heard from Dr. Charlotte Yeh, an emergency doctor from Boston who also is a leader in the American College of Emergency Physicians. In fact, we have had the leaders of many of these professional groups appear in these forums--representatives of from many of the more than 180 different groups of patients and doctors, nurses, health professionals that support our legislation. 
Dr. Yeh described cases where HMOs denied treatment that patients needed because of managed care penny-pinching. She indicated she was appearing at the forum `representing the concerns of 20,000 emergency physicians, on behalf of 90 million patients we see every year.' She went on to say, `For emergency physicians protecting patients is not just a job, it is our lives.' They are strongly in support of our legislation. They strongly believe that we ought to have an opportunity to debate this legislation. They are strongly opposed to Republican leadership, and are concerned about the leadership s refusal to let us have an opportunity to debate the legislation. This is what Dr. Yeh commented on:  
For the last several years, the tactics of the managed care industry with respect to coverage of emergency care has become a national issue. * * * * * 
We've all heard the stories. 
In Detroit, a 46-year old woman collapsed in her husband's arms and was rushed to the hospital by ambulance. She died of cardiac arrest after a failed resuscitation attempt. Unbelievably, her managed care plan later denied payment for her treatment because she did not call for prior approval. 
In Boston, a boy's leg was seriously injured in an auto accident. At a nearby hospital, emergency doctors told the parents he would need vascular surgery to save his leg and a surgeon was ready and available in the hospital. 
Unfortunately, for this young man, his insurer insisted he be transferred to an `in-network' hospital for the surgery. His parents were told if they allowed the operation to be done anywhere else, they would be responsible for the bill. They agreed to the move. Surgery was performed three hours after the accident. But by then, it was too late to save his leg. 
These are not episodes from the TV program, `ER'. These are not anecdotes. They are real people with real lives. 
A bipartisan majority in the Congress has called for enactment of standards that will put an end to episodes like the ones I just described. Last year, the Congress adopted the prudent layperson standard and other protections for Medicare and Medicaid patients seeking emergency care. Millions of Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries have these protections, but not the 160 million people outside of those programs. They do not have these protections. 
She continues: 
We thought there was consensus on this issue. . . . But we are very disturbed about the way in which the emergency service protections were drafted in the Republican `Patient Protection Act.' As a physician, it seems that a little unnecessary surgery was performed on the `prudent layperson' standard to the point where barely recognizable as the consumer protection we envisioned.

Mr. KENNEDY. Seeing Senators are here and ready to move ahead, I will just make some few concluding remarks on this issue and then get back to it at another time. I think we could have been debating this, rather than just filling in the time with the quorum calls, which we have been doing frequently. So I indicate to colleagues, I will make some concluding remarks for just a few more minutes and then yield the floor. Again, from Dr. Yeh's testimony: 
What's the difference between the real `prudent layperson' standard included in the Balanced Budget Act and the Democratic Patients Bill of Rights and the imposter that has been included in the GOP Patient Protection Act? 
The GOP Patient Protection Act would establish a weaker coverage standard for privately insured patients than what exists for Medicare and Medicaid patients. 
This is not Senator Daschle or myself making this statement, this is a leading member of the American College of Emergency Physicians--doctors who deal with this problem every single day--talking about how the GOP Patient Protection Act is a fraud.

Mr. KENNEDY. We heard from cancer patients, and their doctors, who explained that the Patients' Bill of Rights is critical to ensuring patients access to quality clinical trials. These trials are often the only hope for patients with incurable cancer or other diseases where conventional treatments are ineffective. They are the best hope for learning to cure these dread diseases. 
Insurance used to routinely pay the doctor and hospital costs associated with clinical trials, but managed care plans are refusing to allow patients to participate. Our bill forces the insurance companies to respond to these needs, but the Republican bill does not. And they refuse to debate this issue. Here it is on the chart, `Access to Clinical Trials.' We provide this protection, and they do not. 
Yet, this is very important for women who are battling breast cancer. It is important for children--like my own son, Teddy, who was able to get into a clinical trial when he had osteosarcoma at age 12, and survive that dread disease. He is alive today because he was in a clinical trial. 
Mr. President, as I have pointed out before, these are the guarantees that are in our legislation. Under our proposal, the doctor, the medical professional, will make the decisions on medical treatment for the patient--be that you or your spouse or your child or your grandchild. Medical decisions will not be made by an insurance company accountant. That is what is at the heart of the differences between the two pieces of legislation. 
We welcome an opportunity to just say we will take 10 of the issues on this list, and vote on those measures and vote on the legislation, while permitting our Republican friends to have a similar number of amendments. But let us at least get about it in these final days. It is not too late. It must not be too late, or we would not see the kinds of activity to deny or delay action on this legislation by our Republican friends each day. 
Just in conclusion, earlier in the day--although this was not advanced, it was circulated by the majority--there was a unanimous consent that was going to be proposed on the Internet tax legislation. I will include the whole provision in the Record. 
This was circulated to see whether there would be any objection on the Democratic side. It basically allowed all types of amendments--unlimited first and second degree amendments or amendments that are not relevant to the Internet tax issues in the underlying bill--but, and this is important, no health care amendments. Here is the text that would have been spoken by the Majority leader, `I further ask that during the Senate's consideration of S. 442 or the House companion, no amendments relative to health care be in order.' There you have it: One piece of legislation, with possibilities for all other legislation, except one--health care, the Patients' Bill of Rights, guaranteed protections for more than 160 million people. Under this proposal from the Republican leadership, we are permitting other kinds of amendments, but we are going to say no amendments relative to health care be in order. 
Thankfully, our Democratic leader rejected this, so it was not offered. But these are the tactics we are facing. We are as committed as ever to ensuring that we will have an opportunity to debate this issue--even if not on this particular measure. So we are going to continue to pursue it. 
I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes 15 seconds. 
At long last, the Senate is about to vote on raising the minimum wage. The Nation has enjoyed extraordinary prosperity in recent years. Unemployment and inflation are at their lowest levels in a generation. Interest rates are low, and the economy is strong and growing. But 12 million hard-working Americans are left out and left behind. They are minimum wage workers, and for them, the current prosperity is someone else's boom. Working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, minimum wage workers earn just $10,700 a year, $2,900 below the poverty level for a family of three. 
A full day's work should mean a fair day's pay. But for these 12 million Americans, it does not. These hard-pressed Americans can barely make ends meet every month. Too often they are forced to choose between paying the light bill or the phone bill or the heating bill. An unexpected illness or family crisis is enough to push them over the edge. 
Their plight is shocking and unacceptable. If this country values work as we say we do, we must be willing to pay these workers a decent wage. The wealthiest nation on Earth can afford to do better for these hard-working citizens, and today we have the opportunity to do so. We can raise the minimum wage. 
Giving workers another 50 cents an hour may not sound like much, but it can make all the difference for these hard-working Americans. It can help buy groceries or pay the rent or defray the costs of job training courses at the local community college. 
The minimum wage is a women's issue. It is a children's issue. It is a civil rights issue. It is a labor issue. It is a family issue. Above all, it is a fairness issue and a dignity issue. Raising the minimum wage is a matter of fundamental fairness and simple justice. 
In a few moments, the Senate will have the opportunity to do more than pay lip service to these basic principles. If we believe in these ideals, we will vote to raise the minimum wage. No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty.

Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, I yield myself 12 minutes. 
Mr. President, I will briefly review the bidding about where we are with regard to the minimum wage. 
Since the end of World War II, the minimum wage has increased seven different times. President Eisenhower signed a bill for an increase of the minimum wage. President Kennedy did as well, as did President Johnson. President Nixon supported an increase in the minimum wage. President Carter supported an increase in the minimum wage. President Bush supported an increase, and President Clinton has supported it as well. 
In the postwar period, if we look at where the economy went in the immediate 20 years after World War II, the economy grew across the board. The percent of increase for those at the lower income level rose just as well as those at the upper level. There was very, very little disparity. If you look at the difference quintiles, from the period of the postwar--1945 really up to about 1970--there was virtual growth together. 
During this period of time, we found that Republicans and Democrats alike supported the increase in the minimum wage on a very basic and fundamental principle; that is, if Americans are going to work, they ought to be able to have a livable wage--they should not be in poverty. Men and women who want to work 40 hours a week 52 weeks a year and play by the rules ought to have a livable wage. That concept has been supported by Republicans and Democrats alike. 
All we are asking today is whether we are going to continue that basic, fundamental vote of fairness and justice in our country. That is the issue. It is as plain and simple as that. 
There are reasonable questions that we have to ask ourselves. The first is, What is going to be the impact on the state of our economy? 
We have the greatest economic growth and price stability in the history of the Nation. We have seen untold fortunes made during the period of the last 6 years, but not for those at the lower end of the economic ladder, not for those who are the minimum-wage workers. Their actual purchasing power has been reduced. It is surprising, most Americans think, that everyone has not moved up together. Many have moved up the economic ladder, but not those at the lower part of the economic ladder. 
All we are trying to do is to say to those hard-working Americans at a time when we have record unemployment, the lowest inflation that we have had at any time (except one of the seven times where we raised the minimum wage in the postwar period)--the lowest rate of inflation--that, given our economic situation, we can make sure and we can afford for those working Americans a livable wage for themselves and for the members of their family. That is the very simple issue. 
It is fair to look at what has happened with the last increases in the minimum wage to see what the impact has been of those increases on the rate of unemployment and the rate of inflation. 
We find, as I have demonstrated and put in the Record repeatedly, and will not take the time unless challenged on those issues here today, that effectively we have seen virtually no adverse impact in terms of our economy since the last two increases--absolutely none. The economy is stronger, and stronger than ever. We saw in 1997 more than 1,200,000 jobs created in the small business industry. 
We have heard from the restaurant association that since the last increase in the minimum wage their employment has grown by 240,000 jobs. They have not been disadvantaged. If you are looking at a growth industry, according to the Labor Department, it is in the restaurant industry. 
Mr. President, you can see what I have just stated reflected on this chart. This chart reflects clearly the fact that in constant dollars the minimum wage now is at one of its lower levels. Over the period from the mid 1950s, all the way through the mid-1980s, a 30-year period where we have Republican and Democratic Presidents alike, we have minimum wage and purchasing power that would be even above what this proposal is that is offered today: 50 cents next year, 50 cents the following year. Even if we have those two increases, we will still be below the 30-year average under Republicans and Democrats. 
That is all. We are not trying to say we are going to the highest level that we have ever had, even though we have the best economy. All we are saying is let us put them in the realm of the 30-year period for these working families in America. 
A great deal is said around here about the importance of work. These are working families trying to provide for their children. 
Who are these workers? 
These workers are child care workers and attendants. Beatrice Stanford of Wilmington, DE, is a low-wage grandmother who has worked at the YMCA Child Care Center for 4 years, earns $5.75 an hour, and is the sole supporter for her teenage son and daughter and two grandchildren. Beatrice's children have worked from time to time, but she now calls that her biggest mistake. Her daughter fell behind in school because of all the hours she was putting in at work. She needed summer school, but she couldn't afford the $300 for the course. Instead, she had to do a correspondence course that cost $164. She made up the course but lost a year. Beatrice finds it a struggle just to pay the rent. She can't afford a car, so she takes a bus to work and catches a ride to the supermarket. 
These are child care workers--the faces of those who are working for the minimum wage. Beatrice Stanford, a grandmother trying to provide for her children and not being able to make ends meet. 
Mr. President, there are other workers like Renda DeJohnette who provides home health care in Los Angeles. Child care workers, home health care workers, teachers' aides--these are all the people who make up the minimum wage. 
Renda DeJohnette provides home health care. Renda works in a county program to help senior citizens and the disabled to remain in their homes and avoid institutionalization. Renda is a single mother with two teenage children. She earns $5.75 an hour washing clothes, preparing meals, cleaning houses and finds it hard to make ends meet. A low minimum wage increase would allow her to put food on the table and pay all of her bills. 
The list goes on. 
There is Marcus Reynolds of Lynn, MA. To understand the minimum wage from both sides of the paycheck, for 20 years he earned the minimum wage cleaning offices, making beds in hotels, stocking shelves, and lifting heavy packages in stores. 
Often he worked two jobs, sometimes three. He says, `No matter how many jobs I worked, how little time I slept, the minimum wage was not enough to make ends meet. Even when I was basically just working and sleeping, providing for food and rent and transportation was more than a challenge. It was often a struggle.' Now he owns a very small sandwich shop. He pays his entry-level workers $6 an hour. He says, `I can't afford to pay them less.' He respects them as workers and as people, and as he puts it, `What kind of family value is it to pay someone supporting a family a wage that is below poverty?' 
Mr. President, these are the people we are talking about. We are talking about teacher's aides who are working with our children. We are talking about child care helpers. We see the turnover that is taking place in the Head Start Program, and we are all concerned about that because we know the importance of consistency of care in terms of looking after our children. 
One of the principal reasons for this turnover is that we are paying the child care assistants in these kinds of settings the minimum wage, and they just cannot make ends meet. We are talking about those health workers who are working with our parents to try to keep them at home, to help and assist them so they are not institutionalized. They are the helpers and assistants in the nursing homes looking after our parents. They are the people who take care of the buildings which house America's corporations, working long, hard hours at night. 
When we asked minimum wage workers what the impact was when they saw an increase in the minimum wage last time, the answer that so many of them gave was amazing: `You know, Senator, what the impact is going to be when we raise the minimum wage. We are only going to have to work two jobs instead of three.' Only two jobs instead of three. `We might get a chance to see our children more often. We might be able to go to teachers' meetings. We might be able to spend some time with our child helping with some homework.' 
That is the difference in terms of any kind of increase in the minimum wage. That is what we are talking about. That is what we are talking about at a time when we have the strongest economy in the history of this country and at a time when we have hard-working Americans who are prepared to do the work. 
How much time do I have remaining, Mr. President?

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this chart here says it: `The minimum wage is not a livable wage.' We are talking about a livable wage here in the United States of America. These are the average figures for a family. The monthly minimum wage budget includes what is necessary for a family of three. Food on the table, $348; housing, $582; transportation, $145; and what remains is $131. That does not include child care, where the national average in terms of one child would be $333 or health care where the average is $49 or clothing where the average is $63, which comes to $445. You have to squeeze three items, $445, into the remaining of $131. 
The question is, how many times is a parent going to serve peanut butter to a child in order to save the $10, $15 or $20 so they can look after health care needs? How many times are they not going to pay their utilities in order to be able to look after a child? This is what we are talking about--hard-working Americans who deserve a living wage. This issue is the same as the last 70 years when we have debated it in the Senate. But we have come together in decency and fairness at important times for working Americans. 
Finally, Mr. President, just last year we had an increase in our own minimum wage. Members of this body got $3,100. That is $1.50 an hour. That is the increase every Member of this Senate received--$1.50 an hour in 1 year. We are looking at child care workers, health care workers, teacher's aides getting 50 cents next year and 50 cents the following year. If it was fair enough for the Members of the Senate, it ought to be fair enough for those hard-working Americans who are trying to provide for their families. That is the issue--fundamental fairness to working Americans. Hopefully, we will be successful. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have had a good debate and discussion on this issue during the course of the morning. The opposition to an increase in the minimum wage raised a number of issues, which we anticipated and responded to. 
First of all, they say that there is going to be an increasing problem in terms of unemployment. We have demonstrated that we have the lowest unemployment since World War II. 
They argue that it is going to add to the problems of inflation. We have demonstrated that we have the lowest rates of inflation, and we have demonstrated a very substantial growth in terms of small business interests. 
I want to point out, since our friends, Senator Hatch and Senator Enzi, talked about the restaurant industry, that they have been prime opponents of any increase for the hardest working Americans, those at the lowest end of the economic ladder. I point out that in this industry in 1996, the average restaurant CEO grew in income by 8.6 percent. Their average bonus increased 13 percent. Their average value of stock options exploded by over 100 percent. Their average total compensation grew by 6 percent. 
These are some of the highest paid CEOs in this country who are making that high salary on the basis of low-wage workers. I might also add that of the 100 top CEOs in the restaurant industry, there is not one single woman--not one single woman. 
Mr. President, before we take all of the arguments by my friend from Utah where we have seen since 1996 a growth and an increase of 59,000 jobs--that was after the increase of the minimum wage in 1996 in October, and September 1997--one of the lowest unemployment rates in this country, I have a list of the statements that have been made by my friend from Oklahoma that he gave in the last debate: I don't think that they should do it in my State because they are going to put people out of work. 
That was said in 1996. Senator Hatch virtually said the same thing in 1996. The facts demonstrate to the contrary. 
Finally, Mr. President, I want to point this out. We have seen here what you can't get away from: that is, the decline in the purchasing power for low-income Americans. That is a fact. It is lower now than it has been for a period of 30 years. 
Republicans signed onto this program. President Eisenhower, President Nixon, President Bush--all Republicans--supported an increase in the minimum wage. Yet we hear from our Republican leadership that we can't possibly do it because it is going to destroy America. 
Mr. President, it is important to understand why this issue is so important to the religious community. We have 170 organizations, the principal leaders in the religious community, supporting an increase in the minimum wage because they understand it, whether it is the American Friends, Catholic Charities, the Episcopal Church, the Evangelical Church, the Lutheran Church, the American Council of Churches, U.S. Catholic Bishops, United States Church of Christ--they understand it. It is a moral issue for them--believing in the dignity of the individual. They ought to be able to have a decent living, that they are working in America to provide for their children. That is what the issue is. 
You can give us all the charts you want made up by the restaurant industry to distort what is really being debated on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
This is an issue involving women--sixty percent of the recipients are women. 
It is an issue involving children--the neediest and the poorest children in this country who are the sons and daughters of those minimum-wage workers. 
This is a civil rights issue--it is paying people the entry wage, a livable wage for those individuals who come from different backgrounds and tradition, and also the minorities in our country. 
This is basically the moral issue of our time--and when we have been at our best, we have responded to it, Republicans and Democrats alike. It is a fundamental issue that has been stated by my colleagues--Senators Wellstone, Harkin, Durbin, and others who have spoken on it. 
To sum up, it is whether the United States of America, with the most extraordinary economic prosperity in the history of our Nation, is going to say that our fellow citizens who work hard and who have children ought to have a livable wage. That is what the issue is about. The Republican leadership is saying no to those working families. 
We hope that we are going to have some support from the other side of the aisle because we believe that there are those who understand the importance of this issue to working families. There is no issue before this U.S. Senate that involves fairness and decency and equity like an increase in the minimum wage. This 
is it. Now is the time. 
I reserve the remainder of my time. 
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just again to underline the excellent point my friend from Iowa made, according to the U.S. Conference of Mayors study, in 1997 requests for emergency food aid increased 86 percent in the cities served--these are cities with Republican and Democratic mayors. Mr. President, 67 percent of the cities cited low-paying jobs as one of the main causes of hunger. Low-paying jobs are the most frequently cited causes of hunger. Nearly half of those relying on emergency food aid do so because their earnings are too low. In 1997, in Jeffersonville, IN, one-fourth of the families receiving emergency shelter were earning less than $6 an hour. 
This is about fairness to teachers' aides, to child care workers. It is a basic and fundamental issue with regard to health care workers as well. We are either going to respect our fellow citizens and give them this modest increase in the minimum wage, or we are not going to meet our responsibilities. 
Mr. President, has the time expired?

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Muriel Humphrey Brown was an outstanding woman, and all of us who knew her and had the opportunity to serve with her in the Senate mourn her loss today. The people of Minnesota have lost one of their finest public servants, and this country has lost one of its finest crusaders. 
Muriel was an outstanding campaigner for her husband, Hubert Humphrey, who was a great Senator himself, and a great Vice President too. Together, they made a extraordinary team. She was the soft-spoken, gentle, guiding force behind Hubert's mayoral, Senatorial, Vice Presidential and Presidential campaigns. In fact, Muriel changed the rules of Presidential campaigning by becoming one of the first wives to speak out by herself on the Presidential campaign trail. Muriel's eloquence and wisdom could still be heard in recent days, as she celebrated the victory of her son, Skip, in the primary last week in his campaign to became the next Governor of Minnesota. 
Muriel was an eloquent activist in her own right. She became the twelfth woman to serve in the U.S. Senate, when she was appointed in 1978 to complete the unexpired term of her husband. During her service in the Senate that year, Muriel's courage, wisdom, and ability enabled her to carry on the high ideals and important social programs of her husband. 
She was an able leader on issues important to women, and her vigorous support for legislation to extend the deadline for States to ratify the equal rights amendment was a major step forward for women's rights throughout the Nation. 
As a member of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, Muriel introduced civil service reform amendments to protect employees who provided information on illegal Government activities and mismanagement. Her proposals became the foundation for the well-known `whistleblower' protections that employees have today. 
Muriel also actively supported the passage of the Comprehensive Rehabilitation Amendments in 1978, which provided a wide range of new services for the handicapped and the retarded. Prior to her service in the Senate, she became a leading crusader for the disabled. 
She had served on a committee for mental retardation during the administration of President Johnson, and she encouraged many reforms to improve mental health and care for the mentally ill. 
And above all else, Muriel Humphrey was deeply committed to the enactment of the Humphrey-Hawkins full employment bill. Its goal was to do more to reduce unemployment in communities across the country, and the enactment of this legislation was a major accomplishment for Muriel and the entire Nation. 
In every respect, Muriel was a wonderful wife, mother, Senator and leader. She served the American people for 34 years as the wife of our distinguished colleague, Hubert Humphrey, and also in her own right as a highly respected Member of the Senate. She had a remarkable grasp of the issues and a genuine interest in helping others. She earned the respect and admiration of all of us who had the privilege to serve with her, and her spirit and courage and determination will be long remembered by the American people. 
My thoughts and prayers are with the Humphrey family. America has lost a unique leader, and the Kennedy family has lost a wonderful friend.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on another matter, on tomorrow we will have an opportunity to address the issue of an increase in the minimum wage for working Americans, at 2:15 p.m. Starting at 10:30 in the morning, the amendment will be before the U.S. Senate, and we will have that opportunity, with the time equally divided before the luncheon break, to make the case for the increase in the minimum wage for working Americans, those who are on the lower rung of the economic ladder. 
This afternoon, in the time which is available, I would like to anticipate and respond to a number of our colleagues who will raise questions about whether it is appropriate to increase the minimum wage at this time. 
Throughout the history of the minimum wage, our opponents have claimed that raising the minimum wage will add to the rate of inflation. Those who oppose fair increases in the wages for working families also claim that unemployment will increase among the workers in this country and, therefore, be counterproductive to the various people we are trying to help. 
We have raised it on five different occasions since the end of World War II. So it is fair enough for us to look back on the history of the increases in the minimum wage to find out if there is validity to those particular arguments. And, quite clearly, those arguments have to fail on their face. And I will have an opportunity briefly this afternoon and in a more detailed way to respond to these arguments on tomorrow. 
But a basic, fundamental point, Mr. President, that is at the heart of this whole issue is whether we in this country really honor work and whether we think that Americans who work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year ought to live in poverty, 
that they ought to live in poverty and that their children should live in poverty. 
As Americans, we have experienced the most extraordinary economic growth over the period of the last 6 years, with economic growth, price stability, low interest rates, low rates of inflation, declining unemployment. We are also experiencing the longest period of economic growth and price stability in the history of this Nation. 
I think we were reminded a week or so ago when we found out that the stock market went down some 300 points. People were saying we lost $1 trillion in terms of value, and then it bounced back the next day. We see these extraordinary fluctuations. We see the extraordinary creation of wealth in just about every population, except for the low-income, working families in this Nation. They have not been a part of the growth of economic prosperity. 
If we look at what happened in this country in the immediate post-war period, from 1948 into the late 1950s through the 1960s, and actually up to 1972. If we divided the economic incomes into what they call quintiles and divide by five, and look at the relative growth in terms of income over a 30-year period, in the post-war period where we had times of recession, inflation, a variety of economic shocks, we come to one very basic and fundamental conclusion. All of those quintiles went up, and went up together. There was merely a 5-point or 10-point percent difference between those at one level and those at another level. All Americans went up together. The rising tide raised all the boats. We did not have this period of economic growth and price stability. 
What has happened in the more recent times? In more recent times we have seen the enormous accumulation of wealth among the most fortunate individuals in this country and the wealthiest corporations and an actual decline in the purchasing power of the minimum wage workers. They have been the big losers. They haven't just been holding steady, they have lost in terms of purchasing power. 
We have an opportunity tomorrow to say whether this is fair, right here in the United States of America, among our fellow citizens who are working hard and trying to provide for their families and have hopes and dreams like every Member of this body. 
It is interesting that just this last year Members in the U.S. Senate accumulated, with our rate of inflation on our own salaries, the equivalent of more than $1.50 per hour in 1 year. Do we understand that? Every Member in this body this last year got an increase of more than $1.50 an hour. And they all effectively took it. 
We are talking about the men and women in this country who work as teachers' aides, in nursing homes, and who clean these facilities that we have here in buildings all across America. They are also child care workers or assistants to children. We are asking to provide these workers an increase of 50 cents in January and 50 cents the following year. 
We, in the Senate, have taken $1.50 for ourselves, and I didn't hear many voices in opposition to that. But we will hear a lot of opposition tomorrow about providing 50 cents for these hard-working Americans next year, and 50 cents the following year. We will hear opposition and we will have a vote here in the U.S. Senate. I will be frank and say it is still an uphill battle. We are continuing to make that case, and we are hopeful we will be successful. 
How can we possibly justify voting ourselves $1.50 more an hour, but not for the child care workers, not for the teacher assistants, not for those working in nursing homes and looking after our parents? Why? Because they will say they are worried about inflation and are worried about the impact of the increase of the minimum wage on our total economy--an $8 trillion total economy. Ten million Americans will get the equivalent of another $1, spread over a 2-year period. The proposed increases in the minimum wage would amount to a tiny fraction of our total economy. 
We are going to hear from some who will say we cannot afford it because it will be an inflator in terms of our economy. It wasn't an inflator when we had an increase for ourselves, but it will be an inflator if we are going to provide the increase for these working families. Many are working, single mothers who are trying to provide for their children. Sixty percent are women who have two or three jobs to try to provide for their families. 
We hear a lot on the floor of the U.S. Senate about family values. What about that mother who doesn't have the time to spend with that child on their homework or doesn't have the time to take that child for a walk in the park on a Sunday because they have to go to another job? When that child asks to go to a birthday party, and the mother says, `You can't because we can't afford a present,' what about those family values? What about those family values? 
Raising the minimum wage is a fundamental issue of fairness. Are we going to honor work? Are we going to say to our fellow citizens that we, as a nation, have enough sense of common purpose and direction that we believe that many of our neighbors who may not have the kind of training or the education, may have had a life that has been challenging and difficult, may be struggling to try to provide for their families, are not even going to be able to be lifted out of poverty? 
We have seen the greatest accumulation of wealth in the history of this Nation, and we have seen the greatest growth of disparity between the most affluent and those who are the neediest workers in our country, and we have seen this disparity grow to be greater than it has ever been in the history of this Nation. This is a very, very small step to try to do a little something about it. In past years, raising the minimum wage has been a bipartisan effort. 
This chart reflects basically the points I have been making in the past few moments. This chart shows about where the minimum wage was, in real, constant dollars, from 1955-1998 and beyond, to the year 2000. In 1955, we got the increase in the minimum wage. It went to almost $6. For the period of the late 1950s, to the 1960s, the 1970s, beginning into the early 1980s, in all that period of time, for some 30 years, the purchasing power for the minimum wage was far above what it would be if we were able to pass the legislation tomorrow to increase the minimum wage by 50 cents next year and 50 cents the following year. 
All we are trying to do is get to the bottom, not to the top, of what it would be--$7.38 in purchasing power. We are trying to just get into the zone. We will still be at the lowest for a period of 30 years, at a time of economic prosperity. These increases that have taken place since 1955 have had Republican and Democratic support. It didn't used to be a partisan issue. But we are just trying to get there. 
We have to ask, Is that so unreasonable, Mr. President? Look what happens if we are not successful. If we are not successful in getting the increase in the minimum wage, the purchasing power of the minimum wage, drops back to $4.82 an hour. By 2000, it drops back to $4.82. We are just trying to get the minimum wage up to $6.15. Even by 2000, it will only be worth $5.76. It will still be well below what the purchasing power has been in here, Mr. President. 
This is an extremely modest bill. This gives you the history on this chart. These are working families and individuals, who will and can work, who play by the rules, go out to earn a modest living every single day. If these workers miss a paycheck, they miss paying the utilities. If they miss a paycheck, they can't afford to provide for the kind of attention to meet health care for a child. If they miss a paycheck, there is no opportunity to provide for children. Nor can they give them a night out at the movies. That is how close this figure is, Mr. President. 
Do you know what this $1 increase represents, Mr. President? That $1 increase, most of all, means dignity to these workers. That is our No. 1 reason. These workers can free themselves from the reliance on support programs. It gives them a sense of dignity. That is important. We spend a great deal of time around here adding and subtracting and looking at balances. Once in a while, we ought to look at what the real impact is in terms of human quality. It is dignity. It is the fact that men and women can look at their families and know that they have a job that offers them an opportunity to live with some dignity. That is what this is really about. 
But look at what this $1 represents. Some people might say, well, that is not an awful lot. It certainly is for these families. It represents about 6 months of groceries for a family. It represents about 7 months of rent, on average, for a family. It represents two-thirds of the tuition for a community college so that one of their children can go on to a community college. That is the kind of hope and opportunity it means for these families. It is a big deal. It is important. We talk about a billion dollars here and a billion dollars being real money. But this 50 cents and 50 cents--another dollar, over the period of 2 years--is a lot of money for working families. 
So, Mr. President, the other issue I will mention very briefly here is whether this adds to the rate of inflation. Mr. President, I want to address these two issues very quickly; that is, what the impact of the increase in the minimum wage is on inflation. 
Raising the minimum wage does not fuel inflation. It says on the top of this chart, right here, going back to 1996, in January of 1996 we have three-tenths of 1 percent. This is the inflation rate increase per month during this period of time. It is three-tenths of 1 percent. It dropped here. Then it went up. But, generally speaking, for a period before 9 months, it was three-tenths of 1 percent. It increased it to $4.75. 
Look at what happens to the rate of inflation. It drops back and drops, and it settles on in here. Instead of three-tenths per month, it drops down to two-tenths per month. Then we increase it to $5.15, and down it goes again, and then up, and then down again. This spans from January of 1996 through June of 1998. That is a pretty clear indication that the two last increases, with the rate of inflation, when we didn't have as favorable an economy as we do today--that effectively there has been no impact on the rate of inflation. 
If we look at what the impact of the minimum wage has been on the unemployment rate, again, this chart here represents--these are Bureau of Labor statistics and they are authenticated. If you look back in October of 1996, what the rate of unemployment was, it was just above 5 percent--about 5.2 percent. We saw the increase in the minimum wage and a little blip here, and then we see how it has declined, below 5 percent. It was increased to $5.15, and the chart settles in now to about 5.5 percent. I think, if we look at the most recent figures, it is down to 4.3 percent. 
So the two major arguments have been that it adds to the unemployment rate and it adds to the inflation rate. 
The final point I will make, since this is an argument that is raised most recently, as well--maybe it doesn't add to inflation, but let's look at this. The minimum wage doesn't harm small business, it says on this chart. This is a Jerome Levy Economic Institute 1998 survey of 568 small businesses. `Did the recent increase in minimum wage affect hiring or unemployment decisions?' Mr. President, 6.2 percent said yes, 79 percent said no. `Would raising the minimum wage cause you to lay off or hire workers?' Three percent said yes, 93 percent said no. They have a longer study which basically supports this. 
We have had the Restaurant Association that has talked about how this was going to be `devastating.' But they have increased their employment by 230,000 restaurant workers over this period, although they had predicted an absolute disaster in terms of the restaurant business. That is done by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. So it is important that we try to put this into some kind of perspective. 
The basic issue in question is: Are we going to be fair to working Americans? Do we believe that these Americans who are at the lower level of the economic ladder should be able to participate, to some degree, in terms of economic prosperity? Tomorrow, we will have an opportunity to answer that question. I hope that the Senate will vote in favor of providing it. 
I thank the Chair and I thank the Senator from Iowa.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose this legislation, and I urge the Senate to sustain the President's veto. 
In my view, this legislation is unconstitutional under the Supreme Court's decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and President Clinton was right to veto it. The Roe and Casey decisions prohibit the government from imposing an `undue burden' on a woman's constitutional right to choose to have an abortion at any time up to the point where the developing fetus reaches the stage of viability. The government can constitutionally limit abortions after the stage of viability, as long as the limitations contain exceptions to protect the life and the health of the woman. 
This bill fails that constitutional test. In cases before viability, it clearly imposes an undue burden on a woman's constitutional right to an abortion. In cases after viability, it clearly does not contain the constitutionally required exception to protect the mother's health. 
Supporters of this legislation are flagrantly defying these constitutional requirements. In the vast majority of states that have passed so-called partial-birth abortion bans, the law is on appeal, enjoined, or the subject of a restraining order. With only one exception, where the laws have been challenged, the courts have concluded that these bans are unconstitutional. 
The conclusion is obvious. The supporters of this unconstitutional legislation would rather have an issue than a bill. President Clinton vetoed this legislation on October 10, 1997. Almost an entire year has passed since that veto. If the Senate Republican leadership genuinely cared about preventing these abortions, they would have brought this veto before the Senate long ago. Instead, they delayed and delayed and delayed. And now, surprise! The Senate is finally being asked to vote on this veto a few weeks before election day. They want an issue, not a bill. 
In her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Coreen Costello put this issue clearly. After consulting numerous medical experts and doing everything possible to save her child, Coreen Costello had the procedure that would be banned by this legislation. Based on that experience, she said this to our committee: 
I hope you can put aside your political differences, your positions on abortion, and your party affiliations and just try to remember us. We are the ones who know. We are the families that ache to hold our babies, to love them, to nurture them. We are the families who will forever have a hole in our hearts. We are the families that had to choose how our babies would die . . . please put a stop to this terrible bill. Families like mine are counting on you. 
I want the Senate to sustain the President's veto.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator D'Amato's amendment to ban ATM surcharge fees. 
This is good policy, and we all ought to vote in favor of it. 
These fees, which in some instances have reached exorbitant levels like $5 or $10 per transaction, are charged against consumers to access their own money. 
The large bank networks, which typically operate the automatic teller machines, already charge a transaction fee to smaller banks for the use of their network. 
These surcharges are a second charge, directly to the consumer, for the privilege of using the machine. 
Some have argued that consumer behavior has changed, so that consumers can learn how to minimize surcharges. They can do this by getting cash back on debit card purchases, or by taking more money out at one time. 
But these are the savvy consumers, or those who are able to take out a large amount of money at one time. The consumers who end up paying these fees are those who have the fewest options: their money is tighter, or they are in an emergency situation, or they don't understand the system enough to avoid these fees. Do we want to protect the rights of the banks to take advantage of those consumers? 
The banks now charge the consumer at every turn. They first said that tellers were too expensive and encouraged us to use machines. Now they charge both the consumer, and the consumer's bank, for the privilege of using the ATM machine. 
This gouging of the consumer has to stop! 
Some have argued that we should allow banks to police themselves on this issue. In my home state of Massachusetts, for example, the Massachusetts Bankers Association has worked to organize fee free alliances between big and small banks so that consumers can use machines statewide and avoid surcharges. This is a terrific program, and I compliment the MBA for developing it. 
Truly progressive organizations, like Fleet Bank which operates throughout New England, have agreed not to charge fees for ATM use in low and moderate income communities. This is progressive corporate policy, and I salute them for it. 
These financial institutions can be a model for the nation. 
Unfortunately, there are not enough banks like those in my home state. 
And so we must pass this amendment. We have heard from consumers, and they have had enough. 
I know banks have heard from their customers in response to these charges. They have complained about it, loud and clear. 
If banks had been proactive and responded by policing themselves, we would not be compelled to pursue an amendment such as this. 
These exorbitant charges are an outrage! The Senate must act to protect the consumer from excessive charges. 
In a time in which we are debating bankruptcy legislation, which has been supported strongly by banks and credit card companies, we also need to enact some provisions which will help the working men and women of this country. 
We must end the gouging of the American consumer! I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting Senator D'Amato's amendment.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the proposals by House Republican leaders to spend a major portion of the projected budget surplus on tax cuts for the wealthiest citizens gives new meaning to the word `irresponsible.' Any such cut would rob Social Security recipients of the retirement benefits they have earned and deserve. Yet the House Republicans want to spend this `surplus' before it even materializes, in an election eve vote-buying scheme of massive proportions. Every Senator on both sides of the aisle who is serious about preserving Social Security for future generations has a duty to reject these outrageous proposals. 
Before we spend it, wouldn't it be wise to at least ask where this projected surplus comes from? The answer is clear--and shocking in its meaning. Ninety-eight percent of the ten-year surplus projected by the Congressional Budget Office comes from the Social Security Trust Fund. The issue is not whether we should use the surplus to `save Social Security,' the surplus is Social Security. Using those dollars to pay for anything other than retirement benefits for future Social Security recipients would be an act of political grand larceny. The victims would be those hard-working men and women who are counting on Social Security to protect them in their retirement years. 
The term `surplus,' as it is used in the budget debate, means only that the total amount of revenue received by the Federal Government in a particular year exceeds the total amount that the government will spend in that year. In the current fiscal year, for the first time since 1969, the Federal Government will take in more dollars than it spends. But this so-called `surplus' does not take into consideration any future financial obligations of the Government, such as the obligation to pay Social Security benefits to retirees in the future. The surplus is not extra money which Congress can spend on any worthy cause. It is money which must be set aside to pay those future obligations. 
The overall surplus is equal to the surplus in the Social Security Trust Fund minus the deficit in the rest of the government. When Social Security reserves are removed from the calculation, the surpluses over the next seven years evaporate. Budget deficits continue through fiscal year 2001, followed by four years of roughly balanced non-Social Security budgets. Not until 2006 does any meaningful surplus appear without counting Social Security reserves. 
The Congressional Budget Office has projected a surplus of $1.55 trillion over the next ten years. Of that amount, $1.52 trillion--98%--is Social Security reserves, which consist of the payroll tax payments made by employees and employers during the next decade and interest earned on Social Security Trust Fund during that period. 
Every one of those dollars will be needed to honor our commitment to future retirees. Only $31 billion of the ten year projected surplus--an average of $3 billion a year--is not already committed to meeting future Social Security obligations, and that amount could easily disappear with only a slight shift in the economy. 
A $520 billion surplus is projected over the next five years, and it is composed entirely of Social Security reserves. In fact, if Social Security reserves are not included, there would actually be a deficit of $137 billion during this period. There is no surplus for Congress to spend over the next five years--none at all. 
Despite these facts, House Republican leaders repeatedly call for using a major portion of this so-called surplus for tax cuts. Originally, they proposed that half the surplus--over $700 billion--be spent on tax cuts. These Republicans had the gall to brag that they would devote the other half to Social Security. Majority Leader Dick Armey boasted that this is `a big, big step in the direction of saving Social Security.' Nonsense. Congressman Armey's suggestion is the equivalent of a banker embezzling half the money he was entrusted with, and boasting that he did not steal it all. 
Now we hear from Speaker Gingrich that House Republicans will only seek a tax cut of $70 to $80 billion this year, but intend to pass a much larger one next spring. He acknowledged that `virtually all of it' would be paid for with dollars taken from the surplus. The intent of these Republican schemes is clear--it is to rob Social Security in order to pay for tax cuts going disproportionately to the wealthiest citizens. 
Whether the Republicans take one giant bite, or several smaller ones, out of the surplus, the result will be the same--a dramatic weakening of Social Security. The entire $1.52 trillion belongs to the Social Security Trust Fund. It is being raised to pay for retirement benefits--and any diversion of any portion of those funds is wrong. 
Congressman Kasich, the House Budget Chairman, offered an interesting variation on this Republican theme. He has suggested that the interest earned on reserves in the Social Security Trust Fund does not belong to Social Security, and should be used to finance tax cuts. That too is absurd. `I only stole the interest' is hardly a legitimate defense for a person charged with embezzlement. 
The interest earned on the reserves is clearly part of the Social Security Trust Fund, just as interest earned by a private citizen's bank account is part of that account and part of the citizen's income. All of the reports issued by the Social Security actuaries on the state of Social Security finances reflect these interest earnings. Pension funds, bank accounts, and other assets earn interest, and so does the Social Security Trust Fund. Using the interest earned on the Social Security Trust Funds to finance tax cuts would consume hundreds of billions of dollars that otherwise will be used to help restore the financial integrity of Social Security over the long term. If the interest earnings are removed from the trust fund, Social Security's financial problems would become much greater. 
If Social Security reserves are not available for the Trust Fund in the future because they have been used to pay for tax cuts, then it is clear that benefit cuts or large payroll tax increases will be inevitable for Social Security. What we call the `surplus' is actually dollars raised expressly for the purpose of paying Social Security benefits to the men and women of the baby boom generation when they retire. Every dollar which we divert today to finance irresponsible tax cut schemes will only expand the gap between the future retirement benefits owed by Social Security and the resources available to meet those obligations. 
Social Security is fundamentally sound. Unless Congress makes the current problems worse, harsh benefit cuts will not be necessary to insure its long-term solvency. It is essential that the current benefit structure be preserved. For two-thirds of our senior citizens, Social Security benefits represent more than half of their annual income. Social Security has dramatically reduced the poverty rate among older Americans. We cannot allow that guaranteed benefit to be undermined. No action by Congress would threaten those benefits more than recklessly spending a large portion of the Social Security Trust Fund for irresponsible tax cuts. 
The surplus belongs to Social Security--all $1.5 trillion of it. We are not free to spend it for other purposes. The Republican assault on Social Security is unconscionable. We must preserve it for future generations, not spend it recklessly on tax cuts now.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to notify me when 4 1/2 minutes have passed. 
Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the National Endowment for the Arts and full funding for the agency as provided in the Appropriations Committee bill. 
I commend the committee for its continuing strong support for this important agency. I commend Senator Gorton, Senator Byrd, and many other members of the committee who have demonstrated impressive leadership on this issue, and essential funds are being provided to support Endowment programs in vital areas such as music, dance, visual arts, theater, opera and arts education. 
For nearly a decade, Congress has debated the proper role of the Federal Government on the arts. Each year, a small group of Endowment bashers have led a charge against the agency--and each year the charge has effectively been turned back. 
The funds provided in the current bill are the same amount approved by the Senate last year after lengthy debate and deliberation. The bill also includes the priorities and limitations on these funds from last year to ensure the effect of distribution of funds to neighborhoods and communities across the country. 
The arts have a central and indispensable role in the life of America. The Arts Endowment contributes immensely to that life. It encourages the growth and development of the arts in communities throughout the nation, giving new emphasis and vitality to American creativity and scholarship and to the cultural achievements that are among America's greatest strengths. 
Compelling research underscores the role of the arts in student performance in other academic subjects as well. A recent study by the College Board demonstrated a direct correlation between study of the arts and achievement on SAT scores. Students who had four or more years of arts courses scored 59 points higher on the verbal part of the SAT test and 44 points higher on the math part--compared to students with no equivalent courses in the arts. 
If you were to, on the Senate floor, give us one indicator that can make a difference in enhancing the academic achievement and accomplishment of the young people in this country, the arts and the study of the arts has a record which is really second to none, let alone the value that it has in terms of enriching our culture and our history and the history of this Nation. 
The arts are also an important part of the economic base of communities across the country. A study by the New England Foundation for the Arts emphasizes the economic impact. In 1995, cultural organizations in the region had a total economic impact of nearly $4 billion. During that time, over 99,000,000 people attended events and performances sponsored by cultural organizations. That number is nearly 8 times the entire population of New England. Clearly, programs in theater, music and art are significant community assets for both residents and tourists. 
That benefit is one of the reasons why the United States Conference of Mayors strongly supports adequate funding for the arts and humanities. At their meeting last June in Reno, NV, the Conference adopted a resolution reaffirming its support of the Arts and Humanities Endowments and calling upon Congress to fund the agencies at the level of the President's fiscal year 1999 request. Although the bill we are debating today does not reach that amount, the level of funding is reasonable in light of the many other pressures in the budget, and I hope we can join in a bipartisan effort to enact it. 
Bill Ivey, the new chairman of the Arts Endowment has pledged to comply fully with the new regulations on oversight and outreach established by Congress last year. In an effort to reach out to new communities, the Endowment has developed a new pilot project, ArtsREACH, to help states that have received five or fewer grants during the previous two years. This new effort is a productive way to bring the Endowment's programs to new audiences in small neighborhoods across the country, and I commend Chairman Ivey for his leadership. 
Mr. President, I remember the wonderful lines of President Kennedy when he talked about the age of Phidias also being the age of Pericles, and the age of de Medici is also the age of Leonardo da Vinci, and the age of Elizabeth is the age of Shakespeare. The point is that at the time when we have had the greatest intellectual achievement and the most creative aspects of civilization, going back to the time of the Greek civilization, we have also had ennobling periods in terms of the values of our own society and our own history and our own forms of government. 
Mr. President, this is a modest proposal. It used to be that we allocated the equivalent of two stamps for every American, in terms of the arts. Now the reduction is down to one stamp. In this great Nation of ours, it seems to me that we can allocate those resources in ways that will help and assist, preserve, support, and further the arts in our society. I hope the amendment of the Senator is not accepted.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
First, let's remind ourselves of what this legislation is all about. Its purpose is to say to American workers who are qualified for a job that they will be denied employment if they have an intent to try to organize co-workers in nonworking areas and during nonworking hours. 
Very clearly, you can't have it both ways. You can't say we are really not trying to overturn the Town and Country case. All you have to do is look at what the testimony was before our committee. Every single person who supports this bill wants to reverse that case. 
Second is the idea that these workers are going in to destroy the company. What good does it do to organize if they are there to destroy it? That makes no sense. The claim makes no sense. 
Mr. President, it is very clear what the court holdings are. First of all, if a company doesn't want to hire individuals who are paid by a union to organize the workforce, which has been a protected right for over 60 years, all the company has to do is set a blanket rule barring all other employment. That solves the problem--do it for those who are paid by the union, and for those who are going to be moonlighting. That solves the problem. We don't need legislation, Mr. President--they can do that today. 
Mr. President, the court decisions also make plain that you can fire any employee who neglects their duties. If workers are disruptive on the jobsite, current law allows them to be fired. 
Supporters claim that these workers won't do their jobs, but instead will file phony charges with government agencies. But the law allows companies to recover attorney's fees if an unjustified charge is pursued. 
Mr. President, we have to look at what is the issue. The issue is fundamental. It is whether we in this country are going to permit workers who have the ability to do the job, and who are performing their job--whether we are going to muzzle them, to blacklist them and say under no circumstances can they go out there and try to persuade workers to join a union. 
If the company finds out that they are going to be organizing a union, they can go ahead and fire them. That is what this language says--go out there and fire them right away. 
Mr. President, this applies not just to those individuals who hold an employment status with a union, but those who hold an `agency status.' What in the world does that mean? I will tell you what it means. That means, for example, of the 100 top CEOs in the restaurant industry, there isn't a single woman--not one, not a single woman. Do you understand that--in the restaurant industry, of the top 100 CEOs, none is a woman? So workers go in and say, `We want to break the glass ceiling in the restaurant industry.' Under this bill, the employer can say `Oh, no. Oh, no. You have another thought in mind. You may need this job. You may want this job. You may do it very well. But if you intend to try to do something about equal pay for women, try to do something about a child care program, try to do something to break the glass ceiling, oh, no. Oh, no.' These workers can be fired by the employer as well. 
This is a continuation of the effort that we have seen in the last 3 years to attack working families' income, and the rights of working families to represent themselves and try to persuade individuals to be part of their union. If they don't choose to be, so be it. If they do choose to be, so be it as well. But you are denying them that opportunity to choose. 
Mr. President, we have to ask ourselves now on a Monday night why we are debating this particular issue when we have a Patients' Bill of Rights ready to go. We could be debating those issues which are of such basic, fundamental importance and significance to families in this country. 
I withhold the rest of my time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we hope that this motion for cloture will not be passed. This is a very fundamental issue; that is, whether we are going to permit employers to get into the minds of potential employees who are qualified to do the job. If applicants are not qualified to do the job, they are not hired. It is not necessary to hire them. 
This legislation permits any employer to say to any worker who comes into the shop, who is interested in trying to describe the benefits of a union, whether it be higher wages or child care facilities--to be able to say, `No, we are not going to hire you.' You know what is going to happen then. It is a decision that will be made by the employer. That decision then goes to the NLRB. Three years go by, and then the case comes to trial. What was in the mind of that particular employee? There is not any evidence of disruptive activities. The law gives employers many ways to police those. The fact of the matter is, the workers are trying to convince other workers to join the union, and not be disruptive--to demonstrate that there is a better opportunity for them by working through the company rather than being disruptive. 
That is why we have scores of letters to indicate that this is something that is constructive and productive. This involves a very basic and fundamental issue, and that is whether, in our country, which has benefited so much from the development of collective bargaining, we are going to deny workers the chance to be able to gather together to represent their interests to improve the lives of their families. 
Mr. President, I oppose this legislation and I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture on this motion.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are reaching the last few weeks of this session of the Congress, and I think it is appropriate to give some consideration to the positions of the Republican leadership on the many issues that affect working families, because we will consider one of these issues later in the afternoon and another tomorrow when the Senate is going to be debating and also voting on the increase in the minimum wage. 
I think it is appropriate that we look over what has been the Republican leadership position on issue after issue that affects working families in this country over the period of these last few years. There you will find a wholesale assault on the interests and the rights and the economic conditions and wages of working Americans. 
I can remember 3 and one-half years ago, just after the Republicans gained leadership positions in the Senate, one of the first proposals offered was the repeal of the Davis-Bacon Act. I can remember being in this Chamber and asking my colleagues what is it about the Davis-Bacon Act that they object to. Well, they talked about the inflation it adds to construction projects. The average income for a construction worker in the United States of America is just over $30,500. What is it that is so outrageous for a worker involved in construction--construction, the second most dangerous industry--to make $30,500? Why is that such a dramatic concern to the leadership of the Republican Party? We find it time in and time out--let us eliminate Davis-Bacon to make sure that we do not give government contractors the opportunity to inflate wages of workers in this country. 
Nonetheless, we took a number of days on that particular issue. I was wondering why it was, with all the problems we were facing at that particular time, our Republican friends wanted to take away some very important income for working families. 
And then we had introduced an increase in the minimum wage--at that time it was $4.35 an hour--for the working poor--men and women who work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, who want to be able to bring up their children with some kind of respect, but who are living in poverty. Most Americans believe that those who want to work and can work, who believe in work, who are prepared to show up for work and play by the rules, ought to be able to have a livable wage. 
We will have an opportunity to address that issue again tomorrow. We have the most extraordinary prosperity in the history of the nation, with the lowest unemployment and the lowest inflation. But still the Republicans say no to that, no to the wages of working families who are involved in construction, no 2 years ago to any increase in the minimum wage, and then finally, finally, finally, finally, they acceded to a modest increase in the minimum wage. And now we have the issue before us again. We know that the purchasing power of working families has been at its lowest, has deteriorated the greatest, and the highest income Americans have seen their incomes increase. 
In the immediate postwar period, all Americans went up together. The rising tide raised all the boats--low income and upper income Americans increased at about the same rate. But now, according to the Republican leadership, they want to see a decline in the wages of working families by repealing Davis-Bacon. They don't want to see any increase for working families in a minimum wage. 
And then I remember, as we went on into last session, the assault on the earned-income tax credit. Increasing the minimum wage helps working people, whatever the size of their family. But the earned income tax credit helps low wage workers if they have one or more children. The more children you have, the greater the benefit to you from the earned-income tax credit. 
But we had the Republican leadership not only condemning the income of construction workers under the Davis-Bacon Act, but saying no to any increase in the minimum wage. And for those Americans with large families who earn less than $31,000, we saw the wholesale Republican assault on those families by cutting the earned-income tax credit. I believe their particular proposal was $9 billion. 
Now, we went on for 6 or 8 months, and I asked, what is this all about? Why are we having this wholesale assault on working families at the same time we saw the assault on Medicare and Social Security, to take over $256 billion and give tax breaks to the wealthiest individuals. 
Well, Mr. President, this assault that we had from the Republican leadership in the last session of Congress has continued, and it continues today. We have seen serious efforts to undermine the occupational health and safety legislation. Who does that protect? Legislation that had bipartisan support in 1972 that has seen the total number of deaths in the United States from on-the-job work cut in half. But we see our Republican friends saying we want to cut back on OSHA protections. 
We say, all right, maybe it ought to be streamlined; maybe it ought to be more effective. What can we do to provide additional protection for workers? The GOP says, oh, no, we want more protection for the companies, and less protection for the workers. The Republicans want to permit companies to hire their own inspectors, and if their own inspectors say they pass muster, they want them to be immune from any kind of enforcement by OSHA. 
The Republican agenda includes undermining their income, undermining the safety of working families--this is their agenda. 
We say maybe it really is not so. Let's give the Republicans an opportunity to prove that they really do care about working families. Let's try to see what we can do with family and medical leave. We are the only industrial nation that does not provide paid family and medical leave that pays the workers. We provided it for companies with over 50 employees, and it has been a resounding success. It has been a resounding success, and enormously important, as we have seen from the studies that show the importance of parents being with infants during their early days. 
We heard the debate. It went on for weeks with the opposition of Republicans on the Family and Medical Leave Act. Now it is in effect. It is broadly accepted, welcomed, and the people who benefited from it have been working families. 
Efforts were brought up not long ago, a little over a year ago: Let's try to extend it from companies that have 50 or more workers to those with over 25 and pick up another 13 million working families. We cover about half of the workforce now with the 50 or more, but let's bring it down so we pick up another 13 million Americans. If it works for one, let's try it for the other. 
You would think the world would collapse when we listened to the Republican leadership saying `no way are we going to consider extension of the Family and Medical Leave. No way are we going to extend that concept.' 
We hear a great deal on the floor of the U.S. Senate about families and family values. One of the best ways of advancing family values is to let working people have family income. Let them spend some time with their families when they are working. Let them be safe so they can go home to their families, and not lose their lives in construction or be maimed in construction. That is a family value. 
Now we had the wonderful amendment of Senator Murray of the State of Washington. She said, `Let's just give parents 24 hours--24 hours so that parent might be able to go to a parent meeting, maybe be able to go to an academic program in which a child is involved. Let us give 24 hours a year of unpaid leave so parents can see their child receive an award at school.' 
`No, no, no,' said our Republican friends, `we can't possibly do that. We can't possibly do that. That will interrupt the workplace. That will disrupt the workforce. We will give you something else.' 
They came back with a wonderful proposal--what they call `comp time.' `No,' to Senator Murray, the Senator from Washington, who was trying to do something for families. They come back with what they call comp time. They use all the appealing rhetoric. They claim they will give people the time they need to take off to attend to family needs. But, you know, Mr. President, we went through that debate. One thing that those proponents would never be able to answer is that little part of the legislation that I read time in and time out that said it will be up to the employer when they will be able to get the comp time. In the meantime, we are going to abolish the 40-hour week and we are not going to pay overtime. A wonderful deal for workers. A wonderful deal for workers. 
Who do you think supported that? It is always interesting to me when we have these wonderful statements of people who propose things, to then look at who benefits and who loses. Who do you think supported the Republican proposal on comp time? The Chamber of Commerce, all the business interests. Who opposed it? Working families, women's organizations and children's groups, because they saw it was phony and they saw it was fraudulent. 
So on it goes. Here we have the assault on the economic interests of working families, the assault on OSHA, the assault on our efforts to extend Family and Medical Leave, and many more. 
Another example is campaign finance reform. We talked about it. It has been effectively defeated in the U.S. Senate because of Republican leadership. Eight courageous Republicans, eight of them, were willing to stand up and try to advance campaign finance reform. 
The first amendment that our Republican friends offered, before they sunk campaign finance reform, was what they call the paycheck protection provision. That sounds like a good one. On whom do you think it was focused? On whom do you think that paycheck protection was focused? Can you guess? Working families. Working families, to deny them the opportunity to participate effectively in our political process. That is just a continuation of the assault on working families. It is meant to deny them the most fundamental and basic opportunity--to participate in the election process. 
The No. 1 amendment was to deny people their rights. Our agenda was different. Our agenda seeks to expand safety and health protection in the workplace. We want to expand family and medical leave, invest in education, strengthen Medicare for our elderly, try to do something for Social Security--that is our agenda. I know it. 
I yield to no one in sponsoring those proposals because they make an important difference to children, to workers and to our parents. I also support other proposals to make sure our streets are safe and our air water is clean. But we spent weeks on their so-called Paycheck Protection Act, not to change the system to try to deal with the abuses--but to deny working families the right to participate in the political process. 
It was not much later that the GOP brought up the TEAM Act. That bill goes under the guise of giving workers a chance to work together in order to get a safer workplace and better productivity. All of those goals can be advanced now, under current law. I do not think any of those who supported the TEAM Act can compare the kind of increased productivity we have seen with General Electric, for example, in modernizing their jet engines, that has been done with workers and engineers working together. 
I can take you up to the plant in Lynn, Massachusetts. Every time I tour that plant, I see the incredible increase in productivity, because workers are working there alongside engineers to increase productivity and increase safety. But the TEAM Act does something else. What was that? That bill would have permitted any CEO to choose employees' representatives, so that the CEO could bargain with the named employees about any of the issues about which other workers might be concerned. 
How do we like that? Generally speaking, we would think that the workers themselves ought to be able to make a decision among themselves who ought to represent the group. That is a basic, fundamentally democratic concept. But no, no, not according to the Republican leadership. 
Under the TEAM Act, the employee names the representatives, and if the employer doesn't like the person, he can fire the person. The employer sets the agenda and the schedule. The employer sets what will be on the schedule. The employer can change the schedule any time he or she wants to do it. Mr. President, that is under the guise of trying to change and be more productive. It basically would have undermined the opportunity for worker expression that has worked effectively over some 60 years of collective bargaining. 
So, Mr. President, now we are in the final days of this session, and suddenly we come up here with other legislation which is focused on undermining the opportunity for workers to organize. Surprise, surprise, surprise. Absolutely no surprise. Absolutely no surprise. 
There has been a continuous effort over the last several years to undermine working families' interests in this country. It is as plain and simple as that. The Republicans have tried all different ways of doing it. They tried to undermine them economically. They tried to undermine their health and their safety in their OSHA recommendations. They tried to undermine their ability to participate in elections with their paycheck protection, and here they are trying to undermine their basic and fundamental opportunity to organize. 
They have come in the last few days to try to overturn a unanimous Supreme Court decision--unanimous. It wasn't a decision that was 5-4, it was unanimous. Why? Because Republican appointees to the Supreme Court--conservative Republican appointees to the Supreme Court--understand very clearly what this kind of antisalting legislation will mean, and that is, basically, it will undermine one of the most basic and fundamental tenets of American and industrial democracy, and that is the ability to have collective bargaining and to have opportunities for workers to make a judgment either to choose a union or to reject it. That is where we are. We will have that particular vote this evening, and then we will go to the minimum wage issue tomorrow. We will have an opportunity to do that, Mr. President. 
I won't even bother taking the time, because I want to address more specifically the legislation that is before us, but I just mention that under the Republican House leadership, they effectively eliminated every summer job for kids in this country--zeroed out the summer jobs program. Zero funding. It isn't just the workers, it is the teenagers in urban and rural areas. 
I hope we will not hear tomorrow during the debate on the minimum wage, `Well, this is an entry-level job; we want to give teenagers an opportunity to work, and if we have an increase in the minimum wage, we are going to deny all those teenagers an opportunity to work.' It won't stand up. We will give them the reports, show them the charts and the various economic analyses that show their argument is just baloney. 
How are they going to explain that they zeroed out every single cent for summer jobs for teenagers in the House of Representatives? Zero. They say they care about workers? They claim they care about teenagers? The summer jobs program gives them an opportunity to have meaningful work, and they zeroed it out. 
Mr. President, this was just a very brief comment about where we find ourselves, about who is really interested in working families, and what the Republican leadership has been about over the past three and a half years. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the so-called Truth in Employment Act, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it, too. This bill is the latest in a long series of Republican antilabor, antiunion, antiworker initiatives. They have soothing titles and harsh provisions. The GOP's Family Friendly Workplace Act would abolish the 40-hour week. The GOP's Paycheck Protection Act would lock American workers out of election campaigns. The GOP TEAM Act would bring back company-dominated sham unions. Like those schemes, the GOP Truth in Employment Act has an appealing title and appalling substance. 
The bill's sponsors claim that it is designed to outlaw salting, a decades-old practice of people seeking a job at a nonunion shop with the intention of persuading coworkers to join the union. 
Salting was unanimously upheld by the Supreme Court in the 1995 Town & Country decision. But this bill does much more than simply reverse that decision. It undermines the rights of workers to organize to improve their jobs and also infringes on a wide array of other legitimate activities that are important to all Americans. These activities include efforts to improve the status of women and minorities in employment, strengthen safety in the workplace, and many, many more. 
The bill aims at labor unions, but it also hits many other important rights. This bill allows employers to deny jobs to people if they have `the primary purpose of furthering another employment or agency status.' Those are the words from the legislation. 
The bill invites employers to pry into their employees' activities outside the workplace to discover the workers' `primary purpose.' It encourages firms to ask job applicants whether they are union members or civil rights activists and refuse to hire them if they answer yes. This blunderbuss provision institutionalizes the blacklist. 
The bill is blatantly antiunion, and its supporters include the National Right to Work Committee and many antiunion employer associations. But the bill goes well beyond discrimination against union members. It permits many other kinds of flagrant discrimination. 
By permitting employers to deny jobs to workers who have `the primary purpose of furthering another employment or agency status,' the bill also allows firms to fire or refuse to hire a person who seeks to advance the goals of another employer. 
A company can fire a worker who is also employed by a labor union. 
The bill also lets an employer refuse to hire someone based on the fear that she might band together with coworkers to push for an on-the-job child care center. The employer can argue the applicant was trying to advance the goal of women's groups to which she belonged. 
The bill also allows a firm to fire African-American employees who seek to reduce race discrimination in the workplace. 
The bill lets an employer fire workers who seek to change company policy and allow time off for religious holidays, for family and medical leave, or other worthwhile purposes. 
This legislation legitimizes discrimination of the most offensive type. It encourages companies not to hire women. It invites discrimination against anyone else the employer believes might push an agenda in the workplace the employer doesn't like. 
It encourages employers to probe into employees' private beliefs and activities. Freedom of expression and association are guaranteed in the first amendment. For over 200 years, this country has protected individual liberties. Those freedoms are essential to our national character, but this bill clearly undermines their beliefs. 
The bill's supporters claim they want only to outlaw deceptive practices. They contend that employers are victimized by paid union organizers who accept a job with no intention of performing the work. Instead, they claim, these employees disrupt the job, harass coworkers, and file repeated frivolous complaints with governmental agencies. Innocent employers are forced to waste time and effort defending themselves against baseless charges. 
Section 3 of the bill says its purpose is `to alleviate pressure on employers to hire individuals who seek or gain employment in order to disrupt the workplace of the employer or otherwise inflict economic harm designed to put the employer out of business.' 
Employers are not powerless under current law in the face of abusive practices. To the contrary--employers have many ways to ensure an efficient and productive workplace. 
First and foremost, a business can refuse to hire someone who is not qualified for the job. If an applicant lacks the experience or the skills required, the employer can simply say no. Union membership does not automatically entitle someone to be hired, nor is it discrimination not to hire a union organizer who cannot perform the duties of the job. The employer has substantial control. 
The company can also protect its legitimate business interests by setting a policy barring workers from outside employment. 
The firm can require employees to forego moonlighting of all kinds, from driving a taxi, to telemarketing from home, to working weekends at the corner store. 
The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last year that such a policy can be applied against paid union organizers so long as it is applied neutrally to all other types of employment. 
This is a sensible rule. It recognizes employers' legitimate interests in workers who are focused on the job. We understand that, Mr. President. If the company says, `No, no moonlighting. The workers in our particular shop can only work on one job. We want that for business reasons, because we might need to have the workers work a second shift or a third shift and, therefore, we don't want you working in some other capacity.' They can do that and accomplish the result they claim is their intent. 
That is the Sixth Circuit's decision in the Architectural Glass decision in 1997. It says that they can effectively ban all kinds of moonlighting if they have a company-wide policy. So people cannot participate in other kinds of employment. If they are so concerned about that, they can do that. They can do that now. That is a way for them to try and deal with this issue if they are concerned about it. 
Employers can also discipline or discharge employees who neglect their job duties. Workers who leave their stations or simply do not complete the work required of them can be disciplined. In April 1997, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld an employer's right to discharge workers who failed to carry out their duties. In the Hess Mechanical case, the workers neglected their duties and tried to persuade their coworkers to join the union. The court held that the employer was well within his right to fire the workers for poor performance. 
We understand that, Mr. President. If they hire someone who isn't interested in working, will not work, or can't do the work they can fire the workers who neglect their job duties. If they are not going to do the work for which they were hired, and if they are not qualified for the job, they don't need to be hired. If they are qualified for the job, they are hired, they work. If they do not work, and they are busy in other activities, they can be fired. That is the law of the land today--today. 
Union membership does not give workers the right not to perform the job. A company can suspend workers who fail to perform adequately. Their pay can be docked. Disciplinary letters can be placed in their files. In extreme cases, they can be fired. Employers can use all of these items, and more, to get the job done. They are far from powerless to address the types of abuses cited by the bill's supporters. 
Employers are also free to discipline workers who disrupt the job. Harassing coworkers or customers or blocking entrances, intruding in other work areas, all of these acts can constitute grounds for discipline. Once again, employers have many ways to maintain quality, efficiency, and productivity without undermining the employee's legitimate rights. 
If the misconduct is extreme, employers can call the police. Violence, threats, and intimidation are criminal offenses. Damaging or destroying company property is a crime. No employer needs to sit idly by if employees commit such gross misconduct. Criminal charges can be filed. The offender can be removed from the worksite. These sanctions are in addition to all the other disciplinary mechanisms available to the employer. Once again, union membership confers no immunity. 
This bill's supporters contend that union members inherently suffer from `divided loyalties.' They claim that union members simply cannot be truly loyal to the employer, cannot give the employer the genuine allegiance required for an effective and productive workplace. But that extreme antiworker, antiunion view was rejected over 60 years ago when Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act. The so-called divided loyalty antiunion claim is phony. It was used by countless harsh employers to deny the fundamental rights of workers. And Congress put a stop to it in the 1930s.

Mr. KENNEDY. Here are individual companies that had been salted. This is their reaction to it. 
This letter comes from Coast Electric Company in Morgan Hill, California. It says: 
My company was `salted' by a member of the IBEW, a Mr. Pat Mangano, for the purposes of organizing. The work completed was of top quality and we in fact have maintained a friendship. Fortunately I had given thought to the idea of becoming a signatory contractor prior to this event due to the inability of my company to hire qualified people at any wage level. The salting activity convinced me that the decision to become signatory was in fact the right one. 
The contracting business is a complicated one even in the best of times and to be relieved of any problems is of great benefit. Having a reliable and qualified workforce at one s finger tips goes a long way to relieve some of the problems in a most stressful business. Thank God I am a union Contractor. 
From Central Sierra Electric Co., Inc.: 
Here is my opinion concerning the benefits and drawbacks to being a union shop. As you know, Central Sierra Electric Co, Inc. has been in business for fourteen years and has been signatory with IBEW for the past two years. Listed below are what I consider to be among the Union's strengths. To date we have found no drawbacks. 
Extremely helpful in getting qualified manpower. 
Notified us of numerous jobs out to bid. 
Given our name to developers and manufacturers looking for qualified contractors. 
Assistance in getting jobs when competing against non-union shops. 
From TL Electric, Inc., 2296 Mora Drive, Mountain View, CA: 
I was formerly a non-union firm who was just recently organized by the use of union salts from a couple of I.B.E.W. locals here in Northern Carolina. After these employees made it known to me that they were affiliated with the union, it became apparent to me that the skill and ability that they had, along with their understanding of their rights as employees could only help me become a better contractor. 
You see the fact is, Mr. President, when unions do use the salting technique, they send their best people into these companies. Opponents claim that they do not, and that they send people in there who are disruptive and harassing in order to break up the shops. In fact, they send their better people in to be an example in order to convince people to become union members. If they cannot win the respect of their co-workers, they will not be able to convince them to join the union. 
I will go on with some of these others when I conclude this evening. 
The principle of basic fairness was reaffirmed in the Town & Country case in 1992, decided by a National Labor Relations Board composed of members appointed by President Reagan and President Bush. 
In that case, the NLRB emphatically rejected the employer's claim that paid union organizers are not `employees' under the labor laws, and that they are incapable of possessing the requisite loyalty to the employer. Instead, the Board ruled, `the statute is founded on the belief that an employee may legitimately give allegiance to both a union and an employer. To the extent that may appear to give rise to a conflict, it is a conflict that was resolved by Congress long since in favor of the right of employees to organize.' 
The Supreme Court unanimously affirmed the NLRB's decision. The Court described the issue before as follows: `Can a worker be a company's `employee,' within the terms of the National Labor Relations Act . . . if, at the same time, a union pays that worker to help organize the company?' 
In answer to that question, the Court held: `We agree with the National Labor Relations Board that the answer is `yes.' 
The Court noted that the law protects employees' right to engage in union activities during nonworking time in nonworking areas. We understand that, Mr. President. They are only entitled to try to encourage people to involve themselves in union activities in nonworking time in nonworking areas. Otherwise, they can be disciplined. So we are talking about nonworking time in nonworking areas. That is key, Mr. President. 
The decision explained that `this is true even if a company perceives these protected activities as disloyal. After all, the employer has no legal right to require that, as a part of his or her service to the company, a worker refrain from engaging in protected activity.' 
Mr. President, the bill before the Senate destroys this protection. It lets employers force workers to renounce their right to engage in legitimate, lawful activities. Businesses can discharge employees who attempt to organize their coworkers to join a union, or protest dangerous working conditions, unfair pay practices, or race or sex discrimination. 
This legislation takes a giant step backward. It legitimizes conduct that our society has long condemned. It is hard to believe the Republican leadership is giving this misguided, antiworker bill such high priority as we near the end of this Congress. 
Many of us have been trying to get consideration of the Patient's Bill of Rights so we can debate that issue before we recess. And, no, the Republican leadership says, no to patient protections that are of central concern to more than 160 million Americans who are in various health maintenance organizations and managed care plans. 
But what do we have on the floor of the U.S. Senate? The salting legislation. We could ask how many Members of this body on either side have read through this legislation and understood it. It was scheduled at the close of business last Thursday for a cloture vote this evening. 
We could have debated patients' protection Friday, or if necessary, Saturday, or all day today. I bet you would have two-thirds of the Members of the U.S. Senate here instead of two Members. If we were dealing with the people's business, two-thirds of the Members would be here because they know the concern that families have about the abuses that are taking place. In too many instances in our Nation, it is insurance company accountants and agents making decisions on health care that ought to be made by doctors. Why aren't we debating that instead of an antiworker piece of legislation? 
The silence from the Republican leadership is amazing. `Oh, no,' they say, `you can only have three amendments. You either have to have your bill or our bill or two other possible amendments because we don't want to take up the time.' Here it is, two Members of the Senate are on the floor, and we are moving off this bill to consider the Interior Appropriations bill later in the afternoon, and they will be hard-pressed to get another couple of Senators on various amendments on that. 
How much time remains?

Second, Mr. President, any of the circumstances that the Senator has outlined here can be prosecuted under law at the present time. 
The idea of conjuring up all of these horror stories and then saying that is what happens in the workplace as a matter of course is fundamentally wrong. That is not the case. If you have disruptions, there are perfectly adequate ways of addressing them. 
Finally, Mr. President, the Supreme Court has upheld the concept that one can be interested in a good job with good working conditions, believe in a union, and also be interested in furthering the interests of the company. That is what this proposal would overturn.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier today the majority leader propounded the unanimous consent request relevant to the bankruptcy legislation. In that proposition, he had indicated that the first amendment to be considered to the bankruptcy bill would be the amendment which I will offer with a number of our colleagues on behalf of the Americans who are at the bottom two rungs of the economic ladder, those who are making the minimum wage in our Nation. 
It is an amendment to increase the minimum wage by 50 cents in January of next year and another 50-cent increase the following year. The total increase would be a $1 increase in the minimum wage. We will have an opportunity to debate that issue on Tuesday morning, with a vote on that sometime around the noon hour. At that time, the membership will express itself on whether we are going to reward work in the United States of America, whether we are going to say that our fellow Americans who are at the lower end of the economic ladder, who have lost more than any other group in our society in terms of their purchasing power over the period of these last years, whether they are going to be able to have a very, very modest increase of $1 over the period of the next year and a half to 2 years to their wages. 
Mr. President, there are a number of reasons for this increase. I think the most compelling one is the reason that those of us in this country have a sense of common purpose, have a sense of community, have a sense of caring about our neighbors and those who are fellow citizens. That has been a strength of our Nation ever since its earliest days. 
We also put a strong emphasis and a strong quality on the issue of working. What we are saying is that those who are going to work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, should no longer live in poverty. That has been the reason for the minimum wage in the first place, following the Great Depression and over a long period of time. There have been five raises in the minimum wage since 1955. Raising the minimum wage has been supported by Republicans and Democrats, Republican Presidents, Democratic Presidents. It has by and large been a bipartisan effort over the recent years. 
The principal cautions in raising the minimum wage have been, would the raising of the minimum wage result in an increase in the rates of inflation which would work to the detriment of other workers in our society, and would it contribute to increasing unemployment in our society and, in that respect, have a disadvantaging impact on the various people we are trying to help? 
Those are powerful economic issues. And they ought to be considered at any particular time. And we are glad to consider those issues at this time as we are advancing the cause of workers in our society, workers who have not benefited from this extraordinary prosperity which we as Americans have seen over the period of the last 6 years, the greatest economic growth, the greatest price stability, the lowest unemployment, the lowest rates of inflation. The economy, with all of the ups and downs of the stock market, is extremely strong, and it has been strong, and it continues to be strong. 
Nonetheless, we have seen that over the period of recent years the purchasing power of those at the lower level of the economic ladder has deteriorated significantly. And what we are attempting to do is to say to our fellow Americans, as we as a nation move ahead in terms of the economic prosperity, that we want all of our fellow citizens to move along together. It is not asking very much to have a 50 cent increase in the minimum wage or $1 over a period of the next 2 years. That is the issue, Mr. President, that will be squarely before this body on Tuesday next and where we will have an opportunity to vote on it. 
Mr. President, as we have on other occasions, I think it is fair to look at where the minimum wage is today and where it has been. The inclusions in our amendment, are they really reasonable given the current economic conditions? We maintain they are extremely reasonable. 
On this chart here, the real minimum wage reflects where the purchasing power of the minimum wage in real dollars is--in real dollars from 1995, 1998, and beyond. 
If you look at this end of the chart, Mr. President, you will see 1997, 1998; and you will see where my pen is, that at this point here we are talking about a $1 increase from $5.15 to what would be $6.15, with the increase in the minimum wage in real dollars. By the year 2000, it will only amount to $5.76 in real dollars. 
If you go across this line, Mr. President, going back through the 1960s all the way through the 1970s, you will see even with this kind of increase in the minimum wage of $1, the purchasing power of the minimum wage for working families will still be lower than it was for a period of some 20, 23 years from 1960s all the way through the early 1980s. So even with this increase, it is extremely modest, Mr. President, extremely moderate--it still does not bring us back to the purchasing power that the minimum wage has had for the better part of our postwar period. But, nonetheless, it is important progress for families. 
All you have to do is ask any family what a difference it makes for a 50-cent or a $1 increase in the minimum wage. They will answer very quickly, `It means that we'll have to have two jobs instead of three jobs.' That will be their first answer. And secondly, an increase of $1 in the minimum wage will mean the purchase of groceries for probably 6 months of a year. It will mean the rent for a working-poor family of about 7 months of a year. It will be about two-thirds the cost of the tuition for a son or a daughter, of a working family earning the minimum wage, to attend a public university in their State. This is very important to those at the lower end of the economic ladder. That is basically the historical situation, Mr. President. 
It is fair to ask ourselves now, what has happened in the rates of inflation? Let us take a look at inflation and the minimum wage. Many say, `If we increase the minimum wage, we're going to see a bump in the rate of inflation.' Well, if we look at what happens to the minimum wage--and in this particular chart here we go from 1996 all the way up to 1998--we look at what is happening to the rate of inflation. 
Prior to the rise in the minimum wage, which was in October 1996, the rate of inflation per month was three-tenths of 1 percent. Then we raised the minimum wage to $4.75. And if you look at this chart here, you will find that it continued along virtually the same three-tenths of 1 percent. It dropped down here in the wintertime, it rose again in the early spring, dropped again, and then settled into a significant drop. If you are talking of three-tenths of 1 percent per month to two-tenths of 1 percent, you are talking about a significant drop in the rate of inflation, even with the last increase in the minimum wage. Then it rose another 50 cents in 1997. And the inflation rate was two-tenths of 1 percent. 
Look what has happened since that last raise to $5.15. It went along for a period of time, dropped, bounced up, and is now down to one-tenth of 1 percent. 
Mr. President, the clear signal from this chart is that the last increase in the minimum wage virtually had no impact on the rate of inflation. And if we are to look at the history of these last several years, we will see that the rate of inflation has actually gone down. It is not a valid point to say that if we try to do something to raise the minimum wage, it is going to add to inflation.  
Now, if we look at what the impact is on unemployment, this is a second argument. If we raise the minimum wage, it is going to have an adverse impact on inflation and it is going to increase unemployment. Again, if we go back to October 1996 where we saw an increase in the minimum wage, we had 5.2 percent unemployment, a little bump, and then a gradual decline through September 1997, when the last increase in the minimum wage went to $5.15. Since that last increase in September of 1997, up until August of 1998, we have seen a continuing reduction of the unemployment, down at the present time to 4.5, 4.4 percent. It has not added to inflation. It has not added or contributed to unemployment. Those two economic arguments do not stand. 
If we look at the impact on our teens, the arguments are made, `Senator, we are concerned about what the impact is going to be on teen unemployment and particularly among the minorities.' The fact is, about 20 to 25 percent of all those who receive the minimum wage are teenagers. Most of the teenagers in my State who are receiving the minimum wage are out there their first year in college trying to make ends meet. 
Travel with me to the University of Massachusetts in Boston at the campus. Mr. President, many of the children who go to that excellent school are from families where the parents never went to the school. And much of the student body is working 25 hours a week or more. These are teenagers. These are many of the children who are trying to gain sufficient income to fund their education. We should think it is a worthwhile and valuable endeavor in trying to support kids who are trying to go to school and stay in school, many of whom are coming from difficult and complex backgrounds. Nonetheless, they go on. 
Take the minorities. In this case, the black teen unemployment--we can go through any of the various groups in terms of unemployment--and what we see again is the increase in the minimum wage, the continued decline in terms of unemployment of black teenagers and minority teenagers. This chart is just a reflection of the same trend. We see that the total number of employment in terms of teenagers 16 to 19, with the increase in the minimum wage, these are the individuals who find the employment going up. Increase in the minimum wage based upon sound economic principles, and we see that there has not been an adverse impact on the issues of employment or inflation. 
Now, I think it is worthwhile to ask who is really for this increase in the minimum wage. Mr. President, 170 organizations--170 organizations--representing not just workers. The AFL-CIO, even though their workers are all receiving far above the minimum wage, is certainly interested because of respect for the value of work. The principal church groups and church leaders are strongly supportive. The leaders of the various women's and children's organizations are strongly supportive. The various civil rights organizations, knowing the importance of this in terms of the individuals, are strongly supportive.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments, now that we have the statistics behind us and we have dealt with the economic issues. If there are those who have differing economic indicators, we welcome them. Present those so we will have a chance to debate. But we have not heard from them as we have been making this case in the past weeks and past months, even the past year, about the importance of this increase. We haven't heard those arguments made. 
Let me indicate to this body who we are really talking about, because I think it is important that we realize who these individuals are who are the recipients of the minimum wage. Mr. President, 33 percent of those who benefit from this increase are in service occupations, including home health care workers. These are workers like Cathy Adams, a home health aide from Viola, IL. Cathy is a high school graduate, who is currently enrolled in a computer training program at the local community college. She lives with her two daughters, who are 10 and 11. 
Cathy works 11 1/2 hours a day, 5 days a week. She cares for a woman with multiple sclerosis. She bathes her, dresses her, and feeds her. She does the grocery shopping, the laundry, and the cleaning. She runs errands and schedules doctor appointments. 
Cathy likes her job and is fond of her client, but she finds it hard to live on $5.30 an hour. In March, she told a minimum wage forum: 
I literally live paycheck to paycheck. After paying the bills, whatever is left over goes to groceries. I have $9 in my savings account and worry about being able to save for my girls' education. We rarely have money to go to a movie or eat out at a restaurant. The other day, my girls asked me to take them ice skating at school. While it only costs $10, I had to think twice about whether we could afford it. Most of the clothing I buy for my kids and for myself comes from yard sales and secondhand stores. 
This is a minimum wage worker, someone who will be affected by our amendment. 
A second group, is child care workers. According to `Worthy Work, Unlivable Wages,' a recent study by the Center for Child Care Workforce, in 1997, the average wage for a teaching assistant in child care centers ranged from $6 to $7 an hour. This is less than the 1998 poverty level for a family of three--$13,650. Turnover among these assistants is high, 40 percent. 
We talk about what we care about in terms of our children. One of the most important aspects of the child's life is what is happening to them in their home, primarily, but also what happens to them when they are in some kind of child care setting, in a Head Start child care setting. So many of those who take care of those children are child care workers. Those child care workers, by and large, are receiving the minimum wage. 
One of the reasons you have the great turnover is because they can't make it. Rather than having the child care workers who stay with your children throughout the year and interact with them and help and assist them getting a decent, livable wage, we have this very considerable turnover. The study found that centers paying higher than average salaries had lower turnover rates than centers paying less. 
We find that true in the Head Start programs, as well. We care about children. We care about fairness and we care about child care workers. We need to do something about a minimum wage. 
These are workers like Kimberly Frazier, a child care aide from Philadelphia. Kimberly works full time and earns $5.20 an hour. She is a single mother with three children and has worked at the same center since 1992. 
Kimberly says her salary barely covers her bills--rent of $250 a month, food, utilities, clothing for three growing children, and carfare to get her daughter and herself to the child care center. She told our forum: 
Of course, there is never money for a vacation for my children or me. I go without new clothes for myself because I have to keep buying new sneakers for my children, they outgrow them so fast. I can't afford a car and pay for gas and insurance so I rely on public transportation. If I had a car, I could get out to the places where there are better paying jobs. And, like all Americans, I dream of buying my own house so that I can raise my kids in a neighborhood that has less crime and more trees. But I know that, although I work and study as hard as I can, I will never have the down payment for a house earning the minimum wage. 
She concluded, 
A dollar an hour probably doesn't sound like a lot to many people, but to me and my children it would mean a real improvement in our lives. 
Many minimum wage workers are janitors, cleaning offices in buildings across the country. They are people like Valerie Bell. Valerie works as a custodian at the Baltimore City World Trade Center. Since 1995, that building has been covered by Baltimore's Living Wage Ordinance, which requires city contractors to pay $6.10 an hour. That's higher than the federal minimum, but still lower than the level that I have proposed. 
According to Valerie Bell, the living wage means dignity for workers and their families. As she puts it, `under the living wage, we no longer have to receive food stamps or other social services to supplement our incomes. We can fix up our homes and invest in our neighborhoods. We can spend more at the local grocery store. We can possibly work two jobs rather than three low wage jobs and spend more time with our families. Our utilities won't be cut off. We can pay the medical bills we accumulated from not having benefits in these jobs. The best welfare reform is a living wage job.' 
Nationwide, most security screeners at airports earn the minimum wage. These workers screen passenger luggage, operate metal detectors and work x-ray machines. They are responsible for the safety of millions of passengers and thousands of airplanes entering and leaving airports around the country--yet they earn the minimum wage. 
These are workers like Melvin Ware, a customs carousel handler at the Los Angeles Airport. He takes home about $317 every two weeks. `By the time you pay rent and utilities, you're broke,' he said. `There's no life after work.' Raquel Littlejohn screens passenger luggage, and spends much of her day at a computer terminal. This strains her eyes but, with take-home pay of under $400 every two weeks, she can't afford to get them checked. A sympathetic L.A. Councilwoman said, `I don't think it's good that the person who is doing such an important job has to be worrying about trying to get to the next one because the security job doesn't pay a living wage.' 
Eighteen percent of today's workforce is employed in the retail industry--that's 22.5 million workers. Many are paid the minimum wage. 
These are people like Cordelia Bradley of Philadelphia. She works at a clothing chain just outside Philadelphia. She is the mother of one son, and she earns $5.15 an hour. 
She told our minimum wage forum in March that:  
I am currently living in a rented room for which I pay $300 a month. I would like to have my own apartment but I cannot afford one. In addition to paying my rent, I pay for food, clothing and transportation. . . . If the minimum wage was higher I would be able to save up for my own apartment for me and my son. . . . I ask you to reward the people who go to work by raising up the minimum wage. Things are very rough for people, not just people on welfare. There are many people like me who go to work every day and cannot afford to live. Please do the right thing. 
Then there are laundry workers, and the list goes on. These are the individuals whose lives would be impacted by the increase in the minimum wage. We are talking about a dollar--a dollar an hour. We are talking probably $2,000 over the course of a year. That's not two-thirds as much as the increase that every Member of the U.S. Senate received in this Congress--two-thirds as much as we have received in this Congress. We are being asked whether we are going to try to give those individuals some relief, some help, some assistance, as we have in the best days of our past, to say that these individuals could and should be able to have an impact. 
Nationwide, the soup kitchens, food pantries and homeless shelters are increasingly serving the working poor, not just the unemployed. According to a recent study by Second Harvest, the nationwide networks of food banks, in 1997, 39 percent of households seeking emergency food aid had at least one member who was working. Eighty-six percent of households receiving emergency food aid earned under $15,500 a year, and 67 percent of the households earned less than $10,000 a year. 
According to a U.S. Conference of Mayors study, requests for emergency food aid increased 86 percent in the cities survey. And 67 percent of the cities cited low-paying jobs as one of the main causes of hunger. These aren't only just for the parents, these are for the children. This is not a Member of Congress that is saying it, these are the mayors of the country saying what is happening out across the Nation, which is that individuals can't make it with this kind of an income, and there is something that we can do. 
We are facing many complex problems here in the United States Congress and Senate. We have faced many of them. But one that we can impact and one that we should impact is trying to make sure that people who work will not be in poverty for themselves and their children. We hear a lot about American values in our country, about what is important and what is unimportant. The newspapers are filled with that. Well, this is something that is important. 
I welcome the fact that President Clinton has been a strong supporter of this particular issue. So we will have an opportunity, Mr. President, to come back and visit this issue. Nothing, I believe--and I have had a chance to vote and participate on many different issues over 37 years in the U.S. Senate--there is no single issue that is more defined in terms of fairness than the issue of the minimum wage. Nothing. Just in terms of fairness, are we going to be fair to working people in our country and in our society? Are we going to be fair against the background and history of Republicans and Democrats that were fair? 
We are going to be asked next Tuesday whether this body will be fair. We will have a chance then to speak to that issue.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last night my Republican colleagues filed cloture on the so-called Truth in Employment Act. Supporters of this deceptively-titled bill claim that it is designed to bar a union organizing technique known as `salting.' Under that technique, union supporters seek a job at a non-union shop with the intention of persuading co-workers to join the union. 
I oppose this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture. I believe that salting, like other types of organizing activity, should be protected by the labor laws. 
Under the bill, employers could make employment decisions based on their subjective view of an employee's motivation. If an employer believed that a person was likely to try to organize a union, the employer would be free not to hire that person. If an employer unilaterally determined that an employee's interest in organizing co-workers would interfere with her ability to do the job, the employer could refuse to hire her. If an employer rightly or wrongly decided that an employee might work together with colleagues to change conditions on the job, the employer could discharge or discipline the employee. 
Many may remember the movie `Norma Rae,' starring Sally Field. In that film, Norma Rae decided she had had enough of the abusive practices in her factory, so she worked with a labor union to organize her co-workers so they could stand up to these abuses together. But under this bill, Norma Rae could be fired. 
This bill would make mind-reading a protected right under the National Labor Relations Act. It would let employers deny work to employees based on a perception that they might try to organize a union. That perception is most likely to come from the employee's membership in a union. In effect, this bill would institutionalize the blacklist. That is unacceptable. 
Let us be clear what types of activity are protected under the labor laws, and what kinds of conduct would be left open for employer retaliation under this bill. Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act protects employees' rights to organize, bargain collectively, and engage in other concerted activities for mutual aid or protection. 
If this bill became law, an employer could refuse to hire an employee based on a fear that she might band together with co-workers to push for an on-the-job child care center. The employer could claim that this activity was undertaken in furtherance of an organization other than the employer, be it a union or a women's rights organization. Therefore, the workers' conduct would not be protected, and the employer could discriminate or discharge at will. 
Under this bill, a firm could fire African-American workers who together sought Martin Luther King's birthday as a holiday. Once again, the employer could argue that the workers were acting in furtherance of a civil rights group's goals, and therefore were not protected by the National Labor Relations Act. 
Under this bill, a company could deny jobs to employees it believed might try to persuade others to support a political campaign, or get involved in a community group, or contribute to a church or synagogue. And, a firm could refuse to hire workers because they might join a union, or persuade others to do so. 
Most of us would agree that discrimination on the basis of race, or religion, or gender, or political belief--and many of us would also put sexual orientation on that list--is unacceptable in this society. The right to self-expression on these important issues flows from the First Amendment, and has been protected by decades-old federal laws. The National Labor Relations Act places an employee's right to organize and bargain collectively on an equal footing with these other rights, and so it should. 
This bill would effectively repeal that right. It leaves employees in an intolerable position. 
In 1995, the National Labor Relations Board ordered nearly 7,500 workers reinstated. Those workers had been fired unlawfully for union activity. Over 26,000 workers discharged for unionizing were awarded back pay. On average, workers waited four years from the date of the unlawful discharge before being awarded any relief. And, the Dunlop Commission on the Future of Worker-Management Relations found in 1994 that union supporters were unlawfully fired in one out of every four union election campaigns. 
These figures demonstrate that workers who become active supporters of a union after they are hired run a substantial risk of being fired. Under this bill, if the employer thinks an employee might become active in a union, that worker never gets the job in the first place. This is not progress. Instead, it takes us back to the days when employees could be required to sign `yellow dog contracts,' promising never to join the union, in order to be hired. 
The Supreme Court has emphatically rejected this approach. In 1995, the Court unanimously ruled that union supporters are employees protected by the National Labor Relations Act when they apply for a job. In the Town & Country decision, the Court dismissed the employer's claim that union organizers are inherently untrustworthy because they owe their primary loyalty to the union. But that is precisely the premise underlying this bill. 
Current law gives employers many ways to advance their legitimate interests in an efficient and productive workforce--without undermining employees' rights to engage in concerted activity. For example, an employer can establish a policy barring its employees from all outside employment. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals held just a few months ago that such a policy can be applied against union organizers, so long as it is also applied neutrally to all other types of employment. 
Workers who neglect their job duties in order to organize other workers can be disciplined or discharged. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has held that it is lawful for an employer to fire employees who fail to carry out their duties because they are trying to organize. 
Employers can lawfully discipline employees who fail to do the job they were hired to do, or disrupt the employer's operations, or engage in unlawful conduct. Employers can file charges with the National Labor Relations Board, or even the police, if the conduct is criminal. In short, employers have many tools available today to address the concerns that supposedly motivate this bill. 
Finally, I note that many of this legislation's proponents are also strong supporters of the so-called TEAM Act. TEAM Act supporters claim that bill is necessary in order to promote employee participation in the workplace. The present bill would permit employers to refuse to hire workers who band together in order to participate in the workplace. 
It is ironic that supporters claim to favor employee participation in the one context, but seek to squelch it in the other. The common thread appears to be employer domination. Participation is seen as desirable only if employers can control the `team,' and worker-controlled groups such as unions can be prohibited. 
This legislation poses a significant threat to employee rights that have been fundamental to our industrial democracy for over 60 years. Because the bill is dangerous as well as unnecessary, I must oppose it. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with this amendment the United States Senate has an excellent opportunity to restore public faith in the political system by enacting long overdue campaign finance reform. After cynically withdrawing the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill last winter, the Senate followed the lead of the House and passed a needed new law to limit the role of money in election campaigns. 
The current system is a scandal, and I commend Senator McCain and Senator Feingold for their leadership in demanding that the Senate act on reform. The vast sums of special interest money pouring into campaigns are a cancer on our democracy. The voice of the average citizen today is scarcely heard over the din of lobbyists and big corporations contributing millions of dollars to political campaigns and buying hundreds of TV ads to promote the causes of their special interests. 
Every Democrat supports the proposal before us. If enough Republicans join us, this reform will pass. 
It is time to end special interest gimmickry in campaign advertising. Currently, special interests can run as many so-called issue ads as they wish as long as they do not specifically advocate a candidate's election. The American people aren't being fooled--they know that these are campaign ads in disguise and should be regulated accordingly. 
Democrats also want to close the gaping loophole on soft money, which allows special interests to bypass legal limits on giving money directly to candidates. Big corporations and other special interests use this loophole to funnel money to candidates through the back door, by making so-called `soft-money' contributions to political parties and other political organizations that are spent to benefit candidates. 
More than $250 million in soft money contributions played a part in the 1996 elections. McCain-Feingold proposal will ban this practice. 
The fact is that phony issue ads and soft money contributions have created a climate in which our elections and our legislative agenda are determined more and more by how much money candidates can raise and less and less by issues of concern to families and communities across America. The public doesn't have to look any further than the Senate floor to see the effect big money has on the Republican legislative agenda. 
For example, Republicans are determined to pass a bankruptcy bill bought and paid for by the consumer credit industry, despite the pleas of bankruptcy judges, scholars, and consumer groups. 
Why is Congress moving so quickly to pass legislation that raises such grave concerns? Who benefits from the bill? Is it working families, the elderly, women and children? The answer is a resounding `no.' If you want to know who benefits from this legislation, just look at the corporate interests making soft money contributions--the consumer credit industry gave $5.5 million in soft money during the 1995-1996 election cycle. Common Cause reports that since 1995, Republicans in the House of Representatives have received more than twice the PAC and soft money contributions from consumer creditors as Democrats, and--not surprisingly--Republicans voted wholesale for the bankrtupcy bill. In the House of Representatives, the bill had the support of every Republican. 
The tobacco industry's total PAC and soft money contributions are less than half of what the credit industry gave during the same period--but, it was enough for the Republican leadership to reject needed anti-tobacco legislation and prevent it from being enacted. 
The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids reports that Senators who voted consistently against the tobacco reform legislation took far more money from the industry--four times more--than those who supported the bill. In the past ten years, Senators supporting the tobacco industry's position have accepted an average of $34,000, while those who support reform measures accepted about $8,000 in contributions. 
The challenge of managed care reform is another example of the power that big corporations can wield against the interests of individuals and families in the political process. In the halls of Congress, big money from campaign contributors is drowning the voices of our constituents. 
A year ago, in a private strategy meeting called to defeat the Patients' Bill of Rights, staff from the Senate Republican leadership exhorted insurance industry lobbyists to `Get off your butts, get off your wallets.' And lo and behold, the industry ingloriously responded. 
In fact, Blue Cross/Blue Shield and its state affiliates have made $1 million in political contributions during the 1997-1998 cycle, with four out of every five dollars going to Republicans. They are also the number one PAC donors to leadership committees. They more than doubled their contributions during the 1995-1996 election cycle and 98 percent of the contributions were directed to Republicans. 
According to the Center on Responsive Politics, managed care PACs--including the American Association of Health Plans, the Health Insurance Association of America, and Blue Cross/Blue Shield--gave $77,250 to leadership political action committees. All but $1,500 went to the Republican majority. As of July 1, these industry PACs have made $1.8 million in political contributions during this election cycle, and 70 percent of the money is directed to Republicans. 
These same corporations have also funded a multi-million dollar advertising campaign of disinformation and distortion on managed case reform. The same corporations profit by denying care to patients who have faithfully paid their premiums. These same corporations, with their crocodile tears, claim that patient protections will bankrupt them or force them to raise premiums by hundreds of dollars. 
These same corporations are spending millions of dollars--taken from premiums paid by patients--on political campaign contributions and advertising to defeat the very legislation that patients need and deserve. 
What did this significant investment buy? Just what they wanted. Inaction by Congress. Stonewalling. A `just say no' strategy. At the behest of their big donors and special interest friends, the Senate Republican leadership has delayed and denied consideration of the Patients' Bill of Rights for nearly a year and a half. 
The choice is clear. Will the Senate stand with patients, families, and physicians, or with the well-heeled special interests that put profits ahead of patients? 
It is clear that the majority of Senator Republicans are standing with the special interests. There is no mystery about what is going on. The Republican Leadership's position is to protect the insurance industry instead of protecting the patients. They know they can't do that in the light of day. So their strategy has been to work behind closed doors to kill the bill. Keep it bottled up in Committee. No markup. No floor debate or vote. 
Bill Gradison, the head of the Health Insurance Association of America, was asked in a interview published in the Rocky Mountain News to sum up the coalition's strategy. According to the article, Mr. Gradison replied `[t]here's a lot to be said for `Just say no.' The author of the article goes on to report that:  
[a]t a strategy session . . . called by a top aide to Senator Don Nickles, Gradison advised Republicans to avoid taking public positions that could draw fire during the election campaign. Opponents will rely on Republican leaders in both chambers to keep managed care legislation bottled up in committee. 
Just as managed care plans gag their doctors, the Republican leadership wants to gag the Senate. Just as insurance companies delay and deny care, the Republican leadership is trying to delay and deny meaningful reform. Just as health plans want to avoid being held accountable when they kill or injure a patient, the Republican leadership wants to avoid being held accountable for killing patient protection legislation. 
That is why the Republican leadership is trying to hide its tactics of delay and denial behind a smokescreen of parliamentary maneuvers and phony procedural justifications. They say we don't have time to debate managed care. They reject offer after offer from the Democratic leader, thereby continuing the stall of this critically important legislation. I say, the American people aren't interested in excuses. They want action. They want reforms. They want clean elections. This legislation will give it to them and it deserves to pass by an overwhelming majority of the Senate.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just a short while ago I was informed that the majority leader was looking for amendments to the bankruptcy legislation and also mentioned my name during that discussion. I am quite prepared to call up our amendment at the present time, Amendment Number 3540, and move for consideration of that amendment. 
The majority leader indicated--I am getting the transcript--that he was prepared to enter in a time agreement on this amendment, and that he was inviting amendments to the bankruptcy bill. I am here on the floor now prepared to move ahead, and I am also willing to enter into a reasonable time limit. Therefore I am constrained to object given what the majority leader has stated.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his explanation. As I mentioned earlier, I am prepared to enter into a reasonable time agreement for this amendment. But I do want to give the Senate the opportunity to express itself on this amendment because it is of such vital importance for so many millions of Americans who depend upon the minimum wage for their survival, and who have seen, over the past several years, a decline in the purchasing power of the minimum wage. 
I will just take a few moments now to continue some of the thoughts that I expressed last evening. I see that Senator Wellstone wants to address some of the needs of his own State. I will not take much of the Senate's time now. But I will either take additional time this evening when the Senate concludes its business, or at other opportunities, because this is an issue of great importance. 
Mr. President, I pointed out last night what has happened to the purchasing power of those who earn the minimum wage. Even with the increase I propose, which is 50 cents in January of next year and 50 cents the following year--even if we are successful, the purchasing power of those at the lower economic levels will still be substantially lower than it was during the 1960s, 1970s, and the early 1980s. 
This is at a time of extraordinary economic prosperity--the greatest prosperity we have had in this country, with great economic growth, and low inflation, a budget that is balanced, and an increasing surplus. The real issue is: Are we going to reward work? Are we going to say to men and women who work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, that they are going to be out of poverty in the most powerful Nation in the world, with the strongest economy in the world? That is something that I believe is very basic, very fundamental. It is an issue of fairness, and an issue that will not go away. That is why those of us who support it are going to be persistent in insisting that we are going to have a vote on the issue in these next several days. Because we are not permitted to have a freestanding bill, we have to use an amendment strategy so the Senate can address this issue. But address it the Senate will. 
Last evening, Mr. President, I pointed out and responded to 2 of the arguments that are constantly made in opposition to an increase in the minimum wage. The first argument is that it adds to the rate of inflation. I also pointed out last night that we have the lowest rate of inflation of any time when the Senate has considered an increase in the minimum wage since the end of World War II. 
The second argument is that raising the minimum wage increases unemployment. Last night I pointed out that we have the lowest unemployment rate of any time we have considered an increase in the minimum wage since the end of World War II. 
These two claims are continually offered by opponents of an increase in the minimum wage. But they do not hold water. The facts belie those claims. 
Other issues have been raised, Mr. President. One was, what will be the impact on small businesses? A recent survey by the Jerome Levy Institute for Economics shows that 90 percent of small businesses said the last increase in the minimum wage had no impact on their hiring or employment decisions. Only one-third of 1 percent said they laid off workers. If the minimum wage were increased to $6 an hour, fewer than 3 percent said they would hire fewer employees or lay off existing workers. Over 90 percent said they anticipated no ill effects from such increases. 
That data has been substantiated by the Small Business Administration, which pointed out that, in 1997 alone, industries dominated by small business created 60 percent more jobs than did industries dominated by the large firms. Last year, over 1.2 million new jobs were created in the sectors dominated by small businesses, which often are those that pay minimum wage to their workers. 
This data contrasts starkly with the rhetoric from the National Restaurant Association, the National Federation of Independent Business, and other naysayers. Those groups continue to cry `wolf' about the impact of raising the minimum wage. They should ask their members what really happened after the last increase, before they try to feed Senators the same empty arguments. 
These interest groups do not speak for all small businesses in the country. 115 small businesses from across the country have joined the Campaign for a Fair Minimum Wage. They come from 16 States and the District of Columbia, and they include restaurants, retail stores, banks, investment firms, publishers and communications companies. 
These firms understand that raising the minimum wage is good for employers as well as employees. Fair pay for workers improves productivity and reduces turnover. That is extremely important. 
Another point I want to mention, Mr. President, is what is happening to living standards for low-income Americans, including minimum wage workers. Many low wage workers are desperate for this kind of assistance. Nationwide, soup kitchens, food pantries and homeless shelters are increasingly serving the working poor--not just the unemployed. According to a U.S. Conference of Mayors study in 1997, requests for emergency food aid increased in 86 percent of the cities surveyed, and 67 percent of cities cited low-paying jobs as one of the main causes for hunger. 
Here we have individuals who are making the minimum wage and don't earn enough to keep themselves and their children out of soup kitchens. This is powerful evidence about what is happening to the working poor. The purchasing power of these workers has declined, as I discussed last night. This is more dramatic evidence about the significant increase in working poor families who are forced to rely on soup kitchens and charities. This is something that the mayors understand. This is something the mayors have indicated is of increasing concern to all of them. We have an opportunity to do something about that for families who are making the minimum wage, and that is an additional reason for this increase. 
Mr. President, we can also look at the effect of the increase that I am proposing--the two 50-cent increases that will bring the minimum wage to $6.15 in the year 2000. But that amount translates to just $5.74 in purchasing power in the year 2000, even if we go ahead. 
Now, what else is happening to wages in our country? Salaries and bonuses paid to executives have never been higher, Mr. President. In April, the Wall Street Journal surveyed executive pay at 350 of the country's largest firms. The median CEO salary and bonus in 1997 was $1.6 million, or $770 an hour. The CEO takes less than 2 days to earn what a minimum wage worker earns in a full year. 
The same groups that complain about an increase in the minimum wage are the ones that have made dramatic increases in the payment of their officials, Mr. President. On the one hand, they say, `We can't afford to pay a 50 cent or $1 increase in the minimum wage'; yet, they are able to afford millions more in salaries and stock options to their executives. 
Over 170 groups have joined the Campaign for a Fair Minimum Wage. They include religious groups, such as the American Friends Service Committee, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the United Methodist Board of Church and Society, the United States Catholic Conference--and dozens more. 
Women's organizations are also represented: the American Association of University Women, the National Committee on Pay Equity, the National Partnership for Women & Families, the National Women's Political Caucus, the Older Women's League, and many others. 
Civil rights groups also support the Campaign. These groups and others understand that the minimum wage is a civil rights issue--a partial list includes the American-Arab Anti-discrimination Committee, the Asian American Legal Defense Fund, the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza, the Rainbow Coalition, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and many more. 
Trade unions have joined the Campaign, too. Virtually every union member earns more than the minimum wage, thanks to union representation at the bargaining table. But that hasn't stopped the AFL-CIO, AFSCME, the Communications Workers, the Steel Workers, the Service Employees and other unions from strongly supporting this increase. They believe that every working American deserves a decent wage, and they are working hard to achieve that result. 
Mr. President, we will continue to consider the issues that have been raised in past debates on the minimum wage. We are eager to debate these issues on the floor of the U.S. Senate and give the membership an opportunity to vote on this issue. 
As I have mentioned, and will continue to say time in and time out, this is an issue of fundamental fairness and decency. It is a real reflection of the kind of values which this institution has. 
This is a women's issue because the majority of minimum wage workers are women. It is a children's issue because many of those women have children. 
It basically is a fairness issue. And we are very hopeful that we will have the opportunity to debate this and have a decision on this issue in the U.S. Senate.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank our friend and colleague for his superb recollections and comments about this son of Massachusetts, Kirk O'Donnell. Kirk O'Donnell was really a committed public servant right from the earliest days. He started out as a schoolteacher. He came from a working-class family. He entered politics. He served with great distinction, as the Senator has pointed out, with a great friend of both of us, Congressman O'Neill, in a very significant time in the history of this country. 
And then after our friend and colleague, Speaker O'Neill, left, Kirk O'Donnell went to run the Center for National Policy. He kept his interest in public policy, believing that public policy can make a difference in people's lives. 
He really was an extraordinary human being in his common sense, his good judgment and his real desire to advance the common interests of working families in our State. 
So I wish to commend my colleague, Senator Kerry, for bringing this matter to the Senate. This man was a very rare human being, a rare individual, a very loving person, certainly for his wife and his family but also to his friends. He also cared very deeply about the condition of the people that he met over his journey of life. He had a strong commitment to make this world a better world and our State of Massachusetts a better State. 
I thank my colleague for bringing these remarks to the Senate. I commend these remarks to our colleagues and to his family because we miss him not only as a friend, but as an extraordinary public servant. We should not let his name and his memory leave us. Those who knew him and loved him will certainly carry his memory in their hearts throughout their lives. 
I thank the Senator.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might use. 
Mr. President, we have just a few moments ago decided as a Senate to consider the bankruptcy legislation that was reported out of the Judiciary Committee a few weeks ago. I mentioned at the time that this measure was being considered by the leadership, that I had hoped we would have the opportunity at the time that the leadership was considering calling up the bankruptcy legislation to consider other legislation that had been pending for some period of time. 
The legislation that I was hoping would be considered is the Patients' Bill of Rights. It has been introduced by the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, and supported by a number of us. Or, alternatively, I had hoped that the Senate would have been able to accept the proposal of the minority leader, Senator Daschle, that we would lay down before the Senate the Republican managed care proposal that passed the House of Representatives in July. This would have provided us with an opportunity to debate an issue that is enormously important to families in this country. 
I mentioned before, the bankruptcy legislation deals with 1,200,000 people or occasions in this country per year. The Patients' Bill of Rights, however, affects 160 million Americans. The concerns that these families have are very real and very powerful. 
Time and again, we hear of insurance company abuses that cripple or kill patients in states around the country. Yet, the response of the Republican leadership has been, well, you can either take it or leave it. That's it. Take the alternative that is advanced by the Republican leadership--which allows one vote on Senator Daschle's bill, one vote on the Republican bill, and perhaps three other amendments, but no more than those amendments in number that are designated by the majority leader--or leave it and do nothing. Mr. President, this proposal effectively gags the Senate from having full debate and discussion on this legislation. But, we have been told that was the position of the leadership and that was what we were going to be stuck with. 
Mr. President, this is unsatisfactory because it excludes the opportunity to debate the major differences that exist between the Republicans and the Democrats on the issues of health care. 
I have here before me a comparison of each of the patient protection bills--the proposal that has been advanced by the Republicans, and also the Patients' Bill of Rights proposal introduced by the Democrats. At the heart of this debate is a very simple concept: Are medical professionals, the doctors and nurses, going to make the health care decisions that affect patients? Or are insurance company accountants going to make those judgments and make those decisions, which is the case in too many instances in our country today? We believe that in all of these circumstances medical decisions ought to be made by the health professionals who have been trained, qualified, and certified to be able to deal with the health care challenges that will affect our families in this country. 
We believe there should be a prohibition on gag practices; access to emergency rooms when there is a need for services, which is not guaranteed in too many instances today; access to the Ob/Gyn providers; the ability to keep your doctor; and guaranteed access to the specialists, including out-of-network providers, when those needs are important. 
We believe that there should be standing referrals to specialists or that specialists should be allowed to act as primary care providers when that is important for particular patients, such as cancer patients, or persons with disabilities or HIV; the ability to have access to doctor-prescribed drugs when the various formularies override a physician's decision; and access to clinical trials, which are absolutely essential for patients who have life-threatening conditions--such as breast cancer-- that have failed to respond to conventional therapies. The failure to promote and cover routine costs for participation in these clinical trials is something that the Senate ought to make some judgment and decision about. 
The interesting point about clinical trials is that it really is not more costly to the HMOs, because the drug and biotechnology companies or the government continue to assume the burden for the experimentation. The HMOs are simply asked to shoulder their fair share of the routine costs that the patient would incur anyway. So it really is not costly to the HMOs to guarantee this access to clinical trials. We ought to have the opportunity to debate that here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
We ought to be able to ensure there is going to be protection for patient advocacy, and that we are going to have information on plan quality. People need to understand which plans present themselves to be quality plans, and which do not. And, perhaps most importantly, there should be a clear right to a timely and independent appeal process and the ability to hold health plans accountable for their actions. These are the areas of public policy that we ought to have an opportunity to debate and discuss. 
We have not heard from the Republican leadership what particular aspect of this list, which basically includes the President's reservations about the Republican proposal, that they object to. All they say is: We are not going to debate it. We are not going to discuss it. You can get one amendment, two amendments, three amendments, but we are just not going to tie the Senate up to debate these particular measures, even though these are the items which have been embraced by not just Members of the U.S. Senate but by nearly 190 organizations across this country that represent--who? Represent the Congress? The Senate? No. They represent the doctors, represent the nurses, represent the researchers, represent the patients and consumers. 
Nearly every single major and minor consumer group has effectively endorsed the proposal that we have advanced, and we have not heard of a single group that has endorsed or embraced the Republican proposal--not one. Not one. They do not have a single group--doctors or patients or nurses or health delivery professionals--that endorses their proposal. All of them endorse ours. Yet we are told by the Republican leadership that you are going to be denied the opportunity to even raise these issues in an orderly way, to have debate and discussion and an outcome decided on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
These are the areas that need to be discussed. These are the gaps in the Republican bill. Some of them probably could be worked on through an agreement--not a great number. But they certainly are the ones that have been mentioned and identified by the health professionals in this country that are essential if we are going to provide quality health care for the American people. And we are denied this. We are being stonewalled, those of us who believe the patients' interests should be advanced. The Republican leadership have closed us out. They say, `No. No.' 
They don't mind getting consideration for the bankruptcy bill. They don't say we will take the bankruptcy bill up, but there are only X number of amendments. No. They just went ahead and scheduled the bankruptcy bill, which, interestingly, is supported by major financial institutions and credit companies that have spent over $50 million in support of the legislation. Whom does that bill protect? It protects the banking and the financial interests over, I believe, the interests of the consumers. So we have seen that legislation that protects big business is on the fast track, and the legislation that protects patients and families is being denied the floor of the U.S. Senate for debate and discussion. 
I do not think, in the remaining time that we are here, outside of the various appropriations bills, there is any piece of legislation that is more important than this legislation. But we have been in a constant position now, for week after week after week, month after month after month. 
We were denied the opportunity to get even a markup in the relevant committee, in the Human Resources Committee. We were denied an opportunity to consider this as an amendment on other legislation. We have been denied the opportunity to have a full debate and discussion. We are told, `You take it or leave it. You take the three-amendment strategy or you just do not get any debate or discussion.' That is not satisfactory. Although the leadership has been able to prevent us from the opportunity of having that kind of debate and discussion up to this period of time, they will not be successful in denying us the chance to have the kind of debate that we need in order to protect the consumers of this country. 
So I think we have, again, missed an extraordinarily important opportunity to do the public business, to do the people's business, to try to do something about the quality of health care for the American people. We here this evening would like to give the assurance to the American people, as the leader has, as our Democratic leader has, that we will have the opportunity one way or the other to have consideration of this legislation before we adjourn. We should be able to do it in the way in which we deal with important legislation, where we call the legislation up and move toward the consideration of these various amendments, trying to work through a timeframe to get the final resolution. The Democratic leader even indicated that we were prepared to deal with these issues at nighttime, at 6 o'clock tonight, 6 o'clock in the evening. There is no reason in the world that the Senate of the United States should not work tonight, from 6 o'clock to 10 o'clock, for the next 4 hours, debating these particular issues, and do so tomorrow night, too. We could have done it last night as well. There is no reason, no reason in the world. If we believe this legislation is important, why aren't we here debating this issue tonight? What is so important, in terms of Members' schedules, that we are not debating or discussing this? 
I have been in the Senate for a period of time and we have had evening sessions. We have had two-track sessions many, many times. At this time in the session when there is important legislation to consider, Senator Daschle has proposed that to the majority leader, saying, 6 o'clock this evening, why aren't we out here considering and debating these issues tonight for 3 or 4 hours and having resolution of those? But we have been told no, we cannot do that either. We cannot take the time this evening or tomorrow evening, or Friday evening, or next week, or any of the evenings of next week to try to deal with the issues on the Patients' Bill of Rights--no. We are told we will not do it. You are not entitled to have that kind of debate and discussion. Evidently, the public interest with regard to health care will not be considered by the Republican leadership. 
So we will be forced, as the leader pointed out, to take the extraordinary steps that can be taken from a parliamentary point of view to move ahead and consider this at another time. We will continue to press the leadership for that consideration, because we believe that this issue is of such overpowering importance to children, to women, to grandparents, to members of the family, and it is essential that we deal with it. And we will, as our leader has pointed out. 
Now, we are told, as we are moving towards the consideration of the bankruptcy legislation, we will have a cloture motion filed so we will not be able to have debate on various amendments that are relevant to the issue at hand. They may not fall within the particular framework of the technical provisions of the cloture motion. So we are facing the prospect of another cloture vote coming up on this Friday. 
I am hopeful that we will be able to consider, on that particular piece of legislation, a modest increase in the minimum wage. But we are told that the leadership will not permit a debate or discussion on any increase in the minimum wage. 
I have been asked why we should consider having an amendment on increasing the minimum wage on this legislation. I have been asked, what is its relevancy to bankruptcy? The fact of the matter is that the average wage of people filing for bankruptcy is just over $17,000 a year. One of the principal reasons that individuals file bankruptcy is because their income has declined--their purchasing power has been reduced. No one in this Nation has seen a greater decline in their purchasing power than minimum wage workers. 
Mr. President, I have here a chart that reviews where the minimum wage has been in the past 40 years. 
As we can see, the real value of the minimum wage went up to $6, and then to $6.50, until it reached $7.38 in the mid to late 1960s. Again, it bounced up and down through the 1970s at about $6 or slightly above. Then we saw a continued decline down to $4.34 in 1989. We saw an increase again in 1991 and then the increases in 1996 and 1997 which brought it up to $5.15. 
The proposal I have made will increase the minimum wage in two stages--50 cents on January 1, 1999 and 50 cents on January 1, 2000. That will bring the nominal value of the minimum wage to $6.15, but the real value, because of inflation, will be only $5.76. 
Even if this body accepted the increase in the minimum wage, we would still be well below the historical value of the minimum wage for some 20 years in the 1960s and 1970s. These individuals on the lower rung of the economic ladder, the men and women who work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, hard-working men and women trying to provide for their families--they will still be earning well below what the minimum wage was worth for more than 20 years. 
This issue is a woman's issue, because 60 percent of all minimum-wage workers are women. It is a children's issue, because many, many of those women are single moms and, therefore, their income is going to dictate what they can provide for their children. It is a family issue. 
I will always remember the witness who described what an increase in the minimum wage would mean to her. She said, `It is very simple, Senator, we will only have to work two jobs now instead of three.' Only two jobs instead of three. What that means is increasing the ability of those parents to spend time with their children, increasing the ability of those parents to take a little time and work with their children on homework. The additional money may allow them to take their child to a ball game. Maybe they can afford a birthday present. Maybe they can afford to take a child out to dinner, or even see a movie. Of course, a vacation is completely out of reach--it is not even being considered. 
This is what I mean when I talk about family issues. We hear a great deal of discussion about family issues and about family values. The minimum wage is a family value. It is a working family value. It is saying to someone who works 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year that we are going to honor their work, and that in the United States of America working people are not going to live in poverty. These are family values. 
We are going to hear, Mr. President, when we get a chance to debate this--and I can understand why the Republican leadership does not want to permit us to debate it--we are going to hear that we don't need to have an increase in the minimum wage. The market will take care of these workers. If we do increase the minimum wage, opponents will claim it will add to inflation and unemployment. This is against the background of the most extraordinary economic growth in the history of this country, with the greatest prosperity, the lowest inflation, the lowest unemployment in a generation. We will hear, `We can't afford it; we're going to lose jobs.' We will hear that from Members of Congress who have experienced an increase in their own salary of more than $3,000 only last year. 
We will hear, `We just can't afford to do that for working Americans.' It is the working Americans, the working poor who have fallen further and further behind in their purchasing power--further behind than any group in our society. 
I think some of us remember those wonderful charts Secretary Reich used to present at the Joint Economic Committee when he talked about the five different economic groups and what has happened in the postwar period from 1947 right up to 1979. 
And it showed that the wage rates of these groups increased at similar rates. Incomes of those at the lower rungs went up in percentages as high as if not higher than those at the highest levels. This is not true any more. It is the top 1 percent, the top 5 percent, the top 20 percent. Their incomes are going up through the roof. Those at the lower end have been going right down through the cellar. This is an issue that we have an opportunity to do something about. 
Mr. President, I want to take a moment to answer some of the arguments that will be made with regard to an increase in the minimum wage, of what that means in terms of inflation. When we debate this issue, I will review some of the statements that our friends and colleagues made during those final hours of the 1996 debate about the effect on inflation and unemployment of the increase. These were the most extraordinary statements. I will not take the time of the Senate to go through them now, but they are just so out of touch with reality that it really is extraordinary. 
Raising the minimum wage does not fuel inflation. This chart shows what the inflation rate was per month during the year or two before the increase in 1996. The rate of inflation was relatively flat between February of 1996 and October 1996. It was pretty flat--it held fairly steady at three-tenths of 1 percent per month. 
The minimum wage increased to $4.75, and look what happened to inflation. The rate stayed steady. In October 1996, the inflation rate was maintained at three-tenths of 1 percent. Inflation declined in December 1996, and then went up and down slightly between January and September 1997. 
Then the minimum wage increased in September 1997 to $5.15. Here we see the continued decline of inflation. In June of 1998 the inflation rate was one-tenth of 1 percent. This chart puts the lie to claims that the minimum wage increase added to the rate of inflation in the United States. 
I believe that the overwhelming power of this argument comes from notions of basic fairness and justice. But if the opponents are going to claim that increasing the minimum wage will increase inflation, let us look at what happened over the period of the last two increases, going back to October 1996 and then the increase in September 1997. 
Mr. President, I would like to consider at the other argument that is made in opposition. That is the claim that raising the minimum wage causes unemployment to rise. 
Opponents always say, `If you increase the minimum wage, you're going to see a rise in unemployment.' I will come to teenage unemployment in a minute. Unemployment overall declined dramatically since the minimum wage increased in October 1996. 
And then, after the minimum wage increased again in September 1997, unemployment continued to drop. Now we are at 4.5 percent unemployment, which is virtually the lowest unemployment level in a generation. Since 1996, the nation has experienced the lowest rate of inflation and the lowest rate of inflation in a generation. 
So you cannot make the argument, Mr. President, that if we increase the minimum wage, it will add to the rate of inflation or add to the rate of unemployment. 
Mr. President, what is always said is, `Well, all right, you don't really understand it. It is teenagers, teenage unemployment. They are the ones who really get squeezed.' Let us look at teen unemployment, ages 16 to 19, over this same period. Before the minimum wage increase, you had some 16 percent teenage unemployment in 1996. Since the 1996 and 1997 increases, it has dropped to 15 percent unemployment. The fact of the matter is, Mr. President, that about a quarter of those who earn the minimum wage are teenagers. Many of those teenagers are trying to go out and work their way through their first or second year of community college. They are teenagers. These kids, in many instances, are the ones who are trying to earn in order to continue their education. They need that increase as well. 
So, Mr. President, this chart makes the point that the total unemployment for teenagers is down. 
Mr. President, the greatest opposition to this has come from the retail industry. But retail employment has grown by leaps and bounds over this period. It is growing 31 percent faster. Before the minimum wage increased, from September 1995 to September 1996--394,000 new retail jobs were added. The minimum wage increased in October 1996, and then again in September 1997. 
This is a 1-year period before the minimum wage went up. From September to September, 394,000 new retail jobs were added. Then in the 11 months after the increase took effect, 517,000 new jobs were added. This is very dramatic growth. 
The point about it is, Mr. President, that there is not a valid economic argument to be made. I wish we had the opportunity to engage in that debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate with those who are opposed to the increase because they claim they are concerned about teenage unemployment, about inflation and about the effect on people who work in retail stores and will lose their jobs. The facts belie those claims. 
Mr. President, we are talking about individuals who are still earning $2,900 below the poverty level for a family of three. 
What will this $1 an hour increase mean to minimum wage workers? It would buy almost 7 months of groceries. $1 an hour may not mean much to many in this country. Certainly, it doesn't mean a lot to the people who saw the stock market go up 370 points yesterday, gain over $1 trillion in value in one day. Of course, all of us are glad to have seen the stock market go up these past few days. 
$1 an hour might not make so much difference to those who are investing in the stock market, but it represents about 7 months of groceries to an average family of four. It buys about 8 months of rent for that family. It pays three-fourths of a year's tuition and fees at a community college. It is a matter of enormous importance and it is a matter of critical need for working families. 
When you come right down to it, this issue is really about dignity. It is about dignity for individuals who can pay their bills. It is about dignity for people who don't have to go on welfare. It is the dignity of a family knowing they will not have their electricity or their water turned off because they can't pay the bill. Raising the minimum wage is really about dignity. It is about a sense of pride. It is the way parents look at children and the way children look at parents. This is an issue of fairness, an issue of whether we as a society honor work, for people who will work and want to work; those people who are the child-care helpers, the teachers' aides in our schools. 
We talk a great deal about education. Teachers' aides are important. Many of them earn the minimum wage. We talk about the importance of Medicare and Medicaid and making sure that our parents are going to be able to live in dignity. Much of that dignity is provided for by health aides who earn the minimum wage. The men and women who clean office buildings at nighttime, by and large, are minimum-wage earners. These are people who have a sense of dignity and pride in themselves, as they should. 
This is an issue of fundamental fairness. In the past, this body has responded. It has responded at other times when the minimum wage has sunk this low. It has responded with Republican and Democratic leadership, with Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents, alike. But we are now being told by the Republican leadership that we are going to be denied the opportunity even to address this issue on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We are told, `We will not give you the time.' We will not have that debate tonight, here in the U.S. Senate, and vote at 10 o'clock tonight. 
What is more important to the 12 million Americans who would benefit from an increase than a debate this evening and a vote at 10 o'clock tonight? I can understand that many of my Republican colleagues don't want to vote on this issue. But that isn't a good enough reason. We are sent here to make choices. This is a choice that ought to be made in the light of day, or even in the evening, but it ought to be made here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Parliamentary tricks should not be used to deny us the opportunity to address it. This is not a complicated issue, involving constitutional questions. This is a simple issue of fairness and justice. The Members of this body know it. The Members of this body understand it. We don't need any more hearings on this issue. 
People know what this issue is all about. It is simple and plain: Here in the U.S. Senate, are we going to take steps that will guarantee some fairness to American workers who need that increase and have been falling further and further behind? Are we going to say, as a society, that we are all going to move together, that we have a sense of common purpose and common direction? Will we make sure that our fellow citizens can participate in this extraordinary economic expansion? Or are we going to say, no, we will let you stay out there in the cold, we won't even debate any kind of increase? Sure, you are providing for your kids, but we will not even permit the U.S. Senate the opportunity to debate this and vote on this, up or down; up or down. 
Mr. President, that is why this issue is so important. I believe it is one of fundamental fairness. It is a defining issue. It has been a defining issue at other times, and it is at this time. I am hopeful that we could have a time to debate this issue. We are not interested in prolonged debate and discussion. As I mentioned, we would settle for a reasonable period of time to debate this and have a vote. It is not a complex issue. We are going to continue to pursue it because we believe it is right and it is just and it is fair. Those are values which I think most of us were sent here to uphold in the U.S. Senate. 
How much time remains?

Mr. KENNEDY. As the Senator has pointed out, it is 7 o'clock this evening. We had last evening, we will have tomorrow evening. There is no reason we can't go from 7 to 10 or 10:30. The Senator remembers the times where we have had these double sessions. They are not a very unusual process and procedure. I will include in the Record tomorrow the instances when we have had these, generally at the end of sessions, but they have been a two-track process by which we deal with certain measures during the day and others during the course of the evening. 
Does the Senator agree with me, for example, on the Patients' Bill of Rights that if we took Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday evenings and did it from 7 to 10, 10:30 probably this week, three different evenings, there would be a good opportunity where we could probably finish that legislation, or perhaps take one or more evenings of next week to address the issues which the Senator has talked about. We could have a good debate on the question of minimum wage--whether it has been inflationary, whether there has been loss of employment, the impact on small employment, the various kinds of arguments that have been made--and we would be able to dispose of that in a fair and reasonable time, as well as the agriculture and farm issues, pay equity, and other issues? 
Does the Senator believe, if we knew now that we were going to do this, the membership would become engaged in this legislation, particularly if we had notice that we were going to consider various legislation with due notice, in 2 or 3 nights we would consider X legislation, which is sort of a time-honored way that we have proceeded here? Is that the kind of arrangement that the Senator is looking for so that the membership would have notice of the legislation and we could have that kind of debate during the course of the evenings? Does the Senator think there is any other business that is more important for us to be involved in at this time than those issues which people have expressed an interest and concern about such as the Patients' Bill of Rights issue?

Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. Would he not agree with me that we have a general understanding that Thursday nights are the late night in the Senate? We do that with the idea that we hope we can finish various measures that may go on over to Friday out of consideration to some of those Senators who live in different parts, some distance away from the Nation's Capital, to try at least to accommodate some of their interests. 
So the idea that we have a night session is not really unique or special. Members are here during the period of the week. They are on notice now. We have just come back from a good break in the period of August, but we have a limited time that is available. I must say, I fail to find an adequate response by the Republican leadership to the Senator's eminently fair and reasonable proposal. It would seem to me we ought to at least try it for a week, try it for a week or two and find out how we are proceeding. We could consider the Patients' Bill of Rights, for example, a measure of enormous importance to the millions of families in this country. We have been denied that opportunity to have the debate. We have always been told we cannot have that debate because we are not going to take up a lot of the Senate's time. 
The way I understand the leader's proposal is we might be able to do that in the evening time until we reach a conclusion on that so we would not interfere with the appropriations legislation. 
What is possibly the justification not to do it? Are we saying our own personal requirements are of greater importance than trying to deal with the business of America's families--whether they are in South Dakota or in Massachusetts--who are very, very much affected by what we fail to do here in reaching some resolution on the Patients' Bill of Rights? 
I do not know whether the leader had an opportunity to see the list of the various parts of the Patients' Bill of Rights bill that I had on the floor a short time ago, but I know the Senator is very familiar with them. Doesn't he agree that probably 17 or 18 topic areas are about it with regard to the Patients' Bill of Rights, and probably even some of those areas could be accommodated by individual Members on both sides who are really interested in trying to reach a resolution? We could deal with these other measures--whether women are going to be in clinical trials; whether we are going to have appeals procedures; whether we are going to have gag rules--and the various other protections the Senator mentioned earlier. 
Doesn't the Senator feel we could work that through in a reasonable period of time if we involved the Senate in debate during these weekday nights?

Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the leader for, again, his leadership in this important area. Next time there is objection to the proposal--the Republican leadership says we can't afford the time for this; we can't afford the time to debate it-- it is going to ring very hollow after we have seen the very reasonable request of the leader to debate those issues this evening. The Senator from South Dakota has introduced the legislation. He is here tonight to debate it, and I welcome the chance to join with him in debating that. We are here ready to go on this legislation. We could do it this evening or any night this week. It is not satisfactory enough for the American people, just to say, as the Republican leadership has, `No, we are not going to do this, and we are going to refuse to permit this debate and discussion.' That is not really in the great traditions of this body. This body was supposed to deal with the public interest, the unfinished agenda. 
There is nothing more important than protecting American families from decisions being made by insurance companies rather than health professionals. There is nothing more important, in terms of the health care of these families, before the Senate this year. I think it is grossly unfair. 
So I commend, again, the leader for bringing this up. I know the leader will bring up the amendment. Then we will hear from the other side, `Oh, my goodness, we can't do that; we can't do this. It's impossible to do it.' We could have done it this evening; probably last night and the other nights this week. I certainly join in supporting his efforts to insist that we are going to debate these, and we are going to reach resolution on these matters before we conclude. 
I thank the Senator.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Boston University School of Medicine on its 150 anniversary. The School of Medicine has a long and distinguished history, and I am proud to join in paying tribute to its remarkable leadership for the city of Boston and the nation. 
Boston University School of Medicine was founded in 1848 as the New England Female Medical College, and was the first institution in the world to offer medical education to women. In 1864, the school graduated its first African-American female physician, Rebecca Lee. In 1873, Boston University merged with the New England Female Medical College to establish a co-educational School of Medicine. 
In addition to being the first medical school to graduate women, Boston University School of Medicine was also the first school to establish Home Medical Services, an educational and patient care service that continues today. The School of Medicine has constantly introduced innovations in medical education and played a central role in developing the Boston University School of Public Health. 
Down through the years, Boston University School of Medicine has provided outstanding service to our community. It is renowned for its clinical care and its professional training in a vast network of affiliated hospitals including Boston Medical Center, community health centers, and physicians' offices. In 1995, this commitment to service earned the school the Association of American Medical College's Outstanding Community Service Award. 
Mr. President, I congratulate Boston University School of Medicine on its 150 years of excellence, and I know that its outstanding tradition, professional commitment, and community service will continue in the years ahead.

Mr. KENNEDY. The request has been made to go to the bankruptcy bill which affects about 1,300,000 people in this country. We do have an opportunity to consider other legislation, like the HMO bill, that affects 120 million people, and we are being asked to go to the bankruptcy bill when we are not scheduling the campaign finance bill that passed the House of Representatives that involves the elimination of many of the abuses of campaign finance. Some are very concerned about the fact that some $50 million have been expended by banks and credit card companies to move this legislation forward. 
I am interested in inquiring of the leader whether we can have any indication as to when we might have the opportunity of scheduling these other measures which affect the average family, rather than special interests, such as the banks and the credit card companies. When I go back home, people talk to me about health care. It is the bankers and credit card people who are talking about the bankruptcy bill. 
I wonder whether we are going to have any kind of assurance that we are going to move ahead with this legislation and we are going to have an opportunity to address and debate the merits of the Republican legislation, as well as the merits of the legislation, for example, on HMOs that has been introduced by the Democratic leader.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just about an hour ago, we had the majority leader taking the floor and making the request that we go to the bankruptcy legislation, as is his authority, and then making a motion to move toward the bankruptcy bill and filing cloture. And I assume, as others would, that we will be debating this legislation next week. 
In an exchange with the majority leader, I questioned him as to why we were not considering taking up the HMO legislation, the Patients' Bill of Rights. We could either take up the legislation that had been introduced by the Republicans and lay that down as our leader, Senator Daschle, has suggested, or permit some other way or means that we could have a full debate and discussion on that legislation. 
As I pointed out in the very brief exchange with the majority leader, we are talking considering legislation that affects about 1.4 million bankruptcies, with all the importance and consequences that has, as expressed by our friends and colleagues from Iowa and from Illinois and stated eloquently by both of them in recent times, or whether we should be considering a measure that affects 165 million Americans with health insurance coverage. 
When I go home to Massachusetts and travel around the state, I hear from families wondering when the Congress is going to take action to make sure that health care decisions are going to be made by medical officials, by doctors and by nurses, rather than by accountants and insurance company personnel. That is what the people are talking about. That is what they were talking about during August. 
I asked the majority leader whether we would be able to have the opportunity to debate this issue. And as is the wont of the majority leader and the assistant majority leader, Senator Nickles, they have said, look, you are either going to take it or leave it with our proposal. You are either going to take it the way we want it--that is, you can offer two or three amendments, and we can offer two or three amendments --and, if you are willing to take that, we are willing to schedule it; otherwise, we are not. 
They are, for all intents and purposes, gagging the Senate. We do not have any such condition on the measure that is before us this afternoon, the bankruptcy bill. There are a number of very worthwhile, substantive amendments for this measure. The majority leader did not come out here and say take it or leave it on the bankruptcy bill. No, no. Why? Because the credit card industry and the banking industry have the votes to pass this legislation, and, as has been publicly recognized, they have expended some $50 million in order to support the movement of this legislation. 
Yet, we find out that there are children in our country today who are being denied a CAT scan because of an automobile accident or because of a bicycle accident or because of some other kind of an accident. They do not make large contributions to push forward legislation that will help them. Nor do the women who are denied access to clinical trials or obstetrical and gynecological care. 
And so, Mr. President, we are being effectively gagged by the Republican leadership in debating and discussing and voting on the most important health measure that we will be faced with this year. Again, when asked when we can proceed to this important legislation, the majority leader, as is his wont, calls for regular order: We are not going to listen to any voices in the Senate that have been trying to get to this measure for over a year and a half, either a hearing or a markup in the appropriate committee. No, thumbs down. Scheduled on the floor of the Senate? Absolutely not, unless you take it our way. 
Now, Mr. President, you can--and the majority leader has been successful up to this time--avoid having the opportunity for such a debate and discussion, but I do not really understand the reasons why. Why are the Republicans objecting to debating the gag issue or about emergency room access? Why shouldn t patients who believe they are having an emergency based on a reasonable person's judgment be assured coverage at the nearest emergency room? Why shouldn't we be able to debate what would be the appropriate responsibility of HMOs on these issues? 
Why shouldn't we be able to debate whether you can keep your own doctor or whether you have access to specialists or whether you are able to have specialists for primary care, as many women, in particular, so need in our society today? And why not discuss the importance of access to clinical trials, or a right to timely appeals--both internal and external--and health plan accountability? Why should the health insurance industry be the only industry that can cause death and disability and be excluded from accountability in the United States of America? Should we not have the opportunity to debate that issue and call the roll? Not according to the majority leader. No, no, not according to the majority leader. You either take it or leave it. 
Now, that has been the position effectively on HMOs, the position on campaign financing, the position on any increase in the minimum wage: Take ours or leave it. 
Now, he is entitled and has authority as the majority leader to make these decisions, but we also have prerogatives in this body, and we can exercise those prerogatives and, as Senator Daschle has indicated, will either do it in a regular way according to the rules of the Senate or we will have some other opportunity to do so. 
This body should not be gagged, as the majority leader is doing when he responds: You will take three amendments and that is it. It is very clear what the priorities are for the Republican leadership--protect the banks and the credit card companies--protect the insurance industry--protect their friends. All you have to do is look at who is going to benefit from the HMO reform and patients' rights and who is going to benefit from the bankruptcy legislation. 
Who is going to benefit from the bankruptcy legislation? The banks and the credit card companies that have been among the most profitable industries in this country in the last few years. Who benefits from Patients' Bill of Rights? Working families benefit from it. Children benefit from it. Senior citizens benefit from it. The average citizen in this country benefits from it. 
But, no, no, the Senate hasn't got time for that. Make no mistake. What was determined this afternoon by the leadership is that the Senate is favoring the banks and credit card companies and we are giving short shrift, short shrift to those who are dependent upon, in too many instances, the kinds of HMOs in this country that are not putting the medical decisions in the hands of doctors. 
Why is it that nearly 200 of the leading national medical associations, nursing organizations, patient coalitions, disability groups, mental health groups, religious organizations, small businesses and consumer groups support the Daschle bill? I have been in the Chamber when I have listened to the majority leader and my friend from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, talk about their bill. We haven't heard of one single patients' organization that supports their bill. 
Every one of them supports the Daschle bill. So, when we say let us at least have the opportunity to debate it, we mean let's discuss each of the various elements. Let us have an opportunity to address those measures, with relevant amendments--they are right here. I would settle for amendments on the particular measures on this chart this afternoon, if I were asked, with time limits. But let's have accountability. Let's have accountability. Why is the Republican leadership saying to every doctor who is represented by those organizations, to every nurse, to every patient or survivor of every breast cancer group, `No, we can't debate your proposal'? 
So we are going to work at it and we are going to keep at it, time in and time out. 
I know there are others who want to speak. How much time do I have?

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, under the leadership of President Clinton, the country has enjoyed six years of economic growth. Unemployment is at its lowest level in a generation. Inflation is the lowest in 40 years. Despite this week's gymnastics by the stock market, economic indicators continue to be strong. Job growth is projected to continue throughout this year, and inflation is predicted to remain at historically low levels. 
But for most Americans, it's someone else's boom. Too many citizens are just one paycheck away from bankruptcy. Facing a sudden health crisis, a divorce, or some other family emergency--these families often have no choice but to declare bankruptcy. 
My Republican colleagues respond with legislation to make it easier for banks and credit card companies to squeeze these already-struggling families even harder. I say, giant corporations don't need the help as much as families do. 
And the best way to provide effective help is to raise the minimum wage. The amendment I have introduced today will raise the minimum wage by 50 cents on January 1 next year and another 50 cents on January 1, 2000. As we begin the next century, the minimum wage will be $6.15 an hour. 
Mr. President, as this chart illustrates, we can see where the minimum wage has gone since 1955 in terms of real dollars. 
We were back here at $4.34 in 1988. We raised the minimum wage here in a two-step procedure, and then it declined in terms of real purchasing power. And now we are talking about raising it up to what would be $6.15 an hour in the year 2000. But if you look at this chart, Mr. President, you will see that the actual purchasing power in the year 2000 in today's dollars would be only $5.76. This chart is a constant, real dollar chart. And even if we raise it to this level, we will still be below where the minimum wage was for some 15 years from the 1960s through the 1970s under Republicans and Democrats alike--below that level at a time of extraordinary prosperity for millions of Americans--millions of Americans--even with that increase. 
If we do not increase it, if we do not accept this amendment, we will find out that the minimum wage effectively will be not $5.15 an hour, but $4.82 an hour, which will put us close to the lowest levels in the last 35 years in terms of purchasing power for working families at the lower end of the economic ladder. 
Those at the bottom of the economic ladder have not received their fair share of the nation's remarkable growth. Working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, minimum wage workers earn just $10,700--$2,900 below the poverty level for a family of three. 
In the midst of what many experts are calling `the best economy ever,' 12 million working Americans are still earning poverty-level wages. 
For them, survival is the daily goal. If they work hard enough and their hours are long enough, they can make ends meet--but only barely. They don't have time for their families. They can't participate adequately in activities with their children. 
They can't afford to buy birthday presents or do the countless other things that most of us take for granted. 
We know who minimum wage workers are. They assist teachers in classrooms across the country. They care for the chronically ill in their homes. They are child care workers and aides in nursing homes. They sell us groceries at the supermarket, and serve us coffee at the local coffee shop. They clean corridors and empty trash in office buildings in countless communities around the nation. 
They are workers like Valerie Bell, a custodian for a contractor in Baltimore, who told us what a higher minimum wage means in human terms. For workers and their families, it means far more than dollars and cents. It means dignity. As she said, `We no longer have to receive food stamps or other social services to supplement our incomes. We can fix up our homes and invest in our neighborhoods. We can spend more at the local grocery store. We can work two low-wage jobs, rather than three low-wage jobs, and spend more time with our families. Our utilities won't be cut off. We can pay the medical bills we accumulated from not having health benefits in our jobs.' 
Minimum wage workers are people like Cathy Adams, a home health aide from Viola, IL. Cathy is a high school graduate who is currently enrolled in a computer training program at the local community college. She lives with her two daughters, who are 10 and 11. 
Cathy works 11 and one-half hours a day, five days a week, caring for a woman with multiple sclerosis. She bathes her, dresses her and feeds her. She does the grocery shopping, the laundry, and the cleaning. She runs errands and schedules doctors' appointments. 
Cathy likes her job and is fond of her client. But she finds it hard to live on $5.30 an hour. She told us in March that `I literally live paycheck to paycheck. After paying the bills, whatever is left over goes to groceries. I have $9 in my savings account and worry about being able to save for my girls' education. We rarely have money to go to a movie or eat out at a restaurant. 
The other day, my girls asked me to take them ice skating at school. While it only cost $10, I had to think twice about whether we could afford it.' 
And minimum wage earners are workers like Kimberly Frazier, a child care aide from Philadelphia. Kimberly works full time and earns $5.20 an hour. She is a single mother with three children. 
Kimberly says that her salary barely covers her bills--rent of $250 a month, food, utilities, clothing for three growing children, and carfare to get to work. Kimberly says, `I can't afford a car and pay for gas and insurance so I rely on public transportation. If I had a car, I could get out to the places where there are better paying jobs. And, like all Americans, I dream of buying my own house so that I can raise my kids in a neighborhood that has less crime and more trees. But I know that, although I work and study as hard as I can, I will never have the down payment for a house earning the minimum wage.' 
Kimberly concluded that `A dollar an hour probably doesn't sound like a lot to many people, but to me and my children it would mean a real improvement in our lives.' 
Workers like Valerie Bell, Cathy Adams, and Kimberly Frazier tell stories that are repeated in communities across the nation. That's why we say now is the time to raise the minimum wage. 
Nay-sayers parrot the same arguments they have always used against a fair increase. They claim an increase will damage the economy, cut jobs, and hurt the very people it's intended to help. The facts belie those claims. 
A study released May 6 by the Economic Policy Institute proves the point. The two most recent increases in the minimum wage did not cause the sky to fall. There was no measurable effect on jobs; no measurable effect on inflation. The only measurable effect on low-income workers was positive. They received the pay increase they deserved. Mr. President, 60 percent of the benefit of the 1996-1997 increases went to families in the bottom 40 percent of the income groups; a third of the benefit went to the poorest families, those in the bottom 20 percent. Nearly three-quarters of those who benefited were adults over the age of 20. On the average, minimum-wage workers contributed over half of their family's weekly earnings. 
The most recent data support the increase. Raising the minimum wage does not cause unemployment for men and women, adults, teens or anyone else. Look at the teenagers. We have a chart for the teenagers. The argument is made that the most vulnerable group is teenagers. But if we look at the employment levels for ages 16 through 19, before the minimum wage increased to $4.75 in 1996 and then to $5.15 in 1997, we see that the total employment for teenagers has risen steadily. Nearly 400,000 more teenagers are working today than before the increase took effect. So increasing the minimum wage has not lowered teenage employment. 
Teenage unemployment has dropped dramatically during the same period, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate was nearly 17 percent when the minimum wage was first increased. Today the unemployment rate among teenagers is 14 percent, a drop of almost 20 percent since the last increase. 
Minimum wage opponents typically claim that low-wage industries will lay off workers rather than pay a higher minimum wage. But look what happened in the retail industry where many low-wage workers are concentrated. In the year before the minimum wage was increased, retail employment grew by just under 400,000 jobs. In 1994 and 1995, before we increased the minimum wage to $4.75, there were 394,000 new retail jobs. In the eleven months since we raised the minimum wage, there have been 500,000 new retail jobs; retail employment has increased since the last raise. The argument that raising the minimum wage causes job loss for the most vulnerable, the teenagers and those who are the working poor, does not hold. The facts are not there. That argument cannot be made. 
Retail employment grew over 25 percent faster since the minimum wage was actually increased because, many economists believe, when you do get a respectable wage for minimum wage, people will go back to work and go to work and increasingly move off unemployment or the welfare system, because they are able to provide for their families. 
Despite these figures, too many of our Republican friends oppose giving minimum wage workers an additional $1 an hour. Instead, their priority is reforming bankruptcy laws by rewarding banks and credit card companies who target low-income families. That will be the item on the agenda, according to the majority leader. So today I am filing the minimum wage as an amendment to the bankruptcy bill. 
Democrats agree, plums for the rich and crumbs for everyone else is the wrong priority. We need to do more for working families and communities across America. We can do more by raising the minimum wage, and with the strong support of President Clinton, Democrats in the Senate and House and some courageous Republicans, I intend to do so. 
I see my colleagues here. Let me just point out what this issue is really all about. This is a women's issue, because more than 60 percent of the recipients are women. This is a family issue, because many of those women have one child or more. So it is a children's issue. What kind of life are these children going to lead? What kind of atmosphere are they going to be growing up in? Are they going to have a parent available to them or is that parent going to be out working two or three jobs? Is that parent going to be able to treat that child with dignity? 
So this is an important issue. It's a family issue, a children's issue, a women's issue, and most of all, more than any other issue we will vote on here in the U.S. Senate, it is a defining fairness issue. It is a fairness issue. It is an issue whether America is going to say to those Americans who are prepared to work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, that they will be able to live out of poverty. That is the issue. 
Are we going to back up the speeches here in the U.S. Senate that say we applaud work? We are talking about those who are working. If you are working, you deserve a fair wage. With the most extraordinary prosperity we have seen in recent times, with the kind of creation of wealth we all read about--the stories about $2 trillion being lost in the stock market in a period of 24 hours, we are talking about nickels and dimes for working men and women. We are not even talking about the kinds of increases Members of Congress have received during the same period of time. We are not talking about that, which is far in excess of what we are talking about for minimum wage workers. How bold will our colleagues be. Will they turn thumbs down on working families, and continue to accept the increases in their own pay received since the last increase in the minimum wage? 
This is a fairness issue. It is whether we, as a country, are going to follow a proud tradition of Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents, Republican support in the Congress of the United States and Democratic support. This has been, until recent years, a bipartisan effort--a bipartisan effort. The question is whether it will continue to be a bipartisan effort, to try and make sure that working families in this country have a living wage. 
I hope this body will be willing to accept this amendment. 
I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, finally, on another measure we have attempted to bring up here, and we will have the opportunity to do so, it is to recognize a fundamental issue of fairness and equity in our country, and that is an increase in the minimum wage. 
I ask the Chair to let me know when I have 1 minute left. 
We have had the most extraordinary economic prosperity in the history of this country. We have had the explosion in terms of Wall Street, even with its ups and downs. We have the lowest rates of unemployment, the lowest rates of inflation. 
Over the many debates which have taken place since I have been here in the U.S. Senate, since 1962--and we have raised the minimum wage during this time five different times with Republican and Democratic support--we are always faced with two issues: If we increase the minimum wage, we are going to add to inflation and add to unemployment. It is fair for those who oppose the increase in the minimum wage to ask us, now that we saw the last increase in 1996-1997--we have seen an increase of 90 cents. For whom? The working poor; men and women working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, who pay their bills and play by the rules--words that were used by the Senator from Iowa. They are the workers. They are the workers, struggling. 
Mr. President, our particular amendment, if successful, with a dollar in the next 2 years, would move it up by the year 2000 to $6.15. That would be $5.76, in terms of purchasing power. It would still be lower than what it was for a period of some 20 years--25 years, in purchasing power, at a time of extraordinary prosperity and economic growth. 
In every one of these debates they say if you raise it, you will see higher unemployment and you will see higher inflation. Look what happened the last time. When we raised the minimum wage in 1997, the unemployment rate was 4.9 percent and the rate of inflation was 1.7. Then we raised the minimum wage. We raised the minimum wage. Today, the unemployment rate is--higher? No, it is lower. It is 4.5 percent, and the rate of inflation is 1.4 percent. Mr. President, 3.7 million new jobs have been added. Executive salaries have exploded and gone up through the roof, but the real purchasing income for the needy working families of this country continues to fall further and further behind. 
Those who receive the minimum wage primarily are women--60 percent. It is a women's issue. It is a children's issue. These are children of working families. Family values? This is it. When you get an increase in the minimum wage, those families say, `Now we no longer have to work three jobs, we can work two. Maybe we don't have the time to spend with our children.' But this is an issue of dignity for those who are out there working. It is an issue of fairness. It is an issue of decency. 
This body, at the time of this extraordinary economic growth and prosperity, at a time when we in this body have benefited from a cost-of-living adjustment of more than $3,000 since our last increase in the minimum wage, ought to be able to say to those working poor that we understand, when they work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, they ought not to be continuing to live in poverty. 
Mr. President, those issues are going to come back to us and we will address them, I guarantee you, before the end of the session. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, as I understand it, the proposal that was made by the minority leader would have only permitted amendments that were relevant to the underlying measure, which would be the Patients' Bill of Rights, and that would have still granted to the majority leader the opportunity to move ahead, as we must, with the various appropriations bills, and appropriations conference reports. 
As I understand, if the leader's proposal had been accepted, we would then have had the opportunity to consider this very important piece of legislation in an orderly way that would ensure adequate debate and discussion. The proposal would have ensured, if the Senator would agree, an opportunity to debate relevant amendments on critically important issues. It would have allowed the Senate to debate amendments that would ensure: that health care decisions are being decided by doctors rather than insurance company accountants; that all women have access to appropriate specialists for the gynecological and obstetrician care that they need; that patients with life-threatening conditions have access to clinical trials; an effective end to gag practices that inhibit doctors from making medical recommendations and suggestions based on their patients' needs; that all patients have access to a meaningful and timely internal and external appeal, similar to what we have in Medicare, for example; and that the States themselves, if they so choose, to find further accountability for those who are going to practice medicine. 
Am I correct that these elements were included in the legislation which the minority leader introduced, and that these are measures--along with others, that the minority leader thinks the Senate ought to have an opportunity to debate, discuss and vote upon--were based in part on the comments that have been made to the minority leader, I am sure, from people in his own State, and from representatives of the 170 leading patient and medical organizations in this country? 
These are the groups that are supporting the leader's legislation, and they are supporting this action as well. And I understand that now the Republican leadership has just objected to our request to move forward to debate on health care legislation, on the Patients' Bill of Rights? Is that what we have just seen on the floor of the Senate?

Mr. KENNEDY. I welcome the opportunity for those who support the Republican position to provide the Senate with the names of the medical organizations and the patient organizations that support their proposal. Yet I think this may not be possible, because I believe they do not exist. 
But let me ask the Senator if I state this correctly. We debated the defense authorization bill for eight days and 124 amendments were offered; in fact, 10 were cosponsored by the majority leader and the assistant majority leader. We spent five days on agricultural appropriations with 55 amendments offered; seven days on the most recent budget resolution with 105 amendments; nineteen days on the highway bill with 100 amendments offered. 
Does the Senator agree with me that we ought to be able to deal with patient protection legislation in a timely way that might not even come close to the time spent on other pieces of legislation that we have had here earlier in the year? Does the Senator think, given the fact we had spent 19 days on the highway bill, that we ought to be able to spend at least a few days on relevant amendments on something that affects every family in this country, affects their children, affects husbands and wives, affects grandparents in a very, very special and personal way? Does the Senator agree that this would not be a wasted period of time in terms of the remaining several weeks for debate? And would not the Senate minority leader be willing to work out a satisfactory kind of time frame so that we could have this debate?

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, further reserving the right to object, would this unanimous consent request permit debate and discussion on the principal concerns outlined in the President's letter to the majority leader? Would this request permit a full discussion and debate on each of these? They all appear to be relevant. And could we have the assurance that the minority leader would have the opportunity to formulate amendments and have a debate and discussion of at least these particular proposals?

Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate, I am sure, what you intended to be a compliment, but I would like to know whether the leader or other Members would be able to at least raise for debate and discussion each of the rather thoughtful observations that have been made by the President of the United States to the majority leader. And I understand that the majority leader, or his spokesman, the Senator from Oklahoma, is not prepared to permit the observations and shortcomings of the Republican proposal to be considered, if I am not wrong, to be made individually. 
Let me ask further, in the appeals procedures in the Republican proposal, you have put a strict limitation on the circumstances under which patients can appeal health plan decisions. It has to reach $1,000 in order to qualify for appeal. That would effectively rule out any child, for example, that might have had a bicycle accident or a hockey accident or football accident from being able to be guaranteed a right to an appeal under the Republican proposal. 
Would we have an opportunity to debate this limitation and others in the appeals section of the Republican proposal?

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I sent this amendment to the desk on behalf of myself and Senators Lautenberg, D'Amato, and Torricelli. 
Mr. President, ten years ago, in December 1988, 270 people, including 189 Americans were killed in the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. As a result of the intense and skillful investigation that followed, Britain and the United States indicted 2 Libyan intelligence agents. 
The leader of Libya, Colonel Muammar Qadafi, refused to extradite the suspects to either the United States or the United Kingdom to stand trial. As a result, the international community, acting through the United Nations Security Council, imposed economic sanctions on Libya. The sanctions include a worldwide ban on Libya's national airline and a ban on flights into and out of Libya by the airlines of other nations. They also include a prohibition on supplying arms, airplane parts, and certain oil equipment to Libya, and a freeze on Libyan Government funds in other countries. 
Despite these sanctions, Colonel Qadafi has refused to turn over the suspects to either the United States or the United Kingdom. He has said, however, that he will transfer them to a third country to stand trial. 
A week ago, in a major development in this case, the United States and the United Kingdom proposed that Colonel Qadafi transfer the suspects to the Netherlands to stand trial before a Scottish court, under Scottish law, and with a panel of Scottish judges. Last Thursday, the United Nations Security Council endorsed this proposal and called on Colonel Qadafi to transfer the suspects promptly. 
The Administration has told Colonel Qadafi that this is a take-it-or-leave-it proposal and that it is non-negotiable. Secretary of State Albright has said that the United States will urge a worldwide oil embargo against Libya in the United Nations Security Council if Colonel Qadafi rejects this offer and refuses to transfer the suspects to the Netherlands to stand trial. The Security Council is scheduled to conduct the next periodic review of Libyan sanctions on October 30. All of us hope that Colonel Qadafi will accept this plan before that date. 
To send a clear message to Colonel Qadafi, this resolution calls on him to transfer the indicted suspects to the Netherlands promptly, so that they can stand trial before the Scottish court in the Netherlands. The resolution supports the commitment by the United States Government not to negotiate with Colonel Qadafi on the details of the proposal. If Colonel Qadafi fails to transfer the suspects to the Netherlands before the end of October, the resolution calls on the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to introduce a resolution in the Security Council to impose a worldwide embargo against Libya and actively seeks its enactment. 
The families of the victims of Pan Am 103 have waited too long for justice. The Administration's plan is a reasonable opportunity to end the long impasse over these suspects, and achieve a significant victory in the ongoing battle against international terrorism. 
I urge my colleagues to approve this resolution.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege on behalf of the administration to introduce the Immigration and Nationalization Service Restructuring Act of 1998, and I urge the Senate to support it. The purpose of the act is to strengthen the enforcement of the Nation's immigration laws at the borders and in other parts of the country, and also to strengthen the many immigration and citizenship services that the INS provides. 
The Nation has a long and distinguished history of welcoming immigrants and refugees who come to this country legally. But because the United States is widely viewed around the world as a land of extraordinary economic opportunities, these opportunities are often a magnet for illegal immigration. The Immigration and Naturalization Service has two equally important missions. It provides services and benefits to immigrants and refugees eligible for assistance under our laws, and it enforces the laws that prevent illegal immigration. 
In recent years, the effectiveness of the INS in carrying out these two complex and often competing missions has been increasingly criticized. Many critics say that the agency is suffering from `mission overload' and proposals have been made to dismantle the agency and assign its responsibilities to other parts of the Federal Government. 
One such proposal was made by the Commission on Immigration Reform, which conducted a comprehensive study of the functions and capabilities of the INS. The Commission's report contains some well-reasoned findings and excellent recommendations. However, the Commission's proposal for structural reform is highly controversies because it seeks to reassign core INS responsibilities to other federal agencies, the services and benefits function would be assigned to the Department of State, and the enforcement function would be assigned to the Department of Justice. 
Under Commissioner Doris Meissner's impressive leadership, the Immigration and Naturalization Service has made significant progress in identifying its problems, developing strategies to correct them, and implementing successful reforms. A prime example is the significant achievements of the INS in expediting the asylum process. Today, asylum applications are processed in weeks, not months, and legitimate refugees fleeing persecution are granted prompt asylum. 
Nonetheless, Commissioner Meissner is the first to admit that the agency faces continuing serious challenges that impede the agency's ability to carry out its basic responsibilities. The most significant problems are insufficient accountability between field offices and headquarters, the lack of consistency in its actions, the need for greater professionalism overlapping internal responsibilities, and weaknesses in regional and local management. 
The administration has concluded, and I agree, that the most effective way to address these problems is by modifying the agency, not dismantling it. After considerable study and analysis, the administration has developed worthwhile reforms to address the problems. 
The Immigration and Nationalization Service Restructuring Act of 1998 will untangle the overlapping and often confusing organizational structure of the INS and replace it with two clear chains of command--one for enforcement and the other for the provision of services. These two equally important divisions will report, through their respective directors, to the INS Commissioner. The proposed act will maintain the integrity of the agency, and preserve its vast knowledge, skills and abilities, and use them in a more effective and efficient framework. 
I urge my colleagues to support this approach and approve this needed and important legislation.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator Enzi and the other original cosponsors of this bill, Senator Jeffords, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Brownback, in celebrating the final passage of the Postal Employees Safety Enhancement Act. I especially want to commend Senator Enzi for his leadership on this bill. His tireless devotion to the safety and health of the nation's workers has resulted today in passage of significant improvements for employees of the United States Postal Service. I am pleased to have worked with him on the passage of this important legislation, which will extend coverage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act to employees of the United States Postal Service. The bill has broad bipartisan support, and it is supported by the Administration as well. 
Few issues are more important to working families than health and safety on the job. For the past 28 years, OSHA has performed a critical role--protecting American workers from on-the-job injuries and illnesses. 
In carrying out this mission, OSHA has made an extraordinary difference in people's lives. Death rates from on-the-job accidents have dropped by over 60% since 1970--much faster than before the law was enacted. More than 140,000 lives have been saved. 
Occupational illnesses and injuries have dropped by one-third since OSHA's enactment--to a record low rate of 7.4 per 100 workers in 1996. 
These numbers are still unacceptably high, but they demonstrate that OSHA is a success by any reasonable measure. 
Even more lives have been saved in the past two places where OSHA has concentrated its efforts. Death rates have fallen by 61% in construction and 67% in manufacturing. Injury rates have dropped by half in construction, and nearly one-third in manufacturing. Clearly, OSHA works best where it works hardest. 
Unfortunately, these efforts do not apply to federal agencies. The original OSHA statute required only that federal agencies provide `safe and healthful places and conditions of employment' to their employees. Specific OSHA safety and health rules did not apply. 
In 1980, President Carter issued an Executive Order that solved this problem in part. It directed federal agencies to comply with all OSHA safety standards, and it authorized OSHA to inspect workplaces and issue citations for violations. 
President Carter's action was an important step, but more needs to be done. When OSHA inspects a federal workplace and finds a safety violation, OSHA can direct the agency to eliminate the hazard. But OSHA has no authority to seek enforcement of its order in court, and it cannot assess a financial penalty on the agency to obtain compliance. 
The situation is especially serious in the Postal Service. Postal employees suffer one of the highest injury rates in the federal government. In 1996 alone, 78,761 postal employees were injured on the job--more than nine injuries and illnesses for every hundred workers. The total injury and illness rate among Postal Service workers represents almost half of the rate for the entire federal government, even though less than one-third of all federal workers are employed by the Postal Service. Fourteen postal employees were killed on the job in 1996--one-sixth of the federal total. Workers' compensation charges at the Postal Service are also high--$538 million in 1997. 
This legislation will bring down these unacceptably high rates. It permits OSHA to issue citations for safety hazards, and back them up with penalties. This credible enforcement threat will encourage the Postal Service to comply with the law. It will save taxpayer dollars currently spent on workers' compensation costs. 
Most important, it will reduce the extraordinarily high rate of injuries among postal employees. Ever worker deserves a safe and healthy place to work, and this bill will help achieve that goal for the 860,000 employees of the Postal Service. They deserve it, and I am pleased to join my colleagues in providing it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield? 
Last evening I had asked the majority leader just for 5 minutes at some time during the period when he was propounding the consent request. I am glad to cooperate with the floor managers on when would be the most appropriate time to do so, but since we are starting off on an amendment, I don't want to interrupt the debate on the amendment, and I am glad to inquire of my friend from Michigan what period of time he intends to take.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we begin the August recess, the American people should understand that the Republican leadership is still bent on blocking meaningful HMO reform. I believe that Senator Lott owes it to Congress and the American people to schedule a full and fair debate as the Senate's first order of business when we return in September, but he has refused to do so and continues to hide behind the unreasonable restrictions on fair guidelines for the Senate's debate. 
The Republican leadership in Congress deserves the failing grades it is getting for fumbling the issue on HMO reform. At least since last January when the press reports began noting that Oscar-winning actress Helen Hunt in `As Good as it Gets,' who electrified audiences with her attack on HMOs, it has been clear that a tidal wave of support is building to end the managed care abuses and stop HMOs from profiting in ways that jeopardize patients' health or their very lives. 
The GOP's HMO line of defense continues to be to block any strong legislation, refuse to allow fair debate, and to give the HMO industry antireform TV ads a chance to bite. The genie is out of the bottle, and that cynical strategy will fail. If the majority leader has not already done so, I urge him to see the film during the recess. I have a videotape of the film here. I ask a page to deliver it to the majority leader. 
I urge the leader to see the film in a theater so he can judge the audience reaction and be more convinced of the genuine public outrage that exists over the abuses of HMOs and managed care. It is long past time for the Congress to end these abuses. Too often, the managed care is mismanaged care. No amount of distortion or smokescreens by insurance companies or GOP campaign ads can change the facts. A real Patients' Bill of Rights can stop these abuses. Let's pass it now before more patients have to suffer. 
All we want is a chance, in the time-honored tradition and the regular order of this body, to present a full and complete debate on this issue. We have had 5 days of debate and discussion on agriculture, with 55 amendments. We have had 6 days of debate on the defense authorization, with 105 amendments. We have had 7 days of debate on the budget, with over 100 amendments. We are entitled to an opportunity for a full and fair debate. If there are provisions to be included in the Daschle bill, we would like to hear about them and what the objectives are. We believe that this debate offers the best opportunity to make sure that we are going to have the doctors and patients make decisions and not the insurance companies. That is the central and fundamental issue that we ought to be debating. We are going to continue to press this issue until we have that debate. 
The Senate Republican leadership plan is not a bill of rights--it's a bill of wrongs. It cannot withstand a full and fair debate on the floor of the Senate. Its supporters know that--so they are refusing to bring it up for full debate, or at least agree on a fair number of amendments. 
The goal of the Republican leadership and their friends in the insurance industry is to prevent legislation this year, or to pass only a minimalist bill so weak that it would be worse than no bill at all. The initial Republican strategy--the stonewall strategy--lasted for more than a year. But it broke down last month in the face of overwhelming public demand for action. 
Their minimalist approach pays lip service to reform without the reality of reform. They refuse to let the Senate debate it, because they know their plan is more loophole than law. 
The Republican record of delay and denial is clear. Congressman Dingell and I first introduced patient protection legislation 17 months ago--on February 25, 1997. 
Senator Daschle introduced the Patients' Bill of Rights four months ago--on March 31, 1998. 
We have repeatedly asked for committee action or consideration by the full Senate of this important legislation, but the Republican leadership has repeatedly said `no.' 
Now, they know they can no longer just say `no.' So the Leadership is trying the next best thing. Instead of bringing up the bill for full and fair debate, they have offered up a series of phony consent agreements that they know are unacceptable. They don't want a full debate with an opportunity to amend their Patient Bill of Wrongs, because they believe that the less the American people know about their sham proposals, the better they will be able to protect their friends in the health insurance industry. 
In fact, the Republican leadership has gone to extraordinary lengths in the past six weeks to prevent a full debate on HMO reform. 
On June 18, Senator Lott proposed to bring up the bill, but on terms that made a mockery of legislative process. 
 That proposal would have allowed the Senate to start debate on HMO reform, but Senator Lott would have been permitted to pull the bill down at any time, and the Senate would have been barred from considering it further for the rest of the year. So if Senator Lott did not like the direction the bill was headed, he could withdraw it and tie the Senate's hands on HMO reform for the remainder of the year. 
On June 23, 43 Democratic Senators wrote to Senator Lott to urge him to allow a full debate and votes on the merits of the Patients' Bill of Rights before the August recess. 
In response, on June 24, Senator Lott simply repeated his earlier unacceptable offer. 
On June 25, Senator Daschle proposed an agreement under which Senator Lott would bring up a Republican health care bill by July 6, Senator Daschle could offer the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights, and other Senators could offer only amendments relevant to the HMO reform issue. We would not allow amendments on any other subject--just those relevant to the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
However, Senator Lott rejected this offer. And on June 26, he offered once again an agreement that allowed Senator Lott to withdraw the legislation at any time, and bar any further consideration of any health care legislation for the remainder of the year. 
On July 15, after a long silence, Senator Lott made yet another offer. This time he proposed an agreement that allowed for no amendments. He could bring up his bill. We could bring up ours. And that is it. It would be all or nothing. The American people would be denied votes on specific issues. 
No vote on whether all Americans should be covered, or just one-third as the Republicans propose. 
No vote on whether there should be genuine access to emergency room care. 
No vote on whether patients should have access to the specialists they need when they are seriously ill. 
No vote on whether doctors should be free to give the medical advice they feel is appropriate, without fear of being fired by the HMO. 
No vote on whether patients with cancer or Alzheimer's disease or other illnesses should have access to clinical trials after conventional treatments fail. 
No vote on whether patients in the middle of a course of treatment can keep their doctor if their health plan drops the doctor from the network, or the employer changes health plans. 
No vote on whether patients should have meaningful independent review of plan decisions--or whether health plans should continue to be judge and jury. 
No vote on whether the special health needs of persons with disabilities, and women, and children should be met. 
No vote on whether health plans should be held responsible for decisions that kill or injure patients. 
The list goes on and on. 
But the Republican Leadership just wants an all-or-nothing vote on their plan and our plan. They don't want a genuine debate on patient protection. They don't want to be held accountable by the American people for defending industry profits instead of patients. They want to gag the Senate, and allow HMOs to continue to gag doctors. 
On July 16, Senator Daschle proposed that we agree on a limited number of amendments--20 per side, directly related to the legislation, not on extraneous issues. 
This offer by Senator Daschle reflects the best traditions of the Senate. It is consistent with the conditions under which we have debated many major legislative proposals in the Senate this year. 
We had 7 days of debate on the budget resolution, and considered 105 amendments. Two of those were offered by Senator Nickles. 
We had 6 days of debate on the defense authorization bill, and considered 150 amendments. Two of those were offered by Senator Lott, and he cosponsored 10 others. 
We had 8 days of debate on IRS reform, and considered 13 amendments. 
We had 17 days of debate on tobacco legislation--a bill we never completed--and considered 18 amendments. 
We had 5 days of debate on the Agriculture Appropriations bill and 55 amendments. 
Senator Lott has said to reporters that Democrats might be able to offer 3 or 4 amendments. But that means we would have to decide which issues of concern to the American people are debated, and which are discarded. Do we debate access to emergency rooms, but put aside all concerns about access to specialists? Do we offer an amendment to ensure that all Americans are covered by the legislation, and not just the one-third the Republican plan proposes, but put aside access to clinical trials that could save lives? 
This debate should not be an unfair choice. We agree that the number of amendments should be limited. But the number should be large enough to accommodate the large number of legitimate issues that need to be debated as part of this important reform. 
If the Republican leaders are serious about fair debate, they know how to do it. We do it every day in the Senate, and we should do it now. If they are serious about passing meaningful patient protection legislation, they should call up the bill now. All we have asked for is 20 amendments per side. It will take at least 20 amendments to even begin to remedy the major defects in the Republican proposal. 
Since the Republican leadership plan was introduced a week ago, we have held meetings and forums with doctors, nurses and patients to explore the critical issues that must be addressed if a Patients' Bill of Rights is to be worthy of its name. 
In each case, doctors, nurses and patients have reached the same conclusions. The abuses by HMOs and managed care are pervasive in our health system. Every doctor and patient knows that, too often, managed care is mismanaged care. Every doctor and patient knows that medical decisions that should be made by doctors and patients are being made by insurance company accountants. Every doctor and patient knows that profits, not patient care, have become the priority of too many health insurance companies. 
The message in each of these forums from doctors, nurses and patients has been the same. Pass the Patients' Bill of Rights. Reject the Republican leadership plan. It leaves out too many critical protections. It leaves out too many patients. Even the protections it claims to offer have too many loopholes. It is a plan to protect industry profits, not patients. 
One of the aspects of their legislation that the Republican leadership likes to tout is its alleged protections for women. As part of their ongoing disinformation campaign about their legislation, they even had a press conference this morning to proclaim the benefits of their legislation for women. But no credible organization representing women endorses their bill--because their so-called protections for women are a sham. 
Nowhere is the difference between the bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights and the Republican Bill of Wrongs more evident than on the issue of protecting women's health. The Republican leadership bill leaves out most key patient protections. Even the protections it does include are more cosmetic than real. And even those cosmetic protections are limited to fewer than one-third of the privately insured patients who need help. 
We held a forum yesterday afternoon during which leading organizations for women released a letter urging Senators to support the Patients' Bill of Rights and to reject the Republican leadership bill. The letter is signed by more than 30 women's groups, who represent millions of women in communities across the country. 
Last Friday, we heard from Diane Bergin of College Park, MD. She has ovarian cancer, and is currently enrolled in a clinical trial. She eloquently described the need for plans to cover such trials and the importance of having access to specialty care. Diane is a vivid example of the promise of such therapies and the need to see that patients have genuine access to specialists. 
Women need to know that they will receive the benefits covered by their plan and recommended by their treating physician--without being over-ruled by insurance company accountants. 
Women need to know that they can choose their gynecologist to be their primary care physician. 
Women need to know that they will never have to drive past the nearest emergency room, because a more distant hospital is part of their managed care plan. 
Women with mental illness need to know that they will have access to psychiatrists, psychologists and other mental health professionals. 
Women with ovarian cancer--like Diane Bergin--or other life-threatening conditions need to know that their health plan will let them participate in clinical trials by covering routine costs of such care. 
Women whose plans provide pharmaceutical benefits need to know that they will have access to drugs that are not on the plan's list. 
Women need to know that they will have access to a quick and independent appeal if their plan overrules their doctor. 
Women need to know that they have a genuine remedy when plan abuses result in injury or death. 
The Patients' Bill of Rights guarantees these rights to all women with private health insurance. The Republican plan guarantees none of them. 
In fact, the closer you look at the Republican bill, the worse it looks. They claim to provide protections for patients who seek emergency room care. But the American College of Emergency Physicians has denounced their proposal as a sham. 
They claim to provide independent third party appeal, but Consumer's Union analyzed their proposal and called it `woefully inadequate and far from independent.' 
Virtually every protection they claim to have included turns out to fail the truth-in-advertising test--and the protections they have left out are a dishonor roll of insurance industry abuses. 
Part of democracy is accountability. We have votes in the Senate to pass or defeat bills. We have votes on amendments to improve bills. We record these votes, because we are elected by the people of our states to represent them. The people have a right to know where we stand on important issues. 
I ask the Republican leader why he doesn't want the American people to know where members of the Senate stand on whether protections for patients should apply to all 161 million privately insured Americans--or leave more than 100 million out. 
I ask the Republican leader why he doesn't want the American people to know where members of the Senate stand on allowing a sick child with cancer to have access to a specialist to treat his disease. 
I ask the Republican leader why he doesn't want a vote on whether doctors and patients, not accountants, should make medical decisions. 
I ask the Republican leader why he doesn't want a vote on whether doctors who stand up for their patients should be protected from retaliation by insurance companies. 
I ask the Republican leader why he doesn't want a vote on whether patients should have access to the nearest emergency room when immediate medical treatment means the difference between life and death. 
I ask the Republican leader why he doesn't want a vote on whether HMO decisions to deny patients the care they need should be subject to timely and independent review by an impartial third party. 
I ask the Republican leader why he doesn't want a vote on whether patients with deadly diseases that no conventional treatment can help should have access to clinical trials that offer them the hope of cure or improvement. 
I ask the Republican leader why he doesn't want a vote to insist on accountability for health plans when they kill or injure patients. 
Each of those votes will address a critical weakness in the Republican plan. It is obvious why the Republican leader does not want Democrats to offer these amendments. He wants to keep the Republican bill weak, so that it will protect profits instead of patients. He thinks that he can hold Republican Senators for one vote in favor of a bad bill, but he cannot keep them together on vote after vote that will show who stands with patients--and who stands with HMOs. 
The President will not sign--and the Senate should not pass--a bill that is a fig leaf over continued HMO abuses. 
If the Senate has a full and fair debate in full view of the American people, needed patient protections will pass--and that is what the Republican leadership is trying to avoid. 
The House Republican plan is so flawed that President Clinton has already sent a strong veto message. But the Senate Republican plan is even weaker than the House Republican plan--it's `Gingrich Lite.' We know we can do better, and we will do better if we have a fair opportunity for full debate. 
The Senate Republican plan protects industry profits instead of protecting patients. It is so riddled with loopholes that it's a license for continued abuse. It allows insurance company accountants to continue to make medical decisions, not doctors and patients. Patients with cancer, heart disease, or other serious illnesses will not have timely access to specialists and the treatment they need. Managed care plans are immunized from liability for abuses that injure or even kill a patient. No other industry in America has this immunity--and the managed care industry doesn't deserve it either. 
Just as managed care plans gag their doctors, the Republican leadership wants to gag the Senate. Just as insurance companies delay and deny care, the Republican leadership is trying to delay and deny meaningful reform. Just as health plans want to avoid being held accountable when they kill or injure a patient, the Republican leadership wants to avoid being held accountable for killing patient protection legislation. 
Yesterday, Senator Chafee offered a proposal that is a major improvement over the Senate Republican leadership plan, and it provides significant patient protections. But it lacks many of the most important protections in our Patients' Bill of Rights. 
Key provisions omitted in the Chafee plan include the lack of needed protection for breast cancer patients from drive-through mastectomies and access to reconstructive surgery--the lack of fair opportunities for patients to join health plans allowing them to go to the physician or specialist of their choice--the lack of protection for health professionals who point out problems in the quality of care provided by health plans or facilities--and the lack of adequate remedies for patients injuries or killed by HMO abuses. 
All of these reforms are needed, and all of them are strongly supported by an unprecedented alliance of physicians, nurses, patients, and working families. 
Despite these significant gaps, the Chafee plan shows that the wall of opposition by Senate Republicans to genuine reform is continuing to crack, and it shows that at least some Republicans in the Senate are serious about reform. Now is the time for the Republican leadership to respond. As the Chafee plan shows, their industry profit protection plan is becoming less and less tenable with each passing day. The American people demand action, but the Republican leadership still refuses to bring patient protection legislation to the floor for full debate and action. 
The Republican Leadership in Congress deserves the failing grades it's getting for fumbling the issue of HMO reform. At least since last January--when press reports began noting that Oscar-winning actress Helen Hunt in the movie `As Good As It Gets' was electrifying audiences with her attack on her HMO--it has been clear that a tidal wave of support is building to end managed care abuses and stop HMOs from profiteering in ways that jeopardizing patients' health or their very lives. 
The GOP-HMO line of defense continues to be to block any legislation, refuse to allow fair debate, and give the HMO industry's anti-reform TV ads a chance to bite. But the genie is out of the bottle, and that cynical strategy will fail. 
It's time for Congress to end the abuses of patients and physicians by HMOs and managed care health plans. Too often, managed care is mis-managed care. No amount of distortions or smokescreens by insurance companies can change the facts. A real Patients' Bill of Rights can stop these abuses. Let's pass it now, before more patients have to suffer.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Department of Defense and many other government agencies are increasing their use and reliance on information technology for a wide variety of applications. 
The growing frequency and increasing sophistication of attacks on the Defense Department's computer networks is cause for concern. Other government agencies, as well as the private sector, are also subject to these attacks on their network infrastructure. 
Last year, the Administration organized an exercise to test the Pentagon's ability to deal with cyber attacks. In this exercise, several computer specialists from the National Security Agency targeted computers used by our military forces in the United States and our forces in the Pacific. Using computers, modems, and software technology widely available on the Internet, these friendly `hackers' were able to penetrate unclassified military computer networks in Hawaii, Washington, D.C., Chicago, St. Louis and Colorado. 
We need to do more to protect the Defense Department networks that are critical for the operation of our military forces around the world. My amendment, which is fully offset, adds $8 million to the Air Force Information Systems Security Program. The additional funds will be used for research by the Air Force and will rely on the expertise of two federally funded research and development centers currently working on issues of information security. These efforts will facilitate the development of information security technology for the Armed Forces, and I urge the Senate to approve it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, final passage of the Workforce Investment Act is a landmark achievement in which we can all take pride. For years, Congress has struggled to design an employment training system that would provide America's workers with the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century workplace. I believe this legislation will accomplish that enormous task. Few bills which we consider will have a greater impact on more Americans than the Workforce Investment Act we pass today. 
An educated workforce has become the most valuable resource in the modern economy. Our nation's long term economic vitality depends on the creation of an effective, accessible, and accountable system of job training and career development which is open to all our citizens. Schools must assume more responsibility for preparing their students to meet the challenges of the 21st century workplace. Disadvantaged adults and out of school youth need the opportunity to develop job skills which will make them productive members of the community. Dislocated workers who have been displaced by the rapid pace of technological change deserve the chance to pursue new careers. Individuals with disabilities need the opportunity to fully develop their career potential. The way in which we respond to these challenges today will determine how prosperous a nation we are in the next century. 
The importance of highly developed employment skills has never been greater. The gap in earnings between skilled and unskilled workers is steadily widening. For those who enter the workforce with good academic training and well-developed career skills, this new economy offers almost unlimited potential. However, for those who lack basic proficiency in language, math and science and who have no career skills, the new economy presents an increasingly hostile environment. 
Over three million young men and women between the ages of 16 and 24 in this country did not complete high school and are not enrolled in school. Many more graduate from high school without the level of knowledge and skill that a high school diploma should represent. They will require more education and job training in order to obtain stable, well-paying employment. Without it, they are in danger of becoming a lost workforce generation. 
Effective job training is also essential to the success of welfare reform. More than 40 percent of those in the JTPA program for disadvantaged adults have come from the welfare rolls. Under the welfare reform legislation, an additional 1.7 million people will be entering the job market. Most of these individuals have little or no work background and very limited employment skills. In many cases, they are also the sole support of young children. They are making urgent new demands on a job training system that is already burdened beyond its capacity. 
In addition, the combination of rapidly changing technology and the shift of manufacturing jobs overseas is creating an alarming number of dislocated workers. These individuals have extensive work experience, but their skills are no longer in demand. We must give them the opportunity for retraining, and for the development of new skills to enable them to compete in the 21st century workplace. 
The accelerating pace of technological change has made much of the existing job training system obsolete. Broad reforms are clearly needed to meet the demands of the modern workplace. 
The Workforce Investment Act will provide employment training opportunities for millions of Americans. It responds to the challenge of the changing workplace by enabling men and women to acquire the skills required to enter the workforce and to upgrade their skills throughout their careers. It will provide them with access to the educational tools that will enable them not only to keep up, but to get ahead. 
The legislation is the product of a true bipartisan collaboration. I want to publicly commend Senators Jeffords and DeWine for the genuine spirit of bipartisanship which has made this effort possible. Senator Wellstone and I appreciate it. This spirit of collaboration was also shared by the House conferees. The resulting legislation will, I believe, truly expand career options, encourage greater program innovation, and facilitate cooperative efforts amongst business, labor, education and state and local government. 
I also want to recognize the important role President Clinton has played in bringing about this dramatic reform of our current job training system. He has consistently emphasized the need for greater individual choice in the selection of career paths and training providers. The philosophy behind his skill grant proposal is reflected in our legislation. 
The Workforce Investment Act is designed to provide easy access to state of the art employment training programs which are geared to real job opportunities in the community through a single, customer-friendly system of One Stop Career Centers. Over 700 such Centers are already operating successfully across the country. This legislation will ensure that every individual in need of employment services will have access to such a facility. The cornerstones of this new system are individual choice and quality labor market information. In the past, men and women seeking new careers often did not know what job skills were most in demand and which training programs had the best performance record. All too often, they were forced to make one of the most important decisions of their lives based on anecdotes and late-night advertisements. 
No training system can function effectively without accurate and timely information. The frequent unavailability of quality labor market information is one of the most serious flaws in the current system. This legislation places a strong emphasis on providing accurate and timely information about what area industries are growing, what skills those jobs require, and what earning potential they have. Extensive business community and organized labor participation are encouraged in developing a regional plan based on this information. Once a career choice is made, the individual must still select a training provider. At present, many applicants make that choice with a little or no reliable information. Under this bill, each training provider will have to publicly report graduation rates, job placement and retention rates, and average earnings of graduates. 
Because of the extensive information which will be available to each applicant, real consumer choice in the selection of a career and of a training provider will be possible. The legislation establishes individual training accounts for financially eligible participants, which they can use to access career education and skill training programs. Men and women seeking training assistance will no longer be limited to a few predetermined options. As long as there are real job opportunities in the field selected and the training provider meets established 
performance standards, the individual will be free to choose which option best suits his or her needs. 
An essential element of the new system we have designed is accountability. As I noted earlier, each training provider will have to monitor and report the job placement and retention achieved by its graduates and their average earnings. Only those training programs that meet an acceptable performance standard will remain eligible for receipt of public funds. The same principle of accountability is applied to those agencies administering state and local programs. They are being given wide latitude to innovate under this legislation. But they too will be held accountable if their programs fail to meet challenging performance targets. 
The rapid pace of technological change in the workplace has produced an alarming number of workers who have become dislocated in mid-career. The dislocation has been compounded by the increasing number of labor intensive production employers relocating their businesses abroad. This trend has been particularly acute in the manufacturing sector. We have a special obligation to these dislocated workers who have long and dedicated work histories and now are unemployed through no fault of their own. The Workforce Investment Act makes a commitment to them by maintaining a special dislocated worker program, supported by a separate funding stream, which is geared to their retraining needs. The current dislocated worker program served approximately 540,000 dislocated workers nationwide in the most recent year. Of those who completed the program during that year, 71 percent were employed when they left the program, earning on average 93 percent of their previous wages. America's dislocated workers have earned the right to assistance in developing new skills which will allow them to be full participants in the 21st century economy. 
There is no challenge facing America today which is tougher or more important than providing at-risk, often out-of-school, youth with meaningful education and employment opportunities. Far too many of our teenagers are being left behind without the skills needed to survive in the 21st century economy. I am particularly pleased with the commitment which the Workforce Investment Partnership Act makes to these young men and women. This legislation authorizes a new initiative focused on teenagers living in poverty in communities offering them few constructive employment opportunities. Each year, the Secretary of Labor will award grants from a $250 million fund to innovative programs designed to provide opportunities to youth living in these areas. The programs will emphasize mentoring, strong links between academic and worksite learning, and job placement and retention. It will encourage broad based community participation from local service agencies and area employers. These model programs will, we believe, identify the techniques which are most effective in reaching those youth at greatest risk. 
Another important program for young people who face the highest barriers to employment is Job Corps. Most of the participants grow up in extreme poverty. Their educational opportunities are limited. Job Corps, at its best, moves them from deprivation to opportunity. But, for many of them, it is an extremely difficult transition. As a result, critics of the program are always able to point to failures. But for each story of failure, there are many stories of success. Job Corps is a program worth preserving and worth expanding too. Our legislation decisively rejects the view that Job Corps should be dismantled. Instead, it strengthens the program in several ways. It establishes closer ties between individual Job Corps Centers and the communities they serve. It ensures that training programs correspond with the area's labor market needs. It extends follow-up counseling for participants up to 12 months and established detailed performance standards to hold programs accountable. 
The legislation also provides for the continuation of summer jobs as an essential element of the youth grant. For many youth, summer jobs are their first opportunity to work and their first critical step in learning the work ethic. The summer jobs program also provides many youth with quality learning experiences and follow up during the school year. Studies by the Department of Labor's Office of the Inspector General and research by Westat, Inc. have reported positive findings regarding the program, concluding that work sites are well-supervised and disciplined, that jobs provide useful work, that the education component teaches students new skills that they apply in school, and that students learn the value of work. 
I believe that the summer jobs program needs to continue to be available on a significant scale with sufficient funding. This bill recognizes the critical importance of the summer youth program by requiring that it be a part of each local area's youth program and allowing local communities to determine the number of summer jobs to be created. 
The Workforce Investment Act includes titles reauthorizing major vocation rehabilitation and adult literacy programs. Both programs will continue to be separately funded and independently administered. We have incorporated them in the Workforce Act because they must be integral components of any comprehensive strategy to prepare people to meet the demands of the 21st century workplace. 
Vocational rehabilitation offers new hope to individuals with disabilities, allowing them to reach their full potential and actively participate in their communities. The Rehabilitation Title of the Act will ensure that all working-aged individuals with disabilities, even those with the most significant disabilities, have realistic opportunities to obtain the resources and support they need to reach their employment goals. 
Adult literacy programs are essential for the 27% of the adult population who have not earned a high school diploma or its equivalent. Learning to read and communicate effectively are the first steps to career advancement. This legislation will increase access to educational opportunities for those people most in need of assistance and enhance the quality of services provided. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act will make it possible for millions of Americans to gain the skills needed to compete in a global economy. In doing so, we are also enabling them to realize their personal American dreams. 
I would like to recognize the substantial contributions made by several individuals to this enormous legislative effort. On my staff, Jeffrey Teitz has worked on the development of the workforce and education titles of this bill for nearly eighteen months and done an outstanding job. Connie Garner has devoted a comparable effort to the vocational rehabilitation title. Jane Oates' assistance throughout the conference process has also been invaluable. I am proud of their work. 
I also want to call the Senate's attention to the role of my longtime friend, William Spring of Boston. Bill is a leader on training and education issues in Massachusetts and his creative recommendations are incorporated throughout this legislation. There is one further person who deserves special mention. Steven Spinner worked for me during the 104th Congress until his tragic and untimely death. His invaluable efforts helped to lay the groundwork for our success in reforming the workforce system.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, it is a privilege to join Senator Graham, Senator Mack, Senator Abraham and our other distinguished colleagues in supporting legislation to provide permanent residence to Haitian refugees. Last year Congress enacted the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, which enabled Nicaraguan and Cuban refugees to remain permanently in the United States as immigrants. That legislation also enables Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Eastern Europeans and nationals from the former Soviet Union to seek similar relief on a case-by-case basis. 
Haitian refugees deserve no less. 
Haitians have seen their relatives, friends and neighbors jailed, or murdered, or abducted in the middle of the night and never seen again. Like other refugees, they have fled from decades of violence and brutal repression by the Ton Ton Macoutes, and later the military regime which overthrew the first democratically elected president of Haiti. 
The Bush and Clinton Administrations found that the vast majority of these refugees were fleeing from political persecution in Haiti. Thousands of these Haitians were paroled into the United States after establishing a credible fear of persecution. Many others filed bona fide applications for asylum upon arrival in the United States. 
This legislation also includes a significant number of unaccompanied children and orphans who did not have the capacity to apply for asylum for themselves. Senator Abraham and I proposed an amendment which was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee to include these deserving children in this legislation. 
This legislation concerns basic fairness. The United States has a long and noble tradition of providing safe haven to refugees. Over the years, we have enacted legislation to provide Hungarians, Cubans, Yugoslavs, Vietnamese, Laotians, Cambodians, Poles, Chinese, and many other refugees with permanent protection from being returned to unstable or repressive regimes. 
Last year, we adopted legislation to protect Nicaraguans, Cubans and others, but, the Haitians were unfairly excluded from that bill. The time has come for Congress to remedy this flagrant omission and add Haitians to the list of deserving refugees. 
By approving this legislation, we can finally bring to an end the shameful decades of unjust treatment to Haitians. Throughout the 1980s, less than 2 percent of Haitians fleeing the atrocities committed by the Duvalier regimes were granted asylum. Yet, other refugee groups had approval rates as high as 75 percent. Haitian asylum seekers were detained by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, while asylum seekers from other countries were routinely released while their asylum applications were processed. Until recently, Haitians have been the only group intercepted on the high seas and forcibly returned to their home country, without even the opportunity to seek asylum. 
Like other political refugees, Haitians have come to our country with a strong love of freedom and a strong commitment to democracy. They have settled in many parts of the United States. They have established deep roots in their communities, and their children born here are U.S. citizens. Wherever they have settled, they have made lasting contributions to the economic vitality and diversity of our communities and the nation. 
This legislation has strong bipartisan support. It is also supported by a range of nation-wide organizations, including the U.S. Catholic Conference, the Church World Service, the American Baptist Churches, the Mennonite Central Committee, the Council of Jewish Federations, the Lutheran Immigration Refugee Service, the United Methodist General Board of Church and Society, the Presbyterian Church (USA) and many, many more. 
We should do all we can to end this current flagrant discrimination under the immigration laws. Haitians refugees deserve too--the same protection we gave to Nicaraguans and Cubans last year. We need to pay more than lip service to the fundamental principle of equal protection of the laws. 
Finally, the amendment has been modified to resolve a budget problem, deeming approximately 1000 Haitians ineligible for Supplemental Security Income and Medicaid. A similar budget concern was not raised last year when the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act was considered. I am hopeful that this new injustice can be remedied as the Haitian legislation moves forward. I urge the Senate to accept this amendment.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I urge the Senate to approve the amendment by Senator Snowe and Senator Reid to provide fairness in prescription coverage for family planning. 
The provisions of this amendment will benefit millions of American women by helping to make the cost of preventing unintended pregnancy more affordable. They will also help to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies by providing women with greater access to a broad range of safe and effective family planning services. 
Too often, insurance companies refuse to cover these costs. Only a third of all private health plans currently cover oral contraceptives--the most widely used prescription method of family planning. According to a study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, nearly half of all large-group plans do not cover such prescriptions--despite the fact that 97 percent of traditional fee-for-service plans routinely cover prescriptions for other medicines and medical devices. In a recent column in the Washington Post, David Broder called this lack of coverage `one of the great stupidities in the health care system.' 
The result in that women are too often forced to rely on family planning without the full range of available methods. Women pay 68 percent more than men in out-of-pocket health care costs--in large part because of the high cost of preventing unintended pregnancies. As Ellen Goodman noted in a column in The Boston Globe, `Some women are making hard economic choices between paying their bills and buying pills.' 
Too often, women are forced to settle for the family planning method that is most affordable, rather than the one that is most effective. Inevitably, many of them are forced to settle for no method at all. The result is large numbers of unintended pregnancies each year, and large numbers of abortions. Clearly, greater access to reliable methods of birth control will substantially reduce the number of abortions. 
In the United States, it is estimated that half of all pregnancies each year are unintended. Three million women use no method of birth control, and they account for half of 
all unintended pregnancies. Greater access to insurance coverage will significantly reduce this number. As an editorial in the American Journal of Public Health points out: `Contraception is the keystone in the prevention of unintended pregnancy.' 
The vast majority of women who use some form of birth control do not have insurance coverage to defray the cost. Often, they are forced to choose inexpensive methods with high failure rates. The proposal by Senator Snowe and Senator Reid is an important step in the right direction. It requires private insurance companies to cover FDA-approved, prescription birth control drugs and devices in a manner comparable to all other prescription drugs and devices. 
Just as more effective birth control means fewer unintended pregnancies and fewer abortions, it also means more savings in health costs. An April, 1995 study in the American Journal of Public Health estimated that women who use prescription contraceptives will avoid far more in other health costs than the cost of the prescriptions. 
According to the Guttmacher Institute, the increased cost to employers who provide this coverage to their employees would be $17.00 a person per year. That's an increase of just one-half-of-one percent over current costs per employee. 
This bill is sound public policy. It is supported by all major family planning organizations and by the vast majority of the American people. In surveys, 75 percent of Americans express support for increasing access to family planning services. And, 73 percent of survey respondents continue to be supportive, even if contraceptive coverage modestly increases their insurance premiums. 
Support for increasing this coverage clearly crosses party lines. It is sound public policy that has been too long in coming. I urge the Senate to approve it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the nation was stunned as we learned of the tragic deaths of John Gibson and J.J. Chestnut, two veteran officers of the Capitol Police who lost their lives in the line of duty in the tragic and senseless shootings last Friday. The extraordinary dedication and heroism of these two courageous officers clearly prevented greater loss of life in the Capitol, and I join all Americans in mourning their deaths. 
These brave men represented the very finest traditions of American law enforcement. They protected a building--the nation's Capitol--and in doing so they were also defending our democracy. Unless citizens can come freely into the Capitol building and meet with their elected Senators and Representatives, our democracy and our freedoms are greatly diminished. Special Agent Gibson and Officer Chestnut understood this, and with professionalism and dedication, they served Congress well and served the country well too. 
It is fitting that these two brave men will lie in state tomorrow in the Capitol building where they gave their lives. They made the ultimate sacrifice to protect us, and we will forever owe them and their families a debt of deep gratitude. 
Our thoughts and prayers go out especially to the Gibson and Chestnut families. My family too has suffered the sudden loss of loved ones, and I know that there is no greater tragedy, no greater sadness for a family. 
Special Agent Gibson is a son of Massachusetts, and we were all especially proud of him. He loved his family, his country, his church, and his Capitol. Our hearts go out to his wife Lynn and his three children during this very difficult time of loss. 
Officer Chestnut, too, was well known by anyone who entered the Document Room door. He was always friendly to everyone, and was a consummate professional in the conduct of his duties. I join Wendy and the rest of Officer Chestnut's family in mourning his loss. 
We cannot help but be angry at the senseless act that led to the death of these two extraordinary officers. One minute, the Capitol building is full of the people's business--with debates and meetings and visitors from across the country in this great and open symbol of our free government. The next minute, the nation was shocked to learn the news that a man who had no business possessing a handgun had taken the lives of these officers in two brutal acts that shocked the conscience of Congress and the country. 
In the days ahead, we will consider what steps may be taken to ensure a secure--and yet open--Capitol. I hope Congress will also consider further actions to keep guns out of the hands of those who so easily misuse them. As we saw on Friday, our failure to do so leads to tragedy far too often. 
The Gibson and Chestnut families know that all of us in Congress embrace them at this sad time. The nation loves them. We are grateful for their extraordinary service, and saddened by their tragic sacrifice.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Human Services Reauthorization Act before us today is landmark legislation and is backed by a broad bi-partisan coalition. It represents legislation at its best, with Members on both sides of the aisle working closely together and with the Administration to achieve better results for America's children. 
I commend Senator Jeffords, Senator Coats, and Senator Dodd for their leadership in making this bill a reality. Together we have produced legislation that preserves and enhances these needed family programs while addressing the concerns that have been raised. Our bipartisan goal is to take these worthwhile programs and make them even better. 
The pending bill is an important step toward a more effective family policy. This legislation consolidates, reorganizes, and reauthorizes services for poor families and their children by investing in programs to strengthen families, promote child development, and build communities. In keeping with efforts to reinvent government, the Act promotes one-stop shopping by consolidating several existing categorical programs into more comprehensive and coordinated programs. It improves performance by developing outcome measures and monitoring progress, and it puts families first by promoting self-sufficiency. We have worked carefully to draft a bill that addresses the concerns of Senators on both sides of the aisle. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill, and I urge my colleagues in the House, both Democrat and Republican, to join together as we have to provide services to America's families.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, since the Republican leadership plan on the Patients' Bill of Rights was introduced a week ago, we have been holding meetings and forums with doctors and nurses and patients to explore the critical issues that must be addressed if a Patients' Bill of Rights is to be worthy of the name. 
In each case, the message has been the same. The problems created by HMOs and managed care are pervasive in our health system. Every doctor and patient knows that. Too often, managed care is mismanaged care. Every doctor and patient knows that medical decisions that should be made by doctors and patients are being made by insurance company accountants, and every doctor and patient knows that profits, not patients' care, have become the priority of too many health insurance companies. 
And at each of the forums we have held, the message from doctors and nurses and patients has been the same: Pass the bipartisan Patients' Bill of Rights. Reject the Republican leadership plan; it leaves out too many critical protections and it leaves out too many patients. Even the protections it claims to offer are full of loopholes. It is a program to protect industry profits, not patients. 
One of the most critical issues that needs to be addressed in legislation is the right of people with serious illnesses, like cancer, to get the high-quality specialty care they need. If the conventional treatments fail, they should have the opportunity to participate in clinical trials that offer them hope for improvement or a cure, and that can contribute to finding a better treatment for future patients. Our legislation provides for these rights; the Republican plan does not. 
Yesterday, we heard from Dr. Casimir, a distinguished Texas oncologist. Dr. Casimir talked about some heartbreaking stories of cancer patients whose HMOs delay and deny access to specialty care, often until it is too late. She said that when she gets a patient whose cancer progressed substantially from the initial diagnosis to the time they are allowed to receive specialty care, she often flips to the front of the chart, and 9 times out of 10, the insurer is an HMO. Every centimeter a cancer grows can mean the difference between a good chance at life and the likelihood of death. Every centimeter represents potentially devastating and avoidable pain, suffering and sometimes the death of a patient. Dr. Casimir's message was clear: Pass the Patients' Bill of Rights so that more patients will not die needlessly. 
Today, we heard from Dr. Bruce Chabner, a distinguished clinical oncologist and cancer researcher. This is what the doctor had to say: 
My name is Bruce Chabner and I am a medical oncologist and cancer researcher. I am here to support the Patients' Bill of Rights that would require HMOs and insurance companies to support clinical research. I would like to explain briefly the role of insurance coverage in research. Most of the costs in clinical research are associated with the cost of discovery. Laboratory experiments in the development of new treatments are supported by the Government grants, by industry, and by institutional commitments by hospitals and medical schools. 
These contributions provide the hundreds of millions of dollars that lead to new treatments and new hope to millions of our patients with cancer. However, the clinical treatment of these patients requires support for the routine care associated with these clinical trials. The only source of such support for routine care costs is health insurance and HMO contributions. 
This is the final step in proving that a new treatment or a new device actually works in people. Without this step, research is meaningless and has no impact on people, nor does it save lives. We are not asking the insurance companies and HMOs to support the vast effort to discover new treatments or to bring them to the clinics. We are not asking for support for the cost of analyzing data and support during the clinical trials. We are only asking them to continue support for the patients' care costs. 
I am sure that every Member of Congress who is faced with the awful dilemma of cancer would want this kind of continued support for their family members. The research provides the only hope our patients have of conquering this disease and the only hope our society has for curing cancer. 
Now, I just want to mention this one more time, Mr. President. Under our Patients' Bill of Rights, we are guaranteeing the specialty care and clinical trials. For example, if your family or you were affected by cancer, you would not only be able to go to an oncologist, but you would be able to go to one of the great cancer centers that we have in this country to be able to get treatment. You would be able to get the specialty care that you need. If you believe you are being denied that particular care, you are able to go in to have an internal appeal and an external appeal, which must be responded to promptly. But you will get it; we guarantee it, under the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
We guarantee that you will be able to participate in a clinical trial if it is medically necessary--if your doctor says it is medically necessary. Clinical trials can be the source of enormous hope for millions of Americans who are afflicted by cancer. There are 47,000 women who die each year from breast cancer, and there is extraordinary research that is taking place that offers great hope for millions of women. 
Under this proposal, under the Patients' Bill of Rights, we are guaranteeing that if it is medically proven, you can get into a clinical trial. What kind of financial burden does this place on an HMO? Does it say to the HMO, well, you are going to have to pay all of these additional expenses? Absolutely not. The clinical trial is being paid for by the medical center; the clinical trial is being paid for by the pharmaceutical company; the clinical trial is being paid for by the financial strength of the particular clinical center. 
The only thing that the HMO would have to pay for is routine services--do we understand that?--which they would otherwise be required to pay. Those that oppose this provision say, well, if you require that they get clinical trials, it is going to bankrupt the HMO. That is preposterous, that is wrong, that is deceptive, and that is a critical misinterpretation of our legislation. 
As our distinguished clinical researchers pointed out today, once again, the kind of treatment that is necessary for these clinical trials is provided by the center, not by the patient or the HMO. The only requirements by the HMO would be routine care. Quite frankly, the HMO would be obligated to provide routine care in any event. So that does not adversely impact the HMO financially. Still, we have the reluctance and resistance to guarantee this in the Patients' Bill of Rights. I don't understand it. That is one of the reasons we ought to have a debate on this issue. 
How many Members in this body know the allocation of expenditures on clinical trials? I doubt if there are 5 or 10. I cannot understand why any Member of the Senate is saying not do it if it is medically necessary, because the HMO is not going to be burdened with substantial additional costs. That isn't the way it works. 
As I mentioned, 47,000 women die every single year. There are these clinical trials that are taking place in the great medical centers all over this country. And if a doctor says he believes, based upon the type of clinical trial and the kind of need that you are facing--to a woman that has been biopsied in her breast, and where a tumor is present--there is an opportunity and likelihood that you might survive, we believe that ought to be available. That is the best medical practice. Insurance companies were providing that protection for years before we had the HMOs. This wasn't even an issue for years and years, Mr. President. Now it is. And the principal reasons that the cancer oncologists and the cancer organizations support our proposal is because they see the fact that HMOs are denying this kind of treatment. 
Mr. President, we had Ms. Stekley, who was the head of clinical research at the Lombardi Center out here in Washington, D.C. She said that 80 percent of their administrative time is spent arguing with the HMOs to let people into their clinical trials--not because they are profiting financially, but because they believe that they can help the people, from a health point of view--80 percent of their administrative time. This person was almost in tears saying, `Senator, we can help people survive, and it isn't going to cost the HMO any additional resources. Your proposal does the trick.' 
What is possibly wrong with having that particular inclusion in any protection for a Patients' Bill of Rights? I cannot understand it, Mr. President. I cannot believe that we don't have a full opportunity to debate this issue in this body on this one issue, and that we will not be successful. It is enormously important to do two things: One, to have a guarantee that you can have a specialist; and, two, if it is medically recommended, you can have a clinical trial based upon medical evidence. And if you do not, then you are going to get a speedy right of appeal. 
And you contrast that with the top researchers who testified just yesterday, how they look at their patients, and have seen the various tumors that have grown day by day, week by week, month by month, and seeing the chance of these women's survival declining dramatically--because of what? Because of two things.

Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. 
For two things: Because they were late getting to a specialist, and because they were excluded from any opportunities for the clinical trials. 
The HMOs thought they could handle it. The HMOs thought they had someone on their panel who could handle this particular kind of cancer, even though right down the street there was a major international center that specialized in this very program. 
Under the Republican program, access to clinical trials is not guaranteed--it isn't even an appealable item. Even if it were, will the appeal be established by an independent group? No. It will be established by the HMO. They name the people whom this will be appealed to. Then, if that person is harmed with grievous bodily injury, or death, under our Republican program there is no remedy. 
Mr. President, this is the kind of issue that we ought to have an opportunity to debate. We just took one provision today with regard especially to clinical trials. We had a few others. But the time has moved on and I will wait for another time. 
I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support H.R. 1151, the Credit Union Membership Access Act, but I strongly oppose the amendments being offered by Senator Gramm and Senator Shelby. Credit unions have a distinguished history of providing affordable financial services to America's low- and moderate-income communities. This legislation will help them continue to do that. 
It is ironic that we are now debating the issue of whether banks and credit unions should serve low- and moderate-income communities and to reinvest in the communities in which they receive deposits. Massachusetts has 317 credit unions, at 1.7 million members. They have had community reinvestment obligations for many years, and they have done an excellent job of meeting needs of consumers at all income levels. Massachusetts credit unions are a model for the Nation. The vast majority of banks take their community reinvestment obligation seriously in meeting these obligations. 
The Massachusetts Bankers Associations, whose member banks are doing excellent work in community reinvestment, does not support the Shelby amendment. Institutions which have received outstanding ratings, like Bank of Boston and Citizens Bank, are using the Community Reinvestment Act to provide profitable lines of business. 
Senator Shelby's amendment to eliminate the Community Reinvestment Act for 85 percent of the banks would eliminate an important source of affordable credit and financial services from low- and moderate-income families who are bankable. Massachusetts banks do not support this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to oppose it. 
Senator Gramm's amendment would say to credit unions who are being granted expanded power, they have no obligation to serve members of modest means. Both these amendments are bad policy. 
In this period of sustained economic growth, it is vital that all families have the opportunity to obtain credit in order to buy a home, start a small business, or send a child to college. The Community Reinvestment Act has a long history of success. Since 1992, it has helped banks to extend over $800 billion in loans for housing, small businesses, economic development and local communities across the Nation. 
As many have said, there is no capitalism without capital. We should oppose any effort to reduce access to credit which families need in order to buy a home, to start or expand a business, and send their children to college. The Community Reinvestment Act is not charity. It creates a positive obligation for banks to reinvest in communities from which they receive deposits. It is good business and it helps communities, businesses, and families nationwide; requiring similar investments by credit unions is good policy. 
I urge my colleagues to pass this important piece of legislation and to oppose these two amendments. It hurts all those who want a better future for themselves and their families, and it hurts our inner cities and rural communities who are rebuilding. Most of all, they reverse 20 years of successful reimbursement in our neighborhoods, and it deserves to be defeated.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
Mr. President, in 1960, Edward R. Murrow shocked the Nation with his famous television documentary on the exploitation of farm workers in America. His report, `Harvest of Shame,' led to the repeal of the bracero program in 1964, under which 4.6 million Mexican workers had been brought to this country to harvest U.S. crops under harsh and abusive conditions. 
I remember very clearly as a junior member on the Human Resources Committee the extensive hearings that we had and the travels that we took to many different parts of this country. 
Yet here we are today considering an amendment that creates a new large-scale foreign agricultural worker program. Don't we ever learn? Have the special interests no shame. 
A new bracero program would be harmful to American farmworkers, harmful to efforts to control illegal immigration, and harmful to the nation. 
If the Senate votes for this amendment, it is voting for another `harvest of shame.' It is voting to let thousands of poor foreign farmworkers come here and stay permanently. This amendment opens the floodgates to foreign workers. It gives them permanent green cards if they work here for four consecutive harvests. 
This amendment turns its back on years of efforts to improve conditions for America's farmworkers we admit under the current immigration laws. 
A vast new guest worker program is completely unnecessary. As the General Accounting Office said in December: `Ample supplies of farm labor appear to be available in most areas.' 
I refer our colleagues to page 6 of the December publication of the GAO. It says: 
GAO's own analysis suggests, and many farm labor experts, government officials, and grower and farm labor advocates agree, that a widespread farm labor shortage has not occurred in recent years and does not now appear to exist. . . It found that 13 counties maintained annual double-digit unemployment rates, and 19 percent had rates above the national average. 
The late Barbara Jordan and her Commission on Immigration Reform unanimously--unanimously--concluded that creating such a program would be a `grievous mistake'. Every Federal immigration commission in modern times has concluded that agricultural guestworker programs should not be expanded. The Commission on Immigration Reform, the Commission on Agricultural Workers in 1992, and the Hesburgh Commission in 1981 all reached that conclusion. 
The so-called protections in this amendment can be easily circumvented. The Department of Labor does not even have the authority to limit the issuance of visas if it finds that the employment of foreign labor is hurting U.S. workers. This bill strips all of the protections in the current program. 
First, this amendment weakens the requirements to hire American farmworkers first. It requires the Department of Labor to set up a new high-tech registry in which growers post their jobs and American workers who register with the Labor Department can be matched with them. But all a company has to do is check the registry--if it can't get a worker right away, it can bring in a foreign worker. A check with the registry is the only recruitment an employer has to do, and we do not know if the registry will even work. 
Most American farmworkers earn less than $12,000 a year. They don't have computers at home, where they can log onto the Internet and check the registry. In fact, many American farmworkers can't even afford telephones to call the registry. Until we know that a registry really can work, it is nothing but a gimmick that lets growers evade their responsibility to hire U.S. workers first. 
This amendment also eliminates the requirement that growers must provide housing for the foreign workers they bring in. Even under the discredited bracero program, employers were required to provide housing. 
But under this amendment, all growers have to provide is a housing voucher. What foreign worker can negotiate the American housing market? How can a farmworker from Mexico or the Caribbean find an apartment in rural America to rent for just a few weeks when he doesn't know his way around, can't speak English, and doesn't have a car? You can make the housing as generous as you want. But many of these workers are going to be homeless. 
This amendment also weakens the wage standards and will depress the wages of American farmworkers already struggling to make ends meet. American farmworkers are the poorest of the working poor. I ask unanimous consent that an article from the New York Times be printed at this point in the Record.

Mr. KENNEDY. This study shows that despite the extraordinary prosperity we have seen in the United States, the farmworkers are on the lowest rung--working the hardest--the lowest rung of the economic ladder and have moved backward in terms of their real purchasing power. They already suffer double-digit unemployment, and this amendment will make that crisis worse. It eliminates the requirement in current immigration law that foreign workers must be paid a wage that will not depress wages for American farmworkers. 
Even if an American worker shows up early in a harvest, he will not be guaranteed the job if an employer has foreign workers. In fact, that is the way most American migrant farmworkers get their jobs--by just showing up. For years--for decades--they have travelled farm to farm at harvest time. They show up for the job, harvest after harvest. 
Under current law, if an American worker shows up in the first half of a harvest, he gets the job, even if a foreign worker is already there. This is called the `50 percent rule.' Under this amendment, if that American worker is not on the new computer `registry,' he cannot get the job. 
I am also concerned that this amendment will encourage illegal immigration. After spending billions of dollars to strengthen the Border Patrol to keep illegal immigrants out, it makes no sense to instruct the INS to cut a gaping hole in the border fence, and look the other way as illegal immigrants pour through. 
We know from the hard lesson of past experiences that foreign agricultural worker programs create patterns of illegal immigration that can't be stopped. The first workers to come here may be legal, have temporary work visas--but they create an endless chain of illegal immigration, as relatives, neighbors, and friends follow them into America. 
In fact, under this amendment, if you work in this program for four years, you get a green card and can stay in America forever. An unlimited number of workers can enter under this reckless program. There is no cap. Hundreds of thousands of workers can come in, work four years, get green cards, and stay forever. 
As Philip Martin, a leading agricultural labor economist at the University of California at Davis, has stated, when it comes to temporary foreign worker programs, `There is nothing more permanent than a temporary worker.' 
The original bracero program did not really end in 1964. It established a permanent, well-traveled path of illegal immigration. And three and a half decades later, we are still paying a price. A comprehensive joint study by the United States and Mexico, completed last year, put it this way:  
History has shown that U.S.-sanctioned bracero recruitment in the 1950s oriented many Mexican workers toward the U.S. labor market instead of toward local jobs and development. This began a tradition of migration, raised expectations, and set into place a baseline of individuals and families who would eventually reside permanently in the U.S. Although meant to be a temporary supply of workers, an unintended consequence was to create a resident population. 
This amendment adds to that problem, Mr. President. I think it will hurt America's vulnerable farmworkers and cause permanent damage to our immigration policies. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
Mr. President, as I have expressed, I have serious concerns about the development of this program. Similar kinds of programs have been considered and rejected by the Hesburgh Commission. The Barbara Jordan Commission, which really had many thoughtful men and women on it, reviewed these kinds of programs and expressed the same kinds of concerns that I have expressed here briefly this afternoon. For that reason, as well as the very important adverse impact that I think it will have on wages; and because of its impact in terms of opening up some unpredictable, unknown, and uncertain aspects of immigration policy that I oppose this. 
Having said all that, I commend my friends, Senator Smith and Senator Wyden. They have appeared before our committees on this issue. They have been enormously constructive and positive and responsive to those that had differing views on this. They have, brought a very considerable amount of thought to this issue and they have impressed me, as I know they have all Members, about their willingness to try and work this thing through in a constructive way. I intend to vote in opposition for the reasons outlined. But I want to work with them and see if we cannot respond to these kinds of concerns. Both of them have expressed their deep-seated concerns about these issues as well. We do have differences, but they have demonstrated on this issue, as in other areas, a willingness to try and find common ground. I thank them for their courtesies to date and for their willingness to continue to develop something that is going to be effective. I and others who share this view will look forward to working with them.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have heard that same explanation, with all respect, by the majority leader for some period of time. 
I want to just review, since the majority leader is on the floor at the present time--we had the budget resolution. We had 7 days of debate. We had 105 amendments. Defense authorization, we had 6 days of debate, 150 amendments; Internal Revenue Service restructuring, 8 days of debate, 13 amendments. We had tobacco, 17 days and scores of amendments; agriculture, 5 days of debate and 55 amendments. The Senator now is saying, Well, we will bring it up next week, just before we get out, and have a vote on your amendment or the Daschle bill and/or the Republican proposal. 
Mr. President, I just wonder why we can't have a full debate on the comparison between the emergency room provisions of the Republican guarantees and those in the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
I intend to talk about those--now I have the floor. I have the floor. I am glad to yield--but when I inquired of the leader on other occasions, he gave us that other little answer about, `We are going to come to this sometime when we are ready to come to it, some other time, next week, and maybe Wednesday, or Thursday, just before we go out we will have some proposal.' We are just spelling out now what has been included in these different bills and why it is important to have a full and fair debate on them. 
We have seen and we know what the leadership's position has been until the very recent days, and that has been to refuse to permit us to have a markup in our committee, refused us to be able to even have scheduling. I have seen the list of the Republican leadership, and it never was on the list of the Republican leadership in terms of priorities. 
Now we are glad that last Friday there was the publication of the `Republican Bill of Rights.' That was last Friday. But I want to just review, since the leader mentioned the proposal that was put forward by the leader. This was, I believe, the June proposal that was put forward by the majority leader. 
I ask unanimous consent that prior to the August recess [June 18, that was 4 weeks before, June 18] prior to the August recess, the majority leader, after notification to the minority leader, shall turn to the consideration of a bill to be introduced by the majority leader [no information about what that is] or his designee, regarding health care [and further] I ask the Senate to proceed to its immediate consideration; and that, following the reporting . . . by the clerk, Senator Daschle, or his designee, be recognized to offer a substitute to the text of S. 1891 as introduced on March 31. 
That isn't our bill. 
Now, it goes on. It does not include the right to hold the plans accountable. It does not include protecting people who buy their own insurance policy. 
Let me just go on. 
I further ask that during the consideration of the health care issue it be in order for Members to offer health care amendments in the first and second degree. I further ask unanimous consent that the Chair not entertain a motion to adjourn or recess for the August recess prior to a vote on or in relation to the majority leader's bill and the minority leader's amendment, and that following those votes it be in order for the majority leader to return the legislation to the calendar. 
Even if we win the vote, the majority leader has the ability to send it to the calendar--not send it over to the House of Representatives, send it to the calendar, even if we win that proposal. 
Now, it continues.  
Finally, I ask unanimous consent that it not be in order to offer any legislation, motion or amendment relative to health care prior to the initiation of the agreement and following the execution of the agreement. 
Not be in order to offer any legislation, motion or amendment to health care. 
Well, there it is, Mr. President. We are scared in the Senate. After we have some vote, even if we survive, the majority leader can put it back on the calendar, and under the consent agreement we can't even talk about health care for the rest of the session; for the rest of the session. That is what it says here, the rest of the session. 
Now, that is the consent agreement that is referred to. `I want to remind the Senator from Massachusetts we keep asking the Democrats for proposals on it.' 
I don't know how long it took to reject that particular proposal, but there it is. In all the time I have been in the Senate, this is really the most preposterous proposal, consent agreement I have ever heard, that if you are going to be successful and win, instead of sending the bill over to the House, you put it right back on the calendar, and you cannot have a vote on the legislation. And then after that, you can't bring up any issue relating to health for the rest of the session--nothing on privacy, nothing on expanding the whole Medicare system in terms of purchasing, the possibility for elderly citizens to buy into the Medicare system, no way. Nothing dealing with any of the issues dealing with health care. That is the proposal and that is what we are supposed to say, `Oh, what a fair proposal this is.' 
And so we have the Republican proposal that was introduced last Friday. Now, we have no interest in delay of the legislation. We have been asking for action for 18 months. We insist on a fair debate on accountability. That is what we are asking, fair debate on accountability. We have had scores of amendments and days of debate on other legislation, and we are entitled to fair debate on accountability on these measures. 
There are dramatic differences on these measures. I will take a few moments to get into some of those. 
Senator Daschle made a series of formal offers on July 16th, asking for a debate beginning on July 21 with 20 amendments on a side. It is almost a week later and all we have is that maybe sometime Wednesday or Thursday next week we may have time to have a debate on an issue which is of paramount importance for the parents and families of the people of this country. 
So this is not an unreasonable request given the importance of this bill and the large number of loopholes in the Republican proposal which will be the bill in the Chamber. 
We had, as I mentioned, days of debate on the budget resolution, 6 days of debate on defense authorization, 150 amendments. We had 8 days of debate on the Internal Revenue bill, just concluded 5 days of debate and 55 amendments on the agricultural appropriations bill. 
This is the most important health care bill that this Congress will consider, and we are now told by the majority leader that maybe sometime next week he will make a request that we deal with this in 2 days. We had 8 days, as I mentioned, on the Internal Revenue bill, and 5 days of debate, as I mentioned, on agriculture. Now, the majority leader and Senator Gramm are insisting the only way they will debate the issue is up or down on their bill and one vote and that is it. 
The American people deserve to know where their Members stand on a number of critical issues that are essential to patient protection. The Senate deserves an opportunity to amend and improve the Republican bill. It is not unreasonable to ask Members where they stand on whether protections should apply to all 161 million privately ensured Americans or leave 100 million out. The Republican proposal leaves out more than 100 million Americans. Now, maybe they have good reason to do so. Their answer is the States are doing it. Well, we ought to have an opportunity to find out and discuss what the States are doing and how much they are doing and how effective it is, given the 
kinds of concerns that patients have. Let's have a debate on that. But, oh, no. No, no, we don't have time to get into the fact of whether their measure will just cover 48 million and exclude 110 million, or cover all of them. It is a pretty important issue, it seems to me, Mr. President. 
Is it unreasonable to ask Members where they stand on allowing a sick child with rare cancer access to a specialist to treat that particular disease? 
We had very powerful testimony this morning from a very outstanding oncologist, a specialist who has been operating primarily on women with breast cancer, and she was, with tears in her eyes, talking about the various patients she is treating now who come to her with these various tumors in their breasts. And she looks at the first part of the chart and finds out what the size of that particular tumor was when it was first diagnosed and then what it is on the day that she is there called upon to operate. 
She says the time that lapses between the first discovery of those biopsies, which demonstrate that the tumors are cancerous, to the time she gets to see them is often the difference between life and death and more often than not, as she looks over the various files that she gets of various women, the ones with the largest gaps are the ones who are part of HMOs and the procedures that have been denied. 
Or listen to the doctor who was talking today about a particular procedure that was going to be necessary for a child who was having constant headaches, and the doctor said, `What we need is an MRI,' and the HMO turned that down. Under the Republican bill, since the cost of that MRI was $750, that decision would not be able to be appealed. It was less than $1,000. This was a family of five, income of $30,000. The difficulty of that family was having the $750. 
And do you know what the family did? They went down to the county hospital--the county hospital. After a period of time, they were able to get that MRI in the county hospital to find out about the needs of that particular child. You know something. The taxpayers picked up the tab for that. And the bottom line of that HMO looked better and better because they didn't have to pay for that important service which the subscriber had effectively paid for when they signed on for the health care coverage. 
Mr. President, we ought to be able to talk and debate about what is going to happen, what kind of protections are we going to give doctors when they speak out for their patients in the HMO system. Are they going to be under the Republican program which still permits doctors to be fired if they object to prescribing certain procedures to patients that are not desired or approved by an HMO? Shouldn't we provide protections for doctors that are looking out for their patients? It is not in the Republican bill. Shouldn't we have a time to debate that issue out here to find out about it? 
What about the independent and timely third party review? Do the Members know that on the independent review, under the Republican program, those who are going to be paid to review the various procedures which are being reviewed and appealed are going to be paid for by the HMO, the same HMO? Do they know the restrictions in the Republican proposal in terms of the limitations for the types of procedures that can be appealed? We don't want to debate that? 
I can understand why the Republican leadership doesn't want to debate it. Because it is indefensible. It is indefensible. We ought to debate it. 
And access to clinical trials, an enormously important issue, particularly for individuals who have some of the most serious illnesses in our society, we are going to say or give assurance to those who may have breast cancer--are we going to exclude them from participation in those clinical trials? It is an important distinction between the Republican proposal and our Patients' Bill of Rights. 
We have the continuity of care. When a family has a doctor they are seeing and that doctor is dropped from a particular program, under our proposal we provide that there is going to be a continuity of care. Perhaps it is an expectant mother who is going to deliver and, for one reason or another, that doctor is dropped from the particular plan. We give assurances. 
So does the Republican program. Listen to this. If the employer, however, makes a judgment to change the plans in the middle of the year, and that doctor is treating this same patient, under the Republican program there is no longer continuity of care. Both programs show continuity of care. You have to read the small print; you have to understand what the small print says. Shouldn't we have an opportunity to debate that issue? 
The whole question of accountability is something that demands an opportunity to debate that issue. We are talking about the protection that is given to 23 million Americans, county and State employees; 11 million Americans who have private insurance companies. There is no indication there is any escalation of their costs in their program, nothing showing that has been introduced here in the Senate. Some have tried to represent these as extraordinary escalations of cost, but there is no indication, nothing has been put in the Record. What has been put in the Record is these 23 million Americans. In CalPERS, in California, they have this system with accountability and liability built in so they can hold the HMOs accountable, and there is no apparent increase in the cost of those programs. 
Basically, what we are saying is very simple, a very simple concept at the heart of our proposals and which I believe the Republicans have to be able to defend, because it is lacking in their proposal and it is worthy of debate. That issue alone is worth hours of debate here in the U.S. Senate, with the American people watching, because we believe that ultimately the judgment and decision on medical decisions ought to be made by the doctors and the patients, and not by accountants of insurance companies for the profits of those particular insurance companies. That is a basic and fundamental core difference. We ensure that is going to be the case with a number of different protections in our bill. That kind of assurance is lacking in the Republican bill. 
There will be those who say, `No, it is not lacking.' We ought to have a chance to debate, so the American people can make up their own minds and find out whether it is lacking. We can get the legislation out and show where it is lacking. But that is something basic and fundamental. 
We also believe we ought to be able to leave it up to the States to make those judgments and decisions on calling the tune on the issues of accountability and liability. We hear a great deal around this body about `one size does not fit all,' that all knowledge is not in Washington, DC, or on the floor of the U.S. Senate; that the States have some awareness and understanding about these issues and problems. How many times have we heard that speech? You have heard the speech, but you will not hear it when we are debating the Patients' Bill of Rights. You will not hear it because our proposal leaves it up to the States to be able to enforce the issues of accountability. We leave it up to the States to be able to do so. Not the Republican leadership program. They effectively preclude the States from having any voice--shut them out, shut out the States. 
I hope we don't hear that argument about the importance of all knowledge failing to be in the U.S. Congress and Senate, so let the States decide. That is not going to be an argument you will hear, because under the Republican proposal they will not let the States decide. 
What is the issue we are talking about? We are talking about a medical decision that is made by the doctor and the patient, which is overruled by the HMO and causes grievous injury to that individual--maybe life or serious illness; maybe a mother or father, trying to make sure those children and the members of the family are not just going to be left homeless, without any kind of compensation for the decision that is being made for the profits of that particular industry overriding the clear medical decisions. There has to be accountability. There has to be accountability. 
We have seen effective programs which we have built into programs on appeals, internal appeals and external appeals, that also have accountability. It works. We improve and strengthen the quality of those programs. We have 11 million Americans--11 million Americans--who have independent insurance programs that have this kind of accountability. It works for them. 
So we have 34 million Americans who have this kind of protection, but we are asked to exclude it, to deny the States from even letting those citizens who live in that State who want it from having it. That is part of the Republican program. Don't we think that is worthy of a debate? Do you want to muzzle us from having some kind of debate and discussion on that particular issue? That just does not make sense. 
Mr. President, when the leadership wants to go ahead on these appropriations, I am glad to yield the floor so the Senate can move ahead on Senate business. But I want to just make a final few comments. 
Mr. President, I believe the Republicans have abandoned their 16-month-long pattern of stonewalling our Patients' Bill of Rights. Now they have produced a plan that borrows the name of our legislation and nothing else. The Senate Republican plan is not a bill of rights, it is a bill of wrongs. The Senate Republican plan is even weaker than the House Republican plan. It is a `Gingrich lite.' It protects industry profits instead of protecting patients, and it is so riddled with loopholes, it is a license for continued abuse. It allows insurance company accountants to continue to make medical decisions, and not doctors and patients. 
It is very interesting that 170 organizations that represent doctors, patients, and nurses support our program. And who supports the Republican program? The insurance industry and the HMOs. Does that tell you something? Does that tell you something? Mr. President, on this issue it tells us a great deal. This is not a question where we have some ideas, and half the doctors in the country and half the patients' organizations say this is a better idea, and our colleagues on the other side have half of them, and people can say, `Why don't you get together?' 
They don't have them. They don't have them. They don't have the principal organizations. I will be glad to hear any organizations representing health professionals or patients groups that they have. 
We still haven't heard. I can't believe if you didn't have them, they wouldn't have them out there. We have them. They support our program. They support the real Patients' Bill of Rights. 
But they do have the health insurance industry and they have the HMO organizations, the trade organizations that represent HMOs--they support their program. 
Mr. President, we believe that patients with cancer and heart disease and other serious illnesses will not have timely access to specialists and the treatment they need. It immunizes managed care plans from liability for abuses that injure or even kill a patient. No other industry in America has this immunity from any liability which the health insurance industry has and which is protected in the Republican program, and the managed care industry doesn't deserve it either. 
Most of the minimal protections in the Republican leadership plan do not even apply, as I mentioned, to the majority of Americans. Two-thirds of the people with private insurance, more than 100 million Americans, will not benefit from the Senate Republican plan. The HMOs are effectively exempt from regulation under their plan because most of their standards apply only to employer-based, self-funded plans. Let me repeat that. Most of the standards in the legislation do not even apply to the HMOs, only to employer-based, self-funded plans covering about a third of privately insured Americans. 
Even if the Senate Republican leadership plan was passed, 100 million Americans would be left out. This is unacceptable to the American people and should be unacceptable to the Senate. 
The Senate leadership introduced their legislation on Friday. I reviewed the print over the weekend, and the sum total of what is not in their plan at all is staggering. The fact that these minimal protections only apply to a third of the people who need help is shocking. But the disinformation campaign does not end there. Even the protections they claim to have provided turn out, in most cases, to be less than half a loaf. 
In my time, I have seen special interest protection programs masquerading as consumer protection programs many times, but I have never seen anything as indefensible as this. The Republican plan does not include many key protections. 
There is no provision to prevent health plans from arbitrarily interfering with the decisions of the doctors. 
There is no provision to guarantee access to necessary speciality care. 
There is no provision to allow individuals killed or injured by plan abuse to hold the plans liable. 
There is no provision to allow participation in clinical trials. 
There is no provision to allow access to prescription drugs not on a plan formulary. 
There is no provision for continuity of care when an employer switches plans. 
There is no effective ban on plan practices which gag physicians; no limits on improper incentive arrangements. 
We were looking to address this issue of gagging the physician. They say, `Oh, yes, we have that; we have a provision that says we will not gag physicians.' The problem is, unless you address the firing clauses of the HMOs that permit the heads of the HMOs to fire doctors whenever they want, then the gag provisions are meaningless, because they can say, `OK, you can go out and talk all you like, but you're not coming in to work tomorrow.' Let's get real on this, Mr. President. That is effectively what the Republican program does. 
It has no prohibitions against these financial incentives for doctors. It won't publish financial incentives for doctors so that the public, in reviewing a plan, can find out if a doctor has financial incentives for providing certain kinds of treatment and not providing others, which is happening today. We have given examples of those types of procedures. There are no protections for that. 
It does not include a requirement for comparative plan quality information. You cannot find out about the consumers', the patients', satisfaction. You can't find that out. If you ask to find that out, they say, `Well, that's going to be too bureaucratic; that is going to require too much paperwork; that is going to be a rule or regulation, it is going to be a Federal Government rule or regulation, that is going to raise costs for these particular programs.' 
What we are talking about is patient satisfaction, patients staying in these programs: Are they satisfied with these programs? Good ones provide that, Mr. President. These are the elements that are left out of the Republican plan entirely, but even those essentially included are full of loopholes. 
The Republicans say they protect you if you need emergency room care, but they have included less than half of the protections provided by the Democratic plan or even the protections that are already included in Medicare. I wonder how many of our colleagues know that the protection that they have indicated on the prudent layperson, prudent layman standard is an entirely different one from the one that is in Medicare. Who would have known that?

Mr. KENNEDY. Those happen to be the ones that have shown the highest in the polls. I am not saying that is the reason they selected them necessarily. As the Senator was going over them, I was writing them down. Those are the ones that are the top in terms of the polls. 
I say to the Senator, what I would like to ask him is, here the Republicans talk about the market forces, that we ought to let people, consumers, make judgments on the basis of information. Under our proposal, we have tried to have information so that people can make the judgment and decisions with regard to their health care plan. Patient satisfaction, for example. Patient satisfaction--not very difficult. Most of the good ones show that in any event. 
Absolutely not, they point out, and say: We are not going to provide or support any of that additional information because that is a bureaucratic ruling; it is going to cost the HMO more to require that; therefore, we cannot support even that particular proposal. 
But the Senator is quite right. They use these words, `speciality care,' `emergency room,' and the `gag rule.' 
The spokesperson for the College of Emergency Physicians visited with us today. I think the Senator was there at the time. She reviewed instance after instance after instance where just the words, `the protections of access to the emergency room,' were vacant and empty and without the protections that are included in the Patients' Bill of Rights and resulted, in one instance, in the loss of a leg of a young child, the horrific condition of a young girl who had a serious dislocation and her vital signs dropped dramatically and was in real danger of death, and other instances that were taking place in the emergency room.

Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for his interest and also his strong advocacy in terms of the people in his State on this issue. We want you to know that we are still committed to trying to get something worked out. This matter is too important for the reasons that the Senator has outlined. We still want to try and get something worked out. We had been taking a long time before we could get even the recognition of a bill on the other side. Now we ought to go about what is in the best interest of the patients in this country. 
I just mention, finally, to the Senator, what I was just talking about: Every doctors organization, every nurses organization, every health professional and patients organization supports our proposal. We have not got a single one on the other side except the health insurance companies and the HMO plans on it. So we want to try and work this out. We are going to do the best that we can. But we are not going to yield in terms of protecting the interests of the consumers. 
I thank the Senator.

Mr. KENNEDY. I want to take just a few moments to review this very moving testimony in terms of the emergency rooms. These are comments made by Dr. Charlotte Yeh, who is the Chair of the Federal Government Affairs Committee for the American College of Emergency Physicians. And these are comments that she made. 
In Boston, a boy's leg was seriously injured in an auto accident. At a nearby hospital, emergency doctors told the parents he would need vascular surgery to save his leg and a surgeon was ready and available in the hospital. 
Unfortunately, for this young man, his insurer insisted he be transferred to an `in-network' hospital for the surgery. His parents were told if they allowed the operation to be done anywhere else, they would be responsible for the bill. They agreed to the move. Surgery was performed three hours after the accident. But by then, it was too late to save his leg. 
These are not episodes from the TV program, `ER.' These are not anecdotes. They are real people with real lives. 
A bipartisan majority in the Congress has called for enactment of standards that will put an end to episodes like the ones I just described. Last year, the Congress adopted the prudent layperson standard and other protections for Medicare and Medicaid patients seeking emergency care. We thought there was a consensus on this issue! 
There was consensus on this issue, Mr. President. 
Just a few weeks ago, we were delighted to see that Republican Task Forces in both the House and Senate had decided to include the `prudent layperson' standard in their respective protection measures. 
But we are very disturbed about the way in which the emergency services protections were drafted in the Republican `Patient Protection Act.' As a physician, it seems that a little unnecessary surgery was performed on the `prudent layperson' standard to the point where it is barely recognizable as the consumer protection we envisioned. 
What is the difference between the real `prudent layperson' standard included in the `Balanced Budget Act' and the Democratic `Patients' Bill of Rights' and the `imposture' that has been included in the GOP `Patient Protection Act'? 
The GOP Patient Protection Act would establish a weaker coverage standard for privately insured patients than what exists for Medicare and Medicaid patients. 
It gets back to what they are talking about. The name of the legislation--Senator Daschle--they take the various code words going down the line. They took the `prudent layperson' definition, and then they altered and changed it. These are the emergency physicians that I am reading from. 
The GOP Patient Protection Act establishes a weaker coverage standard for privately insured patients than for the Medicare and Medicaid patients. The Democratic bill will provide the same protections for all patients. 
The GOP Patient Protection Act establishes a two-tiered test for coverage of emergency services and guarantees coverage only for a `screening examination.' 
The Democratic bill would require that health plans cover all services necessary to evaluate and stabilize the patient to anyone who meets the prudent layperson standard--no questions asked! 
The GOP Patient Protection Act sets no limits on the amount of cost-sharing the managed care plans would be allowed to charge patients who seek emergency services from a non-network provider. 
You get it? They have a prudent layperson. They further define it to mean less in terms of health care protections. And then they include copays. So if they go there, they are going to have to pay up through the nose for it. 
Don't you think we ought to be able to discuss that on the floor of the U.S. Senate, to see which way this body wants to go on that particular protection for emergency rooms, for consumers of this country? No. We can't--evidently, no. No. We haven't got time. We haven't got time to be able to ask our Republican friends, Why did you do it this way? Why did you change it? Why did you change it? 
Well, I think it is quite clear why they changed it, because the insurance industry wanted them to change it. The GOP Patient Protection Act sets no limits on the cost-sharing. 
The Democratic bill would protect patients who reasonably seek emergency services to protect their health from being charged unreasonable copays and deductibles. 
We protect the consumer. 
The GOP Patient Protection Act sets no guidelines for the coordination of poststabilization care, making it possible for emergency physicians to coordinate and obtain authorization for necessary follow-up care with the managed care plans. 
The Democratic bill would require the health plans to adhere to new Federal guidelines that require managed care plans to be available to coordinate poststabilization care, instead of just permitting the managed plan to turn off the phone at 5 o'clock. 
Obviously-- 
And I continue now with her statement: we are very troubled by the changes to the `prudent layperson' standard in the `Patient Protection Act.' 
Our assessment is that this legislation-- 
Now, these are the emergency room physicians. There isn't a family in this country that does not have some concern--they have children or parents; loved ones--about the importance of having an emergency room that is going to look after an emergency, that is going to affect the family. And there isn't a person that is listening to this program, watching it, that has not had to spend time in an emergency room themselves or their loved ones in a family. 
It is very important. And what is happening out there with regard to HMOs, in too many instances, is that they are putting the interests of the insurance industry ahead of the emergency needs of the patient. 
That isn't what I am saying, although it is what the emergency room doctors are saying. 
This is their final assessment: 
Our assessment is that this legislation-- 
[1.] Will provide less protection for privately insured patients than for Medicare and Medicaid patients. 
[2.] Will lead to more coverage disputes, not less. [Do we hear that--will lead to more coverage disputes, not less.] 
[3.] Will create even more barriers, not fewer. 
[4.] Will create new loopholes for managed care plans to deny coverage of emergency services. 
These are the doctors who are dedicated and committed to providing emergency services to the people. That is their assessment, and we are not going to be permitted to debate and discuss the impact of the Republican bill on the patients of this country as compared to our Patients' Bill of Rights. We are going to be denied that opportunity, Mr. President?  
In four years, we have come so far, but we cannot support these provisions in their current form. We will do everything in our power to ensure the `prudent layperson' standard that is enacted will be consistent with the meaningful protections that Congress enacted for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. Hard-working Americans who pay their premiums deserve no less. 
Now, Mr. President, I will conclude in just a moment. I want to sum up where I think we are in this whole experience. During recent years, we have seen a very dramatic shift from the indemnity health care provisions to the HMOs. We have seen the ERISA provisions that were developed in the early 1970s which exclude liability protections for American consumers. Those particular provisions were developed to protect pensions--it wasn't really thought about in terms of the application of these provisions of the law in terms of health care plans. If you go back and read the discussion and the debate, it wasn't really considered. It was there to protect pensions, and it has worked reasonably well to protect pensions. 
It hasn't worked to protect the patients in these programs. Nonetheless, we have seen the growth of the HMOs. And we have some outstanding health maintenance organizations. We have some of the best in my own State of Massachusetts. The basic concept behind the HMOs was to try to create the financial incentive for keeping people healthier so that the various health organizations would encourage the preventive health care measures, and by keeping people healthier, on what we call a `capitation' program--that is, that the HMO gets a certain payment for an individual; if they keep them healthier, then the HMO's financial situation improves. That made a good deal of sense. 
In the better HMOs it works, and it works effectively. The problem is you have many at the lower end that are reflecting the kinds of abuses we have talked about here today. They have to be corrected. They should be corrected. 
Legislation has been introduced, and we have been excluded from the opportunity of having it scheduled. Now we have, finally, the Republican leadership's provisions, which were introduced in the Senate last Friday, and we still have no time that has been set aside. 
When you look over the range of different provisions in this legislation and the importance of this, we need to have a reasonable opportunity to debate and discuss these measures. The best we were able to get out of the Republican leadership initially was that, `We are not going to schedule what we don't want to schedule.' That is what I heard on the floor of the U.S. Senate about 2 weeks ago. Then we heard that, `We are developing a program and will schedule this when we want to schedule it.' Then we see the legislation that has been introduced. Now we are told, `We may or may not get to that in the day or two before the designated recess.' 
There is not a measure that affects families in this country that is more important than the Patients' Bill of Rights. It deserves full debate and discussion and thoughtful consideration. It deserves the best judgment of all of the Members, and it deserves a bipartisan resolution at the end to try to see that we do something that is meaningful to provide protections for families. What will be unacceptable is some kind of a toothless piece of legislation that picks up the buzzwords but fails to provide the protections for the American people. 
I hope we can get about the business of having this debate and having this result. Every day we delay, we fail to protect our fellow citizens. This issue is not one that is getting better; it is one which cries out for action. It cries out for action now. The earlier, the better. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to offer my support of the Durbin Amendment to the Commerce, Justice, and State Department Appropriations Bill. The recent tragedies in Arkansas and Pennsylvania call our attention once again to the youth violence facing our nation: the pointless injury and loss of life, the families that are ripped apart, the classmates who witness the horror or lose a friend, and the communities consumed in fear. No one can calculate the direct and indirect costs flowing from any one of the 14 times every day in which a child dies from a gunshot wound. National response to this death toll has been minimal, and little has changed in our approach to regulating guns since 1973. Although no one can replace what was lost, we can at least take steps to prevent future tragedies. 
But as we know from harsh experience, you can't arrest your way out of these problems. We must be equally credible on enforcement and prevention to have an impact. And we have to keep guns out of the reach of our children. We need to keep children away from guns. And it means adoption of the Durbin amendment, which requires adults to lock up their guns. The guns used in school shootings in Arkansas and Pennsylvania belonged to adult relatives of the children who used them. Fifteen states already have child access prevention laws, and those laws work. 
What we are talking about here today is taking responsibility for the safety of our children. That means all of us taking responsibility to change the culture of violence, and taking sensible steps to keep children safe. The Durbin amendment takes such a step and it deserves to be enacted this year by this Congress. How much longer must we endure the horrors of juvenile violence before we respond with measures that we already know are effective?  
Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, despite overwhelming public opposition to weakening protections for the environment and public health, some members of Congress are attempting to do so indirectly, by including anti-environment and anti-health directives in committee reports accompanying this year's appropriations bills. Often, these policy directives flatly contradict specific laws or the statute books. 
One particularly insidious example would endanger children. In the last Congress, with broad bipartisan support, we enacted the Food Quality Protection Act to provide safeguards against exposure to dangerous pesticides. But now, the Senate committee report accompanying this VA-HUD Appropriations Bill contains language that could delay implementation of key parts of this law for years, prolonging exposure of children to pesticides used in treating high chairs, sponges, cutting boards and other products used by children. 
The use of pesticides in these products is unauthorized, but unauthorized uses have become a serious problem in recent years. Some manufacturers are taking pesticides intended for other uses, and using them in connection with common household products, and advertising the products as safe. Very little research has been carried out to determine whether these household uses are safe. Until they are shown to be safe, their use in such products should be restricted. EPA has the authority to do so, and EPA is right to do so. 
Under the Food Quality Protection Act, the Environmental Protection Agency has recently acted against manufacturers who use pesticides in ways not approved by EPA. Usually, the manufacturers make unproven claims that their products kill salmonella or other germs, and state or imply that the products are safer for children than other products on the market that have not had such treatment. 
The Committee report on the current bill asks EPA to go through the process of promulgating a formal rule before moving forward with such enforcement actions. EPA has already given extensive opportunities to the industry to comment on the agency's rules on this issue. A formal rulemaking procedure is unnecessary and will result only in delay of needed action and needless litigation to block such protection. 
Obviously, committee report language cannot change current law. I urge the Administration to ignore all policy directives in reports that are inconsistent with existing law and that would undermine the environment and public health. EPA should continue its important mission of protecting the environment and children's health.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in thanking my friend and colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, and Senator Durbin, and others, for providing the leadership in what I consider to be one of the most important amendments introduced as part of this legislation. I hope that we will be successful, because it addresses a problem that has been outlined by my colleagues on the floor of the Senate about what has been happening in our food supply over recent years. 
What we have seen, Mr. President, over the period of the last 5 years, has been the doubling of imported food into the United States. We expect that the food that has come into the United States will double again over the next 5 years. 
We are finding that a third of all of the fruit, and over half of the seafood consumed in this country is being imported into the United States. And those figures are going to grow over the next 5 years. At the same time, we have seen a significant reduction in resources dedicated to inspections. Over the period of the last 5 years, there has been a 22-percent reduction of support for inspections and food safety in the Food and Drug Administration. 
The Department of Agriculture has primary responsibility for meat and poultry. The Food and Drug Administration has primary responsibility for inspection of all other food. The increase in imports in these other food categories--produce, seafood, etc: inspected by FDA would be one factor which could justify the increase that is included in the Harkin amendment. But that really does not tell the whole story, Mr. President. 
To understand the whole story, we have to understand the very dramatic changes which have taken place in terms of our food supply. 
For example, let's look at E. coli, which occurs naturally in our bodies. In the last 20 years, E. coli has mutated to be more virulent and even deadly. This was illustrated today by my friend and colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, and illustrated by the food disease outbreaks that we have seen from January to July of 1998. 
We are not just saying that the appropriations haven't kept up with the need, as important as that is, and that ought to justify it, but there are dramatic differences in the eating habits of the American people. More people are eating out. More people are eating products that are coming from different countries. More Americans are storing their food over longer periods of time. All of this is having an impact in terms of the increased risk from foodborne pathogens and the increased occurrence of foodborne illness. 
The bottom line, Mr. President, is that foodborne diseases are much, much more dangerous today than they were 3 years ago, 5 years ago, 10 years ago. You are getting a change in quantity and the severity of the illnesses, the virulence of foodborne pathogens and their impact on human beings. 
Antimicrobial resistance contributes to this phenomenon, and those in the pharmaceutical industry see it every single day. They believe that this is one of the very significant new phenomena in the whole area of health science. It is reflected in the severity of these illnesses. They are deadly today. They don't just give you a stomach ache; they kill you. 
That is why I believe this amendment is of enormous importance. We need to have the kind of support that this amendment provides, to make sure that we, as Americans, are going to have the safest food supply in the world. We do. But it is threatened. For us not to understand the risk is foolishness. I believe this amendment, with its offsets, is justifiable and of enormous importance. 
I thank the Senator from Iowa for his leadership in this area. I commend him for his legislation and for the seriousness with which he has approached it and for his constancy in pursuit of it. We are very much in your debt. 
Even with this, Mr. President, I think all of us have a responsibility of watching, and watching carefully, what is happening to our food supply as we move ahead in these next months and years. Tragically, if we fail to do this, and we see the kind of tragedies that are bound to take place, we will have, once again, I think, in an important way, failed to meet our responsibilities to provide protections for the American people in the most basic and fundamental way. 
Every day, more Americans are stricken with food poisoning. Children and the elderly are especially at risk. 
Outbreaks of foodborne illness are increasing. The toxicity of bacteria is increasing. Yet resources to combat these festering problems are decreasing. Without additional resources, FDA and the Department of Agriculture cannot act effectively to prevent these illnesses. The American public deserves better. 
In the last two months: over 400 people became ill and 74 were hospitalized in 21 states from Salmonella in dry cereal; 6,500 people in Illinois became ill from salad contaminated with E. coli; 40 people became ill and almost half were hospitalized because of an outbreak of E. coli in cheese; and over 300 people became ill in six states from bacteria in oysters. 
These cases are a small sample. According to the Congressional General Accounting Office, foodborne illnesses affect up to 80 million citizens a year and cause 9,000 deaths. Medical costs and lost productivity are estimated at $30 billion. This is not a problem that we can ignore. 
Michael Osterholm, state epidemiologist for the Minnesota Department of Health, condemned the lack of action after a recent outbreak in the state. He said that, `If we don't do better, and we don't give the FDA more money, more events like this are going to happen. Right now, we don't seem to have the resources or the will to keep something like this from happening again. As long as we don't, we will have other outbreaks.' 
The old wisdom does not apply. You can't just cook your food more thoroughly to avoid these illnesses. Harmful bacteria are appearing in virtually all food products--juice, lettuce, even cereal. 
Our amendment will provide $73 million in additional funds to support greater monitoring, education, research, and enforcement to address this growing problem. 
We have the ability to prevent most foodborne illnesses. Improved monitoring allows earlier detection and an earlier response to outbreaks. Increased food inspections are needed to keep unsafe food out of our stores and off our dining room tables. 
Expanded research is needed to detect and identify dangerous organisms likely to contaminate food. The need is especially great with respect to imports of fresh produce and vegetables. 
Our amendment will provide the resources needed to perform these essential activities. It will mean 150 new inspectors for FDA to focus on food imports, which have more than doubled since 1992. Yet during that same period, FDA resources devoted to imported foods dropped by 22 percent. As a result, FDA now inspects less than 2 percent of imported food. Clearly, we have to do better. 
Our amendment would also provide funds to enhance `early warning' and monitoring systems needed to detect and respond to outbreaks. These systems will also provide information to prevent future outbreaks. Early detection and control are essential to ensure the safety of every American. 
In addition, our amendment will fund research essential to understand dangerous organisms in food. Many cannot be identified today. Others have developed resistance to traditional methods of preserving food. Still others have developed resistance to antibiotics. Clearly, additional research is needed to protect the food supply. 
We have broad support for this amendment. The food industry, consumer groups and the public all favor increased funding. Food safety affects every American every day. 
Without additional resources, we will continue to see the escalation of these outbreaks. Congress must act to ensure the safety of the food supply for all Americans. The American people deserve to know that the food they eat is safe, no matter where it is grown, processed, or packaged. 
I thank the Senator and urge our colleagues to support this amendment.

Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield? 
Biologically, we have E. coli in our bodies, and humankind has always had E. coli, but it was not the deadly strain we are seeing today. Twenty years ago we were not even aware of the E. coli O157:H7 strain that is deadly, and we increasingly see this deadly strain. How many more outbreaks do we have to have before we act? 
This is why I think this amendment is so important, because of the increased danger that these outbreaks pose for our people. Particularly vulnerable are the children and the seniors. With the offset that you have proposed, I cannot understand the reluctance to protect the consumer, rather than taking our chances. 
I find it difficult to understand why we wouldn't have it accepted.

Mr. KENNEDY. It is less than 2 percent of the imported products that are being inspected; 2 percent. We are seeing a doubling of the imported foods that are coming into this country and from a greater number of countries around the world. We are looking at less than 2 percent and the number of imports will be doubling.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Harkin amendment, which fully funds the Food and Drug Administration's youth anti-smoking initiative at $134 million. 
These FDA rules were upheld by a Federal court in Greensboro, North Carolina last year. They prohibit the sale of tobacco to minors, and require retailers to check the photo identification of consumers who purchase tobacco products if they look 27 years old or younger. Of the $134 million which President Clinton requested in his FY1999 budget, $75 million will go to the States for enforcement, and $35 million will go for education and outreach to retailers to ensure compliance with these regulations. 
The pending bill provides only $34 million for this important initiative--$100 million less than President Clinton requested. The funding level in this bill is clearly inadequate. States will be able to check only 20% of tobacco retailers to ensure that they are not illegally selling tobacco products to minors. The additional $100 million in the Harkin amendment will increase that coverage to 60% of retailers. 
By establishing a minimum age to purchase tobacco products, and by requiring photo ID checks of young buyers, this initiative can make a significant difference in reducing youth smoking. Teenage tobacco use in the United States has clearly reached epidemic proportions. According to a report in April by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, smoking by high school students rose by nearly a third between 1991 and 1997. Among African-Americans, smoking has soared by 80%. More than 36% of all high school students smoke--a 19-year high. 
Once people are hooked on cigarette smoking as children, it is very difficult for them to quit as adults. Ninety percent of current adult smokers began to smoke before they reached the age of 18. In other words, if people reach age 18 without having smoked, they are unlikely to begin smoking as adults. 
Even more disturbing is that teenagers under-estimate the addictiveness of nicotine. Studies have found that 86% of teenagers who smoke daily and try to quit smoking are unsuccessful. 
Big Tobacco has known this fact for years. The tobacco companies are fully aware that if they do not persuade children to take up smoking, the industry will collapse in the next generation. That's why the industry has targeted children with billions of dollars in advertising and promotional giveaways. They promise popularity, maturity, and success for those who take up smoking. 
Evidence from the tobacco industry's own files indicates their blatant and cynical marketing to kids. A 1975 Philip Morris report by researcher Myron Johnston described how Marlboro became the most popular cigarette brand among young smokers. According to Mr. Johnston:  
Marlboro's phenomenal growth rate in the past has been attributable in large part to our high market penetration among young smokers . . . 15 to 19 years old. . . . My own data, which includes younger teenagers, shows even higher Marlboro market penetration among 15 to 17 year olds. . . . The teenage years are also important because those are the years during which most smokers begin to smoke, the years in which initial brand selections are made, and the period in the life-cycle in which conformity to peer group norm is greatest. 
An R.J. Reynolds memo written before the introduction of the Joe Camel marketing campaign emphasized that `younger adult smokers are critical to R.J. Reynolds' long-term profitability. Therefore, RJR must make a substantial long-term commitment of manpower and money dedicated to younger adult smoking programs.' 
It's no coincidence that shortly after R.J. Reynolds launched its Joe Camel campaign in 1988, Camel's share of the youth market skyrocketed from less than 1% to 33% in the 1990s. 
An undated Lorrilard memo stated boldly what we have known all along about Big Tobacco, that `the base of our business are high school students.' 
Because the tobacco companies have cynically marketed their deadly products to children, it is essential for the Senate to take strong action to prevent cigarettes from getting into the hands of children. Children and adolescents have little trouble purchasing tobacco products directly from retailers today. Studies have found that nearly 70% of the time that children and adolescents attempt to buy cigarettes from retailers, they succeed. If these youngsters have any problem at the counter, they go to a vending machine, where they can successfully purchase cigarettes 90% of the time. 
According to Professor Joseph DiFranza of the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, `If $1 billion in illegal sales were spread out evenly over an estimated one million tobacco retailers nationwide, it would indicate that the average tobacco retailer breaks the law about 500 times a year.' 
The Harkin amendment will prevent thousands of children from lighting up their first cigarette. It is a reasonable step to prevent youth smoking that has the strong support of the American public. I urge the Senate to approve it.

Mr. KENNEDY. There is a time-honored tradition here which has 
been violated, at least in my concern, where a person who offers the amendment usually is afforded the opportunity to modify it, and that was not afforded to our leader last evening. 
Is it the Senator's understanding that even if we have an attorneys general agreement that basically deals retrospectively with what has been achieved in the past but will not provide the kind of preventive programs that are so important to discourage teenagers from smoking, it will not strengthen the Food and Drug Administration to be able to take effective action in terms of certain advertising programs for youth and will do very little in terms of discouraging children from purchasing cigarettes because of an increase in price? Is it the Senator's understanding that one of the reasons he continues to press this is because even if there is an attorneys general agreement, that it is retrospective rather than prospective?

Mr. KENNEDY. Just finally, because I see others in the Chamber, of course, those kinds of inflictions of addiction are continuing among the young people in this country today without this action. 
My final question is this: Is it the Senator's purpose in providing a substitute, if he had been able to do that, or make the modification last night in the time-honored tradition of this body, would the Senator's modification basically have addressed the objections which were made to the earlier consideration of the tobacco proposal? I understood that is where they were directed. So if the measure had been permitted to be modified, that effectively the kinds of procedural issues and questions that have been raised would effectively have been attended to and we would have on the floor of the Senate a real opportunity to address the substance of the amendment? 
Of course, I think, myself, they both have become interchangeable, but I am just interested in what is the leader's viewpoint on that issue.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as my friend and colleague, Senator Dodd, has pointed out, 
during the weekend, three young brothers--10 year old Richard Quinn, 9 year old Mark Quinn, and 7 year old Jason Quinn--were senselessly murdered because they were Catholic. 
Some time ago, an Independent Parades Commission, appointed by the British Government, ruled that members of the Orange Order--a Protestant organization that celebrates a centuries--old victory of Protestants over Catholics by staging trumphalist marches through Protestant and Catholic neighborhoods--could not march through a Catholic neighborhood in Portadown, Northern Ireland. But the Orange Order refused to accept the ruling and vowed to force the march to proceed along the Garvaghy Road in a Catholic neighborhood. A stand-off ensued--members of the Orange Order attempted to march through the area, but were not allowed past barricades erected by security forces. Protestant extremists have used the week-long stand-off as justification to carry out attacks on Catholic homes and members of the police force. 
Early Sunday morning, in Ballymoney, Co. Antrim, many miles from Portadown, the Young Quinn boys were asleep in their beds when their home was firebombed by individuals who can only be described as terrorists. The boys were living in a Protestant neighborhood, and their home was targeted because their mother is Catholic. 
Both sides deserve their share of the blame for the sectarian attacks that continue in Northern Ireland. But this tragedy never had to happen and never should have happened. The Orange Order must recognize that its refusal to abide by the decision of the Parades Commission led to the murder of the Quinn boys. As a card left at the site of the Quinn home read: `A price to great to pay for a 15 minute walk.' 
Another contentious parade was conducted today in a civilized manner. Despite opposition by the local Catholic residents on the Ormeau Road in Belfast, the Parades Commission ruled that this parade should be permitted. The Orange Order conducted the parade within the bounds set down by the Commission, and the residents of the area staged a peaceful, dignified protest, but did not attempt to block the parade. 
Prime Minister Tony Blair and Northern Ireland's Secretary of State Mo Mowlam deserve credit for not bowing to the pressure of extremists in the Orange Order. And I join with Protestant leader David Trimble, the First Minister of the new Northern Ireland Assembly, and Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon in calling on those assembled in Portadown to end their confrontation in light of this tragedy. 
This brutal fire bombing was the act of cowards. They do not represent the vast majority of the people in Northern Ireland, Protestants and Catholics alike, who have voted for peace and an end to division. Everyone outraged by the murder of these three young boys must redouble their efforts to support the peace process and to assure that extremists bent on sabotaging that process do not prevail. 
We all extend our deepest sympathies to the members of the family. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to proceed for 10 more minutes as in morning business.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the time moves on on the issue of our Patients' Bill of Rights legislation. Just 43 days remain in this session. The time has come to end the abuses of the HMOs and managed care plans. Families across the country know that too many medical decisions today are being made by the insurance company accountants instead of doctors. They know the company profits too often get priority over patients' needs and, too often, managed care is mismanaged care. 
We have legislation--the Patients' Bill of Rights--to end these abuses. Included in the Patients' Bill of Rights is a section that allows ERISA-covered patients to hold their health plans accountable for abusive actions that result in injury or death. 
This provision seems to have drawn the strongest opposition from the Republican leadership and their special interest allies. But an article in last Saturday's New York Times paints a poignant picture of the need for reform. 
Judges throughout the Federal judicial system have written decisions in which they implore Congress to take action to correct ERISA's gross inadequacies. 
They have repeatedly ruled that their hands are tied--even in the most egregious cases--from providing the patients or their families with meaningful redress when an insurance company's actions result in injury or death. 
Mr. President, I will quote a few parts of this article. 
I ask the Chair to remind me when 2 minutes remain. 
. . . The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, reached a typical conclusion in a lawsuit by a Louisiana woman whose fetus died after an insurance company refused to approve her hospitalization for a high-risk pregnancy. . . . 
In dismissing the suit, the court said, `The Corcorans have no remedy, state or Federal, for what may have been a serious mistake.' 
The court said that the harsh result `would seem to warrant a re-evaluation of ERISA so that it can continue to serve its noble purpose of safeguarding the interests of employees.' 
What they were pointing out is that there was no opportunity, after the negligence involved in this case, for the defendant to be able to receive any redress for the injuries they sustained, and the Federal judge was saying that Congress should act. 
In a second case, Judge William G. Young of the Federal District Court in Boston, and I point out that he is a Republican appointee, said--  
`It is deeply troubling that, in the health insurance context, ERISA has evolved into a shield of immunity which thwarts the legitimate claims of the very people it was designed to protect.' 
Judge Young said he was distressed by `the failure of Congress to amend the statute that, due to the changing realities of the modern health care system, has gone conspicuously awry,' leaving many consumers `without any remedy' for the wrongful denial of health benefits. 
Next 
. . . Judge John C. Porfilio of the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th circuit, in Denver, said he was `moved by the tragic circumstances' of a woman with leukemia who died after her HMO refused approval for a bone marrow transplant. But, he said, the 1974 law `gives us no choice,' and the woman's husband, who had sued for damages, is `left without a remedy.' 
Again 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, in St. Louis, said the law protected an HMO--against a suit by the family of a Missouri man, Buddy Kuhl, who died after being denied approval for heart surgery recommended by his doctors. `Modification of ERISA in light of the questionable modern insurance practices must be the job of Congress, not the courts,' said Judge C. Arlen Beam. 
The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinnati, said that the Federal law barred claims against a `utilization review' company that refused to approve psychiatric care for a man who later committed suicide. Because of ERISA, the court said, people who sue an HMO or an insurer for wrongful death `may be left without a meaningful remedy.' 
Federal District Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton, in Worcester, Mass., said that the husband of a woman who died of breast cancer was `left without any meaningful remedy' against an HMO that had refused to authorize treatment. 
Federal District Judge Marvin J. Garbis in Baltimore, said . . . whether ERISA should be `reexamined and reformed in light of modern health care is an issue which must be addressed and resolved by the legislature rather than the courts.' 
The Ninth Circuit continues in another case, and it goes on and on and on. 
This is what we are seeing across the country in the Federal district courts, in the circuit courts, with judges that come from entirely different traditions, Republicans and Democrats alike. 
When they look at ERISA, they find out that there are grossly inadequate remedies for individuals who have suffered as a result of malpractice, or because that HMOs have denied coverage for health treatments recommended by their doctors. 
So, Mr. President, this isn't just those of us who are supporting this legislation that are saying it. Here we have the irrefutable presentations made by district court and circuit court judges across the country that are inviting Congress to act to protect families in the United States of America. 
There is only one bill that provides that protection, and it is the Patients' Bill of Rights. Every single day that we delay acting on it, the circumstances we have discussed here tonight will be repeated and repeated and repeated. 
The insurers and corporations who fear they have something to lose if patients are able to hold plans accountable have used ginned up estimates to try scare people into thinking that offering this protection would somehow result in dramatic premium increases. But tens of millions of patients--those who work for states and localities and those who purchase health insurance on their own--have this right, and a recent study confirmed that the cost associated with it is negligible. 
The independent and nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation hired Coopers and Lybrand to examine the costs of being able to hold plans accountable for their actions. And their study found that ensuring this right costs as little as three pennies per month. Three pennies per month to hold your plan accountable for its actions. 
Now, we know that the insurance industry does not support that particular proposal, and we know that the Republican leadership does not support that proposal. But we are asking, when in the world will the Republican leadership let us at least debate that issue here on the floor of the U.S. Senate? They have denied us the opportunity to mark the bill up in our committee. They have denied us the opportunity to have legislation on the calendar and the opportunity to get that measure scheduled so we can debate it. Mr. President, that is wrong. 
Now we listened to those on the floor of the U.S. Senate the other night speaking for the Republican leadership saying, `The Republican leadership will decide when we will schedule this measure, and we in the majority are not going to schedule that measure until we are good and ready to do so.' 
Well, we are saying that we are going to offer this measure on every single appropriate measure that comes before the U.S. Senate, and maybe the leader does have the power to pull legislation down and stick it back on the calendar, but they are going to be really busy doing that because they are going to have to put every piece of legislation back on the calendar because we are going to continue to offer this commonsense proposal.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to finally point out that the President's own blue ribbon nonpartisan commission, made up of a wide variety of different personnel representing the industry--doctors, patients, nurses--looked at the issues around patients rights. They recommended virtually unanimously that all patients should have the kinds of protections included in our Patients' Bill of Rights legislation. That is the President's commission. 
Now, if our Republican friends do not want the American people to have these rights, let's get on the floor of the U.S. Senate and debate it. But they refuse to do so, Mr. President, and we will not be silent. We will continue to make every effort to bring this legislation up so that we can get about the business of protecting American consumers.

Mr. KENNEDY. The House of Representatives has addressed only one of these issues. It has proposed a limited exception to the Age Discrimination in Employment Act for tenured faculty. But you are correct that there is an additional concern regarding older workers and their ability to pursue claims under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and that has to do, as you noted, with the application of the Supreme Court case, Lorance versus AT&T Technologies. 
In 1991, Congress passed legislation that partially overturned Lorance. Today, Lorance does not apply to claims brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. Unfortunately, Congress did not consider the effect of the Lorance decision on other statutes, in particular, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose this legislation. Much of the bill is almost certainly unconstitutional, and all of it is unnecessary. States and municipalities already have adequate ways to decide questions of property rights. 
The goal of this misguided legislation is not to protect the constitutional rights of property owners, but to create new rights for wealthy developers. It would alter the balance of power in their favor, and force local governments across the nation to accept a wide range of activities that harm communities. 
This legislation is a Pandora's Box of problems for local communities and the federal judiciary. It will force municipalities into federal court early in the land-use process. It will force federal judges to accept cases involving sensitive land-use issues that should be handled at the local or state level. It will add a new burden to federal courts, at a time when they are already over-burdened. It will substantially--and unconstitutionally--broaden the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims. 
The bill is the latest attempt by the Republican Congress to tip the balance against neighborhoods and towns and in favor of developers. It isn't unreasonable to ask property owners to consider the health, safety, and zoning needs of the local community. State and local planning and zoning boards, and health and safety commissions, exist to protect local needs, and balance them with the interests of property owners. 
Each person's property rights are bounded by his neighbor's interests and limited by the public interest. It is not against the law for the government to `take' private property for public use. It is only against the law to take it without compensation. Local involvement is necessary to this process. Only at the local level can the proper determination of value be made and the necessary negotiations take place. Once decisions are made at the local level and state courts have a opportunity to reach a decision, property owners have the right to appeal to federal courts if they are dissatisfied with the local decision. There is nothing wrong with the current law that this legislation will fix. 
By forcing federal courts into earlier stages of these local decisions, it will give landowners an unfair `big stick'--the threat of federal litigation. 
And that threat is real. Currently, a federal judge may refuse to hear a case if it is not yet `ripe' for adjudication in a federal forum, or involves issues better dealt with in state courts. This bill will allow big developers to force local planning issues out of local administrative and judicial forums, where they belong, and into federal courtrooms, where they don't belong. 
The bill also undermines the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court in the Williamson case, which held that remedies should be pursued at the state level before being sought in federal court. As the Court noted, `Rejection of exceedingly grandiose development plans does not logically imply that less ambitious plans will receive similarly unfavorable 
reviews.' In other words, a city can deny a permit to build a factory on a piece of land, but might well allow residential development. 
Most disputes about property are resolved by this back-and-forth process between local officials, neighbors and developers. Through this process, the community shapes the kind of growth it wants and can support. By allowing a developer to bring a city into federal court after filing one proposal, this bill will promote litigation at the expense of negotiated solution. Because municipalities are often small and federal lawsuits are costly, localities will be coerced into abandoning sensible land-use plans because they can't afford a lawsuit. This bill will certainly interfere with necessary local efforts to protect the quality of their communities, including the water, air, and open space, and health and safety, too. 
Most communities across the country are small. Very few have legal staff. Yet these are the communities that will have to defend their regulations and zoning decisions in federal court if they don't surrender to big developers' demands. Some of the cases that this bill would affect could easily pose serious threats to the health and safety and well-being of our communities. 
Finally, there are serious constitutional questions about the bill's proposed expansion of the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims. That court is an Article I court, not an Article III court. It has no authority over Congressional or agency actions. It was created to hear monetary claims against the federal government. Expanding its scope will cause it to cross over into the realm of Article III courts. 
The Judicial Conference of the United States opposes granting the Court of Federal Claims the power of injunctive and declaratory relief, and the authority to invalidate Acts of Congress or agency regulations. The power to invalidate Acts of Congress and federal regulations has historically been part of an independent judiciary. The Court of Federal Claims does not have the tenure and salary protections of an Article III court that ensure judicial independence. So this bill is likely to be held unconstitutional under standard doctrines of separations of powers. 
Judicial efficiency in the already over-burdened federal court system will also suffer, as more federal lawsuits are filed against zoning boards, land-use bodies and regulatory agencies. The cases this legislation will unleash will burden the federal courts at a time when there are over 70 judicial vacancies. The irony is obvious--our Republican colleagues won't confirm more judges, but they're more than willing to add to the current excessive workload. 
These complex issues of local land use are currently being resolved at the appropriate level. Congress should reject this heavy-handed scheme to curry favor with developers at the expense of homeowners and neighborhoods across America.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of the Senate a rather tragic set of circumstances that has taken place in the Azores in the last several hours. 
Some 1,500 minor aftershocks hit the Azores last night after a strong earthquake struck the islands, killing 10 people, with very severe damages to the island of Faial in the Portuguese mid-Atlantic archipelago. There are many individuals sleeping out in the open, in the parks, and in their cars, to avoid the risk of being caught inside of a building if another quake should strike. 
The impact of that was 5.8 on the Richter scale, which is a very, very sizable earthquake. 
As I mentioned, there have been some 1,500 aftershocks. And the terror and loss that has struck the people in that island and in that archipelago is a great human tragedy. Obviously, the people of the United States want to reach out to all of those islanders and all of the people and families who have lost loved ones and those who are suffering injury. 
I know that the United States will do what it can in terms of help and assistance to the people and to the Portuguese Government, particularly people on those islands, and we will want to give whatever humanitarian help and assistance that we can. 
This happened a number of years ago. Some 40 years ago I can remember those circumstances, and I think many of us in Massachusetts who are fortunate to have families and friends who have families in the Azores and from the island of Faial, 
know that they are suffering greatly today, and it is appropriate that we take whatever steps, as a country, to help and assist them. In the meantime, our thoughts and prayers are with all the people of the Azores.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on another item, I want to just take a few moments to bring the Senate and those who are watching up to date about where we are on our battle for debate and discussion on the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
As we have pointed out, that issue, which is of fundamental importance to the American people, is a rather basic and fundamental issue. It comes down to this very simple concept--that medical decisions ought to be made by doctors and patients and not by insurance agents, and that too often in America today managed care means mismanaged care. We have a responsibility to address the abuses that are taking place in our health care system. 
That is what this whole discussion is really all about. Those of us who believe these issues are important have been denied the opportunity to address them. Some of us have introduced and supported legislation to address these abuses more than 1 1/2 years ago, and, more recently, we have done so with the excellent bill that our leader has provided, Senator Daschle. We are in strong support of it. We have been trying to get time to debate that issue here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We were blocked out of consideration in our committees. We were blocked out of consideration of even getting legislation on the calendar. We have been blocked out of consideration here on the floor of the U.S. Senate, and we have been resolute in our determination that this issue would be debated and discussed and acted on in this session. 
We have seen, I think, as of yesterday, a list of so-called principles from our Republican leadership on their version of a Patients' Bill of Rights. I will just take a moment or two to reflect on their particular principles, and the hollowness of their commitment to meaningful rights will be clear.

Mr. KENNEDY. Let me just go through them very quickly. This is on page 1. 
Republicans believe all consumers have the right to: Receive accurate, easy-to-understand information about what their health plans provide, including information about out-of-pocket expenses and information about health care providers. 
Then, if you read through the pages of their document and go to the last page, it talks about the information that will not be provided; that is, it lists, for example, that insurance plans will not have to provide information on treatment outcomes. They will not have to provide information on patient satisfaction. They will not need to report on the quality of the care they deliver. It seems to me that consumers ought to understand the satisfaction level of patients in a particular HMO. It seems to me that we should also have an opportunity to know the outcomes of various treatments in various insurance plans. 
So, on the one hand, you see on page 1 various information is going to be made available. Then you turn around on page 3 and it lists all the things they are not going to provide, including many of the essential elements that every consumer group and every patient group and every employer understands are essential if patients and consumers are going to be able to make informed judgments on their health care. 
Now, returning to the Republican leadership's list, it goes on to say that consumers should be able to `hold their health plans accountable through a fair and expeditious appeals process.' That sounds good. But, the word that should have been in there is `independent.' Patients need an independent appeal process. What does `a fair and expeditious appeals process' mean? If they had 
said it will be `independent,' or to an `external body review for fair and expeditious appeals'--then we would be on our way toward agreement on something. But, oh, no, this again refuses to be specific or even indicative that patients will have fair-minded, independent, outside external review and accountability. 
Furthermore, the so-called principles say consumers will be permitted to `communicate openly with their doctors about their treatment options.' That sounds like we are lifting the gag rules, like this list might include lifting the gag rules that still exist in some HMOs. But, the fact is that most HMOs and insurance plans have the ability to fire doctors without cause. And they also have the ability to make financial arrangements with doctors, and those financial arrangements can be adjusted and changed by the HMO, to discourage provision of necessary medical care. So, while it sounds good to say you are promoting open communication, unless you are also going to guarantee that doctors can practice medicine unfettered by the insurance companies' accountants, you are really not doing very much. It might sound good, but in fact it is not doing very much. This is really a very, very weak commitment. 
Then their list goes on. The consumer should: 
Know that their medical care is based on the best scientific information available, not on political considerations. 
Patients need and deserve the best health care treatment. They are not worried about the political considerations. They are worried about the financial considerations--profit considerations of insurance companies--that drive medical decisions. Do we understand this? Our Republican colleagues do not even commit in their statement that they are going to have the decisions involving health care being made by the doctors on the basis of health considerations. All they say is they will have it `not on political considerations.' They don't eliminate the clear, fundamental problem driving this debate, which is that health treatments are being based on the financial considerations of the insurance companies. 
The Republican leadership's list continues. Consumers should have: 
Access to their medical records and the right to know that their medical information will be used only to provide better health care. 
This would suggest privacy protections. This is very interesting. Senator Leahy, our colleague from Vermont, has been a leader in this whole area. He introduced a bill more than a year ago, which I have cosponsored, and we can't get the majority to report out a bill in our committees, either in the Judiciary or in our Labor and Human Resources Committee, or get the Republican leadership to be willing to schedule it on the floor. Here they are, talking about all the kinds of guarantees in terms of privacy, but they have historically been unwilling to address it in a meaningful way. 
Mr. President, just before the Fourth of July recess Speaker Gingrich issued his principles. The Gingrich plan fails in three very important areas. First, it refuses to commit the Republican leadership to HMO reform that says that medical decisions will be made on the basis of medical concerns rather than insurance company concerns. Second, it does not guarantee access to specialists. What person in this Chamber would want to have either his wife or child who had been stricken by cancer be denied immediate access to an appropriately qualified oncologist or pediatric surgeon who can provide the best in terms of treatment? The Gingrich proposal simply does not provide the kind of guarantee of specialist access which is critically important for protecting consumers. 
Third, it does not provide the ultimate protection of accountability. This will be an issue we will debate here. I cannot wait to find out how the Senate is going to vote on the issue of accountability. Just last month, the Senate voted by two-thirds that we were going to still hold the tobacco industries accountable for their actions. Are we going to reverse that with regards to the insurance companies on health care? Why can't our Republican leadership say, at least on that issue, given where the Senate has voted on tobacco, that we believe that the insurance industries that are dealing with health care also should not be free from liability? Why? Because the Republican leadership is in the pockets of the special interest groups who fear being held accountable for their actions. I would like someone to explain the inconsistency of this position, given the recent vote on immunity for tobacco companies. How can they oppose holding accountable those whose abusive actions can result in immediate injury or death? Who is going to look out after that? Mr. President, we want to make sure we are going to have accountability and that it is going to be an essential issue we are going to debate. 
I call this Senate Republican proposal `Gingrich Lite.' Gingrich Lite. They don't even go as far in the Senate as they went in the House of Representatives, which was lacking. 
Finally, the Republican leadership's principles fail to meet the following very basic considerations and protections. I am waiting for Republicans to describe why they are opposed to any of these protections. I will just mention them again very quickly. 
Patient information--it is interesting, as we list all of these protections in this particular chart, to note where we got these recommendations from. 
In each and every case of protections that are guaranteed in the Patients' Bill of Rights, they have also been recommended either by the President's recent quality commission, which was a blue-ribbon non-partisan group of experts, or they have been in effect for a number of years under Medicare, or they have been recommended by the States' insurance commissioners, which is a bipartisan group, or it has been recommended by the American Association of Health Plans, which is the HMO trade association. 
If you look down at guarantees that are included in our Patients' Bill of Rights, you will see that they have been recommended or been in effect for a number of years. This is a commonsense--commonsense--proposal based upon thoughtful consideration of the types of rights that are currently being guaranteed to many, but not all, Americans. 
Mr. President, we welcomed the opportunity this week to have the measure before the Senate. It was there very, very briefly, but quickly taken away by the Republican leadership. No debate. No discussion. 
This issue is a priority for the American people, and, even though we have only 44 days left in this Congress, we are going to be resolute and committed to bringing this issue up so that we in this body are going to be able to debate these matters on the floor of the U.S. Senate and vote to provide patients across the country with meaningful protections. 
There are 44 days left, Mr. President, in order for us to take action--44 days left. Today is July 10. There are 44 days left to debate this issue and to take action, and the American people deserve action, and they will receive it, because we are strongly committed to it. I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at the outset, as we begin this debate on the Higher Education Act, I thank my good friend, the chairman of our committee, Senator Jeffords, and all of the members of the committee for their broad support for this legislation and for the workmanship which was reflected in this product over a considerable period of time. 
This legislation was reported unanimously out of our committee, and I think it reflects the best judgment of the members of the committee. I am particularly impressed by the work of our friends and colleagues on the Republican side--Senator Coats, Senator Collins, and many of the others, members who were very, very much involved; and on our side, Senator Dodd, Senator Murray, and many, many others whom I will refer to in my opening comments as well. This has been really a very strong bipartisan effort. 
Those of us who have had the honor to serve on the Education Committee for a number of years have always felt that education is something which should have a special position in the thinking of not only the families of America but elected officials in trying to find a common ground in these areas that are so important to families across this country. This bill reflects that continued effort by the membership of the committee. 
We have strong differences on some policy issues, which we have seen in recent hours and recent days, which we will see coming through these next several weeks, the next 35 days that we are in the Senate. Thankfully, we have been able to keep that kind of view out of the consideration of this legislation. 
There will be several amendments from our side and from the Republican side. Those are based upon rather thoughtful consideration and thoughtful differences on education policy, but they are certainly serious amendments and thoughtful ones, and we look forward to addressing these issues as we move ahead. 
We are very hopeful that we can move this legislation, because of its importance, to an early conclusion with due opportunity for the membership to express their views. 
I want to pay particular tribute, as I mentioned, to the chairman of our committee, Senator Jeffords. He has had a longstanding, continuing commitment to a number of different issues in our Human Resources Committee, but I believe personally the commitment in terms of education generally has been a very special interest. He has been absolutely tireless in working with all the members of the committee to bring this product forward. All of us are grateful to him and to his staff for all of the efforts they have made and for the strong and good leadership that he has provided in fashioning this legislation. 
Our goal in this bill is to strengthen the Federal support for higher education. A recent study from the Institute of Higher Education Policy summarizes the public and private benefits of higher education, both economic and social. As you can see on this chart, higher education provides major economic benefits, such as increased tax revenues, greater productivity, increased flexibility in the workforce. 
We are all mindful that when we had the GI bill after World War II, for every dollar that was invested in the GI bill, more than $8 was actually returned by those who participated in those scholarship programs. The Nation benefits, the individuals benefit, our communities benefit, America benefits, and our position in the world and our values in the world benefit from the strong investment that we make in education and by the extraordinary talent that we have in the young people of our country. 
This legislation provides vital social benefits as well. College graduates have greater involvement in their communities, give more to charities. They also show an appreciation of diversity that is vital in our increasingly complex society. This legislation expands access to college for all qualified students. It increases the maximum authorization for Pell grants for the neediest students and expands the formula for need analysis to protect more of the income of working parents and students. 
The bill also continues the critical investments in graduate education through the program of Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need and the portable Javits fellowships for talented students in the arts, humanities, and social sciences. 
The bill also will enable colleges to work with faculty and administrators to improve teaching for students with disabilities. Many more students with disabilities are 
benefiting from higher education, and faculty members often have little experience in teaching these students. This bill reaches out to all colleges and universities and includes training in this area for graduate teaching assistants--the faculty of the future. 
The bill takes a major step in improving training of teachers. Senator Jeffords has spoken to that issue in very considerable detail, but let me underline some points on that subject. 
Fifty percent of the funding in this category goes to local partnerships that include elementary and secondary schools, colleges, and even teachers unions, businesses, and community organizations. The other 50 percent goes to competitive grants to State education agencies. 
The bill also includes greater loan forgiveness for teachers. It forgives up to $8,000 of loans for teachers who teach at least 3 years in high-need schools. Many college graduates with heavy debtloads cannot afford to go into teaching in schools that need help the most. This program will make it easier for idealistic young men and women to work with the needy children. 
The bill also includes early intervention initiatives to encourage students to plan for college as part of their future. One of the greatest tragedies of education today is that so many young students in elementary school, middle school, and high school regard college as out of reach. 
I know many of our colleagues have had the opportunity that I have had in going out and talking to middle-school students around our States. You ask those young people, those young students, `How many of you would want to go to college?' and almost before the words come out of your mouth, every hand goes up in that classroom. There is a great desire, a great interest, on the part of these young students to continue their education. 
Then something happens as they go through eighth and ninth grades and begin to become more disillusioned about the possibilities of going on to college and continuing their education, perhaps somewhat more realistic about some of the financial obligations that they have. It is not completely separate from the fact that the increased use of drugs in the eighth and ninth grades increases about 300 percent to 350 percent. The time when kids are beginning to cool off in terms of their realization of the possibilities for their continuing on to higher education corresponds to the period of dramatic increase among young people in terms of substance abuse. 
Mr. President, the hope and the desire of young students in our society to go on to higher education is there in the middle schools, and so many of them are discouraged from doing so. This happens at a time when there has been a corresponding record of increased use of illegal substances. Many people believe it is the increased use of the substances that have discouraged students. 
On the other hand, there are many others who believe that these young students, when they find out they will not have the opportunity to go on to higher education or continue their education, become discouraged, in many instances despondent, lose interest and subject themselves to the adverse behavior that some young people involve themselves in. 
The whole question in terms of trying to reach out to these students in elementary school, middle school, and high school is very, very important. We need to do what we can to change that distressing mindset. This bill is a major step in that direction. 
The bill also expands the Federal aid for student learning through distance education. The managers' package broadens the demonstration programs, and allows the use of Federal aid for certain distance education certificate programs. 
Distance learning can open the doors of higher education to many who cannot attend classes because they live in remote areas or because of their job or family responsibilities. Some have some special needs, as well. But we must also ensure that the promise of these programs do not lead to abuses. The bill calls for the Department of Education to monitor these changes in distance education, and to report to Congress on the result. 
Another important provision in the bill calls for the creation of a Performance Based Organization in the Department of Education. Its goal is to streamline and improve the financial aid functions of the Department, and give it more flexibility to deal with the many aspects of Federal aid. 
The bill also enables guaranty agencies to enter into voluntary flexible agreements with the Secretary of Education. It will be more businesslike and will focus more heavily on preventing defaults. The guaranty agency in Massachusetts has been in the forefront of this reform. 
Under these arrangements, guaranty agencies can concentrate on preventing defaults instead of simply collecting from students after they have defaulted on their loans. Under current law, these agencies are paid too much when the students go into default and they are not paid enough to prevent the defaults in the first place. 
In a pilot project, the Great Lakes Guaranty Agency reduced its default rate by 96 percent, 96 percent over 18 months by emphasizing the prevention of defaults. This is a win-win-win idea. The student borrowers win because they avoid default and ruining their credit. Government wins because it saves millions in reinsurance payments. The lenders win because the loan continues to earn interest in their portfolios. 
This bill accommodates the concerns of many individuals. Senator Torricelli in his bill, S. 1534, says students who are called to active duty in the Reserves of our Armed Forces will not have to worry about repaying their student loans before they return. Senator Moseley-Braun sponsored a program to encourage more individuals from underrepresentative groups to become college professors. Senators Sarbanes and Mikulski spearheaded efforts to include the Thurgood Marshall Legal Education 
Opportunity Program. 
The major issue in this bill is the interest rate on student loans. The bill reduces the interest rate that students will pay on loans by almost 1 percent, a substantial benefit for students. The average borrower with a loan of $12,000 will save $650 in interest payments over the 10-year life of the loan. The average master's degree student with a debt of $20,000 will save more than $1,000. For borrowers with larger loans, the savings will be even greater. 
Unfortunately and unwisely, the bill trims the rates paid to banks only slightly. As in the House bill, students will pay the same lower interest rate to the banks that they pay to the Government in the Direct Loan Program. But the bill offers a sweetheart deal to the banks by giving the banks a half of a percent interest rate subsidy. This subsidy means that bank receipts will go down only slightly from the excessive receipts they receive under the high interest rates now in effect. It is estimated that the average bank return on student loans will be 16 percent--far higher than the average bank return of 12 percent on its overall assets since 1970. 
This interest rate subsidy will be paid by the taxpayers. The Congressional Budget Office calculates that the costs will be at least $1 billion over 5 years and maybe as much as $3.6 billion. The Office of Management and Budget calculates that this subsidy will cost $2.7 billion over that period, a cost that is not paid for under the bill. 
This failure could trigger a sequester of mandatory inventory programs in October, including Medicare, and we need to deal with this problem more effectively. The best solution is to change the current system under which Congress sets the interest rates the banks can charge. Instead, we should adopt, I believe, a market-based system for interest rates, not one based on price fixing by Congress. 
We are considering offering an amendment that allows the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of the Treasury to conduct pilot programs using auctions as an alternative for setting these interest rates. Competition should determine how much of a premium lenders need in order to offer and service these loans. The results of the pilot programs would be reported to Congress and full-scale implementation would follow only after a subsequent vote of approval by Congress. These pilot programs will give Congress the information to make a sensible decision providing adequate incentives to the banks without gouging students or taxpayers. 
I look forward to final Senate action on this bill. I commend the constructive bipartisan spirit that has brought us to this point. Our colleges and universities deserve no less.

We want to be able to accept her amendment; Senator Graham as well. Senator Wellstone is prepared to move on ahead. 
I hope, just without asking consent--I will, if I might, ask that, if it is agreeable with the manager--I don't want to foreclose the process of moving back and forth--but it would seem, if it was agreeable to the floor manager, after the Senator from New Hampshire is recognized that we move ahead with the Senator from California, the Senator from Florida, and then the Senator from Minnesota, if that is agreeable?

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge we accept this amendment. It is basically completely consistent with what we are attempting to do with the legislation; that is, to put a high priority on enhancing teacher training and the qualification of teachers and enhance educational background for teachers. That is what this program is directed towards with the program that has been fashioned and shaped in California. 
This is basically not a graduate school program. It is just a continuation of a program that happens to take 5 years. There is an issue of whether we want to use the Pell funding for graduate education. I think those are policy issues that deserve a good deal of consideration, but this really doesn't fall in that category. It falls into a category where we are getting a very advanced kind of training program for young people who are going into teaching. This lasts over more of an extended period of time than in other parts of the country. This amendment is fashioned and shaped on a case-by-case method to make sure the program is going to be contained and targeted in ways that are absolutely consistent with the legislation. 
I welcome the opportunity to urge our side to accept the amendment, and I thank the Senator from California for bringing it to our attention. Obviously, we didn't want those young people disadvantaged. We are, again, talking about needy students who will have gone to school for a long period of time. These are extraordinary young men and women who will continue over the fifth year to be eligible for Pell Grants. These are people who are really dedicated and committed. In terms of teaching, I think they are a unique group of young people. We certainly should not discourage them from their careers in education. 
I urge the Senate to accept the amendment.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in urging adoption of this amendment. The original campus security amendment was offered by Senator Bradley of New Jersey and myself some 6 years ago. This recognizes some of the areas where there have been loopholes in the interpretation of that amendment. Senator Specter has done good work in helping all of us to make sure that we are going to have safe campuses. Students cannot learn unless they are have safe campuses. There are important loopholes that Senator Specter has identified and additional kinds of reporting requirements and a small enforcement mechanism, but an effective one. This is a good, solid amendment. I urge its adoption.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for bringing this matter to our attention and for presenting it here on the floor of the Senate. 
As a Member of the Armed Services Committee, I was there at the time the Montgomery educational programs were advanced as a part of the expanded opportunity for young people in the military services. That has been an enormously important program. It has been a vehicle for continuing education for those that are in the armed services. We have been encouraging that program for those people in the armed services. There is an incentive program for matching funds from the Federal Government for those young people who put aside and save their rather limited salaries. It has been very important and very effective. 
Now we have the accumulation of some of those benefits after the young people come out and save for themselves and have served in the Armed Forces, many of them in very perilous conditions, called to serve overseas. Their GI Bill benefits have been part of the contract of service. Unless we accept this amendment, we are really unduly penalizing young people who have served in the Armed Forces and set aside some savings of their own in order to carry on their education. 
It seems that we ought to take this very reasonable step, as the Senator from Florida has suggested, to make sure that those cumulative funds will not reduce the financial aid that these young people are eligible for. 
I think that this makes a great deal of sense. I certainly support it. 
One aspect of the proposal seriously concerns me. That is about how the amendment is paid for, because the amendment takes the money from the Department of Education's administrative funds. These funds are used for both the Direct Lending Program and the FFEL Program. 
Last year's bipartisan budget agreement included major cuts in the Department's administrative fund, and the Department has already had to terminate a number of major contracts to live within these reduced funding levels. Funding cuts undermine the Department's efforts to modernize the student aid delivery systems and to address the year 2000 computer problems. 
This can potentially hurt students and lenders. 
We must work in the conference to find a better way to offset the cost of this important benefit for veterans. I will work with all of our colleagues in the conference to do so. 
On the substance of the amendment, it makes sense. I thank the Senator.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just very briefly, I hope this amendment will be accepted. I think in the study of welfare reform there are a number of items which are necessary to help move people into meaningful jobs. They have to have, one, by and large some help and assistance with child care; secondly, they have to have the health care needs of their children attended to. One of the reasons people are on welfare is the fact that health care costs have depleted their resources and they have ended up on welfare. Third, there has to be a job available; and, fourth, there has to be some training or education. That is the key element in terms of a successful movement. And taking all of those elements with an expanding economy, they have the real opportunity of promise for, I think, meaningful health care reform. 
I did not believe in the last welfare reform bill we were really addressing those kinds of issues and questions, and therefore I voted in opposition to that particular program. The Senator from Minnesota has offered, I think, a very important and significant amendment that will really help to assist in terms of the medium- and long-term interests of those individuals who have the ability to gain entrance into educational institutions, obviously the commitment and the dedication to be able to do so, and I think it will make a major difference in terms of their lives. 
I think it is very commendable. I hope the Senate will accept it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I think all of us on the Education Committee know of the enormous commitment and perseverance and persistence and wisdom of our friend from New Mexico in the development of education policy, particularly the quality of our teachers. It is a very important record. When he speaks about these issues, I think all of us take these very seriously. I do think, however, that in this particular situation, on this particular amendment, I must say that I differ with the Senator from New Mexico. Let me be very brief about the reasons. 
First of all, in the various education programs and recruitment and retention programs--and I won't take the time to go on through them, but as one who is a supporter and an author of a fair amount of them, they never were funded over a period of time or funded very lightly: 
The Paul Douglas Teacher Scholarship, Christa McAuliffe Teacher Corps, National Board for Professional Teachers, Standards class size demonstration, middle-school demonstration, new teaching careers, all the various mini-corps programs, foreign language instruction, small State teaching initiative--none of these effectively were funded. None of these were funded, and we had, as the Senator from New Mexico said, no evaluation of the few that were funded. 
He makes a very good case about the past. I take some exception, and I ask our friends to review the parts of the legislation--I know the hour is late. We don't spend as much time in going through the particular provisions of the legislation. That is point No. 1. 
Point No. 2, I believe, that many of the 18 States are just the kinds of States that need this help and assistance. I will go into the various details of the programs, and many of the comments the Senator from New Mexico has made are actually the kinds of criteria which are included in the various competitive grants. I don't want to exclude these 18 States. In many instances, they need the help and assistance the most. We all need it. We have to have 2 million teachers over the next 10 years, and we have to strengthen the opportunities for teachers to teach better and give our teachers additional training programs so they can do it and hold them to a higher accountability. We are in complete agreement with that. 
The question is how you get there. I am not for excluding 18 States from being able to participate. When we were considering the Goals 2000, we were told that in making available resources that were going to be available to States on 
a voluntary basis that there were many States that said, `We don't want to do it because we do not want to have participation of Federal programs in here.' I do not want the States that may need this the most denied it. 
Let us look at the question--I will take the part of the Senator's evaluation first. If you look in the legislation on page 373, you see `Accountability and Evaluation.' After a State receives a competitive grant under this section, it `shall submit an annual accountability report to the Secretary'--the Secretary of Education--but also to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, our committee, and as well as to the House. 
Such report shall describe the degree in which the State is using the funds to, what? Student achievement: `Increasing student achievement for all students, as measured by increased graduation rates, decreased dropout rates, or higher scores on local, State or other assessments.' 
Second: `Raising Standards: Raising the State academic standards required to enter the teaching profession . . .' That is going to be part of the criteria. It will be part of the application for States if they want to participate in this program. They may have to, as part of their evaluation, have programs that will encourage the States to raise academic standards `required to enter the teaching profession, including, where appropriate, incentives to incorporate the requirement of an academic major in the subject, or related discipline, in which the teacher plans to teach.' 
This is a positive incentive. We are trying to, with the scarce resources that are going to be included in this bill, to say, yes, we want to see movement toward an academic major in the subject area and related discipline in which the teacher plans to teach. That is written right in the evaluation program. 
It continues with regard to the core academic subjects, and it talks about the efforts that will be made to decrease shortages for professional development in poor urban areas and rural areas and communities, and it does an evaluation of these. 
What it does find out, as it says on page 377: 
`Each State or teacher training partnership'--that is either the State or local community--`receiving a grant . . . shall report annually on progress toward meeting the purposes of this part [upon which the grant was given] . . .. If the Secretary, after consultation with the peer review panel . . .'--and that has been spelled out--`determines that the State or partnership is not making substantial progress in meeting the purposes, goals, objectives and measures, as appropriate, by the end of the second year of the grant, the grant shall not be continued for the third year of the grant.' 
I think that is pretty good, Mr. President, if we have a Secretary who we are going to hold accountable to this. I think that is pretty good. That is a tough evaluation. It identifies many of the points--virtually all of the points--that the Senator from New Mexico has identified. Whether it will be enforced, whether we will be serious about seeing that it is enforced is going to be the challenge that is going to be placed upon us. 
Look at page 372 where it talks about the responsibility of the local partnership in encouraging teachers at the local partnership. The application will:  
describe how the partnership will restructure and improve teaching, teacher training, and development programs, and how systematic changes will contribute to increased student achievement; 
describe how the partnership will prepare teachers to work with diverse student populations, including individuals with disabilities and limited English proficient individuals; 
Some might say that is too prescriptive in terms of establishing at least criteria where there will be competition for these resources. Describe how the partnership will help prepare teachers to use technology. We can have all the technology in the world in our classrooms, but if our teachers do not know how to blend it into curriculum, that is very significant to mention. 
The point is, Mr. President, that I believe that in this program we have the most effective kind of evaluation and criteria and accountability that I have seen in higher education. We do not do as well as we should in most programs, I will agree with that. But it does seem to me that the committee has given very substantial consideration, first of all, in recognizing that so many of these programs here just did not measure up, did not have the support, and was not the way to go. 
And the best way we were going to try to do it was to provide some resources--half the money to the States, half to the partnerships. We had a lot of debate about the allocations of resources, and then we established criteria which is spelled out and which has included many of the points of the Senator from New Mexico about what we hope will be achieved in those applications. And we do that for the States as well as the local partnerships. Then we have a tough evaluation program to hold the States and the partnerships accountable. 
So I must say, although there is much to which the Senator has pointed out that I agree with, it seems to me that the danger that we are risking in accepting the Senator's amendment is that we will be denying important opportunities for States that for one reason or another will not meet the exact criteria. They will be denied. We will be cutting them off from any participation. I do not think that is the way to go. I think the evaluating programs and the enforcement mechanisms included in this bill are the way to go. So I hope that the amendment would not be accepted. 
Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. So it was really an insurance program in terms of the loan program at that period of time. And then as the Senator makes the point now that we have virtually a strong economy, we have stable interest rates, low interest rates in terms of these programs, whatever justification was there at that time certainly is not there at the present time but still this fee has been maintained. 
The Senator, as I understand, has spelled out that with his amendment there is still going to be a sound economic situation in terms of the total program, and that we are going to save at a time, as the Senator from Connecticut and others have pointed out, of ever-increasing costs and the pressure that is on middle-income families and working families, you are talking about, what is it, $171?

Mr. KENNEDY. And that is a lot of money for an awful lot of students. I can remember in my own State of Massachusetts when the University of Massachusetts in Boston had $1,000 a year tuition, 85 percent of the parents of the students who attended that university had never gone to college and 85 percent of them worked 25 hours a week or more. And when they raised the tuition by $100, they lost 15 percent of their applications--15 percent. 
It is a real reflection--when you are talking $170, we are talking about a lot of books. We are talking about a real lifeline, in many instances, to sons and daughters of hard-working families, I know certainly in many of the urban areas and I believe in the rural areas, as well. 
We have followed this issue for a long period of time. The Senator has been a constant advocate for moderating the cost of higher education over the long time that he has been in the Senate, and it has been a challenging one. But he, I believe, has made a very solid recommendation, and I would certainly hope his position is sustained. 
I urge all of our colleagues to support his amendment.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it, we have a half hour evenly divided, and I yield myself 7 minutes. 
Mr. President, this was a very good segue--listening to the comments of my friend and colleague from Iowa--to the amendment which I propose this evening and which has the administration's support. 
The amendment I am offering will enable the Department of Education, working with the Secretary of the Treasury, to conduct a pilot program on methods to rely on competition to set interest rates on student loans. The results of this pilot program will be reported back to Congress within 120 days after the end of the test, and Congress must act again before any further action to implement competition on a wider scale. 
The bill currently calls on the Secretary to study the feasibility of using competition. That is too little and too late. It is a further delaying tactic. My amendment takes the reasonable step of authorizing a pilot program to see how competition would work in practice. 
The obvious way to use competition is through an auction. Under this amendment, up to 10 percent of the loan volume can be auctioned in each of 2 years. Students will be protected with the same low interest rate in the bill, and access to loans will continue. Colleges will participate on a voluntary basis. No one will be forced to be part of a pilot project. After the pilot is completed, an independent entity will evaluate the results and submit them to the Department of Education, the Treasury, and Congress. For example, one type of auction could invite lenders to offer loans to all eligible students at a college, or a group of colleges; or a State could originate loans for students at colleges in the State and auction the loans afterward, with excess subsidies returned to the Federal Government. 
The pilot project would be able to assess the practical problems, if any, in this procedure. In fact, there is already experience to build on. Loans for students in the health professions were conducted by auctions. Before the initial auction, the interest rate was based on a 91-day Treasury bill rate plus a premium of 3 percent. At the final auction, the premium was 1.5 percent--a significant cut in the interest rate that brought major savings for the students. According to the Treasury, lenders will make an average return of 16 percent on student loans under this bill, 
a higher rate of return than their historic rates of return on their other assets, even though these loans are guaranteed by the Federal Government and therefore have no risk to the banks. 
As the Congressional Budget Office analysis of March 30, 1998, concludes, `banks do not require the same returns on FFELs that they require overall, since federally guaranteed student loans are less risky than the average bank asset.' The excessive cost to the taxpayer of these artificially high interest rates is at least $1 billion over the 5 years. 
Mr. President, we all know what is going on here. A Washington Post editorial of March 18 is titled `Stared Down by the Banks,' and it pulls no punches and it accuses Congress of being intimidated by the banks. A USA Today editorial of March 23, 1998, is titled, `Banks Acting Like Bullies'--too much subsidies for the banks. Clearly, we should let competition set the interest rate, not Congress. 
As the Los Angeles Times said in its editorial on June 5, `Congress should tackle the 'larger problem: the lack of competition in the student loan system.' This amendment that I am offering this evening is a worthwhile pilot program that can help do so. 
Competition can work and will work to save Federal dollars and save dollars for college students as well.

Mr. KENNEDY. We obviously have the Treasury securities that are involved in these kinds of competitions. The HUD loans; the FHA auction on mortgages is a competitive bid; the HEAL loans, the Health Education Assistance Loans; the FCC wireless spectrum auctions. We had a long debate on what was going to be the best way to protect the taxpayer. And the decision by the Congress was to have the spectrum auctions. Elk Hills Oil Field of the Naval Petroleum Reserve was auctioned. WIC, infant formula, there was a bidding process and auctions; EPA pollution rights are auctioned off. The Resolution Trust Corporation relied on auctions, and the auctions were, in their view, based on their best and final bids. The last auction that went off was typical. The $450 million sale yielded 87 cents on the dollar rather than the 75 cents that the portfolio had originally been valued at, and was returned to the Treasury. Oil and gas sales on the Outer Continental Shelf were auctioned off. Conservation Reserve Program auctioned off; timber sales auctioned off; Export Enhancement Program auctioned off. 
These are existing Federal programs that use the auction system to provide the best kind of protection to the taxpayers, and in this case to the students. 
But this particular amendment says, with the urging of the Administration, let's have a pilot program independently evaluated, the result of which is submitted to the Congress, the Administration, and made public. Then the Congress can make a judgment on this matter. 
I hope our friends on the other side of the aisle who talk about market forces and are constantly lecturing Members will support this very modest recommendation. This amendment is built on market forces and built on competition. It follows the kinds of recommendations which the U.S. Government has accepted in terms of auctions. 
All we are doing is saying let's have a pilot project and test how this program would work in terms of protecting student loans. We have had debates here tonight on the level of interest rates. We have had debates in our committee on the level of interest rates. Let us try in terms of protecting students to give them the best deal that they can possibly have, and use these resources to make a major difference in reducing the cost of higher education in this country. 
I reserve the remainder of time.

Mr. KENNEDY. What my friend, the Senator from Indiana, did not point out is that the student loan defaults were 22 percent under the Republican administration, the previous administration, now down to 10 percent, saving hundreds of millions of dollars a year. This debate isn't over the particular administration, because what we are talking about is a very sound idea. Let me give you what Mr. Petri, a Republican in the House of Representatives, said:  
The amendment would end the recurring battle--he has one that would put in place an auction program. Ours is just a pilot program. 
The amendment would end the recurring battle between student groups and lenders over the industry on student loans, which results in the price of the private sector services being set by political negotiation without regard to the actual cost of services. 
This amendment has the potential of saving the American taxpayers billions of dollars through competition for this profitable business. Up to now, with the exceptions of in-school interest and the overall interest cap, the banks have always received the same interest the students paid on interest loans. 
Here is Mr. McKeon, Republican of California. This is what he says: 
The gentleman is correct that up to now we have tried to figure out how much to pay the lenders for providing student loans in a political negotiation, and we in Congress really have no way of knowing what the right price is. 
These are two Republicans who believe in the market system: 
It would be much better if we had a market process to determine rates. 
That is exactly what this amendment provides, a test, a pilot. You can't implement it until we vote again, but a test and a pilot make sense for the very reasons two of the most knowledgeable leaders in the Republican Party in the House of Representatives have stated: 
I am interested in working in that direction. 
That is in the recent debate and discussion. 
Now, Mr. President, I indicated just a few moments ago all the different agencies of Government that use this process, the most significant, obviously, the Treasury, the FHA, dealing with a great deal more amount of funding than we are considering. 
Finally, Mr. President, just look at this chart that I have in the Chamber. This represents, according to the FDIC--and my good friend from Iowa was referring to various figures. Under the proposal that we have tonight, the proposal; that is, the bill, will guarantee the return on equity for all commercial banks at 16 percent. This chart here shows what the banks have made from 1958 going up to 1996, and recently, in 1994 through 1996, it has been in excess of 14 percent. 
All we are saying, for those Members of the Senate who are concerned about the cost of higher education, is we have an opportunity to do something and do it the old fashioned way--competition; competition, tried, tested, utilized by other agencies of our Government and which effectively works. At least a pilot project; let's give it a try.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment of the Senate's time to, first, congratulate Senator Jeffords and his staff and thank my staff and a number of our colleagues. This is an enormously important piece of legislation. 
I didn't really have a chance in the final moments to indicate the importance and significance of this legislation, but to the parents of this country who may be following this discussion this evening, as a result of this legislation, the students who will be attending colleges after its implementation, which will be later in this year, will be saving anywhere from $650 to $3,200 over the course of a loan. The bill also provides for loan forgiveness for teachers, some $8,000 for highly qualified teachers who will teach in low-income communities. 
It has very, very important quality teaching training programs. This was a high priority of the chairman. A great deal of time was taken on it. We have scarce resources, but the resources that were available were really targeted to strengthening the teaching and the training of teachers. As the debate indicated, I believe there are strong evaluation programs in the bill, and they are very, very significant. 
This bill increases the Pell grant to some $5,000. Then it continues along with some important initiatives for students with disabilities, campus-based child care, distance education, and a range of other kinds of initiatives, building on a very solid record. 
The fact that we were able to get this legislation through in one day is a clear indication of the very, very strong bipartisan support, and I think the vote is a real tribute to the chairman and his leadership and to the other members of the Human Resources Committee. 
I thank my staff: Marianna Pierce who has been working on this legislation for many, many months, over a year; Jennifer Kron; Jane Oates; former fellows Gloria Corral, Maria McGarrity, Eileen O'Leary and Danielle Ripich. 
I also thank Deborah Kalcevik from CBO and Margot Schenet, Jim Stedman and Barbara Miles at CRS; Mark Sigurski from the Office of Legislative Counsel, as well as on my staff, Michael Myers. 
I in particular thank Senator Jeffords and his staff. I know he has mentioned them. 
I thank Senator Coats who was very much involved in this legislation, and his staff, Townsend Lange. 
From my friend and colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd: Suzanne Day, Megan Murray, MaryEllen McGuire. They were all invaluable, as was the Senator, in working very effectively during the course of the whole day on this legislation. 
I thank Tom Harkin for his initiatives, Paul Wellstone, Jeff Bingaman, all who were very much involved in the debate; Patty Murray, Barbara Mikulski and other members of the committee who were active and involved today; Jack Reed who follows in a very long and distinguished tradition on the Education Committee in the great traditions of our dear friend Claiborne Pell, who was chairman of the Education Committee and made monumental contributions to the education of young people across this country. 
To all of them, I am enormously grateful. I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the unholy alliance between the Republican leadership in Congress and the health insurance industry is working overtime to prevent enactment of meaningful patient protections to end the abuses of HMOs and managed care health plans. The tactics of the Republican leadership yesterday made that crystal clear--and continue the obstruction that has been taking place since the beginning of this Congress. 
Yesterday, the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, offered our Patients' Bill of Rights as an amendment to an appropriations bill, to address the worst abuses of managed care. The Republican leadership didn't want to debate our amendment in the Senate, because they know that they cannot sustain a position that protects insurance industry profits at the expense of patients. 
So what did they do? They pulled down the important appropriations bill in order to avoid a vote on the Patient's Bill of Rights. Then they filed an immediate cloture petition on the Product Liability Bill, to avoid having to debate the Patient's Bill of Rights on that legislation. And I have no doubt that they will continue to engage in any other parliamentary maneuver they can devise--in an attempt to avoid debating and voting on the Patient's Bill of Rights. They are ready to impose a gag rule on the United States Senate, if that is necessary to prevent us from ending gag rules on the Nation's doctors. 
It is long past time for Congress to act on the issue of reforming managed care. Individuals and families are increasingly apprehensive about how they will be treated when they are sick. A survey last year found that an astonishing 80 percent of Americans believe that their quality of care is often compromised by their insurance plan to save money. And, too often, their belief is well-founded. 
Our Patients' Bill of Rights will end abuses of HMOs and managed care plans across the country. Too often today, managed care is mis-managed care. Decisions on health care should be made by doctors and their patients, not by insurance industry accountants bent on protecting profits instead of patients. 
For more than a year, the Republican leadership has been delaying action. I introduced patient protection legislation with Congressman John Dingell nearly a year and a half ago. Since that time, the President's non-partisan blue ribbon commission has recommended nearly identical protections. Under Senator Daschle's leadership, we have introduced the Patients' Bill of Rights legislation in both the House and Senate--and it is supported not only by Democrats but by Republicans as well. 
More than 170 organizations have endorsed it. These groups represent tens of millions of patients, doctors, nurses, persons with disabilities or chronic illnesses, those in the mental health community, workers and families, consumers, small businesses, religious organizations, non-physician providers and many others. 
Yet, despite this support and the obvious need for action, the Senate leadership continues to delay. The special interests that profit from the status quo have designed a campaign of misinformation to obscure the real issues and prevent action. 
There is no mystery about what is going on. The Republican leadership's position is to protect the insurance industry instead of protecting patients. They know they can't do that in the light of day. So their strategy has been to work behind closed doors to kill the bill. Keep it bottled up in committee. Prevent any debate or vote by the full Senate. 
Willis Gradison, the head of the Health Insurance Association of America, was asked in an interview published in the Rocky Mountain News to sum up their strategy. According to the article, Mr. Gradison replied `There's a lot to be said for `Just say no.' The author of the article goes on to report that 
At a strategy session . . . called by a top aide to Senator Don Nickles, Gradison advised Republicans to avoid taking public positions that could draw fire during the election campaign. Opponents will rely on Republican leaders in both chambers to keep managed care legislation bottled up in committee. 
Instead of participating in a productive debate on how to give patients the protections they need, insurance companies and their allies in the business community have heeded the call of the Republican leadership, in the words of a leadership aide acting on behalf of Senator Lott, to `get off their butts and get off their wallets.' They are contributing hundreds of thousands of dollars to GOP candidates who toe their line, while simultaneously preparing to spend millions of dollars on TV ads to defeat the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
But before we swallow their phony charges of excessive increases in costs and in the number of the uninsured, let's examine their credibility on this issue. 
Insurers say it is too costly to guarantee that treatment decisions are made by doctors and patients. Yet, they pay their CEOs and high-ranking executives multi-million dollar compensation packages and spend millions of dollars on luxury accommodations for corporate headquarters. 
How can the insurance industry tell the American people with a straight face that this legislation will raise costs, when it is spending millions of dollars--derived from premiums paid by hard working families--on a scare campaign to intimidate patients and deny them the protections they need, deserve, and thought they had paid for? 
Mr. President, we have, and I will include in the Record, a summary of the various protections that are included in this legislation. But before I do, I think it is interesting to know where we are with regard to the scheduling of this particular provision. 
The Patient's Bill of Rights was offered last evening by the Senator from South Dakota, Senator Daschle, and was sent back to the desk. We have been denied an opportunity for a markup on this legislation in the Labor and Human Resources Committee. The Republican leadership has refused to schedule this legislation on the floor of the U.S. Senate, with the exception of the phony unanimous consent request. The consent request indicated that when we had the debate on this legislation, and after a vote on or in relation to this legislation, it would be in order for the majority leader to return the legislation to the calendar. That means that after we voted on the legislation, even if we voted for good legislation that protects the consumers in this country, under this consent request, the Republican leader would have been able to send it back to the calendar. The Republican leader would not send it to the House of Representatives for action. The Republican leader would not even take legislation if it was sent over from the House of Representatives and we acted upon it. The Republican leader would not send it to the President of the United States: instead, the Republican leader would put the legislation back on the calendar. 
This is a phony initiative by the Republican leadership. There isn't a Member of this body who wouldn't read it and understand how phony it is. It is insulting to the millions of patients in this country who have suffered to say that if we take action to try to protect you, and we have a positive vote in the Senate of the United States, the leader of the Republican Party can put it back on the calendar and frustrate every other Member in the Senate. 
This is the first time in 36 years I have ever seen a consent request like this. Last night, the Republican leaders said, `But, oh, wasn't the Senator from Massachusetts here when there was objection to the leader's request?' 
Here is the consent request. I will put it all in the Record, Mr. President: 
`it be in order for the majority leader to return the legislation to the calendar,' effectively killing it. To add insult to injury, Mr. President, it points out that we will not be in order to offer any other health care measures for the rest of the session. 
Isn't that a beauty? We will not be able to offer any other health measures for the rest of the session. We will not be able to deal with medical records confidentiality issues; we will not be able to deal with Medicare issues. We will not be able to deal with any other health care issue for the remainder of this session. 
Why? What is it about debating the health care issues which are of such fundamental importance to families in this country that we cannot get a debate on it? What is it, Mr. President? What does the Republican leadership fear about debating these issues on the floor of the U.S. Senate that are of central concern to every family in America? That is the question we ask. 
And you know what our answer is? You know what our answer is, Mr. President? Our answer is that tomorrow at 10 o'clock we are going to vote on the IRS conference report. We are going to vote on cloture of the product liability bill. Are we then going to proceed to health care? No. We are instead going to have a 2-hour debate on agricultural sanctions. Then are we going to proceed to health care? No. We are instead going to the higher education reauthorization. With the higher education reauthorization, by prior agreement that was made many weeks ago, we are prohibited from offering any amendments. And then this week is finished. It is gone. Starting tomorrow, thirty-five more days are left in this session. This week is gone without any opportunity to debate this important issue. 
I see members of the Republican leadership here. Maybe the Senator from Oklahoma can explain why we cannot debate health care issues on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We had the opportunity to have health care raised yesterday by the Senator from South Dakota. And here we have the Republican leadership agenda. The vote on the IRS conference report is important and we are going to vote on it. 
But is the conference report on the IRS more important than the fact that tonight, across this country, insurance company agents are making decisions on health care that will imperil the health of families? Can we say that the IRS is more important? What about the vote on the product liability bill? Is that more important than this debate? The Republican leadership says that we're going to have a 2-hour debate on agricultural sanctions. And it goes on and on.

Mr. KENNEDY. Just let me make a brief comment because I was denied the opportunity last evening by the Republicans to have a conversation or ask questions last night. I will make a brief statement, and then I will yield. 
Last night, my friend from the State of Washington said: `Republicans will decide whether this great body is going to debate health care. I want to say that to the Senator from Massachusetts. Republicans will. They'll make the decision. Democrats won't. And we decided that because the Senator from South Dakota has raised this issue we are not going to permit a debate on this issue on the floor of the U.S. Senate.' That is what they have said.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in the area of the Patients' Bill of Rights, we have provisions supported by four different groups. One group is the President's Quality Commission. The Commission is made up of a number of extraordinary individuals from the insurance industry, from HMOs, from consumer groups. This is a bipartisan group that is universally respected. 
Another group is the NAIC, which is the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The NAIC includes both Republicans and Democrats alike across the country. A third group is the American Association of Health Plans, which is the trade organization of HMOs.

Mr. KENNEDY. Thank you. And I yield 8 minutes to myself of the 10 minutes. 
So we have provisions supported by these four organizations: Medicare; the National Association of Insurance Commissioners; the President's Quality Commission; and the American Association of Health Plans. 
Now, we come to the provision regarding access to emergency care to permit individuals to go to the nearest emergency room. All four organizations agree with this. My time tonight is going to be short, so I will get back to this issue at another time when we debate it. 
Another provision is access to specialty care, for example when a child has cancer and ought to be able to go to an oncologist. Oh this provision, we have support from three out of the four organizations. The President's Quality Commission, the HMO trade association, and Medicare all say yes. 
For the direct access by women to OB-GYNs, the President's Quality Commission says yes. 
Continuity of care allows an individual to be able to continue to get treatment by their doctor if the doctor is dropped from an HMO. This provision is effectively favored by all of the various groups. 
What in these particular areas can our Republican friends complain about? Let us go on. 
Coverage of an individual to participate in clinical trials is absolutely essential if we are going to get breakthroughs, particularly in breast cancer, and allow patients to take advantage of cutting-edge new technology. Access to clinical trials is supported by the American Association of Health Plans. 
Provider networks need to ensure adequacy. If you are going to represent yourself as an HMO, all of these groups say you ought to have a balanced number of participating professionals and hospitals. 
Nondiscrimination in delivery of services. You cannot discriminate against sick people and cannot discriminate in the delivery of health care by race or religion. Three out of the four groups agree with this provision. 
Patients need information about copays, deductibles and standard information so they can make comparisons between different groups. Who can complain about this? All four groups support this provision. 
Prohibition on gag rules. All four groups agreed with us on this position. You should not prevent doctors from being able to tell you what is in the best interest of your health. 
Prohibition of improper incentive arrangements. Can you imagine we have to put legislate to prevent HMOs from putting the kind of improper incentives into their arrangements with the medical profession? It is extraordinary that we have to do this, but it is necessary. 
Internal appeals to have a fair appeal in cases. All four groups agree on that. 
The external appeals, to have a third party group. The President's Quality Commission recommends it and Medicare has been doing it for years. 
And finally, to hold plans accountable in State courts. We had a vote here in the U.S. Senate the other day not to give blanket freedom of any kind of liability for the tobacco industry, and it passed by two-thirds to three-quarters of the U.S. Senate. We want to give the same kind of protections and accountability on the issues of health care. We will have a chance to debate that. If the Republicans don't want us to do that, then let's have a rollcall vote on that. 
These are the essential aspects of the Patients' Bill of Rights. They have been taken from these four different organizations. Most of these items are supported by two, three, in many instances all four, of the different groups. This is a commonsense protection for the patients of this country. If Republicans differ with those kind of protections, let us stand up and debate them. Let us hear their alternative. 
We have heard in the last few days that the right to hold plans accountable is going to drive the health care costs through the roof. Read in the Wall Street Journal today an article on a study by Coopers & Lybrand that showed it will only cost pennies a day for this protection. Don't just read the Journal article, but also look at what has happened to the 23 million Americans--most of them State and county officials--who have those kinds of protections, and look at the cost of their premiums. Their premiums are not any higher. This result is better than any study that can be done by the Chamber of Commerce or other group that is wholeheartedly opposed to this legislation. 
These are the essential elements of the Patients' Bill of Rights, introduced by Senator Daschle. Perhaps they have to be altered, or maybe they ought to be strengthened, or maybe others in this body have better ideas to achieve these kinds of protections. But let us hear the opposition and the reasons for it. Let us hear the reasons. Let them advance those causes. But the silence is deafening. The American public deserve better. 
The Republican leadership will have a chance to debate the issue, because Senator Daschle and others will continue to press it until we get a time to debate it. If that is wrong, so be it. Some of us are committed to protecting the American family, to make sure that doctors and nurses and patients are going to be making the health care decisions and not the insurance companies. That is the issue, plain and simple. We will challenge the Republican leadership tonight, tomorrow, and every other day for the 35 days remaining in this session, to give us a time to debate this issue. 
It is interesting that the essence of this legislation is supported by Republicans in the House of Representatives, including Congressman Ganske, who is a doctor and was at our press conference. Congressman Ganske didn't believe this ought to be a partisan issue. Dr. Norwood, a Republican, didn't believe this ought to be a partisan issue. But here in the U.S. Senate, the Republicans are making this a partisan issue. Here in the U.S. Senate we are told: No, not only you won't have any one of us support it, but we won't even give you the time to debate it. That is wrong. 
How much time remains?

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself the last 2 minutes. 
In summary, the Patients' Bill of Rights guarantees the access to specialists, emergency rooms, and other needed care. It expands choices. It ensures independent appeals. It holds plans accountable for the medical decisions, restores doctor-patient relationship, establishes quality and information standards. 
The American people are entitled to these rights in their health care. Children in this country are entitled to them. Senior citizens in the country are entitled to them. Hard-working men and women in this country are entitled to them. Doctors are entitled to the kind of protections we provide. The major insurance companies and HMOs should be held to a standard like every other industry in this country. 
If that is wrong, let's call the roll and find out who believes in it and who does not. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will further yield, as I understand it now, as a result of the action of the majority leader, the Ag appropriations bill has returned to the calendar and the VA-HUD appropriations bill has returned to the calendar. So it appears, would the Senator not agree with me, that it is not the Democrats who are holding up the appropriations process and procedure--we were prepared to move ahead--but evidently it is the majority leader who has sent these matters back to the calendar when it is our responsibility to go forward? 
I am just wondering if the leader can tell us whether he has had any opportunity to talk to the majority leader about when we will have an opportunity to at least have discussion or debate on the measures that evidently are objectionable to the majority leader? Are we going to have any opportunity to debate these measures, or are we going to be required to continue this charade and continue to try to offer these amendments on other appropriations as well?

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am encouraged certainly by the comments of the acting floor leader now that he says we will have an opportunity to debate the issues on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We look forward to that opportunity. But I will just take a few moments of the Senate's time--I will not take a great deal of time--to really correct the Record. 
As the Senator from Oklahoma remembers, and should remember very clearly, the U.S. Senate overturned in 1995 the longstanding rule that we would not have legislation on appropriations. And it was the Republican Party that overturned that concept. Every single Republican, including the Senator from Oklahoma, voted to overturn the ruling of the chair and allow legislation on appropriations. So, now we have legislation on appropriations. I think it is regrettable, and should the Republican leader want to alter and change that, I think he would find that there would be strong support for that. 
But, Mr. President, I want to get back and talk for just a moment or two about what the issues really are. We have just listened to our friends from the States of Washington and Oklahoma speak on the floor about what cannot be done, or what should not be done. 
Earlier this afternoon, in a time-honored process and procedure, the minority leader, Senator Daschle, sent to the desk of the U.S. Senate an amendment to provide for a Patients' Bill of Rights, a recognition that in this country too often those who are making health care decisions are actually insurance company accountants rather than doctors. Too often the doctors, who represent the best interests of the patients, are caught in this extraordinary dilemma and understand that they are put between a rock and a hard place. Too often in our country we find that managed care is mismanaged care. And we have heard examples of this on the Senate floor time and time again over the period of these past weeks. I dare say that we have had few days that have gone by when Senators have not spoken about particular tragedies that have been experienced in their States. 
Senator Daschle's amendment should have allowed the Senate to debate the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights, debate it this afternoon, debate it this evening, debate it tomorrow, but debate it and reach some kind of a conclusion on the issue. The President has spoken. He spoke as recently as this afternoon in support of the legislation that was included in Senator Daschle's proposal. 
That is what this is about. We have that opportunity to debate managed care reform. The Democratic leader offered the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is an issue that Republicans and Democrats across the country want us to do something about. We are being denied that opportunity because the majority leader pulled the bill down and put it back on the calendar, as was his wont to do, and we are again denied the opportunity to debate this critically important issue. 
So our efforts to move toward that debate have been temporarily deferred--deferred perhaps for a day or two, but certainly not longer than a day or two. We are going to come back to that issue and keep coming back. And our friends on the majority side better get used to it. They may get into a situation where they are going to put appropriations bill after appropriations bill after appropriations bill back on the calendar because the Senate will want to debate a Patients' Bill of Rights, and the Republican Leadership will want to continue to deny us that opportunity. Mr. President, we will continue to demand debate because the American people are demanding it. 
You can say, Why are we in this kind of a situation? Why aren't we following a regular order, the procedure that everyone learns in civics class and in their study of American history, that says when legislation is introduced, it goes to the committee, the committee marks it up, it comes to the floor, it is acted upon on the floor, the two bodies get together in a conference, and, if they agree, they send it to the President of the United States? 
The reason the Senator from South Dakota offered the amendment is because we could not get a markup and we could not get a hearing in the appropriate committee. We were denied that opportunity--denied it, turned down, thumbs down to the Senators who supported that legislation. No, you can't have a hearing on that legislation in our committee. The Republicans told those of us on the Labor and Human Resources Committee that not only can't you have that hearing, but, if you introduce the legislation, we will not give you a markup on it. We will not let you have a debate in the committee. We are going to obstruct the whole committee process so you will not be able to advance your issues, and the issues of the American people. 
I did not hear that talked about by the Senator from Washington. I did not hear that talked about from the Senator from Oklahoma. The majority leader has put forward several lists of his priorities for the session, and the Patients' Bill of Rights is not on any one of them--not on any one of them. The Republican leadership wants to stonewall--stonewall on this issue, which is of such great importance to families all across the country. That is why the Democratic leader offered this amendment, because the Republican leadership is trying to stonewall it. 
So, Mr. President, are we going to say--those of us who favor patient protection legislation--that we are going to be denied consideration of the committee, we are going to be denied a markup in the committee, and we are going to be denied floor debate by the majority leader and the Republican leadership, that we are not even going to consider this issue in the U.S. Senate? 
No. That is not the kind of U.S. Senate that our Founding Fathers intended, nor has today been one of our best and greatest days. But we are going to debate this issue, and we are going to act on it. Make no mistake about it. 
And we are going to come right back after that and consider an increase in the minimum wage. Our Republican friends better hear that as well. We can't get the markup on the increase in the minimum wage for workers in this country--workers who have not benefited by the extraordinary explosion of the stock markets and the extraordinary increase in the accumulation of wealth. These are men and women who are working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, primarily single women, primarily women who are heads of households with children. This is a women's issue. It is a children's issue. It is a fairness issue. And we are going to consider it this year. We know Republican leaders are opposed to that. 
What else is new? They were opposed to it last time. And we were able to be successful. It wasn't on the Republican agenda the last time we saw an increase in the minimum wage. The increase in the minimum wage has never been on the Republican agenda. Yet we have been successful in doing so. And we will be successful in doing so this time. 
So that is why we find ourselves where we do this evening. And here the Democratic leader offers our amendment, makes a brief comment--a brief comment--about it. And then, bingo, the bill is pulled. Now we hear from the Republican leadership that, Oh, well, you objected to a consent agreement that could get this proposal before the Senate and to act on it. 
I would love to take the time of the Senate to go through this, but let me just include the appropriate parts of this proposal. Let me just mention a very interesting aspect of the consent agreement, to which the Senator from Washington referred. I asked him to yield so we could go through this agreement together. He refused the opportunity to do so. I can understand why, too. I might have wanted to do the same if I had to defend this proposed agreement. This is what was included in the agreement. 
And I will include the whole agreement. But let me read a section:  
I ask unanimous consent that the Chair not entertain a motion to adjourn or recess for the August recess prior to a vote on or in relation to the majority leader's bill and the minority leader's amendment. 
And that following those votes: 
It be in order for the majority leader-- 
Listen to this-- to return the legislation to the calendar. 
`Return the legislation to the calendar.' 
And the Senator from Washington has the audacity to say on the floor of the Senate that the consent that was offered by the majority leader would have actually gotten these measures up? 
You know what this proposal is effectively saying? This says that after the votes, even if we win the Patients' Bill of Rights with a majority of the Members of the Senate, it will be in order for the majority leader to--send it to the President of the United States if the House has already acted on it? No. To send it to the House of Representatives if they have not acted on it? No. Under the majority leader's proposal, if we pass it, after a debate, the majority leader sends it right back up there to the desk. It is over. Good-bye, farewell, so long, to protections for the patients of this country. 
Now, that is a farce, an absolute farce. I could go through the whole consent agreement, but it should not be given any more attention because it is a farce offered, evidently, only to make a political point. 
The Patients' Bill of Rights is a commonsense plan that guarantees fundamental protections that every good insurance company already provides and that every American who pays insurance premiums deserves to have when serious illness strikes. 
But the Republican leader's position is to protect the insurance industry instead of protecting the patients. They know they cannot do that in the light of day, so their strategy is to work behind closed doors to kill the bill, keep it bottled up in committee, no markup, no floor debate, no vote. That has been the strategy. Ask any Member of this body whether they can contest that. They cannot. No markup, no floor debate, no vote, no fair time agreement. 
Mr. Willis Gradison, the head of the Health Insurance Association of America, when asked in an interview published in the Rocky Mountain News to sum up the strategy of the businesses opposed to patient protections, replied: 
There's a lot to be said for `just say no.' 
`Just say no.' The author of the article goes on to report that at a strategy session last month called by a top aide to Senator Don Nickles, Gradison advised Republicans to avoid taking public positions that could draw fire during the election campaign. Opponents will rely on Republican leaders in both Chambers to keep managed care legislation bottled up. 
Well, they have done a good job of bottling it up tonight. We would have had an opportunity for debate if they had not pulled down the underlying legislation. But, no, they bottled it up by sending the bill right back to the calendar. 
That has been the strategy for the past year--keep the Patients' Bill of Rights bottled up, engage in a campaign of misinformation and disinformation, cater to the special interests, ignore insurance company abuses, and ignore the will of the American people. We are seeing that strategy in this Chamber this evening. 
Now, Mr. President, the rights that are included in our legislation are commonsense components of quality care that every family believes they were promised when they signed up for insurance coverage and paid their premiums. Virtually all of the protections that this legislation provides already apply to Medicare, are recommended by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which is a bipartisan group, or were recommended by the President's Advisory Commission, another nonpartisan group, or even established as voluntary standards by the managed care industry itself through their trade association. 
These commonsense rights include access to appropriate specialists when a patient's condition requires specialty care. It would allow people with chronic illnesses or disabilities to have referrals to the specialists they need on a regular basis. 
It assures that patients whose plans cover prescription drugs can have access to drugs needed to save their life or protect their health even if the drugs are not included on their plan's restricted list. 
They are assured that persons suffering from serious symptoms can go to the nearest emergency room without worrying that their plan will deny coverage. No patients with the symptoms of a heart attack should be forced to put their life at risk by driving past the emergency room down the street to the managed care hospital farther away, and that is happening here in the United States tonight. 
No patient with symptoms of a stroke should be forced to delay treatment to the point where paralysis and disability are permanent because an accountant in the managed care headquarters does not respond promptly and appropriately. 
Reforms must protect the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship. Gag clauses and improper incentive arrangements should have no place in American medicine. They are absolutely appalling, Mr. President. 
This amendment only says that any reform worthy of the name must guarantee that insurance plans meet the special needs of women and children. Women should have access to gynecologists for needed services. No woman with breast cancer should be forced to endure a drive-through mastectomy against the advice of her doctor or be denied reconstructive surgery following breast cancer surgery if that is her choice. 
No child with a childhood cancer should be told that a urologist who happens to be in the plan's network will treat him, even if that urologist has no experience or expertise with children or with that type of cancer. 
Patients should have the right to appeal their plans' decisions to independent third parties. Today, if a health plan breaks its promise, the only recourse for most patients is to go to court, a time-consuming, costly process that may not provide relief in time to save a life or prevent a disability. 
Independent review was recommended unanimously by the President's Commission. Republicans and Democrats alike recommended independent review unanimously. It has worked successfully in Medicare for more than three decades. Families deserve the basic fairness that only a timely, impartial appeal can provide. 
Without such a mechanism, any rights guaranteed to patients exist on paper only, and they are often worth no more than the paper on which they are printed. When the issues are sickness and health, and often as serious as life and death, no health insurance company should be allowed to be both judge and jury. 
When health plan's misconduct results in serious injury or death, patients and their families should be able to hold those plans accountable for their actions. Every other industry in America can be held responsible for its actions. Why should health plans whose decisions can truly mean the difference between life and death enjoy this unique immunity? 
We had a debate on the issues of immunity not long ago with regard to the tobacco industry, and this body voted overwhelmingly not to give immunity to tobacco. These health plans have immunity today under the ERISA provisions. That is not right and we ought to address it. Every day and every night that we delay it, the health, the good health of American families is threatened. You would think, when you listen to the Republican leadership talk about scheduling, that it doesn't matter a twiddle whether this debate goes on today or tomorrow or next week or next month or next year. It does. And every day we delay means that more families' health protections are threatened. 
Under the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act, patients whose lives have been devastated or destroyed by the reckless behavior of their health plan have no ability to go to court to obtain appropriate redress. ERISA preempts all State remedies, so patients are limited to Federal ERISA remedies, which will only cover the cost of the procedure for which the plan failed to pay. 
Just the cost of the procedure--some remedy. You can be crippled for life by cancer of the spine because the plan refused to authorize a test costing a few hundred dollars to detect the cancer in its early stages, and all you can get back to help support your family is the cost of the test. That is no remedy. That is wrong. And our bill does something about it. 
During the debate on the tobacco legislation, as I mentioned, Republicans and Democrats alike voted overwhelmingly to support the proposition that no industry in America should be exempt from accountability because of its actions, but because of the ERISA preemption, one industry alone--the health insurance industry--enjoys this protection. That is wrong and today the Senate should have the opportunity to say it is wrong. 
ERISA preemption applies to the millions of Americans who get their coverage through a private employer, but it does not apply to 23 million State and local employees and their families. It does not apply to Medicaid patients. It does not apply to Medicare. And we have not heard a shred of evidence that the ability of State and local employees, Medicaid patients and Medicare patients to sue their health plans has imposed significant costs on those plans. That case has not been made. 
Mr. President, 23 million State and county employees have that kind of ability to sue, and we have not seen that the costs of their plans have been higher than others. So I challenge my colleagues who oppose this provision to explain to the American people why State and local government employees should be able to hold their taxpayer-financed health plans accountable if they are injured or killed by the plan's behavior, but equally hard-working Americans employed by private companies should be denied this basic right. Explain that to me. 
Our legislation simply removes the Federal preemption provision. It creates no Federal right to sue and lets States take whatever steps they see fit. So many of those who oppose this legislation are fond of talking about the need to keep Washington out of decisions by States, but when the profits of special interests are at stake, it suddenly becomes better for bureaucrats in Washington rather than elected State and local officials to decide what is best for people in their State. This amendment should not be controversial for any Member of the Senate who is serious about protecting patients from insurance company abuse. It is supported by the American Medical Association--and more than 170 other organizations, Mr. President. Let me just give you a few. 
The Patients' Bill of Rights is supported by the American Medical Association, the Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities, the American Cancer Society, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the National Partnership for Women and Families, the National Association of Children's Hospitals, the AFL-CIO, the American Association of Retired Persons and many other groups representing physicians, health care providers, children, women, families, consumers, persons with disabilities, small businesses, Americans with serious illnesses, religious organizations, and working families. 
Find me another piece of pending legislation that has that kind of support. But we are told we cannot even debate it tonight. We are told we cannot even consider it tonight. We are told we cannot even move this legislation to have a rollcall vote to see who is for it and who is against it. 
It is rare for such a broad and diverse coalition to come together in support of legislation. But they have done so to end the flagrant abuses that hurt so many families. The choice is clear. The Senate should stand with patients, families and physicians, not the well-heeled special interests that put profits ahead of patients. 
The American people know what is going on. Movie audiences across the country erupt in cheers when actress Helen Hunt attacks the abuses of managed care in the film `As Good As It Gets.' Helen Hunt won an Oscar for that performance, but managed care is not winning any Oscars from the American people. Everyone knows that managed care today is not as good as it gets. 
It is time for Congress to end the abuses of patients and physicians by HMOs and managed care health plans. Too often, managed care is mismanaged care. No amount of distortions or smokescreens by insurance companies can change those facts. A Patients' Bill of Rights can stop these abuses, and let's pass it before more patients have to suffer. 
We want to tell our friends on the other side of the aisle that they are going to see this amendment day after day after day after day, until this body has a chance to debate it and vote on it. Let me give the assurance of that. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I welcome this opportunity to recognize the valuable service given to Massachusetts by our state District Court Judge Maurice H. Richardson, who retired in June after serving the citizens of Norfolk County with great distinction for nearly a quarter century. 
Judge Richardson dedicated his career in the law to serving the people of our state. As a judge he applied the law with great wisdom and compassion. He was well known for his ability to distinguish between hardened, habitual criminals and those who could take advantage of opportunities for rehabilitation. He encouraged many to seek counseling, enter a drug or alcohol treatment program, or take other steps to put their lives and their families back together. 
During his years on the bench, Judge Richardson was also a skillful and tireless advocate for mental health. For many years he presided over mental health commitment hearings for several Massachusetts facilities. He was dedicated to finding the most effective assistance for the mentally ill, and often worked closely with doctors, patients and their families. 
Judge Richardson also took the lead in the state judicial system and state legislature to improve the way the mentally ill and the mentally retarded are treated by the state courts, and his efforts enhanced the quality of life for countless individuals and their families. 
Judge Richardson has earned well-deserved recognition for his leadership and his achievements. Throughout his distinguished career, he received numerous awards, including the District Court Award for Judicial Excellence from the Massachusetts Judges' Conference, the Annual Award from the Bar Association of Norfolk County, and the Commissioners Award from the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health. 
I am sure that my colleagues join me in commending Judge Richardson for his distinguished service. We congratulate him on his extraordinary career and we extend our warmest wishes to Judge Richardson and his family on his retirement.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, a few months ago, the American Immigration Lawyers Association held its second annual essay contest, entitled `Celebrate America' for fifth grade children across the country. The children were asked to write essays on the subject, `Why I am Glad America is a Nation of Immigrants.' 
Thousands of children entered the contest, and I congratulate all the participants. Five winners were selected, and were judged by a panel that included our colleague Senator Abraham, Washington State Governor Gary Locke, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Alan Page, and myself. 
The winner of this year's contest is Jaclyn Mals, from Decatur Classical School in Chicago, who wrote about her great-grandfather's immigrant experience. In addition, four other students were honored for their essays--Tony Kudron of Livonia, MI, Samantha Fonseca-Moreira of Lexington, MA, Mandi Steiner of West Hills, CA, and Kayla Weinstein of Encinitas, CA. All of the essays are an expression of the pride that we all share in our immigrant heritage, and emphasize what the nation gains from immigrants.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, upon our return in July, it is my hope that the Senate will turn to full and open debate of patient protection legislation at the earliest appropriate time. The American people are concerned about the state of our health care system. Earlier this month, a survey by the Pew Research Center showed HMO regulation at the top of the list of issues important to individuals and the country. 
We have a proposal, the Patients' Bill of Rights (S. 1890), which would restore confidence in our system. A critical provision in our bill would allow patients who receive their benefits through their employer to hold their plans accountable for medical or coverage decisions that result in injury or death. Currently, approximately 123 million Americans are precluded from seeking any meaningful redress when they are permanently disabled or when they lose a loved one because of insurance company abuses that put profits ahead of patients.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the House version of the Reading Excellence Act, and I also oppose the process by which it is being brought to the Senate at the last minute in an effort to pass this bad bill under the pressure of the July 1 funding deadline. 
On May 13th, six weeks ago, the Labor and Human Resources Committee approved an alternative bill on this issue, with unanimous bipartisan support, and with the strong backing of educators, reading specialists, and community organizations across the country. Despite this overwhelming support for the Senate committee bill, the Republican leadership refused to allow the full Senate to act on it. Instead, they did nothing for six weeks. Now, as the July 1 deadline is upon us, they insist that we swallow the deeply flawed House bill. 
What is at stake here is nothing less than the way teachers and schools across the country will be allowed to help children learn to read. 
Organizations throughout the nation who know this well are adamantly opposed to the House bill. These groups include the American Association of School Administrators--the International Reading Association--the Council of Chief State School Officers--the National School Boards Association--the National Parent Teacher Association--the National Council of Teachers of English--the American Federation of Teachers--the National Education Association--the National Association of Elementary School Principals--the National Conference on Language and Literacy--the Conference on College Composition and Communications--the National Association of State Boards of Education--Reach Out and Read. 
All of these groups are doing the hard day-to-day work, helping children learn to read. They say that no bill would be better than the House bill, because the House bill will not help them do the work they need to do. 
In last year's appropriations legislation, Congress reserved $210 million for a child literacy program if enacted by July 1. By missing the July 1 deadline, we miss an initial opportunity. But we will have many other opportunities this session to pass a bill we can all support--and fund it accordingly. 
Many successful models to help children learn to read well now exist, but they are not yet available to all children. As a result, far too many children in communities across the country are denied the opportunity to learn to read well. The statistics are appalling. Forty percent of 4th grade students do not achieve the basic level in reading, and 70 percent of 4th graders do not achieve the proficient level. 
We must do more--much more--to help all children learn to read well. Many of the reading difficulties experienced by teenagers and adults today could have been prevented by adequate intervention in early childhood. By working to ensure that all children learn to read well in the early grades, we can also reduce the need for costly special education instruction in later grades. 
The time has come to pass a bill that will help all children learn to read well. Child literacy is an important goal, and if we are to reach this goal, we need well-educated, well-trained teachers prepared to give children the special assistance they deserve. We need dedicated and trained volunteer tutors. We need support for successful community programs to improve family literacy and teach parents how to read more effectively with their children at home. We need support for innovative community efforts to help children learn to read before they enter school. 
This House-passed bill is not an adequate response to these problems. This bill undermines state and local responsibility for public education. My Republican colleagues want to create a new state bureaucracy and new federal control over public education. These are the same Republicans who say they want school vouchers and block grants, in order to give parents and communities more choice and more control over their children's education. 
State and local education agencies and school administrators are doing well in creating, implementing, and coordinating innovative efforts to help children learn. We should do more to support these efforts. We should provide community organizations with the resources they need to bring successful programs to more people. Instead, my colleagues want to bypass state leadership, undermine local control, and create a new state bureaucracy, when states and communities are already prepared to implement new literacy programs and oversee the use of new Federal funding. 
State Departments of Education and local education agencies are already working successfully to coordinate local, State, and Federal resources to improve education and provide higher quality education to children. It makes no sense to bypass the current State leadership and require states to create a new State bureaucracy. 
Another serious problem with this bill is that it brings Federal control into the classroom and dictates how teachers teach reading. This bill specifies only one way to teach reading skills. It ignores the research and recommendations of the leading educators. During the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee hearing on child literacy, we heard from two of the most distinguished researchers--Doctor Catherine Snow of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, who chairs the Committee on the Prevention of Reading Difficulties at the National Academy of Sciences, and Doctor Reid Lyon of the National Institutes of Health. They emphasized that the best way to help all children learn to read is to promote a variety of the best practices and give local educators the freedom to tailor programs to meet local needs. 
Doctor Snow testified that a solution to reading problems has not been achieved because of an: 
Unrealistic desire for a simpler answer. Reading is a complex and multifaceted outcome, determined by many factors. Ensuring adequate reading progress for every child . . . requires providing all of the many, varied experiences that will benefit their reading. 
Doctor Lyon testified that: 
Learning to read requires different skills at different levels of development. . . . It does not have anything to do with philosophy, and it does not have anything to do with politics. It has to do with making sure the kids get the ideas. That is it. . . . To be able to read our language, you have to know the sounds. You have got to know how to map it onto the letters . . . you have got to do it quickly, and you have got to know why you are reading and have good vocabulary and the things that Dr. Snow spoke about. It is never an either/or. 
This bill will prevent teachers from following that sound advice. Instead, teachers will be forced to follow a mandate from Washington requiring all teachers across the country to follow one formula to teach reading--regardless of local needs. Is this what the Republicans mean when they ask for more local control of education? Schools and communities already have control over education. The Federal Government shouldn't start micro-managing their reading programs. 
We should be doing more, not less, to ensure that teachers and school districts are free to design programs to meet the unique local needs of the children. The Reading Excellence Act approved by the Senate Committee by a unanimous, bi-partisan vote would give local educators the flexibility and training the experts say they need. 
This bill doesn't just take control away from public schools. It also takes money away from public schools. We all recognize that recruiting and training more tutors is an important goal. President Clinton began his effort two years ago, with his `America Reads Challenge.' The Senate Committee bill would build on the success of that program, so that local schools will benefit from available community resources. 
The House bill is a detour away from these worthy goals. Instead of helping schools capitalize on volunteer tutors and community resources, it wastes funds on private tutoring programs. It denies support for successful school-based programs in which tutoring assistance is closely linked to a child's classroom instruction. 
The bill also requires local schools to spend time, money, and other scarce resources overseeing private tutoring programs. Funneling scarce public dollars into these private programs will undermine accountability for academic results and expenditure of federal dollars. 
This bill has major flaws. It does little or nothing to help public school children learn to read or improve their chance of receiving a good education. Other provisions in the bill are worthwhile, because they encourage better teaching, more trained volunteer tutors, and more support for community-based family literacy programs. These initiatives will ensure that many children get the extra assistance they need to learn to read well and early. 
These issues are too important for us to leave this House bill as the final word. I will do all I can to pass a strong bipartisan bill in the Senate in the coming months--the nation's children deserve no less.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to support the amendment offered by Senator Murray. This provision would take the long overdue step of repealing the current ban on privately-funded abortions at U.S. military facilities abroad, so that women in the armed forces serving overseas can exercise their constitutionally-guaranteed right and have safe abortion services. 
This is an issue of fundamental fairness for the women who make significant sacrifices to serve the nation. They are assigned to military bases around the world to protect our freedoms, and they serve with great distinction. It's wrong to deny them the kind of medical care available to all women in the United States. They should be able to depend on their base hospitals for all their medical services. 
It is not fair for Congress to force women who serve overseas to face the choice of accepting medical care that may be of lower quality or else returning to the United States and for the care they need. Without good care, abortion can be a life-threatening or permanently disabling procedure. This danger is an unacceptable burden to impose on the nation's servicewomen. 
Congress has a responsibility to provide safe alternatives in these situations. Opponents of this amendment are exposing service women to substantial risks of infection, illness, infertility, and even death. The amendment does not ask that these procedures be paid for with federal funds. It simply asks that the appropriate care be made available. It is the only responsible thing to do. 
In addition to the health risks of the current policy, there is a significant financial penalty on servicewomen and their families who make the difficult conclusion to have an abortion. The cost of returning to the United States from far-off bases in other parts of the world to obtain adequate care can often involve significant financial hardship for young women. This is a cost that servicewomen based in the United States do not have to bear, since non-military hospital facilities are readily available. 
If military personnel cannot afford to return to the United States on their own for an abortion, they will often face significant delays waiting for military transportation. The health risks increase each week, and if the delays in military flights are long, a woman may well decide to rely on questionable medical facilities overseas. As a practical matter, women in uniform are being denied their constitutionally-protected right to choose. A woman's decision on abortion is a very difficult and extremely personal one. It is unfair to impose an even heavier burden on women who serve our country overseas. 
Every woman in America has a constitutionally-guaranteed right to choose to terminate her pregnancy. It is time for Congress to stop denying this right to military women serving abroad. It is time for Congress to stop treating service women as second-class citizens. I urge the Senate to support the Murray amendment and end this flagrant injustice under current law.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 1999. The need for a strong and capable military was clearly demonstrated during the Iraqi crisis over the UN-mandated inspections. Our forward-deployed forces were quickly strengthened by additional personnel as the crisis deepened. The diplomacy of United Nations Secretary General Khofi Annan, backed up by the credible, on-scene forces of the United States Armed Forces, successfully kept the peace. 
This bill provides the proper support for our military forces while maintaining a realistic balance between readiness to take care of immediate needs, and the needed investment to develop and procure new systems for the future. 
The bill provides for those who serve in uniform today, and those who gave this country so much during their careers in military service. A fully funded and well-deserved 3.1% pay raise for military personnel is included in the bill. 
Additionally, the bill includes a provision for the Department of Defense to initiate a comprehensive test plan to evaluate the best way for us to provide health care to retired military personnel and their families who have reached the age of 65. The plan will build on the Medicare test program included in last year's Bipartisan Budget Agreement. The new expanded plan will include test sites for participation in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan, the Department of Defense's Tricare health care program, and a mail order pharmacy program to reduce out-of-pocket costs. 
The daily operations of our military forces have obvious risks and dangers. All branches of the Armed Forces have made progress in improving safety in the military, but more remains to be done. I commend the Department of Defense for its accelerated installation of needed additional safety systems on military aircraft that carry passengers. 
This bill also includes a worthwhile provision to evaluate the way the Pentagon investigates aviation accidents. We must ensure that no stone is left unturned in finding the cause of every accident and taking the necessary corrective action to reduce the risk of future accidents. 
The growing frequency and sophistication of attacks on the Pentagon's computer networks highlight the need for improved protection of critical network infrastructures. This bill includes research and development funding for the exploration and development of defenses against cyber attacks. This step will greatly improve the Pentagon's focus on this growing threat. 
In the past eight years, the Navy-Marine Corps team has responded to over 90 contingencies--almost one per month. As the Ranking Democrat on the Seapower Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, I am pleased that the bill provides the support necessary for our naval forces as they modernize to meet the challenges of tomorrow. 
The bill includes the necessary advance procurement funding for Fiscal Year 1999 for the Navy's next aircraft carrier, CVN-77. The Navy's procurement schedule for the next carrier, revised from its budget submission of last year, will be under the cost cap mandated in last year's defense bill. Also, much of the new technology being developed for the next generation aircraft carrier, the CVX, will be included in CVN-77. 
The budget request for the Navy's F/A-18E/F Super Hornet and the Marine Corps' MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft is fully funded. The Super Hornet combines the outstanding characteristics of earlier F/A-18 models with cutting edge technology in an affordable aircraft with significantly improved performance and endurance. The MV-22 Osprey is a vertical take-off and landing aircraft designed to replace the Marine Corps' aging fleet of CH-46 and CH-53 helicopters. 
In contrast to these aspects of this bill, I do have concerns about reductions in the Administration's budget request for the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, demilitarization of chemical weapons, and the nuclear weapon stockpile stewardship program. I hope that these reductions will be corrected in the final bill. 
The Cooperative Threat Reduction program is the most cost-effective program for reducing the dangers of nuclear weapons. Thousands of nuclear warheads remain in the nations of the former Soviet Union. The Cooperative Threat Reduction program plays a key role in the control and dismantling of these weapons. We must continue this all-important program and ensure that every single nuclear warhead is secure, and eventually destroyed. 
Funding reductions in the chemical weapons de-militarization program will endanger our ability to comply with the provisions of the Chemical Weapons Conventions Treaty approved last year. As a world leader and the only superpower, we have an obligation to lead the worldwide effort to eliminate chemical weapons. I urge the restoration of these funds. 
All of us have grave concerns over the recent nuclear testing in India. Russia and the United States continue to work hard to reduce the world's stockpile of nuclear weapons. India and other nations must also be involved in the reduction and eventual elimination of all nuclear weapons. 
The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is a major milestone on the road to a nuclear free world. A cornerstone of the implementation of this treaty is the Department of Energy's Stockpile Stewardship Program. We must be able to certify that our remaining stockpile of nuclear weapons is reliable, while reducing the number of nuclear weapons through START II and, hopefully, a START III treaty. 
The Stockpile Stewardship Program is the key component in verification of the reliability of our nuclear weapons. The program has experienced a fundamental shift in policy since the United States ceased live testing of nuclear weapons. The Department of Energy is developing new capabilities to complete this certification without live testing of nuclear weapons. The funding cuts in the budget request will hinder these efforts. I urge the restoration of these funds to the Stockpile Stewardship Program. 
In closing, I welcome the opportunity to commend the distinguished services of the members of the Committee, particularly the extraordinary services of the three members who will be leaving the Senate at the end of this Congress. Their efforts have added significantly to this year's Defense Authorization bill. The Airland Subcommittee has benefited from the efforts and insights of Senator Glenn and Senator Coats. Senator Kempthorne's able leadership of the Personnel Subcommittee has ensured that the needs of our service men and women are paramount in this legislation. It has been a privilege to work with these able members of the Committee over the years, and we will miss their leadership in the years ahead.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am strongly opposed to the Byrd amendment which would require that all military services separate men and women during basic training. I am opposed to this amendment for two reasons. 
First, yesterday during the deliberations of the Snowe amendment it was stated that it was premature to make a determination on this issue, that we should let the commission complete its work, that we should wait for the final findings of the commission before taking any action. Nothing has changed. 
We have charged the commission with a task that we seem to have no intention of letting them complete. Only upon careful study of the commission's final report is it prudent to make a judgment that could fundamentally alter the way in which the services conduct basic training. 
Second, the decision on how to train recruits should be made at the individual service level, not by the Congress for every service, as if they all had the same training requirements. To do otherwise is to do a disservice to the men and women in our armed services. Men and women numerous other overseas postings were trained in a gender integrated environment. As a result, they are performing superbly in all aspects of military life, in a gender integrated force. 
The Marines and Army direct ground combat units conduct gender-segregated basic training. For all other non-direct ground combat roles, the services conduct gender integrated training. This is how they will fight. And these decisions were made at the individual service level, as one component of a larger force structure. And the Congress should not now attempt to reverse these decisions. 
Some ask, why should basic training be any different? But basic training is where new recruits learn basic military values. Integrated initial training makes sense. They will train and fight as an integrated force for their entire military careers. There is no reason why they should not begin to do so as early as possible. Doing so increases the readiness of all our military forces. 
The critics of gender integrated training will list recent incidents of sexual harassment as an argument for gender segregation. However, these incidents were largely committed by senior personnel against junior personnel. 
This kind of sexual harassment indicates poor leadership and not a gender integration problem in training. All of the Services acknowledge the importance of improving the quality of recruit training. Commanders and drill instructors will exercise closer supervision over all recruits. That is the best way to eliminate these abuses and ensure the high level of readiness required for our national defense. 
The Senior Noncommissioned Officers in each service say that one training policy, which applies across all services, will have a negative impact on readiness. Then why are we attempting to sacrifice military readiness to gender-segregation? Numerous other military officers and veteran's groups have weighed in on this issue each supporting gender-integration. The senior officer in each service supports gender-integration and moreover, believes that the decision should be properly made at the service level--not in Congress. 
We have come a long way toward full acceptance of women in the military. But more needs to be done to ensure that the progress goes forward in the coming years. Women will not continue to serve in a military which discriminates against them. I look forward to a day when more policies and programs affecting service members are implemented without regard to gender. Women in the military deserve no less. 
I urge you to reject this amendment. 
Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, sixty years ago today, President Roosevelt signed into law an historic piece of legislation. The Fair Labor Standards Act established a number of basic protections for workers, including one of the great landmarks of American law--the federal minimum wage. 
President Roosevelt called that Act `the most far-reaching, far-sighted program for the benefit of workers ever adopted here or in any other country.' 
And he was right. 700,000 workers got a raise in 1938. The minimum wage helped pull the country out of the Great Depression. And, in the decades that followed, it helped to lift millions of working families out of poverty. 
Our standard of living has improved steadily and dramatically since 1938. And, for thirty years, the minimum wage kept pace with those improvements. 
But the last thirty years have seen an about-face. The real value of the minimum wage has dropped steeply since 1968. To have the purchasing power today that it had thirty years age, the minimum wage would have to be $7.38 and hour--40% higher than its current level of $5.15. 
Working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, minimum wage workers today earn just $10,700 a year--$2,900 below the poverty level for a family of three. In the midst of what many experts are calling `the best economy ever,' 12 million Americans are earning poverty-level wages. 
For them survival is the daily goal. If they work hard enough and their hours are long enough, they can make ends meet--but only barely. They don't have time for their families. They can't participate in activities with their children. They can't afford to buy birthday presents or do the countless other things that most of us take for granted. 
We know who minimum wage workers are. They are teachers' aides and home health aides. They care for our children in child care centers and our parents and grandparents in nursing homes. They sell us goods at the corner store, and serve us coffee at the local coffee shop. 
They clean office buildings in communities across the country. 
They are workers like Valerie Bell, a custodian for a contractor in Baltimore, who told us what a higher minimum wage means in human terms. For workers and their families, it means far more than dollars and cents. It means dignity. As she said, `We no longer have to receive food stamps or other social services to supplement our incomes. We can fix up our homes and invest in our neighborhoods. We can spend more at the local grocery store. 
We can work two low-wage jobs, rather than three low-wage jobs, and spend more time with our families. Our utilities won't be cut off. We can pay the medical bills we accumulated from not having health benefits in our jobs.' 
That's why we say now is the time to raise the minimum wage. Our proposal will raise the minimum wage by 50 cents on January 1, 1999 and 50 cents more on January 1, 2000--bringing the minimum wage to $6.15 an hour at the turn of the century. Twelve million working families across the country deserve no less. 
Our Republican friends just cut capital gains taxes for the wealthiest Americans by more than $300 million over the next five years. Yet they oppose giving minimum wage workers an additional $1 an hour. `Let them eat cake,' they say. 
Plums for the rich and crumbs for everyone else is the wrong priority. We need to do more for hard-working families in communities across America, and we can do more. We can raise the minimum wage. And with the strong support of President Clinton and Democrats in the Senate and House, we will raise it. 
I intend to offer the minimum wage on the first available legislation after the July 4th recess. No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was greatly saddened to learn of the death today of Paul O'Dwyer of New York City. To all of us who knew him and worked with him and loved him, he was a great friend, a great champion of democracy and civil rights, a great friend of working families, and a great friend of Ireland. He will be dearly missed. 
Paul was born in County Mayo in Ireland, and immigrated to the United States in 1924 at the age of seventeen. He put himself through law school at night, and formed his lifelong commitment to the political and social causes which were so important to him and for which we all admired him. 
He was a proud supporter of Ireland all his life. He was a hero to the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and to Irish Americans as well. At the same time, he recognized the importance of reaching out to the Protestant community in Northern Ireland to achieve peace and reconciliation in that troubled land, and he always insisted on meeting with Protestant leaders visiting this country. 
Paul was elected to a number of offices in his long and brilliant career, including President of the New York City Council. Once, when asked about his decision to come to America as an immigrant, Paul said `I thought of going back, but something that grips you as an immigrant is the sense of freedom here.' As few individuals have ever done, he worked hard and long and well to provide that freedom for all Americans. We will miss his leadership, and we will miss his friendship.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to ask my colleague from Wyoming to help me clarify the intent of H.R. 2877 as it relates to evaluating the performance of employees. Several States with OSHA-approved State plans have expressed concern that the language regarding `the results of enforcement activities' could prevent them from considering the quality of an enforcement officer's reports or recommendations; the percentage of cases which are upheld or overturned in legal proceedings; the timeliness of case completion; the comprehensiveness of evaluations; and other legitimate means of evaluating employee performance. 
Contrary to this very broad interpretation, it is important to point out that the authors of the bill read much more narrowly the language prohibiting OSHA from evaluating employees based on `the results of enforcement activities, such as the number of citations issued or penalties assessed.' When H.R. 2877 was originally introduced, it prohibited the Secretary of labor from establishing `any performance measures for any subordinate' within OSHA `with respect to the number of inspections conducted, citations issued, or penalties assessed.' After the administration expressed concerns that the language could adversely impact the ability of OSHA supervisors to assign inspection work and ensure employee productivity and accountability, new language was negotiated. The intent of that language, which is contained in the version of H.R. 2877 that we are about to pass, was intended to prevent OSHA from establishing any quota or goal requiring OSHA inspectors to assess a specific number or amount of penalties. Clearly, Congress would not want to prevent OSHA from ensuring that the penalties actually assessed by its inspectors are legally valid, based on true and accurate information, and issued in a timely, professional manner. 
Does the Senator agree with me that the `results' referred to in the legislation refer to whether an OSHA inspector is evaluated on a specific quota or goal regarding the number of citations issued or penalties assessed, rather than the other means I have outlined?

First, assume an OSHA inspector uses falsified inspection results to justify and recommend the issuance of citations and penalties against one or more employers. Does the language in H.R. 2877 allow OSHA to negatively evaluate the inspector and proceed to dismiss him or her?

Mr. KENNEDY. What about an inspector who, in the course of a year, conducts one tenth of the inspections conducted by the average inspector? The inspector finds no violations in any of the inspections he or she conducts, leading the inspector's supervisor to suspect that the inspector may be failing to identify serious hazards in at least some of those workplaces. Does H.R. 2877 allow OSHA to examine these circumstances to ascertain whether the employee is adequately performing his or her duties?

Mr. KENNEDY. If an inspector's citations and penalties are consistently being overturned in legal proceedings, would H.R. 2877 inhibit OSHA's ability to use that experience to evaluate how well that employee is doing his or her job?

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in just a few moments we will be voting on the Coverdell conference report. The President of the United States has indicated that he will veto this measure, and he is entirely wise to do so and to call on us, the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States, to act on the sound recommendations that he has made to improve public schools. But these recommendations are not just ones from the President of the United States, but from educators across the country. They have said that these recommendations outlined by the Senator from California are absolutely essential if we are going to strengthen academic achievement and accomplishment for the young people of this country. 
Now, you cannot isolate what we are doing here on the floor of the U.S. Senate this morning from what our Republican friends did yesterday in the House of Representatives on education. You can't just separate these. We have the House and the Senate, combined; we are dealing with education policy and we are together addressing the issue of education in our society. 
Now, today we are discussing legislation will spend $1.6 billion over a 10-year period to help private schools. We have gone through repeatedly, and the Joint Tax Committee has pointed out, that 7 percent of the American families send their children to private schools, and 93 percent send their children to the public schools. The benefit of this program will go where? It will go primarily to the private schools. 
Now, let us look at what happened yesterday in the House Appropriations subcommittee on education matters. While we are being asked here to demonstrate our great interest in the cause of improving education for the nation's young people today, yesterday in the House of Representatives, Republicans zeroed out the summer jobs program for youth across this country--zeroed it out; $871 million, gone. Find me an educator in this country who does not believe that funding those summer jobs is light-years more important than the Coverdell program that is about a potential savings that will go primarily to private schools. Find me a single educator who says knock out the summer jobs program. But that is what our Republican friends did just yesterday, just yesterday, in the House of Representatives. They will deny 530,000 teenagers the opportunity to gain valuable work experience during the summer months. 
What else did they do? Did we not hear last night and this morning about the importance of helping American students learn math and science? What did Republicans do yesterday? They cut back significantly the Eisenhower Math and Science Program. What does that program do? It upgrades the skills of math and science teachers. Upgrading the skills of teachers in the public schools is one of the most important investments we can make to improve student learning. What did the Republicans do? Slashed the program, the tried and true Eisenhower program, named after an important President of this country. 
What else did they do? They cut the title I program by $400 million below the President's level. By not investing in Title I, the Republicans are denying help for those needy children who are having difficulty in school and are falling behind. It is an enormously successful program. While we are over here on the U.S. Senate floor, saying how we are going to have a breakthrough new program that is going to provide these brilliant new ideas in education, Republicans in the House are cutting back on the title I program that has been a mainstay for needy children in this country, which has had bipartisan support, 
and they didn't stop there, Mr. President. They cut $137 million from the President's request for educational technology programs to try to help the public schools that are crying out for computers and computer training. There are few high schools in this country that are up to speed and on the Information Super Highway. And by denying extra support for training teachers so they can use those computers and tie them into the curriculum, we are saying to the young people that preparing for the modern workplace is not important 
Mr. President, in these programs alone, Republicans slashed $1.8 billion yesterday of investment on tested, worthwhile programs. And Republicans today in the U.S. Senate are saying, `We are doing the most revolutionary thing that we can for our public school students. We are going to provide $160 million a year in tax breaks for families.' Which families? The Joint Tax Committee says it is families who are sending their kids to private schools. Mr. President, if the President is ever-wise and ever-conscious about the importance of vetoing a piece of legislation, this is it. 
I was here last night and I listened to Senators that rose in support of the Coverdell legislation and talked about the great study that was done under the Reagan administration in 1983 called, `A Nation At Risk,' In listening to our colleagues who are supporting this legislation talk about `A Nation At Risk,' I wondered what the Nation At Risk report recommended? The fact is that the Nation At Risk commission recommended raising standards for student performance, devoting more time to learning, improving the quality of teachers, holding educators and elected officials responsible for providing leadership necessary to implement these reforms, and strengthening graduation requirements. 
Under the leadership of President Clinton in 1994, we took those recommendations and made them central to the hallmark Goals 2000 legislation. Under Goals 2000, over 90 percent of the funds go to the local community to implement standards-based reforms. What happened yesterday in the House of Representatives Appropriations Committee? They gutted the Goals 2000 program that is helping local schools implement the recommendations of `A Nation at Risk,' that our colleagues have hailed as a call to action in education. 
What hypocrisy, Mr. President. Over here, we are talking about how we are going to save our public school children, and over in the House of Representatives, the Education Appropriations Committee is gutting the essential programs that make a difference for schoolchildren. 
Mr. President, we ought to see the Coverdell bill go to the President of the United States as rapidly as possible. He ought to veto it as fast as he can. He ought to go to the American people and say, if you are really interested and concerned about education, let us go ahead in a bipartisan way and strengthen public schools. Let's not just reject out of hand, as our Republican colleagues have done, every one of the recommendations of the President. One of the most important recommendations the President has championed came from the Senator from Illinois, Carol Moseley-Braun, who understands the importance of having school facilities and buildings that are going to be worthy of teaching our children in. 
Senator Moseley-Braun is here on the floor at the present time. She can speak to this issue. When we send our children to dilapidated schools, we are sending them a very important message: Education doesn't really count. We're saying that we don't really care if young people go to dilapidated schools because we grownups are not prepared to put the resources toward modernizing school facilities. 
So, Mr. President, this is an absolute sham. The Coverdell bill is an absolute sham. People cannot in this body, given what has happened in the House of Representatives yesterday, stand up and say that this bill will really help solve our education problems and strengthen our public schools.

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 15 seconds more. They might have some credibility if they stood up and said we deplore that the President's proposals have been rejected, but we also want to fight for this one and we will fight to restore those funds. But there has been absolute silence on that. 
Mr. President, I think this measure should be defeated. We don't have the votes to defeat it, but I certainly hope we try. Our goal should be to strengthen public schools, not abandon them. 
I yield whatever time we have to the Senator from Illinois.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the most important issues involving training in the military is the issue of gender integrated training. 
Women have been serving with distinction in our military forces for decades, but their opportunities have grown immensely in the past decade. Unfortunately, the recent sexual harassment scandals in the military have been used by some to oppose the integrated training of men and women in the military and to urge a return to separate training. This approach would be a serious mistake. 
In light of the expanded roles for women in the military it makes sense to continue to integrate all aspects of training except for direct combat training. The Services often cite `train as you fight' as one of their guidelines in preparation for war. Each service trains as it will fight. The Marines and Army direct ground combat units conduct gender segregated basic training. For all other non-direct ground combat roles, the services conduct gender integrated training. This is how they will fight. 
Some ask, why should basic training be any different? But basic training is where new recruits learn basic military values. Integrated initial training makes sense. They will train and fight as an integrated force for their entire military careers. There is no reason why they should not begin to do so as early as possible. Doing so increases the readiness of all our military forces. 
Opponents also argue for separate barracks for men and women during training. But, as anyone who has served in the military knows, military training does not end on the drill field or in the classroom. A great deal of unit cohesion is built during time spent in the barracks studying or preparing for the next day's training. Separate barracks would further complicate the commanders' task and make it more difficult to exercise the leadership that guarantees the readiness of the military unit. 
The barracks now used in basic training by the services all have independent sleeping areas and restrooms for men and women. Each of these areas has separate entrances. There are alarms on doors and walls around living areas, which are locked at night. Moreover, there is around-the-clock supervision by the chain of command. There is no doubt that we have safe and secure barracks. Wasting over $150 million in new construction for separate barracks that are not needed and are no more secure makes no sense. 
The critics of gender integrated training cite recent cases of sexual harassment as a demonstration of the need to segregate men and women during basic training. But almost none of the instances of sexual harassment or sexual misconduct were committed by recruits on recruits, but by drill instructors on recruits. 
That kind of sexual harassment indicates poor leadership, not a gender integration problem in training. All of the Services acknowledge the importance of improving the quality of recruit training. Commanders and drill instructors will exercise closer supervision over all recruits. That is the best way to eliminate these abuses and ensure the high level of readiness required for our national defense. 
We have come a long way toward full acceptance of women in the military. But more needs to be done to ensure that the progress goes forward in the coming years. Women will not continue to serve in a military which discriminates against them. I look forward to a day when more policies and programs affecting service members are implemented without regard to gender. Women in the military deserve no less.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I share the growing concern over the continuing high levels of tactical nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both Russia and the United States. 
We have made substantial progress in reducing the levels of strategic nuclear weapons which threaten world peace and security. This progress has been made through the cooperation and efforts of both our countries and I commend the Reagan, Bush and Clinton Administrations for their efforts. 
We have reduced the number of strategic missiles on each side. We have inventoried and controlled dangerous nuclear materials to prevent their theft. We have improved the safety and security of strategic nuclear weapons world-wide. 
But, during this time, we have left another dangerous threat untouched--the tactical nuclear weapons built and deployed for battlefield use. These dangerous weapons have received far too little attention in our arms control efforts. 
Although they are smaller than strategic nuclear weapons, tactical nuclear weapons are still a massive threat. In the wrong hands, in a terrorist or military attack, these weapons are almost as dangerous as strategic weapons. The potential armed conflicts facing the world today would be far more threatening if tactical nuclear weapons become an option for any side. The effect on stability and our own security could well be catastrophic. 
We must take every reasonable measure to ensure that such weapons are never used--not in any armed conflict, not in a terrorist attack, never. 
The goal of the Conrad amendment is to reduce, and eventually eliminate, the world's stockpile of tactical nuclear weapons. We must inventory the number and types of these weapons currently held in stockpiles, assess them, and work together to eliminate them. 
It is not too much to ask that we pursue two tracks in the effort to deal with the nuclear threat left by the legacy of the Cold War. Reducing and eliminating both strategic and tactical nuclear weapons is the right course for the United States and Russia, and the only one that will ensure our future security.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the Senator from Georgia in bringing the legislation to where it is at the present time out of the conference. I admire his persistence, but I believe he is fundamentally wrong in his approach to education. 
I want to just mention very briefly, when I arrived over here, the good Senator was talking about the Nation At Risk report. I was in the Senate when the Nation At Risk study was done. We had very extensive hearings on it. The Nation At Risk was primarily a report done by a superb group of education leaders. While I was listening to my friend from Georgia, I was harkening back to the various recommendations of those who had done that extensive study to which the Senator referred. 
The fact of the matter is, the Nation at Risk report authored by a bipartisan commission, made recommendations that mirror the recommendations that were made by the President of the United States this year. With all respect to the Senator from Georgia, there is no reference in there about the tax breaks and voucher programs that he has described. What was recommended in the report is the hard work that has been recommended by, not only the Nation At Risk panel, but most of the educators since that time. 
What we need is more and better teachers. This is very important, particularly given the fact we are going to need some 2 million more teachers over the period of the next 10 years. The Nation At Risk commission thought that upgrading the skills of teachers is one of the most important things we can do. They also said that raising standards for children so they will be challenged to meet their highest educational ability, instead of dumbing down the curriculum to the lowest expectations. 
The Nation At Risk report recommended that we devote more time for learning. That means afterschool programs and extended day programs. And we know that spending more time on learning works. In my own State of Massachusetts, the Timility Middle School in Roxbury, MA, was long known for its low test scores and high suspension rates for students. Under Project Promise, the school extended learning time by 90 minutes 4 days a week and opened for 3 hours on Saturday. The result is more students receive the help they need, parents are more involved, student attendance is up, student absence is down, reading and math scores have improved--by investing in public schools, not abandoning them. 
In addition, there is general recognition that you cannot teach children in antiquated schools or schools that are falling apart--yet so many of the nation's schools are. In fact, the GAO found that over $100 billion is needed for help and assistance to rebuild and modernize our schools in our cities, suburbs, and rural communities. 
But the Coverdell bill will spend $1.6 billion over 10 years. Is that going to solve all of the problems that have been outlined by my friend from Georgia? That is quite a stretch, particularly because it doesn't help the public schools. 
The Coverdell bill is not trying to give support for these kinds of initiatives that are facing communities across this country, with many of these children who are sons and daughters of working families who do not have the ability and resources to be able to put aside the money that would be necessary in this program. 
In Waltham, MA, 215 math teachers are learning innovative techniques in teacher training programs. They are working with bankers, engineers, high-tech experts, and college math professors to learn more about math, how to teach it well, and how to link it to the real-world experience of the students. 
The early indications are that when these teachers go back to their schools, they are seeing improved academic achievement from the students. But under the Coverdell bill, we won't get any kind of help and assistance for these kinds of innovative programs that are taking place. This legislation does nothing to support innovative programs like these. It does nothing to strengthen public schools. Instead, it uses a regressive tax policy to subsidize vouchers for private schools and gives no significant financial help to working families and no help to children in the Nation's classrooms. What it does is provide an unjustified tax giveaway to the wealthy and to private schools. 
Public education is one of the great success stories of American democracy. It makes no sense for Congress to undermine it. Yet this bill turns its back on the Nation's longstanding support for public schools and earmarks tax dollars for private schools. It is an unwarranted step in the wrong direction for education, for public schools, and for the Nation's children. It would spend the $1.6 billion over the next 10 years on subsidies to help the wealthy pay the private school expenses they already pay and do nothing to help the children in the public schools get a 
better education. 
It is important to continue the national investment in children and their future. We should invest more in improving public schools by repairing crumbling facilities, by recruiting more and training better teachers, by reducing class size, by developing responsible afterschool activities, and by taking many other steps. 
If we add $1.6 billion to spend on elementary and secondary education, we should spend it wisely on these problems, not waste it on bad education policy and bad tax policy. We should rebuild our public schools, not build new tax shelters for the wealthy. 
According to the Joint Tax Committee, over half of the benefits--$800 million--will go to 7 percent of the families with children in private schools. Did you note when my friend from Georgia was here he said: 70 percent of the families that can use this tax break will be making under $70,000. But let's find out where the money is going, Senator. We are not just talking about who may be able to use the program. Let's look at what the Joint Tax Committee says. Let's read the next line. Let's ask where the money is going, not who `may benefit.' I heard that out here four or five times in the last hour, look who is going to benefit, all of these families below $70,000--`may benefit.' May benefit. The fact is, the Joint Tax Committee has indicated that $800 million, half of all the money, will go to the 7 percent of families whose children are already in private schools. 
If you are going to fight for a particular program, at least have the intellectual honesty to state what it is going to do and try to defend it. I can understand why those who support this program run from all the details, try to really say it's doing something that it does not do. With all respect, when I listen to those who have been supporting the program, I have to wonder how this program is going to solve the education problems for the young people? Proponents use the National at Risk as a starting point, but they, again, don't tell you the next line. The Nation at Risk gave recommendations on how to improve education, but they are not the ones included in the Coverdell bill. Here it is. The Joint Tax Committee: 93 percent of the children in the country go to the public schools; 7 percent go to private schools; and 48 percent of the monetary benefit that will come from here will go to the public schools; but 52 percent--more than half--will go to the 7 percent of the children who go to the private schools. 
You can say 70 percent of the families that are eligible for this tax break go to the public schools. But that's not where the money goes. And we all know that where the money goes is what counts around here. The money goes to families who already send their children to private school. We believe that we should not abandon the public schools. We ought to commit ourselves to helping and assisting the public schools and the children who attend them. 
The bottom line is clear. The scarce tax dollars should be targeted to public schools. They don't have the luxury of closing their doors to students who pose special challenges, such as children with disabilities, limited English-proficient children, or homeless students. This bill will not help children who need help the most. 
Parental choice is a mirage. Private schools apply different rules from public schools. Public schools must accept all children. Private schools can decide whether to accept a child or not. The real choice belongs to schools, not to the parents. It belongs to schools, not to the parents. Public schools must accept all children and develop programs to meet their needs. Private schools only accept children who fit the guidelines of their existing policy. So, if we are talking about public funds that are contributed from working families, we ought to be using those funds where the children of those working families go to school. 
And that means supporting the public schools. But the majority of the money goes to the seven percent of families sending their children to private schools. 
We have a series of recommendations that have been made by the top education community in this country. They are common-sense recommendations: Smaller classrooms, modernizing schools, upgrading teacher training, and expanding afterschool programs. These have all been outlined here, and they were all rejected on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Then we are asked to accept this bill to support private schools or nothing. We are asked to accept this or nothing. 
We even had a modest rehabilitation program by our friend and colleague, the Senator from Florida, Senator Graham, that was dropped in the conference, to try to increase assistance for school construction. 
Another program that the President talked about is the Educational Opportunity Zones to provide support to those school districts that are willing to invest in major restructuring, reorganization, and innovation in order to improve student academic achievement. The program provides some incentives for those exciting programs. 
You can say, what is an example where that program would work? Chicago is the example for that. Chicago is really doing a very important and effective job to try to give some help and assistance to its schools and to its parents and teachers who are trying to do the job of educating children, to do it right. We recognize that there are many communities that are trying to improve their schools, and we should support them. 
I am proud of what the city of Boston is doing, Mr. President. We saw just yesterday the Boston Globe was reporting on the most recent math and reading tests in that city and how, for the first time in many years, there was increased performance of students across the board in reading and math, and in some of the most difficult schools with high suspension rates, dropouts rates--the most troubled schools--how they have been able to see a significant improvement in academic achievement and accomplishment. 
That is happening in the public schools among some very needy children in a major city. Why? Because we have had a superintendent and a mayor who are committed to providing resources and discipline to enhance the education of the public schools--not abandon them. 
We have nothing against the private schools. There are many wonderful private schools. But we are talking about, in a budget with scarce resources, funds paid in by working families through their taxes. And, in the consideration of the budget, after the President's programs--smaller class size, upgrading the skills for teachers, modernizing our schools, expanding afterschool programs--have been defeated, we are forced to consider this program that does what? Benefits the private schools--benefits the private schools. 
So, Mr. President, this proposal does not deserve to go into law. The President is right to veto this proposal. He is right to send it back to the Congress and say, `Start over again. Start over again.' We have time to do that. We have been fussing around here for 4 weeks debating the tobacco bill and then find that the point of order was made on it. It could have been made 4 weeks earlier in order to dismiss that as a result of big tobacco. 
We are not debating the education priorities of the American people. We are not debating the health care priorities of the American people, such as the Patients' Bill of Rights. People in this country want to see the reform of our health care system to eliminate the abuses of HMOs. Managed care too often means mismanaged care. The American people want these decisions made, that are affecting their health, by doctors and not insurance company accountants. We ought to be debating that. But we cannot debate that. It is nowhere on the Republican leader's schedule. 
And we ought to start over here, after the President's veto, and debate, what we can do as a legislative body, with scarce 
resources, that will make the best, most effective impact on improving the quality of education and achievement and accomplishment for the 90 percent of children in the public schools? Public money for public schools--that is the central challenge. And this particular measure fails on all accounts. 
So I hope, Mr. President, that we can get about the business in the remaining days of this Congress and support what we know is being done in rural, urban, and suburban communities, with scarce resources, by creative, dedicated people who are absolutely committed to their children in those communities, who are working tirelessly, exhaustively, to raise academic achievement and improve public schools. 
Do we have a ways to go? Yes. Will $1.6 billion solve the whole problem? No, and we should invest more--much more--in improving our public schools. But the question for us today is, Is this the best way to spend $1.6 billion of the American taxpayers' dollars to improve public schools? The answer is no. And for that reason, I believe that this measure should not win the support of the Members of this body. 
Mr. President, I know we are under a time fix. Whatever time remains on our side I yield to the good Senator from Minnesota.  
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I strongly support Susan Oki Mollway's nomination to the federal district court in Hawaii. Her nomination has now been pending before the Senate for two-and-a-half years. It is long past time to confirm this able nominee. 
Ms. Mollway's credentials are impressive. She is a Harvard Law School Graduate and a partner at a prestigious Hawaii law firm, where her practice has included complex civil litigation. In 1987, she was voted Outstanding Woman Lawyer by the Hawaii Women Lawyers. She successfully argued a case before the Supreme Court of the United States in 1994. 
Ms. Mollway has the support of every member of Hawaii's congressional delegation, and the federal judges in Hawaii hold her in the highest regard. She would be the first Asian-American woman to sit on the federal bench. 
Some of our colleagues opppose this nomination because Ms. Mollway served on the Board of Directors of the ACLU in Hawaii, at a time when the ACLU was active in the same-sex marriage debate in that state. In fact, much of the ACLU's involvement in that debate took place long before Ms. Mollway became a member of the Board of Directors. In addition, Ms. Mollway has emphatically stated that she never voted on the position the ACLU should take on this issue or on any other litigation or legislation. The opposition to her nomination is unjustified, and it is no basis for denying confirmation. 
Unfortunately, Ms. Mollway is just one of the many well-qualified women and minority nominees who have been arbitrarily delayed by the Senate and subjected to unfair ideological hazing. 
In fact, in this Republican Senate, women are four times more likely than men to be held up for more than a year. Forty-three percent of the nominees currently on the Senate calendar are women. In the last three months, the Senate Republican leadership has allowed only one woman to be confirmed to the federal bench, while confirming 15 men. And, 16 out of 21 --that's 76 percent--of the nominees carried over from last year's session are women or minorities. 
I urge my colleagues to support Ms. Mollway's nomination. It is time to end the logjam of qualified women and minority nominees. It is time to provide relief to the federal district court in Hawaii, whose caseload has doubled in the last five years. It is long past time to confirm Susan Oki Mollway. Her qualifications are outstanding and I am confident that she will serve with great distinction on that court. Frankly, the Senate should confirm her--and apologize to her as well.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I hope very much that in the coming days, we will be able to begin debate in the full Senate on another major issue of vital importance to the country--the reforms needed in our health care system to end the abuses by HMOs and health insurance companies. Critical decisions on health care should be made by doctors and their patients, not by insurance industry accountants. It is long past time for Congress to act to protect patients and end these abuses. We face a growing crisis of confidence in health care. 
A recent survey found that an astonishing 80 percent of Americans now believe that their quality of care is often compromised by their insurance plan to save money. And, too often, they are absolutely right. 
One reason for this concern is the explosive growth in managed care. In 1987, only 13 percent of privately insured Americans were enrolled in HMOs. Today 75 percent are in some form of managed care. 
This issue goes to the heart of health care and the fundamental doctor-patient relationship. At its best, managed care offers the opportunity to achieve greater efficiency and greater quality in health care. 
In too many cases, however, the priority has become greater profits, not greater health. HMOs and conventional insurance companies alike have abused the system by denying coverage for treatments that their customers need and that their premiums should have guaranteed. 
In California, a Kaiser Foundation study found that almost half of all patients reported a problem with their health plan. Substantial numbers reported that the plan's actions caused unnecessary pain and suffering, delayed recovery, or even resulted in permanent disabilities. 
Projected to the national level, these results indicate that 30 million Americans develop additional health problems because of their plan's abusive practices--and a shocking 11 million develop permanent disabilities. 
The dishonor roll of those victimized by insurance company abuse grows every day. A baby loses his hands and feet because his parents believe they have to take him to a distant emergency room rather than the one close to their home.

Mr. KENNEDY. So you can't offer anything to do with the health care of the American people prior to this, or after this, or after the Republican leader puts this proposal back on the calendar to shelve it. In other words, the Republican leadership says to the Senate of the United States: You can't deal with anything affecting the health care of the American people for the rest of this Congress. 
Come on, Mr. President. Come on, Mr. President. 
This is just the day after the Republican leadership tried to sink the tobacco bill. Now they are out there trying to deny us the opportunity to debate one of the most important health care bills that is before the American people. 
Mr. President, it is just unbelievable to me to think that the majority leader's proposal was going to be considered in good faith by our Democratic leader, or by any Member--not just leadership--by any Member. We are all equals in this body. 
Those who are interested in health care ought to be concerned when a proposal is put forward to muzzle the U.S. Senate on health care. What does the Republican leadership fear? What do they fear about a full and open debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights? What do they fear in a debate about trying to give an opportunity for the Senate to express itself to permit our uninsured citizens between the ages of 55 and 64 to be able to buy into the Medicare system? What do they fear about having an open and full debate on that issue, if the individuals are going to pay full premiums? What do they have to fear about the possibility of requiring that companies of 50 or more employees have some requirement to provide health care for their employees? Can't we have a debate on that issue? Can't we have a rollcall on that issue? 
Some will agree. Some will differ. Let the American people make a judgment about how their representatives stand. No, no, not if the majority leader, on behalf of the Republicans, have their way. 
This proposal says `not be in order to offer any legislation, motion, or amendment relative to health care prior to the initiation of the agreement,' which is sometime just before the August recess, for the next several weeks, and for the rest of this session following completion of this proposed agreement. If we were to proceed with it, we would be absolutely curtailed from any kind of effort to try to address health care for the American people. 
This could even preclude further consideration of tobacco legislation, or proposals to extend health insurance to uninsured Americans between the ages of 55 and 64, or improvements in Medicare package for senior citizens, or appropriations for the National Institutes of Health and other health programs, or legislation on the privacy of medical records--the list goes on and on. 
Many of us believe that as we move on into the millennium, it is going to be the millennium of the life sciences with extraordinary scientific breakthroughs. And the Republican leader wants to silence us from having some opportunity to debate that priority? 
Mr. President, it prohibits consideration of any legislation dealing with the problems of the privacy of our medical records, and the dangers that exist in terms of the proliferation of medical records. There are enormously important issues relating to the privacy of medical records that Republicans and Democrats have tried to address. But we are foreclosed from any opportunity to consider that under this proposal. 
Mr. President, it often takes, as we all know, many votes to pass legislation important to American families. Rarely can we do so on the first attempt. These arbitrary, unfair restrictions serve only to strengthen the power of the special interests. We have heard where those special interests are. We understand what they are doing at the present time--raising millions of dollars, and going on with these distortions and misrepresentations. 
The networks were hardly quiet after the tobacco industry was able to disrupt the kind of successful conclusion of legislation here in the U.S. Senate that would protect our children. The airwaves are polluted again with distortions and millions of dollars in trying to do a similar job on the Patients' Bill of Rights. They are not going to succeed in either one, Mr. President. 
It is said that you can fool some of the people all of the time, all of the people some of the time, but not all of the people all of the time. 
This unanimous consent request isn't going to fool any of the people any of the time. The American people want patient protections. They deserve them and know parliamentary maneuvers. No public relations campaign is going to allow the Republican leadership to avoid responsibility if this Congress does not pass strong HMO reform legislation this year.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have just seen an opportunity for the Senate to address the issue of public health for the children of this country once again, with the introduction of the legislation by Senator Daschle. 
This is going to be the first of many attempts to try to ensure that the Senate is going to take action to try to protect the young people of this country. That is what this issue is all about. What we have just seen as a result of the vote is that the Republican Party is stonewalling action here in the U.S. Senate and, evidently, still kowtowing to the power of big tobacco and their campaign contributions. 
We are not going to be silent on this issue, and we are going to continue to raise it. We believe that it is the most important public health issue, certainly for the children of this Nation, and it is an issue that is not going to go away. 
So maybe today there is one more opportunity, by a narrow margin, to defeat those forces and for a reasonable and responsible approach on this issue. This issue is not going to go away. Our Republican friends had better get used to addressing it because they are going to have the opportunity to do it many more times until we get responsible action here, where the Senate is responding to the people's needs, the families' needs, not the interest of big tobacco. 
This amendment by Senator Daschle would have given the Senate a second chance--an opportunity to reconsider its ill advised action of last night. A minority of Republicans used a transparent parliamentary ploy to frustrate the will of a majority of the Senate. The two votes last night proved that a bipartisan majority of the Senate supports tough antismoking legislation. It also proved that an obstructionist group of Republicans will stop at nothing to prevent fair consideration of the McCain bill. Those Republicans put the interest of the tobacco industry above the health of America's children. For the last four weeks, they have parroted the messages being broadcast in cigarette company advertisements. Last night, they gave their votes as well as their voices to Big Tobacco. 
This issue will not go away. It will haunt the Republicans until they allow the bipartisan majority which exists to pass strong antismoking legislation to do so. Just as the Democratic leader brought the issue back to the floor today, we will bring it back again and again. This willful band of Republican obstructionists may have killed a bill last night and blocked consideration of the Daschle amendment today, but they cannot kill an idea whose time has come. Make no mistake, the time has come to protect our children from the evil influence of the tobacco industry. 
The times has come to stop 3,000 children a day from beginning to smoke. 
The time has come to save those children from a lifetime of addiction and premature death caused by smoking-induced illness. 
The time has come to raise the price of cigarettes so they will not be easily affordable to children. 
The time has come to stop the tobacco industry's targeting of children with billions of dollars of seductive and misleading advertising. 
The time has come to protect millions of nonsmokers from the health hazards of secondhand smoke. 
The time has come to prevent the 400,000 deaths caused each year by tobacco use. 
No power on Earth--not even the Republican leadership of the Senate--can stop an idea whose time has come. The time has come for the Senate to reject the perverse influence of Big Tobacco, and to do what is right for America's children.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Jeffords/Roth Amendment to the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, which will substantially increase funding for renewable energy programs. 
The Jeffords/Roth amendment is critical to an industry that will be at the forefront of energy production in the next century. Renewable energy will bring major economic benefits and major environmental benefits to the nation. This amendment provides us with the opportunity to become leaders in this booming global market. 
At the same time, increased renewable energy technology will decrease our dependence on foreign oil and reduce the trade deficit. We will have greater protection from harmful oil price shocks. Funding for renewable energy now will clearly strengthen our competitiveness in the worldwide energy market for the 21st century. 
Equally important, the Jeffords/Roth amendment reaffirms the nation's commitment to the environment. Renewable energy enables us to reduce the emissions from other energy sources that are polluting our air and water. It helps to curb the largest current source of pollution in the United States--energy production and energy use. Bringing innovative research from the laboratory to the market will also ensure the protection of our limited natural resources for a sustainable future. 
Currently, millions of Americans already obtain electricity from renewable energy sources. These advances are just a hint of the possibilities of cleaner, safer energy production in the years ahead. This amendment allows the U.S. to maintain its leading role in global clean energy technology. I support this amendment, and I commend Senators Jeffords and Roth for their leadership in protecting our environment and our economy.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Domenici, Senator Kerry, and Senator Bingaman in introducing the `The Program for Investment in Micro-Entrepreneurs' Act--the PRIME Act. This legislation will encourage investment in micro-entrepreneurs by supporting the kinds of education and training needed to help build new small businesses. 
Today, the nation's entrepreneurial spirit is thriving, fueled by the extraordinary economic growth and prosperity we currently enjoy. But new entrepreneurs still face challenges that limit their ability to turn innovative ideas into successful businesses and create new jobs. They deserve assistance in learning the basics to take their ideas to the next level--starting their own firms. 
The `PRIME' Act is designed to help small entrepreneurs bridge the gap between worthwhile ideas and successful businesses. It will offer $105 million over the next five years to build business skills in key areas such as record-keeping, planning, management, marketing and computer technology. 
The Clinton Administration strongly supports these initiatives. The Treasury Department's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund has become a lead agency for micro-enterprise activities across the country, and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is one of their strongest advocates. 
The PRIME Act will enhance all of these efforts. It will provide grants for micro-enterprise organizations across the country to assist disadvantaged and low-income entrepreneurs and provide them with essential training and education. 
It will encourage the development of new micro-enterprise organizations, and expand existing ones to reach more micro-entrepreneurs. 
It will sponsor research on the most innovative and successful ways of encouraging these new businesses and enabling them to succeed. 
Under the Act, grants will be available each year to organizations that work with entrepreneurs. Local groups will leverage these funds with private and local resources to increase the impact of the federal seed money. 
Massachusetts and New Mexico are leaders in this effort. The business community and local banks have made a significant investment in creating loan capital for micro-entrepreneurs to start their businesses. 
By investing in micro-entrepreneurs, we will be harnessing the spirit and ideas of large numbers of Americans and creating new opportunities for self-sufficiency. We will be encouraging new small businesses that will strengthen the local economy in communities across the country. And that result in turn will help to keep our national economy strong as well. I look forward to working closely with our colleagues in the Senate and the House to enact this important measure.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Children's Gun Violence Prevention Act, together with Senator Boxer, Senator Durbin, Senator Dodd and Senator Reed. 
The continuing epidemic of gun violence involving children demands action by Congress. 
The wave of school shootings in communities across the country is a wake-up call for the nation. We need to do more--and we can do more--to protect children from guns. 
Every day in the United States, 14 children are killed by a gun; 24 percent of children say they have access to a gun at home; 10 percent have recently carried a gun to school. 
We need to deal more effectively with all aspects of the culture of violence that is killing our children. The legislation we propose today is a concrete step to do more to keep children safe from gun violence. 
I know that some in Congress are reluctant to challenge the National Rifle Association, but there are common sense steps that we can take and should take to protect children from guns. Our bill says that gun owners must take responsibility for securing their guns so that children can't use them. It says that gun dealers must be more vigilant in not selling guns and ammunition to children. It says we must develop child-proof safety locks and other child safety features for guns. We do more today to regulate the safety of toy guns than real guns, and that's a national disgrace. 
The legislation we are introducing today is the least we can do to stop more schoolyard tragedies and to deal more responsibly with the festering crisis of gun violence involving children. 
In a press conference earlier today, we heard what gun violence has done to Susan Wilson of Jonesboro with the loss of her daughter Brittheny, and what it has done to the families in Oregon, and the thousands of other families who lose children to gun violence every year, and we know that action is needed. 
I want to commend Sarah Brady and Handgun Control for their leadership on this legislation, and for bringing us to this point today. 
Practical steps can clearly be taken to protect children more effectively from guns, and to promote greater responsibility by parents, gun manufacturers, and gun dealers alike. This legislation calls for such steps and it deserves to be enacted this year by this Congress.

Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, as Senator Durbin and Senator Conrad have pointed out, the current amendment is not really about saving money for the States. The amendment is one more backhanded attempt to protect the tobacco industry. It is the third amendment offered on attorneys' fees. The prior two were rejected by a substantial majority. It is a transparent effort to distract attention from the enormous public health issues on which the American people want us to focus. Let's defeat this amendment and turn our attention to stopping youth smoking. 
The Senate has debated this landmark youth smoking reduction bill for a month. Each of us has had an ample opportunity to state our views. The Senate should commit to vote on final passage this week. We owe it to the children who are being entrapped into a life of addiction and premature death by the tobacco industry every day. 
The opponents of this legislation have used every parliamentary tool at their disposal to extend the debate and divert attention to an unrelated issue. They want to talk about every subject but the impact of smoking on the Nation's health. However, the real issue cannot be obscured by their verbal smokescreen. It is time for us to move from talking to voting. Each day that the opponents delay final Senate passage of the bill, 3,000 more children begin to smoke and a third of these children will die prematurely from lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease, and other smoking-caused illnesses. 
Each day that we delay, the price of a pack of cigarettes will continue to be affordable to the Nation's children and more and more of them will take up this deadly habit. And each day that we delay, tobacco will continue to target children with billions of dollars in advertising and promotional giveaways that promise popularity, excitement, and success for young men and women who start smoking. Each day that we delay, millions of nonsmokers will be exposed to secondhand smoke. 
According to the Environmental Protection Agency, secondhand smoke causes 3,000 to 5,000 lung cancer deaths each year in the United States--more than all other regulated hazardous air pollutants combined. Secondhand smoke is also responsible for as many as 60 percent of cases of asthma, bronchitis, and wheezing among young children. 
Each day that we delay, tobacco will remain virtually the only product manufactured for human consumption that is not subject to federal health and safety regulations, despite the fact that it causes over 400,000 deaths a year. 
Preventing this human tragedy should be the Senate's first order of business. With so much at stake for so many of our children, it is truly irresponsible for the opponents of this legislation to practice the politics of obstruction. Let the Senate vote. 
The public supports this bill overwhelmingly, despite the tobacco industry's extravagantly funded campaign of misinformation. 
A new poll released this morning shows that the American people want the McCain bill to pass by a margin of two to one; 62 percent support the legislation, while only 31 percent oppose it. The American people can see through the tobacco industry's smokescreen, why can't the Senate? 
The same survey shows that the public knows who will be responsible if the McCain bill does not pass. By a 2 1/2 to 1 margin, the American people say the Republicans in Congress will be most responsible if the bill dies. By a similar margin, voters say they would be more likely to vote for a candidate who supported the McCain bill, and less likely to vote for a candidate who opposed it. 
This bill will do an effective job of providing that protection for our children. It will save 5 million of today's children from a lifetime of addiction and premature death. It contains a series of strong provisions that have withstood repeated attempts to weaken them: 
It contains a substantial price increase to keep children from starting to smoke. 
It gives the FDA strong authority to regulate tobacco like the drug it is. 
It has tough restrictions on advertising, to stop tobacco companies from cynically targeting children. 
It contains a strong lookback provision that requires large additional payments by tobacco companies if they fail to meet the targets in the bill for reducing youth smoking in the years ahead. 
It gives no immunity from liability to the tobacco companies for the illnesses they have caused. 
We can reach a reasonable accommodation on how best to protect tobacco farmers, and how best to use the revenues obtained from the tobacco industry. There is no excuse for further delay. The Senate should pass this bill this week, and send it to the House. Senators who refuse to act will pay a high price for abdicating their responsibility. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment or two to talk about an issue that is related to the health and well-being of our fellow citizens--the Patients' Bill of Rights legislation, which I think cries out for action in these next very few days. 
Mr. President, the Patients' Bill of Rights is not on the majority leader's list of bills to be considered. The majority leader has made available to the Members which pieces of legislation he is going to call up to the floor of the Senate over the period of these next few weeks until the Fourth of July break, then the period of July and then coming into the time that we will be meeting in September. There is a whole series of bills on that list, but one that is missing and one that cries out for action as well is the Patients' Bill of Rights. We want to have the opportunity to debate and consider it, but we are unable to either get a markup of the legislation in our Human Resources Committee, the committee of appropriate jurisdiction, or on the floor of the U.S. Senate. And that is, I think, unacceptable. We are not able to have it considered--not this month, not next month, not for the remainder of this Congress. Evidently, he stands shoulder to shoulder with the guardians of the status quo who want to continue the health insurance abuses. Protecting patients may not be on the majority leader's priority list, but it is on the priority list of American families. And it is on the priority list of more than 100 organizations of doctors, nurses and patients who wrote Leader Lott and Speaker Gingrich yesterday asking that this legislation be considered. 
I believe this is on the priority list of a majority of Members of the Senate and House--a bipartisan majority that want to protect families, not the profits of the insurance companies. Our leader on this side of the aisle, Tom Daschle, has said that we will offer the Patients' Bill of Rights on the first available appropriate vehicle. The American people deserve action. 
The American people deserve to have their health care decisions decided by the doctors and the medical profession rather than the accountants for the insurance industry. We have had over the period of these past weeks series after series of incidents of how our fellow citizens' lives have been lost or permanently damaged because of our failure to address this particular issue. The President last year called forth a commission, which was bipartisan, which made unanimous recommendations--Republican and Democrat alike. 
The Patients' Bill of Rights legislation, which has been introduced by Senator Daschle and which I have been honored to cosponsor with a number of our colleagues, basically reflects the judgment put forward by that bipartisan group of outstanding, thoughtful men and women who are a part of our health care system. We here in this body should address this issue, and we will. We are giving as much notice as possible to the leaders that this is an issue that is not going to go away. We are going to address it. We would vastly prefer addressing it in a way that will accommodate the kind of debate and discussion this issue deserves, but if we are not given that kind of assurance, if we are not given time to address this issue, then we will use whatever parliamentary means we must because the American people expect it. 
This is a measure of enormous importance in protecting the health and the well-being of families in this country. Families that are facing medical crises, as I mentioned, should have these decisions decided by the health professions. They ought to be able to get the specialists they need. If it is, in a woman's case, a gynecologist or obstetrician, they ought to be able to call on and get the kind of specialty care they need. Women in our society ought to be able to participate in clinical trials, not be denied some of the best that is available out there that offers, in many instances, the opportunity for real hope of a possible cure or a significant improvement in their well-being. They should not be denied that. They are denied that in too many instances today. 
Newborn children ought to be guaranteed they are going to be able to get the pediatric specialists who can help guide a newborn child or a baby to be able to deal with some of those extraordinary challenges that are evidenced in the first days and weeks of life. We ought to prohibit the kind of gag orders that are out there today in so many instances where doctors who are trying to practice their medicine are denied the opportunity to provide the whole range of choices and options to their patients and they are prohibited because of the HMO's decision. 
We want to eliminate the kinds of incidents that have been reported on the floor of the Senate where ambulances will drive by the emergency room of a particular hospital and take someone who is in need of emergency treatment to a distant hospital because the HMO is not going to reimburse that individual for the treatment and emergency services at that particular hospital. That makes no common sense, and it does not make any sense even on the bottom line for these companies. 
These kinds of things are happening every single day, and every single day we delay the debate, discussion, and conclusion of this legislation, the health of Americans across this country is being compromised. That is wrong. 
We have had bipartisan support for this legislation. The two doctors in the House of Representatives, Republicans, have both supported a Patients' Bill of Rights. They are urging that 
we take action. I commend them for their courage and for their leadership. It is imperative that we move ahead and take action in the very near future. Every day that goes on and we fail to do so, thousands of families are being put at risk. I hope that on the first vehicle after we conclude this legislation we will have an opportunity to address it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Reed for his leadership on the amendment that is before the Senate at the present time. He has proposed a creative and effective enforcement mechanism to deter tobacco industry marketing targeted to children. I strongly support his amendment to eliminate the tax deduction for tobacco industry advertisements that violate FDA advertising restrictions. 
Clearly, the tobacco industry should not be marketing its addictive products to children. For years, Big Tobacco has appealed to children through its advertising and promotional campaigns. Tobacco advertising was banned from television in the 1970s, but cigarette manufacturers have found new ways to hook kids on their products through colorful magazine advertisements, free t-shirts and caps with brand logos, product placements on prime-time television shows and in the movies, and sponsorship of sports events and cultural events. 
In fact, studies show that more cigarette ads are placed in stores near schools than in other stores. Ads are put next to the candy counters more often than elsewhere in stores. Displays are set at eye-level for children. In stores near schools and in neighborhoods with large numbers of children under 17, there are more tobacco ads outside the store and in the store windows than in cases where schools are nearby. 
Recently in Massachusetts, 3,000 teenagers surveyed stores in their communities to identify cigarette advertising aimed at children. Stores within a thousand feet of schools in low-income and minority neighborhoods had more cigarette advertising than stores in affluent communities. 
According to a recent study in the Journal of the American Medical Association, children watching the Marlboro Meadowland Auto Race on television were exposed to Marlboro ads over 4,700 times in 90 minutes--4,700 times in 90 minutes. Cigarette ads are theoretically prohibited on television--but the tobacco companies have obviously found a way to get around that prohibition. 
These advertising placements do not happen by accident. Tobacco companies have consistently targeted children as young as 12--because they know that once children are hooked on cigarettes, they are customers for life. 
In fact, a 1996 study in the Journal on Marketing found that teenagers are three times as responsible as adults to cigarette advertising. 
Before the Joe Camel advertising campaign began, less than 0.5 percent of young smokers chose Camel. After a few years of intensive Joe Camel advertising, Camel's share of the youth market rose to 33 percent--33 percent. 
Some 90 percent of current adult smokers began to smoke before the age of 18. If young men and women reach that age without beginning to smoke, it is very likely that they will never take up the habit in later years. And so the industry has cynically conducted its advertising in a way calculated to hook as many children as possible. 
For at least a generation, Big Tobacco has targeted children with billions of dollars in advertising and promotional giveaways that promise popularity, maturity and success for those who begin this deadly habit. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the average 14-year-old is exposed to $20 billion in tobacco advertising--$20 billion--beginning at age 6. It is no coincidence that the three most heavily advertised brands are preferred by 80 percent of children--Marlboro, Camel, and Newport. 
A study published in the February 8, 1998 Journal of the American Medical Association also reported a strong correlation between cigarette advertising and youth smoking. 
It analyzed tobacco advertising in 34 popular U.S. magazines and found that as youth readership increased, the likelihood of youth-targeted cigarette advertising increased as well. 
Two recently disclosed industry documents reveal that Big Tobacco had a deliberate strategy to market its products to children. In a 1981 Philip Morris memo entitled `Young Smokers--Prevalence, Implications, and Related Demographic Trends,' the author wrote that `it is important to know as much as possible about teenage smoking patterns and attitudes. Today's teenager is tomorrow's regular customer, and the overwhelming majority of smokers first begin to smoke while still in their teens. Because of our high share of the market among the youngest smokers, Philip Morris will suffer more than other companies from the decline in the number of teenager smokers.' 
A 1976 R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company memorandum stated that `young people will continue to become smokers at or above the present rates during the projection period. The brands which these beginning smokers accept and use will become the dominant brands in future years. Evidence is now available to indicate that the 14- to 18-year-old group is an increasing segment of the smoking population. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco must soon establish a successful new brand in this market if our position in the industry is to be maintained over the long-term.' 
The conclusion is obvious. Big Tobacco's goal is to hook children into a lifetime of nicotine addiction and smoking-related illnesses. They've used Joe Camel, the Marlboro Man, and the prominent placement of tobacco advertising. Obviously, Big Tobacco knows how to stop targeting children. That's why the Reed amendment is so important. If tobacco companies continue to target children with their billboard advertisements near schools, giveways of branded items, sponsorships of sporting events, and magazine promotions, they'll lose their tax deduction. 
The health of the nation's children deserves to be protected. The Reed amendment is an important enforcement mechanism to ensure that Big Tobacco plays by the rules. 
If we continue to permit tobacco companies to deduct the cost of advertising targeted to children as an ordinary and necessary business expense, we will literally be providing a tax subsidy for this unlawful and immoral conduct. Unless we adopt the Reed amendment, the taxpayers will be paying approximately 35 cents of every dollar spent by the industry on a billboard, on a magazine ad, on a promotional item designed to entrap our children into a lifetime of addiction and premature death. The Senate should declare in one resounding voice that we do not consider addicting children to be `an ordinary and necessary business expense.' 
This amendment speaks to the tobacco industry in the only language it understands--money. It will dramatically increase the cost, and therefore help to deter, marketing campaigns which seek to convert impressionable kids into lifelong smokers. For every advertisement which does not appear because of this amendment, there may well be a child who does not light up his or her first cigarette. 
The Reed amendment deserves the support of every Senator. I urge my colleagues to support it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Kerry/Bond Youth Smoking Reduction Amendment. This year has featured hearings, press conferences, and legislation from both sides of the aisle promoting children's programs. Over 50 bills have been introduced to improve childhood development and after school programs. Headlines have focused the nation's attention on the difficulties that many parents face in finding quality care for their children. The struggle for decent child care is a daily fact of life that all working families understand, regardless of their income. Yet millions of families today cannot afford the child care they need in order to raise, and protect their children. 
Both Republicans and Democrats agree that the number one goal of this tobacco bill ought to be protecting our children and reducing teenage smoking. Rightly, so. Millions of young lives hang in the balance. Every piece of tobacco legislation that has been introduced is intended to help children. Republicans have called their bills `Placing Restraints on Tobacco's Endangerment of Children and Teens Act' and the `Kids Deserve Freedom from Tobacco Act.' Democrats have introduced the `Healthy Kids Act.' It's time to make this legislation reflect the rhetoric about children. 
Senator Grams was right when he recently explained why he will not support the tobacco settlement--`It's not about protecting kids from tobacco, because if it were, the dollars the federal government collects would go to the kids.' 
I agree that these funds should be used for early childhood development, child care and after school programs--programs that directly help kids. These programs are effective ways to curb teen smoking and promote a healthy future for our children. It's time to stand up for the nation's children, and stand against the tobacco industry. 
During this debate, there has been a great deal of discussion about restricting tobacco advertising and increasing the price of cigarettes. Both steps are intended to curb teenage smoking, and both will help to do just that. But there are other steps we can take as well to deal with realities that make children vulnerable to the lure of tobacco. By investing in essential early childhood development and care that can really help us save children from the dangers of smoking. 
The purpose of this tobacco legislation is to help children and to stop teenage smoking. For more than a generation, the tobacco industry has been profiteering by abusing the nation's children, stunting their growth and stealing their futures. The full dimension of this cynical tobacco industry strategy is finally becoming clear. The avalanche of secret industry documents disclosed in recent months reveals a blatant nationwide scheme to target children and addict them to tobacco in order to maximize industry profits. 
For a quarter century the R.J. Reynolds Company has referred to children as `tomorrow's cigarette business.' Newly released documents show that Philip Morris provided money to movie makers to add smoking scenes to popular movies, such as the Muppets, in order to observe attitudes toward smoking by children as young as 5 years old. As a result of the tobacco industry's tactics, 93 percent of 6 year olds can identify Joe Camel as a symbol of smoking. 
Investing in child development is sensible `public health' strategy. It is based on sound science and common sense. Doctors and public health officials who are on the front lines, working tirelessly to help children grow and develop into productive citizens, know all too well the dangers of tobacco. They have seen all too frequently its tight grip on our young people. They have called upon us to do all we can to reduce teen smoking, including an essential investment in early childhood development and after school programs. Forty-two doctors, public health officials, business leaders, and child development experts including Dr. T. Berry Brazelton, America's foremost pediatrician, have strongly supported this strategy, and have asked Congress to invest in child care and after school programs to prevent youth smoking addiction. 
Recent research reminds us that brain development in the first three years of life 
is critical to laying the foundation for positive self esteem, effective decision-making and the ability to resist destructive habits such as smoking. If we want children to grow up healthy and tobacco free, we must ensure that they receive the stimulation and nurturing they need early. If we wait until adolescence to help them develop the will and the skill to say no to smoking--what we do will be too little and too late. 
After school and summer programs also make a large difference. Over 5 million children are left home alone after school each day. They are more vulnerable to negative peer pressure and pressure from the tobacco industry. These are precisely the teenagers targeted and manipulated by the industry's marketing schemes. After school programs help keep young people off the streets and engaged in constructive activities that do not jeopardize their futures. Many of these after school programs specifically incorporate anti-smoking initiatives to teach participants about the dangers to tobacco and equip them with the skills to make important life and death decisions. 
Teenagers left home alone are significantly more likely to smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, and experiment with drugs. In stark contrast, children who participate in productive after school activities are far less likely, to smoke, drink alcohol, or use drugs. We also know that cigarettes are a `starter drug' and often lead to hard drug use and substance abuse. 
High quality child care and after school programs can help children develop the skills they need to avoid unhealthy habits such as smoking. But, every day across America, millions of low-income working families face the daunting task of finding affordable child care on their limited budgets. The reality is that far too many children are at risk. Ten million low-income children today theoretically qualify for services under current federal child care programs. But because of the lack of funding, only 1 in 10 actually receive it. The cost of decent child care often ranges from $4,000 to $10,000 per year--yet a minimum wage job pays only $10,700 a year. Low-income parents need support to ensure that their children are safe and well cared for. Unfortunately, far too few of them receive the help they need and deserve. Sadly, they are the one group that has been deliberately targeted by the tobacco industry for addiction and early death. That is why I support the Kerry-Bond Amendment, which will ensure that at least half of the federal share of the state funds received under this legislation will be spent by states on after school care and early childhood development by increasing the Child Care Development Block Grant. 
The American people understand the importance of funding these child development programs. They agree that tobacco settlement revenues should be invested in child care and child development programs. I have received numerous letters from groups, experts, and parents from across the country urging Congress to do so. 
If we want children to say no to tobacco, then Congress needs to say yes to making children's programs part of our national strategy for keeping children healthy and tobacco free. 
Mr. President, I join in commending my friend and colleagues, Senator Kerry and Senator Bond, for bringing up this amendment. I think it is very consistent with the central thrust of this legislation which is addressed to reducing the number of young people in this country--the children of this country--from becoming involved in smoking. 
What we all find out in listening to those who have thought about this, studied it, and reviewed the various real-life experiences that we have seen in different communities, countries, and States is that there are some very, very powerful conclusions. There is no one single answer, but there are a series of answers. 
I believe that this amendment addresses one of the very important conclusions that have been drawn on the basis of sound science and common sense. We have learned that if you see a significant increase in the cost of a pack of cigarettes, that it provides a significant disincentive to children to involve themselves in smoking. We find out that if you provide counteradvertising in making young people aware of the dangers, that it can have a powerful impact in offsetting the $5 billion a year that is out there to try to draw young children into smoking by presenting the case that, if they start to smoke, their life will be more exciting, more pleasurable, and more successful. You don't need to match the tobacco industry dollar for dollar, but you do need to have an effective counteradvertising campaign. That reduces youth smoking. We have seen it in Massachusetts. We have seen it in California. I have referred to those studies at other times in the course of this debate. 
Cessation programs to help young people to stop smoking have had some important success. 
Support for school-based programs, which I see in my own State of Massachusetts, where young people involve themselves in working with law enforcement to discourage retailers from violating the law, has had some success. 
We have a number of young people now in my State of Massachusetts who are involved in programs to have the various malls around Massachusetts smoke free. They are doing it as volunteers. The young people are doing it. They are also educating the public and their colleagues about the dangers of smoking. 
There are a number of things that can be done. But the importance of providing early child development to equip young children with the confidence-building tools so that they have the ability to resist various peer pressures and develop those skills of competence is absolutely imperative and essential if we are expecting the children in the future to resist dangerous types of behavior. That has been demonstrated time in and time out. The various Carnegie studies have amply demonstrated that. 
This legislation is focused on early child development, building those confidence-building skills, helping and assisting in augmenting and supporting children at the earliest ages. We find as the study goes on and on that the earlier, really, the better. 
Then by providing an atmosphere where these children are going to be able to be challenged intellectually and socially in child care settings provides the kind of supporting atmosphere and climate, again, for building their confidence-building skills. 
Also, providing some after-school programs, whether it is 
in the day when the children are attending school, or whether it is at a time when the children are not in school, such as during vacations and also the summertime, considered together, have a very powerful impact in strengthening the willingness of children to resist the negative behavior patterns that start out with smoking, then yield to smoking and drinking, and then, as the law enforcement experts provide, smoking and drinking lead their way to significant substance abuse. That empirical evidence has been included during the period of these last couple of weeks and has been amply justified over a period of time. 
The benefit of this particular amendment, I think, primarily rests with helping the children at their most vulnerable time, as they are developing their own kinds of confidence-building skills--giving them the kind of help, support, and the power to resist abnormal, negative, and destructive behavior. 
Second, it provides an important investment in terms of the children so they will have a more useful, constructive, happier, and productive life. 
All we have to do is consider the Beethoven studies that have been done in Chicago and the Ypsilanti studies that have been done, which have demonstrated this kind of investment in terms of children's attitude and support pays off in just the way that has been represented by those who have advanced this amendment. 
This is right on target in helping to reduce children's smoking. It is right on target in ensuring that children who are the most vulnerable will be able to develop the kind of skills to resist smoking. 
It is right on target and consistent with the public health drive, which is the central purpose of this bill, and cannot be distorted and cannot be misrepresented by those who are opposed to any kind of legislation. As hard as they try, this legislation is moving forward. 
But with this particular amendment, it will be a more effective bill in helping the children in this country. It is an amendment that should be accepted, supported, approved, and made a part of this bill. 
Mr. President, I hope that the amendment will be accepted.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned about the continuing lack of commitment by the Republican Leadership to schedule floor debate on legislation to end abuses by health insurance managed care plans. Today, more than 100 groups have sent a letter to Senator Lott and Speaker Gingrich asking for quick, full and fair floor consideration of this legislation, which is called the Patients' Bill of Rights. These groups represent millions of patients, doctors, nurses, therapists, and working families. 
Yet, in a memo sent to all Senators and in recent floor statements, it appears that our patient protection legislation--the Patients' Bill of Rights--is not even on the Republican Leader's radar screen. It is not on the list of priorities designated by the Republican Leadership to be taken up this month, or even this session. I have here a list of more than 20 bills, ranging from regular appropriations bills and reauthorization bills to the nuclear waste disposal legislation and a constitutional amendment on flag burning. 
But, I have yet to see any interest from the Republican Leadership in taking action to ensure that medical decisions are made by treating physicians, and not by insurance company accountants. And I have yet to see any interest from the Republican Leadership in curbing abusive activities by the worst plans and insurance companies that are dedicated to their profits, not their patients. Instead, it appears that, by this inaction, the Republican Leadership is interested only in defending the indefensible, the status quo. 
In addition, the House Republican Leader, Dick Armey, recently lashed out at doctors, nurses and other health care professionals by grossly misinterpreting and distorting a provision in the Patients' Bill of Rights that allows health care professionals to support their patients in appeals procedures, and to report concerns about the quality of care without fear of retaliation. These are reasonable patient-oriented protections. Congressman Armey's misguided effort offends and impugns the character and professionalism of hundreds of thousands of nurses, doctors and patients. 
In fact, his harsh attack has helped mobilize even more organizations to support the bill. Representatives Lois Capps, Carolyn McCarthy and Eddie Bernice Johnson, who are former nurses, and nurses from communities around the country have rallied around the Patients' Bill of Rights. Today, they have sent a letter to Congressman Armey asking for a meeting on these critically important issues. They are supported, in a separate letter, by a number of groups who represent persons with disabilities, mental illness and HIV/AIDS, and other organizations that rely regularly on trained and devoted health care professionals. 
These issues matter a great deal to families across the country. Too often today, managed care is mismanaged care. In state after state across the country, patients are paying for these industry abuses with their lives. 
Just ask Frances Jennings of Andover, Massachusetts. In November, 1992, at the age of 57, her husband Jack was diagnosed with mild emphysema by his pulmonologist. A few years later, in March, 1997, Mr. Jennings was hospitalized for a pneumothorax, which can lead to a collapsed lung. His physician, Dr. Newsome, determined that a lung reduction procedure would improve Jack's health and overall quality of life. 
Two months later, in May, 1997, Jack's condition was stable enough for the operation, and he was referred to Dr. Sugerbaker, a top surgeon who specialized in the procedure. 
But in late May, Jack's insurance plan--U.S. HealthCare--denied his referral to the specialist. Frances and Jack were disappointed that the plan refused to authorize the referral, and they requested a referral for consultation with a plan-approved physician. This appointment was finally scheduled for June 12. But, on June 11, the new doctor's office called Jack to cancel his appointment, stating that the physician no longer accepted patients from the health plan. 
Immediately following this cancellation, Jack's primary care physician--Dr. Newsome--contacted the health plan to obtain yet another referral. On June 18, a new appointment was confirmed for mid-July, four months after his initial hospitalization. 
Tragically, Jack Jennings never had the opportunity to benefit from the procedure recommended by his doctor. Jack had been having trouble breathing, despite his continuous use of oxygen, and had been hospitalized at the end of June. During this hospitalization, they discovered a fast growing cancer in his chest. Lung surgery was out of the question, and it was too late for chemotherapy to be effective. 
Mr. Jennings died on July 10--four days before his long-awaited appointment with the specialist. In fact, this appointment would have been with Dr. Sugarbaker's group, the same physician that U.S. Health Care had prevented Jack from seeing in May. 
This is a clear case where needed health care was unnecessarily delayed, with tragic implications. Timely care could have saved Jack's life. The health plan's inability or unwillingness to provide it cost him his life. 
Unfortunately, such abuses are far too common in managed care plans today. Congressional offices are flooded with letters and calls from constituents who need assistance. Newspapers tell story after story of the human costs of these abuses. 
The Patients' Bill of Rights will help solve these problems, and restore confidence in the health care system. The Patients' Bill of Rights is a common sense solution. Nearly all of its provisions were recommended by the Presidential Advisory Commission on Quality in the Health Care Industry. Many are included in the voluntary code of conduct for members of the American Association of Health Plans, the managed care trade association. Some of the provisions are already being implemented for federal health programs, including Medicare. Still others are included in model laws written by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. The Senate should act on this important legislation, and it should act now.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, thirty-five years ago today, in his commencement address to the graduating class of The American University in 1963, President Kennedy announced his support for a comprehensive nuclear test ban. As he said on that occasion: 
The conclusion of such a treaty, so near and yet so far, would check the spiraling arms race in one of its most dangerous areas. It would place the nuclear powers in a position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest hazards which man faces in 1963, the further spread of nuclear arms. It would increase our security--it would decrease the prospects of war. Surely this goal is sufficiently important to require our steady pursuit, yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole effort nor the temptation to give up our insistence on vital and responsible safeguards. 
In the weeks that followed, President Kennedy secured one of the most important of successes of his New Frontier--the signing of the Limited Test Ban Treaty. 
But, today, 35 years later, we still have not achieved the larger goal of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Especially in the wake of the recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan, we need to do all we can to achieve the rapid ratification of this important treaty. 
The arguments in favor of the CTBT are stronger and more important than ever. The recent tests are a reminder that the greatest threat to humanity is still the danger of nuclear war. 
The end of the Cold War has presented us with a unique opportunity to step back from the nuclear brink and end nuclear testing worldwide. A Comprehensive Test Ban now would also end the current discrepancy between the world's recognized nuclear states which are permitted to test and the rest of the world's countries which are not. The Senate can take the lead in creating a more secure world by putting the United States in the front of the international effort to achieve a Comprehensive Test Ban. 
This is the right time for the CTBT. We no longer need to develop more powerful or more accurate nuclear weapons to deter the nations of the former Soviet Union, or any other nuclear-capable state. Through the Stockpile Stewardship Program, we are learning more each day about how to keep our nuclear arsenal safe and reliable without testing. 
One-hundred and forty-nine nations around the world have already signed the CTBT, including all five of the recognized nuclear states. The United States signed it in September 1996, but the Senate has not yet ratified it. 
President Kennedy said it best 35 years ago when he told the students at American University, `. . . in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal.' 
I urge the Senate to act on the ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The most important single step we can take today to reduce the dangers of nuclear war.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator will yield for a brief question. 
Does the Senator remember the debate on the telecommunications legislation where at least there was an understanding that the major carriers were going to be favorably disposed, as a result of the competitiveness, to give those assurances to schools, to libraries, and to rural public health settings around the country? 
Telemedicine is extremely important, I know, in many regions of the country. It provides extraordinary upgrading of quality health in terms of diagnosis and treatment and care for many of those who live in remote areas, whether it is in urban areas that might benefit from the museums and libraries or educational centers, or those kinds of facilities that exist in rural America, or the public health facilities, small clinics, that provide in many instances life support services for people who live in those communities. It seems to me that many of us were under the understanding that there was an agreement to provide for those kinds of services. 
I am just wondering whether the leader shared my impression that this was something they had every reason to expect to go into effect, that they had planned on it and made provisions for it, and in many instances are very dependent upon these kinds of services.

Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield further, it seems to me that we have been talking about whether it has been in the area of education, the area of health care, about partnerships. We have understood that we don't have all the resources given the budgetary considerations, but we are talking about the partnership that exists between the public and the private sector. 
We also listened, I thought with very strong approval, to the excellent presentation that the President made up in my own State of Massachusetts at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
I see the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. If I could yield for whatever interventions he would like to make, I see an outstanding guest who honors us and who made a wonderful speech that many of us had the chance to listen to a short time ago. It is a great pleasure to yield at this time.

Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. 
Mr. President, the Senate has been considering the comprehensive tobacco legislation offered by Senator McCain for three weeks. 
In fact, since the Senate began to debate the tobacco bill on May 18, 69,000 children have begun to smoke, and 23,000 will die prematurely from a smoking-caused disease. 
In the past day, however, we have made significant progress in moving forward in a bipartisan manner to resolve our differences and bring this bill to final passage. 
The Senate should once and for all reject the dilatory tactics of the opponents of this legislation, who care more about protecting the profits of Big Tobacco than they do about protecting the health of the nation's children. They have used every strategy in the book to delay and obstruct this important legislation while thousands of children begin a lifetime of nicotine addiction and smoking-caused illness. But the pressure is starting to build in every corner of this nation, and the American voters are demanding that the Senate take quick and decisive action to bring this bill to a vote. 
The stakes have rarely, if ever, been higher on any public health issue. Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the nation. Of the 48 million smokers in the United States today, it is estimated that 20 million adults and 5 million children will die prematurely from a tobacco-induced disease. 
In fact, tobacco products are responsible for a third of all cancers, and 90% of all lung cancers. 170,000 new cases of lung cancer are expected in 1998. 90,000 men and 65,000 women are expected to die of the disease in this year alone. 
Tobacco use is also linked to a wide variety of other illnesses. Smoking by children and adolescents is associated with higher cholesterol levels which can significantly increase the risk of early development of cardiovascular diseases. 
New research also indicates that tobacco use is a risk factor in alcoholism, depression, hearing loss, and vision loss among the elderly. 
The use of smokeless tobacco products is associated with cancers of the mouth, gum disease, and tooth loss. 
The dangers of secondhand smoke are also becoming increasingly clear. It is linked to low birthweight, respiratory distress syndrome, and sudden infant death syndrome. A recent report by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research says that secondhand smoke is responsible for as many as 60% of cases of asthma, bronchitis, and wheezing among young children. 
It is also clear that smoking-related illnesses impose an enormous burden on the United States economy. According to the Department of Treasury, smoking will cost society $130 billion this year, of which $45 million is attributable to medical costs due to smoking-caused diseases. 
Smoking during pregnancy, which results in increased costs from complicated deliveries, medical care of low-weight babies, and developmental disabilities, adds up to a $4 billion loss for the U.S. economy. 
The damage resulting from smoking-caused fires is $500 million a year, which does not even account for the 2,000 lives lost in these tragic accidents. 
$500 million is attributable to lost productivity, since smokers miss 50% more work days than nonsmokers. In addition, smokers tend to die younger and retire sooner, which costs society an astounding $80 billion in lost output and wages. 
Much higher priority is obviously needed for smoking cessation programs and tobacco prevention initiatives, which are among the most cost-effective means available to reduce health care costs while, at the same time, improve the lives of millions of Americans. 
The pending amendment by the Senator from Texas seeks to divert approximately $47 billion over the next ten years away from smoking prevention, away from smoking cessation, away from medical research, and away from reimbursing states. 
When we add the combined impact of the pending 
Gramm amendment and the Coverdell amendment which was approved yesterday, no funds would be left for programs which are essential to reducing youth smoking and to helping current smokers quit. In fact, the Gramm amendment alone would result in roughly 4 million fewer Americans served by smoking cessation programs, 20 million fewer people discouraged from smoking by counteradvertising campaigns, and 48 million fewer children participating in school-based smoking prevention activities. 
These numbers speak for themselves. Reasonable marriage penalty relief makes sense. But the Gramm amendment goes too far. It would destroy the underlying smoking prevention legislation. 
All of the money raised by the cigarette price increase contained in the legislation is currently earmarked for smoking related purposes: 22 percent is directed to smoking prevention and cessation, 22 percent is to be used for medical research, 16 percent is for transitional assistance for tobacco farmers, and 40 percent is to compensate states for the cost of medical treatment of smoking related illnesses. 
Which of these smoking related initiatives would the Senator from Texas eliminate? Does he propose to eliminate all compensation to the states for their tobacco related health costs? After all, it was the state lawsuits which provided the genesis for this legislation and which exposed the most dramatic evidence of industry wrongdoing. That would not be fair. Even if every dollar intended for the states was taken to fund the Gramm amendment, it would not be enough to cover the cost. 
Does he propose to eliminate all transition assistance for tobacco farmers and communities? It would not even cover one-third of the cost of the Gramm amendment. 
All of the remaining dollars are directed to smoking prevention, to smoking cessation, and to medical research. These initiatives are the heart of the legislation, yet both the pending Gramm amendment and the Coverdell amendment approved yesterday will deny needed resources to prevent teenagers from beginning to smoke. If we are serious about stopping children from smoking and saving lives from tobacco-induced diseases, we have to make these investments. 
These programs work. Let me give you a few examples: 
Every dollar invested in a smoking cessation program for a pregnant woman saves $6 in costs for neonatal intensive care and long-term care for low birth weight babies. In addition, smoking cessation programs have an added benefit of reducing tobacco use among children. According to Michael Fiore, Director of Tobacco Research at the University of Wisconsin Medical School, children who smoke have twice the risk of becoming smokers than children of nonsmokers have. By helping parents to quit, the risk of children becoming smokers is reduced as well. The effect of the Gramm amendment would be to reduce funds for these programs, and that makes no sense. 
The Gramm amendment would deny funds needed to help states and communities conduct educational programs on the health dangers of smoking. The tobacco industry spends $5 billion a year--$5 billion--on advertising to encourage young people to smoke. Shouldn't we spend at least one tenth of that amount to counteract the industry's lethal message? 
Counteradvertising is a key element of an effective tobacco control strategy. We know that children are easily swayed by the tobacco industry's marketing campaigns, which promise popularity, excitement, and success for those who take up smoking. We can use counteradvertising to reverse the damage by deglamorizing the use of tobacco among children. 
Both Massachusetts and California have demonstrated that paid counteradvertising can cut smoking rates. It helped reduce cigarette use in Massachusetts by 17 percent between 1992 and 1996, or three times the national average. Smoking by junior high students dropped 8 percent, while the rest of the nation has seen an increase. In California, a counteradvertising campaign also reduced smoking rates by 15 percent over the last three years. 
The Gramm amendment also would take money from law enforcement efforts to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors, even though young people currently spend $1 billion a year to buy tobacco products illegally. According to Professor Joseph DiFranza of the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, `if $1 billion in illegal sales were spread out evenly over an estimated 1 million 
tobacco retailers nationwide, it would indicate that the average retailer breaks the law about 500 times a year.' 
The Gramm amendment will diminish funding for medical research on tobacco-related diseases, which kill 400,000 Americans each year and incapacitate millions more. Given the damage that smoking inflicts on the nation's public health, it makes little sense to deny funds that should be directed to finding a cure for cancer and other tobacco-induced illnesses. 
In essence, the Gramm amendment would destroy much of the public health benefit this legislation is designed to achieve. The goal of eliminating the marriage penalty for low and moderate income families is a worthy one. It is shared on both sides of the aisle. However, it must be accomplished in a way that does not imperil our primary goal--preventing youth smoking and helping smokers overcome their addiction. 
The Daschle amendment, which offers relief from the marriage penalty without imperiling our smoking prevention efforts, will cost far less than the Gramm amendment, and it does a much better job of targeting tax relief to those most in need. 
The Daschle amendment will cost only $27 billion over the first ten years. That is the most which can be accommodated without damaging our ability to achieve the legislation's core anti-smoking purposes. The cost of the Gramm proposal mushrooms after the fifth year. Thus, over ten years, the cost of the Daschle amendment is approximately $20 billion less than the Gramm amendment. This is the difference between preserving a viable youth smoking reduction effort and destroying it. That is the difference between helping millions of smokers quit and leaving them at the mercy of their addiction. That is the difference between advancing medical research that can cure tobacco induced diseases and indefinitely delaying it. 
Because it is carefully targeted, the Daschle amendment actually provides more tax relief to those two income families earning $50,000 a year or less who currently pay the marriage penalty. By contrast, more than half the tax relief provided by the Gramm amendment would go to families that are not subject to the marriage penalty. Senator Daschle's proposal will do more to achieve tax fairness at a much lower cost. 
Once this issue is decided, there is little excuse for further delay. The remaining amendments can be considered in a few days if we move conscientiously forward. There is no valid reason why the Senate cannot vote on final passage soon. If we do not, the American people will know why. A small group of willful defenders of Big Tobacco will have succeeded in obstructing the work of the Senate on this vital issue of public health. On an issue of this importance, our constituents will not tolerate such obstruction. Now is the time for the Senate to act. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to express strong support for what my friend and colleague from Arizona has commented to the Senate and thank him for this long and continuing battle. He has been a leader in terms of trying to have a responsible position on this tobacco issue. As all of us understand, this has been an issue where there has been a great deal of diversity in this body, but there has been an enormously admirable, noble, and I think commendable effort on his part to try to move this legislation in a responsible way that tries to find a common ground. I want to just commend him for his continued efforts to move this process forward. 
We may have some differences on some particular issues as we address them, but I think every Member of this body who believes in the importance of developing a responsible position has to recognize his very, very strong and positive leadership. I join with others who have expressed that previously but, again, take note based upon his continuing efforts and upon his very reasoned statements that he made here earlier today. 
Now, I want to just join in welcoming many of our colleagues' focus and attention on the problems that this Nation is facing in terms of substance abuse. I am so delighted that many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have brought forth their strong support for this Nation to be addressing this particular problem in a more aggressive way. And I welcome that, because many of us stood on the floor of the U.S. Senate in the period of the past 3 years when we saw the Drug-Free School Program, which is the one program that has been developed that had bipartisan support, that is focused on the high schools of this country, that is focused on dealing with the problems of substance abuse, alcohol abuse, and conflict resolution. 
It doesn't provide a lot of resources--maybe $12 or $14 per school. Nonetheless, there have been a number of very impressive and important programs that have been developed on that. We have seen in recent times many of those who have spoken in favor of this particular amendment voting in favor of cutting the program back in a significant way that would bring targeted help and assistance in terms of the at-risk youth. We have seen that program, which includes the young people who are attempting to try to acquire some kind of treatment and attention and have been afflicted by this horrific kind of addiction in terms of substance abuse, significantly cut back and cut back again. 
We have seen the important success, I believe, of adding police officers to the streets across this country. The neighborhood policing concept reaches far beyond the total number of 100,000 police officers. I can tell you that in my city of Boston, where they have had the additional kinds of police officers that are community policing, that are involved in the community policing network and are out in schools setting up local kinds of police departments in these schools, in recreational areas, working virtually around the clock and doing a lot of work with community groups, nonprofit agencies, outreaching in terms of trying to deal with some of the problems of gangs. They have had a very important success. 
In my State of Massachusetts--particularly in Boston--up to just 2 months ago we went close to 2 years without a youth homicide. There are a lot of factors included in the efforts in Boston. Paul Evans, our commissioner, deserves great credit. The neighborhood policing support that was received as a result of some of these programs played an important part, and, again, that program was opposed. 
So I am not going to take much time here this morning to go through the opposition that many of us faced as we were looking for drug courts which have, I think, demonstrated to be very important and very effective in dealing with the more violent aspects of those that are involved in substance abuse, and the battle we have had in terms of support for those kinds of programs that have been developing to try to demonstrate their success in different regions and communities across the country. 
So over the period of these past years, many of us have been trying to give additional life to the problems of substance abuse in our society and we haven't been able to get very much support. So whatever the circumstances, we are glad that at least we are hearing on the floor of the U.S. Senate an increasing priority for this Nation in terms of focusing resources. We are not saying that necessarily just adding dollars to a particular program is going to solve the issue, but we do say that the allocations of resources--in this case, the commitment of appropriations, is at least the Nation's priorities in terms of allocating these resources. For many of those, I might say, in watching this debate on the problems of substance abuse and the so-called drug amendment, we have not heard their voices, we have not seen their support, we have not had their votes in the very recent times as all of us are trying to find ways of dealing with a problem that affects too many communities and families in this Nation. 
So if nothing comes out--and hopefully something will--of the debate, at least we will have additional kinds of focus and attention and, hopefully, support to try to help families, schools, and communities deal with the problems of substance 
abuse. 
Let's go back again to what we have here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. What we will find out, Mr. President, if you bring the experts in, in terms of substance abuse, is that virtually without exception the gateway drug to substance abuse is smoking. It is smoking. They will say that is the predominant one, and access to beer is a secondary aspect. But they will say smoking is the gateway drug to substance abuse. We won't take the time this morning--perhaps later in the debate--to show the correlation of smokers to those who get into the use of marijuana, or young smokers that start at 12, 13, and 14 years old that begin to use substances like heroin. The correlation is powerful, it is compelling, and it is convincing. If we are trying to come back to the problems in terms of substance abuse, the first place and the best place to start is with the issue of smoking. The younger the better. The younger the better. 
That is why I think it is important, as we are coming to this time in the debate and discussion, to keep our focus on what the underlying legislation is all about, which is the public health of young people in this country, to discourage them from smoking with the increase in price and a vigorous antismoking campaign on the back end to try to help provide both information and assistance, cessation programs, and others, in dealing with the challenge that this Nation is facing, and which other countries are facing as well. 
So, Mr. President, this is why it is so important that we get on with the business that is before the Senate, which is getting, I think, action in terms of voting rather than talking on the issue of tobacco legislation. We have all been through these various battles and we have legislation on the floor of the Senate, where there are strong differences of opinion, and the ability to delay action is readily available by Members on this issue. It seems that the debate has moved along. The issues before us are imperative and we ought to go ahead in having the cloture vote, and we can then deal with those amendments that are relevant at that time. 
The first vote we are going to be facing this afternoon on the motion to invoke cloture on the tobacco legislation is a key vote. For more than 3 weeks, opponents of the legislation have used every parliamentary trick in the book to prevent the Senate from passing this bill, even though a clear majority are for it. In the 3 weeks since the Senate started this debate, 66,000 more children have started to smoke, and 3,000 more will start each day until the legislation is enacted and implemented. While the Senate fiddles, the cigarettes burn. 
The opponents have attempted to create a smokescreen to divert attention from the real purpose of this legislation, which is to prevent children from beginning to smoke and becoming addicted to tobacco and help current smokers stop smoking. The opponents are desperate to have the Senate focus on anything else--limiting attorneys' fees, reducing the marriage penalty in the tax laws, prohibiting illegal drug use, school vouchers--any issue but the real issue. They would prefer to ignore the fact that tobacco use is responsible for 20 percent of all premature deaths in the United States. 
Tobacco is the Nation's leading cause of preventable death and disability. It accounts for 400,000 deaths a year--more deaths than from alcohol, more deaths than from car accidents, more deaths than from suicides, more deaths than from AIDS, more deaths than from homicides, more deaths than from illegal drugs, more deaths than from fires, more deaths than from all of these combined. 
Yet, the opponents of this legislation are not interested in protecting the public health and saving lives from tobacco use. They are interested in protecting big tobacco and blocking any effective action that would reduce tobacco use and therefore reduce tobacco profits. 
The American people understand what is going on here. Today's vote will lift the smokescreen and demonstrate where each Senator stands on this fundamental issue. Do they stand for further delay and obstruction, or do they have the courage to act against the will of the tobacco lobbyists? 
Parents are watching to see if the Senate will continue to allow tobacco companies to blatantly market their products to children, or will we force the Marlboro Man into the sunset? 
People are watching to see if the Senate will continue to allow nonsmokers to be exposed to secondhand smoke, which causes 3,000 to 5,000 lung cancer deaths each year in the United States and up to 60 percent of all cases of asthma and bronchitis in young children. 
Are we willing to stand up against the tobacco industry, and stand for the smoking cessation programs and the counter-advertising campaigns and the law enforcement efforts that are needed to prevent tobacco sales to minors? 
There is no valid reason why the Senate cannot vote on final passage this week. If the majority leader was willing to permit the fair and timely scheduling of amendments from both sides of the aisle, we could complete action on them within a few days. We have filed for cloture because it is the only way to break the parliamentary logjam created by a small group of willful defenders of the tobacco industry. It will provide an irrefutable public record of who is ready to vote for strong legislation to prevent youth smoking and who is attempting to talk the legislation to death. 
The opponents of the McCain bill are engaging in filibuster by amendment--amendments which do not even deal with the subject of smoking prevention. These amendments are transparent attempts to scuttle the legislation, not improve it. The Coverdell amendment would divert more than 80 percent of the funds currently directed to anti-smoking prevention and cessation programs. 
According to the analysis, the Coverdell-Craig amendment will slash, as I mentioned, funding for the smoking prevention programs by 82 percent over 5 years. This will be $13 billion, down to the $2.4 billion that will match reduction for these programs that have been demonstrated to be effective. We have gone through that in the course of the debate, including my own State of Massachusetts, California, and other various communities, and neighboring countries such as Canada. The list goes on. 
Effectively what we are saying is the Office of Management and Budget says this amendment would drain $10 billion from the $13 billion set aside by the bill each year for the antismoking programs. Effectively it guts the program. 
These anti-smoking initiatives are at the very heart of the legislation. If the Senate is serious about stopping children from beginning to smoke and saving lives from tobacco-induced diseases, we have to invest in these important public health measures. 
If the Coverdell amendment is enacted, there will be less funding for smoking cessation programs, for counter-advertising programs, and for school and community-based education initiatives, all of which have an excellent track record of preventing smoking by children and helping adults to stop smoking. 
Clearly, we need greater enforcement efforts to prevent the illegal sale of tobacco products to minors. Each year, American youths spend over $1 billion to purchase tobacco products, despite laws in all 50 states that prohibit underage sales. According to Professor Joseph DiFranza of the University of Massachusetts Medical Center, `if $1 billion in illegal sales were spread out evenly over an estimated 1 million tobacco retailers nationwide, it would indicate that the average tobacco retailer breaks the law about 500 times a year.' 
We shouldn't weaken these important law enforcement efforts by reducing their funding, when they could have such a significant effect in reducing teenage smoking. 
The federal government currently spends $520 million a year on tobacco control efforts. That sum is dwarfed by the amount spent to fight illegal drugs, which will total $16 billion this year--thirty times as much.  
Deaths caused by tobacco, 400,000; the amount that is actually spent on Federal spending, $520 million; deaths caused by substance and illegal drugs is 20,000. We spend close to $16 billion. Of course, we are all concerned about the problems of substance abuse. But we are talking about now dealing with the issue of tobacco because it is the gateway to the substance abuse problem that we are facing in this country. If we don't understand that interconnection, we don't really understand this problem in a very important way. 
This disparity is especially significant, since tobacco use causes 400,000 deaths a year, while illegal drugs are responsible for 20,000 deaths. 
Clearly, we can do more to reduce illegal drug use, but those efforts should not come at the expense of needed anti-smoking initiatives. President Clinton has already asked Congress to act this year on a $17 billion counter-drug budget--the largest anti-drug budget in our history. 
The National Drug Control Strategy increases funds for drug intervention programs for youth and for treatment programs. It adds 1,000 officers to the Border Patrol and 540 new DEA positions. Two hundred counter-narcotics agents will be assigned to initiatives to combat heroin and other drug smuggling. In fact, some of the components of the Coverdell amendment duplicate anti-drug strategies set in motion months ago. 
The Coverdell amendment contains another provision--private school vouchers--which are poison pills for the tobacco legislation. I strongly oppose these provisions, and the Senate should reject them. 
The private school voucher provisions are a blatant attempt to force the Republican anti-public school agenda on the tobacco bill. The Senate has already debated this issue at length earlier this year. We all know that it is a highly contentious issue. We should not revisit it in the context of the tobacco legislation, since private school vouchers are totally unrelated to reducing youth smoking. The only reason it was included in this amendment is to serve as an anchor to weigh down this important bill. 
Our goal is to improve the public schools, not abandon them. Instead of draining much-needed resources from public schools, we need to take steps to help all schools, not just a few schools--and to help all students, not just a few students. 
The Coverdell amendment would undermine these efforts by diverting federal funds to help private schools. 
Supporters of this legislation are certainly prepared to allocate part of the funds to the anti-drug measures in the Coverdell amendment, but it makes no sense to allocate the vast majority of the funds to those programs. 
It is time for Republicans in Congress to stop holding the tobacco bill hostage. We should free the prisoner, and do what's needed to reduce smoking. 
Cloture should be invoked now to prevent any more delaying tactics. I urge my colleagues to vote to end this pro-tobacco filibuster and pass this needed legislation. 
Mr. President, just to reiterate, we welcome the new voices that are speaking in terms of support for the substance abuse programs. We could have used both their voice and their vote in recent years when those programs were under attack and assault here in the appropriations committees as we were trying to deal with those issues. But now that we find new interest in these programs, we welcome their effort. But you can't get away from the fact that even in dealing with the illegal problems of substance abuse and illegal drugs that the gateway to all of this is tobacco. That is what we are focused on. That is the core issue. We take meaningful steps in terms of tobacco by discouraging young people from purchasing as a matter of price, and by taking the antismoking kinds of programs that have been included in this effort, we are going to have a meaningful impact on the number of young people that are going to smoke, and we are going to have a meaningful impact on the problem of substance abuse. 
Mr. President, I hope we can come back this afternoon and move towards cloture and get on with the business before the Senate. The American people have been listening to this debate for some 3 weeks. Families are entitled to have a vote to protect their children in this country. We ought to be able to take a stand. We should be willing to take such a stand and be held accountable for that. We will have the first opportunity to do so this afternoon. I hope all of our colleagues will give support for that program so we can move this legislation, so the House will move it, eventually the President will sign it, and we will make meaningful progress in reducing the problems of youth smoking in this country.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Frist on this important legislation, which is strongly supported by the Clinton Administration, patient groups, and the American Association of Blood Banks. 
The National Marrow Donor Program was established in 1986 to meet the need for a single large, nationwide registry of bone marrow donors. For those facing the diagnosis of leukemia or other life-threatening diseases, the registry can literally save their lives. 
Of particular importance is the need for identifying potential donors for African Americans, Asian/Pacific Islanders, Hispanics, and Native Americans, since each individual's likelihood of finding a matching donor, apart from family members, is higher in the individual's racial or ethnic group. By cooperation with international registries and targeted campaigns to increase the representation of minorities, the NMDP has made remarkable progress in improving the likelihood that patients of every racial and ethnic group can find suitable donors. 
Through skillful work and commitment, the NMDP has grown rapidly in recent years. It now maintains a registry of over three million volunteer bone marrow donors. The very important work of the registry must be continued. Its success in identifying matching donors and recipients is bringing the miracle of better health to families across the country. Congress has a responsibility to support this critical work. 
In fact, this reauthorization is long overdue, and I hope that Congress will act expeditiously so that the National Marrow Donor Program can continue its life-saving work.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senate debate on this landmark youth smoking reduction bill began more than two weeks ago. The time for debate on this legislation is rapidly drawing to a close. Each of us has had ample opportunity to state our views. The Senate should commit to a vote on final passage within a week. We owe it to our children who are being entrapped into a life of addiction and premature death by the tobacco industry every day. 
The opponents of this legislation have used every parliamentary tool at their disposal to extend the debate and to divert attention to unrelated issues. They want to talk about every subject but the impact of smoking on the nation's health. However, the real issue cannot be obscured by their verbal smokescreen. It is time for us to move from talking to voting. 
Each day that the opponents delay final Senate passage of this bill, 3,000 more children begin to smoke. A third of these children will die prematurely from lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease, or other smoking-caused illnesses. 
Each day that we delay, the price of a pack of cigarettes will continue to be affordable to the nation's children, and more and more of them will take up this deadly habit. 
Each day that we delay, Big Tobacco will continue to target children with billions of dollars in advertising and promotional giveaways that promise popularity, excitement, and success for young men and women who start smoking. 
Each day that we delay, millions of nonsmokers will be exposed to secondhand smoke. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, secondhand smoke causes 3,000 to 5,000 lung cancer deaths each year in the United States--more than all other regulated hazardous air pollutants combined. Secondhand smoke is also responsible for as many as 60 percent of cases of asthma, bronchitis, and wheezing among young children. 
Each day that we delay, tobacco will remain virtually the only product manufactured for human consumption that is not subject to Federal health and safety regulations, despite the fact that it causes over 400,000 deaths a year. In fact, Kraft Cheese is more heavily regulated than Marlboro cigarettes, although both are manufactured by Philip Morris. 
With so much at stake for so many of our children, it is truly irresponsible for the opponents of this legislation to practice the politics of obstruction. Let the Senate vote. 
There are two pending amendments before us today--the Gramm amendment on the marriage penalty and the Durbin-DeWine amendment on the youth smoking reduction lookback. I would like to address each of them in turn. 
The pending amendment by the Senator from Texas seeks to divert $52 billion over the next 5 years away from smoking prevention, away from smoking cessation, away from medical research, and away from reimbursing states. He proposes to take 80 percent of all the money raised by the cigarette price increase and use it for unrelated tax cuts. No funds would be left for programs which are essential to reducing youth smoking and to helping current smokers quit. 
By offering such an amendment, the Senator from Texas shows his true intent. It is he who wants to convert this legislation from a youth smoking prevention bill into a piggybank for unrelated projects. Although he has complained that the tobacco bill is a piggybank that Democrats are using to fund new programs, in fact it is the Gramm amendment which would hog 80 percent of the money taking resources which are needed to prevent young Americans from beginning to smoke and to help current smokers overcome their addiction. These numbers speak for themselves. This tax cut was not designed to help working families--it was intended to destroy the underlying smoking prevention legislation. 
The criticism of the Gramm amendment has been so strong and so widespread that even the sponsor has agreed to reduce the size of the proposed moneygrab. Under his new proposal, he only wants to take one-third of the revenue generated in the first 5 years and one-half of the money in succeeding years. That would amount to approximately $60 billion over a 10-year period. It would still cripple the smoking 
prevention and cessation efforts which are essential to effectively reducing youth smoking. 
All of the money raised by the cigarette price increase contained in the legislation is currently earmarked for smoking related purposes: 22 percent is directed to smoking prevention and cessation, 22 percent is to be used for medical research, 16 percent is for transitional assistance for tobacco farmers, and 40 percent is to compensate states for the cost of medical treatment of smoking related illnesses. There it is, Mr. President. 
Which of these smoking related initiatives would the Senator from Texas eliminate? Does he propose to eliminate all compensation to the States for their tobacco related health costs? After all, it was the State lawsuits which provided the genesis for this legislation and which exposed the most dramatic evidence of industry wrongdoing. That would not be fair. Even if every dollar intended for the States was taken to fund the Gramm amendment, it would not be enough to cover the cost. 
Does he propose to eliminate all transition assistance for tobacco farmers and communities? It would not even cover one-third of the cost of the Gramm amendment. 
All of the remaining dollars are directed to smoking prevention, to smoking cessation, and to medical research. These initiatives are the heart of the legislation. If we are serious about stopping children from smoking and saving lives from tobacco-induced diseases, we have to make these investments. Would the Senator from Texas propose that we take money from these programs and use it to fund an unrelated tax cut instead? How can we in good conscience raise the price of cigarettes and then refuse to fund programs which will address the evils of smoking? These programs work. Let me give you a few examples: 
Every dollar invested in a smoking cessation program for a pregnant woman saves $6 in costs for neonatal intensive care and long-term care for low-birthweight babies. The effect of the Gramm amendment would be to reduce funds for these programs, and that makes no sense. 
The Gramm amendment would take funds intended to assist states and communities to conduct educational programs on the health dangers of smoking. The tobacco industry spends $5 billion a year--$5 billion--on advertising to encourage young people to smoke. Shouldn't we spend at least one tenth of that amount to counteract the industry's lethal message? 
Counteradvertising is a key element of an effective tobacco control strategy. We know that if children are easily swayed by the tobacco industry's marketing campaigns, which promise popularity, excitement, and success for those who take up smoking, we can reverse the damage by deglamorizing the use of tobacco among children with counteradvertising. 
Both Massachusetts and California have demonstrated that paid counteradvertising can cut smoking rates. It helped reduce cigarette use in Massachusetts by 17 percent between 1992 and 1996, or three times the national average. Smoking by junior high students dropped 8 percent, while the rest of the nation has seen an increase. In California, a counteradvertising campaign also reduced smoking rates by 15 percent over the last 3 years. 
The Gramm amendment also would take money from law enforcement efforts to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors, even though young people currently spend $1 billion a year to buy tobacco products illegally. 
The Gramm amendment will diminish funding for medical research on tobacco-related diseases, which kill 400,000 Americans each year and incapacitates millions more. Given the damage that smoking inflicts on the nation's public health, it make little sense to divert tobacco revenues to tax cuts when they could be directed to finding a cure for cancer and other tobacco-induced illnesses. Since tobacco induced disease costs America $130 billion per year, it certainly is not cost effective to reduce research spending. 
In essence, the Gramm amendment would destroy much of the public health benefit this legislation is designed to achieve. It would be a tragic mistake. 
The goal of eliminating the marriage penalty for low and moderate income families is a worthy one. It is shared on both sides of the aisle. However, it must be accomplished in a way that does not imperil our primary goal--preventing youth smoking and helping smokers overcome their addiction. 
I anticipate that an alternative amendment will be offered which will provide relief from the marriage penalty without imperiling our smoking prevention efforts. It will cost far less than the Gramm 
amendment, and it will do a much better job of targeting tax relief to those most in need. 
That is the difference between preserving a viable youth smoking reduction effort and destroying it. That is the difference between helping millions of smokers quit and leaving them at the mercy of their addiction. That is the difference between advancing medical research that can cure tobacco induced diseases and indefinitely delaying it. 
The second issue I want to address is the Durbin-DeWine look-back amendment. It will assess increased sums for noncompliance with the youth smoking reduction targets. In addition, the emphasis will be shifted from industry-wide assessments to company-by-company assessments, in order to more effectively deter individual tobacco companies from marketing their products to children. 
Big Tobacco knows how to hook children into a lifetime of nicotine addiction and smoking-related illnesses--whether appealing through characters like Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man, through the prominent placement of tobacco advertising, or through a strategic cut in cigarette prices. And Big Tobacco also knows how to stop appealing to children. 
The purpose of the look-back is to give tobacco companies an overwhelming financial incentive to turn their focus away from the youth market. Our goal is to influence every business decision by taking the profit away from addicting teenagers. 
The Durbin-DeWine amendment will accomplish that goal much more effectively than the current look-back provisions in the manager's amendment. It will substantially increase the total amount of the surcharges which companies must pay if youth smoking levels do not decline in accordance with the reduction targets. It also shifts the payment obligations from a predominately industrywide system to a predominately company-specific system. This will dramatically increase the deterrent influence of the look-back on company policy. 
The current McCain provision provides for a maximum industrywide penalty of $4 billion, or about 20 cents a pack. The company-specific portion is extremely small, amounting to only a few pennies per pack. The Durbin-DeWine amendment provides for substantial company-specific penalties, which in the aggregate could reach $5 billion per year if companies continue to flaunt the law and blatantly target children. The amendment also provides for an industrywide surcharge of up to $2 billion a year. 
Through this important amendment we are speaking to the tobacco companies in the only language they understand--money. If they continue to target children, these companies will pay a financial price far in excess of the profits raised from addicting children. 
But if they are willing to cooperate in efforts to prevent teenage smoking, the companies may never have to pay a dollar of look-back surcharges. A strong, company-specific look-back, such as the one we are proposing, will give the tobacco companies a powerful financial incentive to use their skill in market manipulation to further, rather than undermine, the public interest in reducing youth smoking. 
Each tobacco company must be held accountable for its actions on teenage smoking. The stakes involved are nothing less than the health of the Nation's children. For each percentage point that the tobacco industry misses the target, 55,000 children will begin to smoke. One-third of these children will die prematurely from smoking-induced diseases. 
This bipartisan amendment deserves the support of the full Senate, and I urge my colleagues to adopt it. 
These two issues--the marriage penalty and the look-back--should be resolved quickly. Once they are decided, there is little excuse for further delay. The remaining amendments can be considered in a few days if we move conscientiously forward. There is no valid reason why the Senate cannot vote on final passage by the middle of next week. If we do not, the American people will know why. A small group of willful defenders of the tobacco industry will have succeeded in obstructing the work of the Senate on this vital issue of public health. On an issue of this importance, which is literally a matter of life and death, our constituents will not tolerate such obstruction. Now is the time for the Senate to act. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on May 29, during the Memorial Day recess last week, the Kennedy Library Foundation held its annual `Profile in Courage' Award Ceremony at the Kennedy Library in Boston. The 1998 Profile in Courage Award was presented to Nickolas C. Murnion, the County Attorney of Garfield County, Montana, for his courageous leadership in the confrontation earlier in this decade with the militia group called the Freemen. 
The Profile in Courage award takes its name from President Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize-winning book, `Profiles in Courage,' which my brother wrote in the 1950's, while he was still a Senator. The book told the stories of elected officials in American history who showed extraordinary political courage by doing what they thought was right, in spite of powerful resistance and opposition. 
Nick Murnion clearly demonstrated that quality of political courage, and he did so at great physical risk to himself as well. His small rural community in Montana came under siege, beginning in 1993, from the Freemen, a belligerent anti-government militia that took root in the area. The members of the Freemen refused to abide by local laws or pay taxes. They harassed and threatened public officials, and threatened the life of Nick Murnion and anyone else who challenged them. 
But Nick Murnion stood his ground, and armed with the rule of law and the strong support of other citizens in the community, he prevailed. Finally, in 1996, the FBI came to provide assistance, and after a dramatic 81-day siege, the militia members surrendered peacefully. 
Today, as the nation struggles to deal with extremist groups, hate crimes, church bombings, schoolyard shootings, and other distressing acts of violence in our society, Nick Murnion's inspiring story reminds us of leadership at its best in our democracy.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are now in what should be one of our most productive and thoughtful legislative periods this year. Many important items are pending before the Senate, and there is no reason to believe that we cannot successfully address each of them. We must act to protect the nation's children from tobacco, and we must move forward on appropriations and authorization bills. But, there are many other important measures waiting to be brought to the floor. Patients across the country are urging Congress to enact the `Patients' Bill of Rights.' I would like to take this opportunity to share with members of the Senate another tragic story that demonstrates the need for action. 
This is a story about Mrs. Peggy Earhart of Sun Valley, California. At the age of 63, she was being treated by her HMO for arthritis. Her treatment required her to visit her doctor every six to eight weeks for cortisone injections. During a period of treatment, she noticed a mole on her ankle. She brought this mole to her doctors' attention, but her doctor reassured her that it looked fine and she need not worry about it. 
Initially, she trusted her doctor's judgment. As the mole changed shape and color, she brought these changes to the attention of her doctor, who looked at the mole again and assured Mrs. Earhart that it was fine. On the next visit, Mrs. Earhart once again pointed out changes in size and color, and again, the doctor did nothing. 
Worried and exasperated, Mrs. Earhart requested a change of doctor. She filled out the necessary paperwork and waited--and waited, and waited. Six months later, the HMO finally responded, permitting her to see another physician. The first time she saw the new doctor, he examined the mole and immediately referred her to a dermatologist. The dermatologist took a biopsy and found that the `mole' was in fact a malignant melanoma. 
Further tests were ordered, which showed that the cancer had metastasized. It was then too late to treat Mrs. Earhart, and she died a year later. 
As this tragic story shows, the heart of the issue is providing patients with access to needed health care--a guarantee that patients shall receive the care they paid for with their hard-earned premiums. 
In talking about the rights of patients, it is no answer to simply say `Let the Patient Beware.' Purchasing health insurance is not like buying a car, and it never will be. 
Patients deserve to know that, if they notice something wrong and report it to their doctor, their health needs will be met. Mrs. Earhart should have been treated by the appropriate specialist, without the long delay that ultimately cost her life. 
Mrs. Earhart should have had access to an appropriate review procedure that would have allowed her to seek outside help in time. Her family should have been able to hold the health plan accountable for its actions, and for the inexcusable delay that took her life. 
The Patients' Bill of Rights provides these protections and more. The Senate should act on this bill as soon as possible. It has the strong support of more than 100 organizations, representing millions of patients, doctors, nurses, working families and consumers. Every day we delay, more tragedies like this take place. They shouldn't have to happen to any family, and they won't happen when this needed legislation is enacted into law.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from Massachusetts for initiating these responses to our colleague and friend from Texas giving the strong emphasis in terms of the real make-up of this legislation, because he, like I, believes the single purpose of this legislation should be to halt the young people in this country from starting smoking, and then also to do it by the best means that are available to us from a public health point of view; that as a result of a good deal of practical study, we know there are some measures that are effective and will work. We have seen the inclusion of those measures in the legislation. Some, I believe, should be strengthened. But the Senate has made a judgment on this. That was in the earlier debate about the increase in price to bring it up to the recommendations which have been made by our friends and colleagues in the public health community that universally, based upon their experience, believe that we should raise the price to $1.50 a pack and to do that in a more dramatic way than was included in the legislation that is before us; then also to have the effective programs in counteradvertising and the cessation programs; and strengthen the Food and Drug Administration with the help and assistance to programming in schools and local communities and many programs which have been touched on this afternoon included in the legislation. 
One of the ways that we have is a very important opportunity to also strengthen the general thrust of this legislation and make it more relevant to the reduction of teenage smoking is to provide the disincentives to the major tobacco companies for advertising and targeting the children in this country. 
I am always interested in listening to my friend and colleague from Texas crying crocodile tears for working families. We will have an opportunity to address those needs of working families as we have in the past in terms of their income, in terms of their health care, in terms of their safety on the job, and in a variety of terms for families with numbers of children, which he has always unfortunately voted in opposition to. 
But nonetheless part of the whole tragedy that we as a nation have experienced has been the viciousness of the tobacco industry in targeting the children of working families and of the neediest families in this country and those have been primarily the children of the minorities and working families in this country. 
All we have to do is look again at what has happened in the past years and see what the results of that targeting of more than $5 billion a year have been on the teenagers in this country. We find out the actual explosion in the use of tobacco by those who are black and non-Hispanic was some 80 percent over the period of the last 6 years, 34 percent by Hispanic, 28 percent by white and non-Hispanic, a general rise of some 32 percent. And that has been primarily the children of working families. 
To suggest out on the floor of the Senate that somehow the primary concern of these workers is going to be the cost of the pack of cigarettes over the interest of having their children stop smoking I think is a real failure to understand what is happening out among working families in this country. To think that they are more concerned about the increase in the cost than they are about making sure that their children are not going to get cancer in the community or that they are going to be free from these absolutely devastating health impacts which, by starting smoking at an early age or any age, are going to occur I think really fails to consider what is happening out among working families in this country and also what this legislation is attempting to do. 
I want to speak just briefly this afternoon on the Durbin-DeWine provision because I do think it has a very important impact in terms of discouraging the major tobacco companies from the targeting of children. Once again, we are primarily concerned with the targeting of children--the significant and dramatic increase in costs which discourage children, the preventive programs that are included in this legislation devised to discourage children, and to help and assist those children who develop the addiction to free themselves from that addiction, resources available to help communities to free themselves from this targeting of children. And now this very important and significant amendment that is before the Senate, which it will hopefully adopt, that reflects a bipartisan approach, I think is one of the major kinds of improvements and strengthening amendments that can be achieved. 
Now, Madam President, the amendment which is before the Senate will assess increased sums for noncompliance with the youth reduction smoking targets. In addition, the emphasis will be shifted from the industry-wide assessments to the company-by-company assessments in order to more effectively deter the individual tobacco companies from marketing their products to children. 
For years, big tobacco has appealed to children through its advertising and promotional campaigns. Before tobacco advertising was banned from television in 1970, cigarette advertising included cartoon characters Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble promoting Winston cigarettes from their Bedrock neighborhood. 
So the tobacco companies have been targeting kids as young as 12, because they know once the children are hooked on cigarettes, they become customers for life. Prior to the introduction of the Joe Camel advertising campaign, fewer than one-half of 1 percent of youth smokers chose Camel. After a few years of intensive Joe Camel advertising, the Camel share of the youth market rose to 33 percent. 
The tobacco company pricing decisions also have a dramatic impact on the level of youth smoking. When Philip Morris made a decision to dramatically cut the prices of Marlboro Friday and 
other companies followed its lead, the industry precipitated a substantial increase in youth smoking. The historical record is irrefutable. The tobacco industry, through its marketing and pricing decisions, has an enormous impact on the level of youth smoking. 
Madam President, we see in this chart exactly what happened with Marlboro Friday. This chart, as we have seen in the course of the debate, is so compelling, so convincing, so overwhelming in its conclusion that as the price of cigarettes goes up, teenage smoking has gone down. The dramatic increase in the price in the 1980s we demonstrated last week to show the sharp decline in youth smoking. And then we presented what we call Marlboro Friday, where we showed the significant reduction in the real price and then the dramatic spike up in the consumption of youth smoking that we have seen over the period of time. 
The fact is that as they have maintained their price, this number of young people going up to 32, 33 percent a year is reflected with the dramatic increase in advertising. Take price and advertising, and you can tell the story in terms of teenage smoking. And so we know advertising is a key element in this whole debate as well. Price is a key element in this debate. 
The Senate has gone on record now that it is holding at the $1.10 price. I still believe that a significant increase in price would have a much more dramatic effect. The public health community believes that as well. The Senate has made that decision on price. But we have now the opportunity to make a decision on another feature of youth smoking, and that is on the degree of advertising that the tobacco industry is going to involve itself in in order to continue to hook children in this country. And that is what this amendment is really all about. It is going to say to the tobacco industry: All right, we are passing this legislation. If you are going to continue to rifle-shot children, if you are going to continue to rifle-shot the children of working families, of minorities, and they are going to exceed a certain standard, you are going to end up paying an additional penalty for that. If you are going to make the effort, that you have stated that you will make, to try not to target children in this country, then you will not have the additional penalty. 
That is really what this amendment is all about. What the amendment from Senator Durbin and Senator DeWine does is to make sure there is going to be compliance. I think all of us understand that a right around here is not very effective unless you are going to have an enforcement mechanism for that right. 
What we are basically saying is, if the tobacco industry is going to live up to its commitment and not target children, all fine and well; but if they are not, they are going to find a penalty. It is as simple as that. If they are going to stand by their word, they have nothing to fear from this amendment. 
Given what we have heard from our good friend from Texas, it is going to be interesting to see how he will vote on this amendment. I wish he had had an opportunity to address it a bit this afternoon and indicated support, because I think it would help to establish a good deal of credibility to the other aspects of his argument. 
So, Madam President, as we have seen, in fact, 90 percent of current adult smokers began to smoke before they reached the age of 18. If young men and women reach that age without beginning to smoke, it is very unlikely they will ever take up the habit in later years. And so the industry has conducted its advertising accordingly. For at least a generation, big tobacco has targeted children with billions of dollars in advertising and promotional giveaways that promise popularity, maturity, and success for those who begin this deadly habit. 
In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have found that the average 14-year-old is exposed to $20 billion in tobacco advertising--$20 billion--at the age of 6--beginning at the age of 6. We wonder why children as young as 12 years old, 14 years old, 16 years old--62 percent of those who have started by the time they are 16 years old have been subject to these billions of dollars of advertising, starting at the age of 6. 
We are saying now, OK, if you are not going to target the children, you have nothing to worry about. But if you are and your brands are going to be accepted and taken and paid for, even with this increase, you are going to pay a price at the back end. That sounds pretty fair to me. It is just holding them at their word. 
It is no coincidence that the three most heavily advertised brands are preferred by 80 percent of children: Marlboro, Camel and Newport--the three most heavily advertised, the three most heavily used. So, once again, we know what is going to happen, I believe, unless we have the Durbin-DeWine amendment. 
A study published in the February 8, 1998, Journal of the American Medical Association also reported a correlation between the cigarette advertising and youth smoking. It analyzed tobacco advertising in 34 popular U.S. magazines and found that as youth readership increased, the likelihood of youth-targeted advertising increased as well. So these weekly--daily surveys that are taking place by the tobacco industry to find out what children are reading in magazines are then sent on back to the advertisers of the major tobacco industry. And, sure enough, up they come with that appealing kind of advertising to hook those children into addiction. That is happening. 
That is the issue we are attempting to address in this legislation. We deal with it on some of the restrictions, in terms of advertising, that have been constitutionally upheld in the Baltimore decision, some of the protections that are there, provided under the FDA, but there is an opportunity for us to go far beyond that with this legislation, and that is what we are doing. 
Two recently disclosed industry documents reveal that big tobacco has a deliberate strategy to market its products to youth. In a 1981 Philip Morris memo entitled `Young Smokers--Prevalence, Implications, and Related Demographic Trends,' the author wrote that:  
It is important to know as much as possible about teenage smoking patterns and attitudes. Today's teenager is tomorrow's regular customer, and the overwhelming majority of smokers first begin to smoke while still in their teens. . .. 
Because of our high share of the market among the youngest smokers, Philip Morris will suffer more than other companies from the decline in the number of teenage smokers. 
There is the cigarette company looking at the teenager, not as a teenager but as part of the profit in the years ahead, over a lifetime--a shorter life, albeit--but over a lifetime of smoking. 
A 1976 R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company memorandum stated that: 
Young people will continue to become smokers at or above the present rates during the projection period. The brands which these beginning smokers accept and use will become the dominant brands in future years. Evidence is now available to indicate that the 14 to 18 year old group is an increasing segment of the smoking population. [RJR-T] must soon establish a successful new brand in this market if our position in the industry is to be maintained over the long-term. 
We cannot have it any clearer--that this is the group that is being targeted. We know they have done so. We know that is how they have increased their market. They have indicated they will not do so in the future. We are saying: If you are not going to do so in the future, you have nothing to 
fear from this amendment. But we are going to recognize what your track record has been over the historic past, and how you have targeted youth, and we are going to say the least you are going to do is to pay an important penalty if you are going to violate your commitment. That is what this Durbin-DeWine amendment will accomplish. It will accomplish that goal much more effectively than the current look-back provisions in the managers' amendment. It will substantially increase the total amount of the surcharges which companies must pay if smoking levels do not decline in accordance with the reduction targets. It also shifts the payment obligations from a predominantly industry-wide system to a predominantly company-specific system. This will dramatically increase the deterrent influence of the look-back on company policy. 
In this chart, you see what the relative effect would be with regard to the `real incentives' surcharge in the millions under the current McCain legislation and what would happen with regard to the Durbin-DeWine program. Here we find, with regard to the industry-specific, how much more effective this amendment would be in targeting those who really have abused the system most in the past, and to make sure that is not going to happen, to protect our children in the future. 
The current McCain provisions provide for a maximum industry-wide penalty of $4 billion, or about 20 cents a pack. The company-specific portion is extremely small, amounting to only a few pennies per pack. The Durbin-DeWine amendment provides for substantial company-specific penalties which, in the aggregate, could reach $5 billion per year if the companies continue to flout the law and blatantly target children. The amendment also provides for an industry-wide surcharge of up to $2 billion a year. 
Through this important amendment we are speaking to the tobacco companies in the only language they understand--money. If they are going to continue to target children, these companies will pay a financial price far in excess of the profits raised from addicting children. 
But, if they are willing to cooperate in efforts to prevent teenage smoking, the companies may never have to pay a dollar in look-back surcharges. A strong company-specific look-back, such as the one we are proposing, will give the tobacco companies a powerful financial incentive to use their skill in market manipulation to further rather than undermine the public interest in reducing youth smoking. Each tobacco company must be held accountable for its actions on teenage smoking. The stakes involved are nothing less than the health of the Nation's children. For each percentage point that the tobacco industry misses the target, 55,000 children will begin to smoke. One-third of these children will die prematurely from smoking-induced diseases. We are talking about the difference of hundreds of thousands of children between the two approaches that are before the Senate now--one under the proposed legislation and one under the Durbin-DeWine proposal. This, I believe, is just absolutely an essential amendment that will really strengthen the legislation to carry forward its very sound and important public health provisions to protect America's children. 
Finally, I did want to also mention briefly the very substantial provisions, as my friend and colleague, Senator Kerry, pointed out before, with regard to the preventive aspects of this legislation, the very important smoking cessation programs, the prevention programs in school and the prevention programs in communities. We have a number of teenage volunteers in our State, down in New Bedford, MA, and in classrooms around our Commonwealth now, who are going out to various shopping malls to get the owners of the various shopping malls and the various shops to make these shopping malls smoke free. These are young people. These are teenagers who we are asking to participate, to make a difference in their communities, and they are prepared to do so. 
Counteradvertising--we have seen, even in a State like our own State of Massachusetts, where the tobacco industry was spending 10 times as much as counteradvertising, still, the counteradvertising, talking about the importance of the health implications and the dangers of smoking, had a very important and significant impact in reducing the incidence of addiction--very, very important. 
The medical research into addiction prevention and cure--as someone who sits on the Health Committee, I know the work that is being done, in terms of addiction and substance abuse and also in nicotine. We know--we have been listening--about how we ought to be concerned about the problems of substance abuse as well. We are concerned about the problems of substance abuse. 
There are two gateway drugs and smoking is No. 1. The second one is drinking beer. This is a gateway drug. When I listen to our friends who have indicated opposition to this legislation say this isn't the problem that we ought to be dealing with, substance abuse, if you talk to anyone who has seriously worked on the problems of addiction and substance abuse, they will tell you that nicotine is right out there with any of the other kind of addictions that are afflicting the young children in this country, and we can do something about it. 
The various medical research into the tobacco-related diseases, and there are many--emphysema and the whole complexities in terms of the lungs--there are many, we have resources to try and deal with those issues as well. 
Madam President, I see my friend and colleague from Ohio on the floor. I pay tribute to him for his leadership on this amendment. I commend him for his work in this area. He has been an important leader in protecting the interests of children in our country and society on many different matters. It is just a pleasure to join with him, and I urge the Senate to accept his wisdom and judgment about public policy on this issue.  
Mr. DeWINE addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this opportunity to recognize the extraordinary leadership of the President of the Fraternal Order of Police in Massachusetts, Officer Elizabeth Gianetti. 
Officer Gianetti has achieved many `firsts' in her outstanding career. She is the first person to hold this position. She was instrumental in its creation in 1993, when the 4,000 law enforcement officers of Massachusetts decided that they needed a statewide organization to represent their concerns. And once the Massachusetts State F.O.P was established, Officer Gianetti was overwhelmingly elected its first president by the local F.O.P. lodges across the state. 
She is also the first woman in the 83-year history of the national Fraternal Order of Police to head a state F.O.P. chapter. 
Officer Gianetti comes to this position with an impressive record of achievements in law enforcement and service to the community. 
She has been a Boston School Police Officer for more than 10 years. In that capacity she has been actively involved in the community, and especially active in working with children through such programs as Boston Medical Center's Children With AIDS Foundation. She has brought her enthusiasm for working with children to her position as state F.O.P. president. This summer, for example, she will coordinate a safety day with the goal of educating children and parents about keeping children safe, including the distribution of bicycle helmets to help prevent accidents and injuries. 
Elizabeth Gianetti's initiatives with the state Fraternal Order of Police and her work for the people of Massachusetts are truly remarkable. We are proud of her accomplishments, and I know that all Senators join me in commending her fine record of public service.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in congratulating the people of the Republic of Georgia on the 80th anniversary of their independence. 
Eighty years ago on May 26, 1918, following the collapse of the Russian Empire, the people of Georgia gained their independence and established their own government. Tragically, Georgia's independence was short-lived. In March 1921, the Soviet Army reoccupied Georgia, beginning decades of further occupation, domination and repression. 
Despite this persecution by the Soviet leadership, the spirit of the Georgian people could not be defeated. Throughout almost seventy years of Soviet rule, the people of Georgia never lost sight of their goal to be free from outside domination and influence. 
Finally, in 1991, following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the people of Georgia were again able to realize their dream of independence, and their nation now enjoys a bright future. The election of President Eduard Shevardnadze and the election of a Parliament committed to legal reform in 1995 have encouraged economic growth and reforms in human rights. 
Today, as we celebrate this 80th anniversary of Georgia's independence, we also honor and commend the Georgian people for their courage and commitment in achieving their dream of a nation free again at last and committed to the principles of democracy.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues, Senator Enzi, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Bingaman, in introducing the Postal Employees Safety Enhancement Act. This important legislation will extend coverage of the Occupational Safety and Health Act to employees of the United States Postal Service. 
Few issues are more important to working families than health and safety on the job. For the past 28 years, OSHA has performed a critical role--protecting American workers from on-the-job injuries and illnesses. 
In carrying out this mission, OSHA has made an extraordinary difference in people's lives. Death rates from on-the-job accidents have dropped by over 60% since 1970--much faster than before the law was enacted. More than 140,000 lives have been saved. 
Occupational illnesses and injuries have dropped by one-third since OSHA's enactment--to a record low rate of 7.4 per 100 workers in 1996. 
These numbers are still unacceptably high, but they demonstrate that OSHA is a success by any reasonable measure. 
Even more lives have been saved in the two places where OSHA has concentrated its efforts. Death rates have fallen by 61% in construction and 67% in manufacturing. Injury rates have dropped by half in construction, and nearly one-third in manufacturing. Clearly, OSHA works best where it works hardest. 
Unfortunately, these efforts do not apply to federal agencies. The original OSHA statute required only that federal agencies provide `safe and healthful places and conditions of employment' to their employees. Specific OSHA safety and health rules did not apply. 
In 1980, President Carter issued an Executive Order that solved this problem in part. It directed federal agencies to comply with all OSHA safety standards, and it authorized OSHA to inspect workplaces and issue citations for violations. 
President Carter's action was an important step, but more needs to be done. When OSHA inspects a federal workplace and finds a safety violation, OSHA can direct the agency to eliminate the hazard. But OSHA has no authority to seek enforcement of its order in court, and it cannot assess a financial penalty on the agency to obtain compliance. 
The situation is especially serious in the Postal Service. Postal employees suffer one of the highest injury rates in the federal government. In 1996 alone, 78,761 postal employees were injured on the job--more than nine injuries and illnesses for every hundred workers. This rate is 23% higher than the overall private sector rate, and 40% higher than the overall federal rate. Fourteen postal employees were killed on the job in 1996--one-sixth of the federal total. Workers' compensation charges at the Postal Service are also high--$538 million in 1997. 
This legislation will bring down these unacceptably high rates. It permits OSHA to issue citations for safety hazards, and back them up with penalties. This credible enforcement threat will encourage the Postal Service to comply with the law. It will save taxpayer dollars currently spent on worker's compensation costs. 
Most important, it will reduce the extraordinarily high rate of injuries among postal employees. Every worker deserves a safe and healthy place to work, and this bill will help achieve that goal for the 860,000 employees of the Postal Service. They deserve it, and I urge my colleagues to provide it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Gregg-Leahy amendment raises very fundamental questions: 
Why would we consider giving a group of the worst corporate villains in America special protection? 
Why would we want to make it more difficult for those who have been injured by the tobacco industry's wrongdoing to collect damages? 
Why should Congress impose a liability cap which will have the effect of redirecting dollars away from smoking victims and into industry coffers? 
I have heard no convincing answers to these questions from the bill's proponents. 
More than one year ago, when news of the settlement negotiations between the state attorneys general and the tobacco industry first became public, I expressed my opposition to restricting the liability of tobacco companies. On April 25, 1997, I came to this floor and spoke out against giving the tobacco industry any special protection: 
It would be unconscionable to deny people poisoned by tobacco their day in court. Each year, millions of Americans learn that they have a disease caused by smoking. In too many cases, it is beyond our power to restore their health. We must never permit the tobacco industry to extinguish their right to justice as well. 
We have come a long way in the last year. The deal with the industry that was announced on June 20th would have given tobacco companies de facto immunity from suit. In fact, its provisions were designed by the industry to erect enormous barriers in the path of smoking victims seeking compensation. It would have banned all class action suits, which are often the only effective way individuals can litigate against corporate giants. In fact, it prohibited any aggregation of claims. It would have also banned all punitive damages. If ever we have seen an industry against which punitive damages are warranted, it is the tobacco industry. It would have prohibited all litigation by health insurers, such as Blue Cross and Employee Health and Welfare Funds, which incur enormous costs treating tobacco induced illnesses. It would have prevented the introduction of crucial evidence by tobacco victims suing the industry. It would have given absolute immunity to the parent companies of cigarette manufacturers even though those companies are where most of the profits go and the real decisions are made. It would have extinguished all future governmental suits against the industry. And, it would have imposed an annual ceiling on the liability of the tobacco industry. It was truly a draconian litany. 
Fortunately, these liability restrictions were so extreme that they produced a great public outcry. Public health experts and victims' rights advocates expressed their outrage at this enormous injustice. 
During the past year, there has truly been a national awakening on this issue. The American people focused on what the tobacco industry has done as never before. The dramatic revelations of corporate misconduct which have emerged from the industry's own files have truly shocked the national conscience. The harshest indictments of the tobacco companies are written in their won words, long kept secret, but now revealed for all to hear. From a 1981 Phillip Morris strategic planning document: 
Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer, and the overwhelming majority of smokers first begin to smoke while still in their teens . . . Because of our high share of the market among the youngest smokers, Phillip Morris will suffer more than the other companies from the decline in the number of teenage smokers 
From an R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company document entitled `Planning Assumptions for the Period 1978 to 1987'. 
Evidence is now available to indicate that the 14 to 18 year old group is an increasing segment of the smoking population. RJR-T must soon establish a successful new brand in this market if our position in the industry is to be maintained over the long term. 
Company records also detail elaborate efforts to chemically treat the nicotine in cigarettes to make it even more addictive than it naturally would be. All the while, these same companies were telling the American people that smoking is just a matter of free choice. 
All of the special industry protections contained in the settlement were included in the Commerce Committee bill when it was first introduced. To the Committee's credit, in the final days before the markup, the prohibitions on class actions and punitive damages were removed. In the negotiations which produced the Manager's Amendment, the provisions granting immunity to corporate parents and affiliates was finally deleted and many of the evidentiary restrictions were removed. It is now time for the Senate to strip this legislation of the remaining vestiges of these special protections for Big Tobacco. While the remaining special protections may be less extreme, the principle is the same. This industry should not in any way be shielded from the long overdue rendezvous with accountability which awaits it in courthouses across America. 
Title XIV of the Manager's Amendment provides the industry with an $8 billion per year liability cap limiting the companies financial exposure for both past and future misconduct. I object to any special protection for the industry. I believe the tobacco industry is not entitled to any liability cap. But, I especially object to this particular cap which applies to liability for future as well as past wrongdoing. One of the most important purposes of the civil law is to deter misconduct. 
Capping liability for future wrongdoing reduces that deterrent and encourages tobacco companies to continue their misconduct. This industry of all industries, based upon its unparalleled record of corporate irresponsibility, should be subject to tougher standards, certainly not more lenient standards, than other companies. Yet, a more lenient standard is exactly what Title XIV will provide for the tobacco industry. 
Consider the significance of the protection which a liability cap will give the tobacco companies. It provides them with an absolute ceiling on the amount of money they will have to spend each year to compensate their victims. This industry which conspired for decades to conceal the enormous health damages inherent in smoking. This industry which manipulated the nicotine in its products to make them even more addictive. This industry which targeted generations of our children for a lifetime of addiction and early death. There can be no justification for sheltering this industry from the legitimate claims of those who have been injured by its deadly product. 
To the extent that the proposed liability ceiling is ever reached, it will have the effect of transferring dollars which rightfully belong to victims into the industry's corporate coffers. We are giving preference to CEOs and shareholders above the victims of tobacco induced illness. That cannot be justified. It is ironic to hear some proponents argue that the ceiling is so high it will never be reached. If that is true, it is unnecessary. If it is reached, it will inflict a second injury on those already injured by this industry's gross misconduct. 
There is another serious problem created by the current Title XIV. The language it uses to settle the state cases is far too broad. It does for more than resolve current claims arising from state expenditures for the treatment of citizens suffering from tobacco induced illness. As written, it could prohibit state and local government from bringing future actions to enforce public health standards and consumer protection laws. It could prevent state and local government from effectively policing future tobacco industry conduct. If this provision is not revised, it will tie the hands of state and local government, and allow the tobacco industry to escape effective regulation. 
The Gregg-Leahy amendment will remove all of these special limits on industry liability from pending legislation. Congress does not need the consent of the tobacco industry to legislate meaningful protection for America's children. Our sole concern must be what the public health requires, not what the industry desires. The deal with the industry which Title XIV contemplates would set an appalling precedent. It will undermine the moral authority of the federal government as protector of the public health. Today the Senate should declare that it will not allow the tobacco industry to escape its long overdue rendezvous with accountability. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to thank my friend and colleague from Minnesota for his excellent presentation and his compelling arguments and for the persuasiveness of his argument. 
The fact of the matter is on this issue the American people are on our side. The question is going to be in the next hour and a half or 2 hours whether the Members of this body are going to be on the side of the children of this Nation and on the side of the parents of this Nation in taking the kind of important steps that are recommended virtually by every public health official that has studied this issue over a long period of time. We have placed in the Record the various studies and the various support material. 
The fact of the matter is, although there is some progress that will be made under the proposal that is before the Senate, what will happen if there is no change at all, if there is no change at all, is that we obviously will not see any reduction in youth smoking. With the proposal that is before the U.S. Senate now, we will see a 34-percent reduction in youth smoking as a result of the increase in the cost of cigarettes. With the $1.50 increase, a 56 reduction. The attorneys general established as a goal a 60-percent reduction. The Commerce Committee established as a goal a 60-percent reduction. Our particular proposal will go to 56 percent and with the kind of look-back provisions we will obviously be able to achieve this goal. That is what this issue is about. 
We will have the opportunity, as the Senator from Minnesota has stated, to save 750,000 American children from smoking, and we will have the opportunity to save some 250,000 to 300,000 lives of children. This is the most important public health issue. 
It is important for us to look at what is happening to the young children of this country over the period of the last 5 years. Look what has happened since 1991, 1993, 1995, 1997. Over this period of time, we have seen the absolute explosion in the utilization of cigarettes by young people in this country. The target of the tobacco industry, as demonstrated by their own material, has been with the youth of this country, and particularly with the minorities of this Nation. All you have to do is look at these statistics from 1991 through 1997. There is an 80-percent increase in black and non-Hispanic use of cigarettes, 80-percent increase. This is what is happening in the United States of America. Among Hispanics, it has gone up 
some 34 percent over the period of these past 6 years. Among white, non-Hispanic young people in our country, some 28 percent. This is an average rise, since 1997, of 32 percent--32-percent increase. 
What all of that means in terms of addiction, what all of that means in terms of the dangers with substance abuse, this is a gateway drug. Members of the Senate are talking about doing something about substance abuse. You have a chance to do it in an hour and a half by doing something about curtailing the use by our teenagers of these cigarettes. This is a national tragedy. We have an opportunity in an hour and a half to do something about it. 
You can have the various questions whether it really makes much of a difference if we move ahead with an increase in price or does it really make very much difference in terms of the young people of this country. Let's take a look at what the record has been from 1980 to the present time on the issues of price and the issues of teen smoking. 
We can have study after study after study, but, Mr. President, for those opposed to this amendment, I hope they would be able to refute what this chart demonstrates, and demonstrates very convincingly. Here we have in the early 1980s and 1982, we have a sharp increase in the costs, the real price of cigarettes, and a sharp decline, considerable sharp decline in teenagers smoking. This is what Philip Morris said about that, and we are not talking about an academic study. We are not talking about medical economists. We are not talking about Members of the Congress and the Senate who just want to see an decrease in smoking because we somehow think there might be some reduction in teenagers smoking. 
This is what the industry said in the Philip Morris memo from 1987 that was in the Minnesota trial: `The 1982, 1983 round of price increases prevented 500,000 from starting to smoke'--that is indicated in this line here--`500,000 teenagers from starting to smoke. This means 420,000 of the nonstarters would have been Philip Morris smokers. We were hit hard. We don't need that to happen again.' 
`We don't need that to happen again.' 
No wonder out in the waiting room, in the reception room, I can't get in there because of the tobacco lobbyists--high-priced tobacco lobbyists. They don't want this to happen again. And it can happen. It can happen. It can happen in an hour and a half from now if the Members of this body are going to put the public health first in this debate on the issue that we have at hand. 
Here the chart shows the increase in the price and the reaction as a result of the statistic--the reduction in teenage smoking--and the tobacco industry acknowledging the relationship. So we have, as we went through the period of the 1980s, the increase in the real price, and we saw a rather significant increase in the real price going up during this period of time, and we see the corresponding reduction in terms of the teenage smoking. Until when? Until when? Until 1991. Then what happened to the real price? The real price went down and the real price went down on what they call Marlboro Friday, when the Nation's largest tobacco company, Philip Morris, fired the newest salvo which reversed the decade-long use in smoking. They slashed 40 cents off the brand of Marlboros, the most popular brand among children. The strategy was designed to protect prices. If Philip Morris reduced prices by 50 percent in Massachusetts, and a month later, R.J. Reynolds--the second largest tobacco company, which manufactures Camels--had a corresponding reduction. 
So we have the major tobacco companies going down, the major price going down. Look on this chart what has happened in terms of youth smoking, escalating, going up dramatically. Price decline, youth smoking increases; price increase, youth smoking goes down. We have seen that continue over a long period of time. 
We could say what happened in here over the period for the last year or two, we have seen little blips going up, 10 cents, to cover the costs of various settlements they have had, an increase of 35 percent. It would not really reflect on this chart. 
Now what we have seen in here is $5 billion in tobacco industry advertising, an explosion in advertising. It makes our case, Mr. President. 
It makes our case for the proposal that we have at hand. Increase the cost and the price of cigarettes, do it in a significant time with a shock treatment of 3 years. The way that we saw it this time, it is going to have a dramatic impact on young people. Increase the antitobacco advertising, which is in this bill; develop the cessation programs, which are in this bill; strengthen the look-back provisions, which are in this bill; do the kind of prohibition on advertising that is in this bill, and you have the combination of elements that will work to bring a significant reduction in teenage smoking--a significant reduction in teenage smoking. 
Mr. President, we must have learned from the past. We have a pathway here that is outlined by the history of this industry, and the things that have been effective--not just studies, not just testimony, not just surmise, but real facts, Mr. President. Over that long period of time, we have the incontrovertible case that has been made here yesterday, last night, and this morning, again, that cannot be answered. We will hear answers like, oh, well, we will develop a smuggling industry; we can't do this because we don't know where the money is going to be expended; we can't do this because we will have this or that kind of a problem. 
There is an issue before the Senate: Can we do something with regard to seeing a significant, dramatic reduction in terms of teenage smoking? The answer to that is, yes, by supporting our amendment that virtually every public health official in this country supports--not only Dr. Koop, not only Dr. Kessler, but the Cancer Society, the Lung Society, and every public health group across the Nation, Republican and Democrat alike. That is the issue that we have. Now is the time to make that judgment. We will have the opportunity to do that in a short period of time. 
Mr. President, I see others who want to address the Senate. I yield at this time.

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 7 1/2 minutes, if I could, please. 
Madam President, I, first of all, thank our leader, Senator Daschle, who has been a strong supporter of this particular amendment, a strong defender of the health of the young people of this country and their families, and my colleagues who have all spoken here, and spoken very eloquently and compellingly. 
I thank my friend from Massachusetts, our floor manager, John Kerry, Kent Conrad, the chairman of our task force, and Frank Lautenberg, who is one of the great leaders on the issue of tobacco. 
I am enormously grateful for Senator Durbin's comments as a leader not only in the Senate now but also in the House of Representatives. And the eloquence of Bob Graham earlier today and the compelling arguments that he made, I thought, were enormously convincing. 
Jack Reed of Rhode Island has been a strong member of our task force and a strong defender of public health. 
Tom Harkin, who has been in and out and has spoken frequently on this issue at different times, and many others, I can go down the list of so many in our caucus. I also thank our friend and colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, for his very strong support on this issue. I commend him for making his statement. He is someone who has been strongly committed to children on different health matters over the years. I thank him for his leadership, and I thank others of our Republican friends who voted for this in the Budget Committee, as well as in the Finance Committee. 
We are very hopeful that in just about 20 minutes or so, when the roll is called, that a majority of the Members on both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats alike, are going to vote with the American people, with the families of America and for the children of America. 
There will not be a single vote in the U.S. Senate this year that will be more important to 275,000 children than the vote that we are going to have 20 minutes from now. We have the opportunity to make a major difference, a lifesaving difference for those 275,000 children. 
The overwhelming, uncontroverted evidence that has been demonstrated during the afternoon of yesterday, last night and in the course of today is the fact that this kind of amendment that we are offering today that will have bipartisan support can make the greatest difference in the public health of the people of this Nation than any other action that we will take in the course of this year. That is a fact, Madam President. It is the most important vote that we will have this year on public health for the families of this country, and we will have it in just a few moments. 
We don't have to go over the facts. We know what will happen if this amendment is successful. More than 750,000 young people will not involve themselves in smoking; 250,000 will not develop cancer of the lungs; 250,000 will not develop heart disease because of smoking; 250,000 of them will not develop emphysema, and the list goes on with diseases that result from smoking in this country. 
Who are we talking about? We talk about children in this country, but let's be very clear about who those children are. We are talking about children who are as young as 12 years of age. Sixteen percent get started at 12 years of age; 37 percent are 14 and younger; 62 percent are 16 years of age and younger. 
These are the individuals who are targeted by the tobacco industry. I listened to those crocodile tears of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle about how distressed they are about what is happening to working families. I give them reassurance, they will have a nice chance to vote for an increase in the minimum wage later on, and we will see how distressed they are about all those working families that they 
are agonizing about and so distressed about because this is a regressive tax. 
The reason it is a regressive tax is because it is the tobacco industry that has targeted the needy and the poor and the working families of this country. It is the tobacco industry that is to blame. It isn't these families. How elite and arrogant it is for those on the other side of the aisle to cry these crocodile tears for working families and their children who are going to get cancer and they don't want to pay those taxes. Those working families care about their children. They care about them no less than those who come from a different socioeconomic background. How arrogant can you be? How insulting can you be to make that argument on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
Finally, Madam President, there can be no argument about what has happened over recent times, the explosion--the explosion--of use of tobacco by teenagers. It is a national disgrace. It is a national disgrace, and we are faced with these facts. 
You can talk about smuggling all you want. You can talk about it all you want. These are the facts. This is the issue. Public health is the issue, the fact that it is an 80-percent increase among the black youths in this country, 35 percent by Hispanic youths, 28 percent of the white youths of this country, 32 percent year after year after year after year because of the policies of the tobacco industry. And we can do something about it on the floor of the U.S. Senate. The question is, Will we do so? 
The question comes back, If we have to defend ourselves again, all you have to do is--there is one simple chart. We all had our statements and our charts. This one says it all. What this chart says very simply and is expressed very clearly by Philip Morris in a memo of 1987--listen to this: 
The 1982-1983 round of price increases prevented 500,000 teenagers from starting to smoke. This means that 420,000 of the nonstarters would have been Philip Morris smokers. We were hit hard. We don't need that to happen again. 
There it is on the chart. There it is in 1982. This is the spike in the increase of price, and that is the drop in terms of teenage smoking.

Mr. KENNEDY. I will take 1 more minute. 
I say this is demonstrated right here as clear as can be. What we have seen is, as the price has gone up over a period of years, teenage smoking has gone down, except in 1982 when we had the wars, then we had the drop, and we see that incredible spike and the leveling years with $5 billion a year in tobacco advertising, getting those children, holding those children, addicting those children in this country. 
Madam President, now is the time. Now is the time to speak up for the children of this country. Now is the time to speak out about public health. We have not heard all morning long, all last night, all yesterday, we have not heard the opposition give the name of one notable, credible public health official who denies what we have stated hour after hour about the dangers for the children of this country--not one. They can't answer it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to express my appreciation to the Senator from Arizona, who, as I understand, was trying to work out a decent process so that we might debate this during the course of the evening, and then at least work out some process where we could have a fair allocation of balance in terms of time as we debated it tomorrow. I hope those who support that position would, if we don't get a formal agreement, at least follow that process tonight and also in the morning. Then the leaders and those who are interested in either extending debate, or amendment, or whatever they want to, will proceed and will obviously have the right to do it. 
I want to thank the Senator from Arizona, who was trying in his conversations with us to work out a process so there could be an adequate time for debate and discussion, and also balance in terms of time between those who favor this position and those who are opposed to it. 
I want to express our appreciation to all of our Members for the opportunity of raising this issue with my friend and colleague from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, who has been one of the really important leaders here in the Senate on the tobacco issues; also, our friend and colleague, Senator Conrad, who has been the chair of a task force on the tobacco-related issues, and has been really tireless in terms of developing a command of this issue, and has also been tireless in trying to work out bipartisan support, not just on this issue but on other issues as well; our friend, Senator Durbin, who has been so involved in this issue, in particular on the price, as well as a number of my other colleagues; my colleague from Massachusetts; Senator Reed; and so many others. I am grateful to all of them. 
We look forward over the period of these next several hours and hopefully at a time during tomorrow morning to be able to present this issue to the U.S. Senate. 
We are very mindful that only a few hours ago, just a few yards from where we gathered this evening, we had the good opportunity to be with Dr. Koop, who is really the foremost public health official in this country and who has been such a leader in protecting the children in this Nation on this issue, as well as many others. I think that all of us who were gathered there were impressed that Dr. Koop was speaking on behalf of all of the public health community. It was really a singular voice in which he spoke for all of the public health communities. We can spell out the reasons why as we get into the debate and discussion on this issue. He was speaking not as a partisan, not as a Republican, not as a Democrat, but for all Americans, because that is what his service has been to this country as our Surgeon General. He has been the defender of the public health, and also as one who is a keen analyst as to what has been the real strategy of the tobacco industry over the period of these past years, who recognized what their strategy was in order to meet their financial requirements, that it was going to have to make a particular appeal to the children in this country. 
He spelled that strategy out long before it became evident as a result of the various publications of various documents that have been made available to the American people during the process of the various State suits. He is really one of the great giants. 
I took the opportunity at that time to thank him for his strong support of an amendment that was going to raise the price of a package of cigarettes to $1.50, because this would mean anywhere from 750,000 to 900,000 young people who would not be engaged in smoking and anywhere from 250,000 to about 300,000 young people children who would not die a premature death. 
I thanked Dr. Koop on that occasion for the families. I thanked him for the children who would not have the addiction. I thanked him for their parents because their children would not be addicted. I thanked him, for all Americans, for his willingness to take a stand on this issue. 
Mr. President, the amendment we are bringing here this evening is not an issue which is strange to the Members of this body over the period of these past weeks and months. I think all Americans have probably had the opportunity to listen to the public health community, represented, as I said, by Dr. Koop, and Dr. Kessler, and the representatives of many of those that have been afflicted with the kinds of illnesses and diseases that have been caused by addiction. 
We have heard the uniform appeal--the uniform appeal of all of those who have really studied this issue in any detail--that if we are going to have a significant impact on reducing the addiction of children in our country, the best way to do this is by having an increase in the cost per pack of cigarettes, and to do it in a timely way. 
By `in a timely way,' we mean doing it rapidly. We have devised this amendment to be a stepped-up process over a period of 3 years. There are others who have favored a $1.50 increase a pack in a 2-year period. We have accepted that particular challenge and followed their guidance. This amendment, more than any other proposal or amendment that is going to come in this Chamber, is motivated by protecting the children of this country. That is the reason behind this amendment, clear and simple. If you are interested in public health, you support this amendment. If you are interested in protecting children, you support this amendment. If you are interested in doing something about the problems of addiction and children, you support this amendment. If you are interested in trying to provide some limitation on children being involved in gateway drugs, you support this amendment. 
For all of these reasons and many more, this is a compelling amendment, and it is supported overwhelmingly by the American people, by families all over this Nation, Republican and Democrat, North and South alike. We will have the charts available that will indicate what the various data reflect. That is important and useful perhaps for some. 
But what we are motivated by and why we are offering this amendment is because of public health. Those who have studied this issue in terms of children believe that this is the first and most important step we can take to reduce the smoking addiction of children. 
This chart, Mr. President, points out very quickly and easily for the benefit of the Members the number of children who will be deterred from smoking by an increase of $1.10, 3 million; $1.50, 3,750,000. The difference of the proposal that is in this Chamber will be 750,000. That is what we are talking about by accepting this particular amendment. We will come back to elaborate on that in a while. We are talking about the number of children whose lives will be saved by the cigarette price increase. We are talking about 125,000 who will have an early death. 
I think one of the questions we are going to be asked sometime during this debate is, well, this is fine and well that you talk about increasing the cost per pack to $1.50, but how do we know this is really going to have the impact that you are stating here this evening? 
We will have a chance again either later tonight or tomorrow to go through a number of the public health reviews and the studies and the testimony that has been taken by a number of the committees over the period of these past weeks. We have had a number of committee hearings on this very issue. But perhaps one of the most impressive factors has been what happened with the significant price increase in our neighboring country of Canada that moved up to a $5 per pack price increase in 1991 and what happened to youth smoking over that period of time. You see the dramatic reduction of youth smoking as a result of the significant increase in the price of cigarettes. 
I hope we will not have to take a great deal of time to review that particular phenomenon. It is irrefutable. It is absolutely irrefutable. The public health information is irrefutable; that with a dramatic and significant increase in the price we see a significant reduction in youth smoking. This is one of the clearest examples to demonstrate what we hope will be achieved. 
We have set a goal of a 60-percent reduction in youth smoking over 5 years by increasing the price per pack of cigarettes. That is a national goal, and that has been one that has been stated and reaffirmed by many, even those who do not support this particular proposal. The only way we will get the 60-percent reduction over the 5-year period is by going to $1.50 per pack. That is basic and that is fundamental. But I just mention here that after a period of time we saw there was a growth in terms of the black market in Canada. 
Mr. President, 85 percent of the Canadian people live proximate to the United States. There was an increase in smuggling, and there was a decision that was made by the Government 
of Canada to basically leave it up to the Provinces as to whether they were going to maintain their increase in the higher cost per pack. So they left it up to the particular Provinces, and the result from leaving it up to the Provinces is in the Provinces that maintained the higher cost, we saw the continuation of a significant reduction in youth smoking--a significant reduction. 
We will have a chance perhaps, if necessary, to go Province by Province, but, nonetheless, that was the result. We cannot make the case any clearer than has been made, that this particular amendment is the amendment that deals with children; this particular amendment is the amendment that deals with addiction. If you are interested in trying to do something in the interest of public health, this is the amendment, with all due respect to the other amendments. We understand the relationship that they have to each other, and I am a strong supporter of the other provisions of the legislation. With the dramatic proposals that we are making here on the increase in the cost, when you have the other programs that are built in to deter individuals from beginning smoking and the other reductions in advertising, all of it has a symbiotic effect that will have an important impact on children. We are doing everything we can. 
The basic support for the proposal we are advocating today is a culmination of everything that has been recommended to us by the public health community. We have taken their recommendations and now are bringing them to the Senate. We know the American people are for it. The question is going to be, are we going to have the support of the Members or is the power of the cigarette and tobacco industry, which has been reflected in so many ways over the period of recent months and in recent years, going to be again demonstrated in this Chamber in terms of resisting these issues. 
Senator Conrad, who has held hearings with regard to the issues of smuggling and what will the impact of this be on the tobacco industry. All of these issues are important, but make no mistake about it, Mr. President, those of us who are advocating this amendment are advocating it for a very fundamental reason, and that is to protect children in our country and in our society, and we believe that the kinds of protections we are offering here are the kinds of protections that are going to have the most important impact for our country. 
We offer this amendment which is really one we believe the Senate should move towards and be willing to accept. We can go back in terms of the time and understand what is really happening out there in America, the impact that tobacco has on the young people of this country. 
I see my colleagues from New Jersey and North Dakota are here and ready to address this issue, but let me just take a few moments to go through the way children become involved in the addiction of tobacco. 
Smoking begins early, Mr. President. 16 percent of adults who are daily smokers began smoking--and these are the cumulative figures--by age 12. Just think about it. By the age of 12, 16 percent; by the age of 14, 37 percent. By 16 or under, we are talking about 62 percent. These are the children who become addicted. These are the children who do not have the benefit of being able to make a balanced and informed judgment about going ahead and involving themselves in the use of tobacco. 
We are talking about very young children who begin the utilization of tobacco and move on through. By the age of 16, 62 percent of those who eventually are going to become addicted have already started down that path, and they are the ones who have been targeted by the tobacco industry for marketing--for addiction. It is for these children that the studies demonstrate that the increase in the costs of tobacco, because of the limitations in their purchasing power, will be a very, very powerful and important disincentive to these young people. Added to the other features of the program, it will be a serious disincentive for them to get started smoking. 
Mr. President, I will wind up now to let my colleagues speak. I hear often: Isn't this really a disservice to those families who may be involved in smoking, that they will have to pay, really, a disproportionate share because we will have an increase in the costs of these cigarettes? I must say, that is an argument that you hear out here occasionally on the floor of the U.S. Senate, but the fact is I don't hear that back home in my State of Massachusetts. People, even in blue-collar areas, who perhaps smoke more than others in a community, are saying we are not less concerned about our children than those who may come from a different socioeconomic background. Those working families are concerned about their children. Time in and time out, when you ask working families, `Do you want to do something about reducing the opportunity for your children to start smoking,' their answer is yes, and overwhelmingly yes. Because they understand, as all of us understand, that these children, once they get started down the path towards addiction, find it extremely difficult if not impossible, to begin to get control. 
Mr. President, I will yield the floor now. I look forward to our continued discussion of this. 
I ask unanimous consent to add the names of Senators Harkin and Wellstone as cosponsors of the amendment.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join all of my colleagues in thanking our friend and colleague and chairman of our task force, Senator Conrad, for the enormously informative presentation that was made in support of our proposal before the Senate now, which is to raise the cost of a pack of cigarettes by $1.50. 
I thank my colleague and friend, Senator Kerry, for his comments and for all the work he has done, as well, in bringing us to where we are in this legislative session, so that we are having an opportunity to debate these issues on the floor of the Senate and having an opportunity to express a judgment about these matters this afternoon, again tomorrow, and the remainder of this week. 
This is enormously important. Perhaps, in many respects, it is the most important measure that we will have before the Senate in this term--certainly one of the most important public health issues that we will have before the Senate. I think it is important that the American people give focus and attention to this issue and, in particular, to the amendments we are now discussing and debating on the increase of the per pack cost of cigarettes. 
I also mention our colleague and friend, the chairman of the committee, Senator McCain. I, too, want to join in expressing appreciation for the fact that we had the opportunity to get to this legislation through his leadership. Now we have an opportunity to strengthen and improve it. We are grateful for his leadership. 
Mr. President, I want to just take a few moments to respond to the issue that Senator McCain spoke to when we were making the presentation about the importance of increasing the price per pack by $1.50. Senator McCain at that time talked about, what is magical about $1.50? What is really the difference between that and $2 or $2.50 or $3? 
Mr. President, I think it is important to understand why we do have the $1.50. It is, as I mentioned earlier, and as Senator Lautenberg and Senator Conrad have pointed out, the recommended figure by not just the majority, but the entirety of the public health community, to be essential if we are going to have some impact in reducing cigarette smoking by teenagers in this country and also to achieve the goal that was established by the attorneys general in their own proposal. They established a 10-year goal of 60 percent. That was in the initial proposal made by the attorneys general--the 60 percent. 
In our Committee on Labor and Human Resources, which had the consideration of this legislation for a short period of time--we had the jurisdiction because of the responsibility that the committee has regarding the Food and Drug Administration, and we had a markup on the legislation--we had a majority of the members who said, `We don't want to see a reduction of 60 percent, we want a reduction of 80 percent.' If we are going to accept that, then we have to find out how we are going to get and reach that particular goal. That is really the fundamental issue. It doesn't do much good to say we are going to set a goal of 30, 40, 50, or 60 percent and then not take the steps to be able to achieve it. 
The attorneys general went with 60 percent. The goal established out of the Commerce Committee was 60 percent. So it is fair enough to ask ourselves, will we reach that goal of 60 percent with the proposal of the Commerce Committee? And what we are saying is that we will not. You won't reach that with $1.10. You will get maybe into a 34, 36 percent reduction, but you are not going to get the 60 percent reduction, which has been the goal--and I think a worthwhile goal--to see that 60 percent of the young people in this country are going to stop smoking over a period of 10 years. We will be able to reach that with $1.50. I will come back and explain that in greater detail in a few moments. We will be able to reach that and give the authority for that. 
The chairman of the Commerce Committee says we will get there, and if we don't get there on the front end, we will get there on the back end by the requirements we have on the look-back provisions. But I think it is fair to say that with the look-back provisions, and the capping of the payments on the look-back provisions of some $4 billion, that the best estimate, even if you are going to have the violations of the look-back provisions, you are only talking about perhaps 15 or 20 cents more per pack. 
So you get up to maybe $1.30 or $1.35. But you still are not getting to where the health economists and professionals say you have to get in order to have the significant reduction. 
That is really the issue that is before the Senate. That is the question that we are going to decide on tomorrow. 
What is the justification for not taking the recommendations of the public health community? What is possibly the reason for not doing so? There are those who can say, `Well, if you do so you are going to pay for the industry itself.' Senator Conrad just responded to that. 
I come back to the excellent testimony we had before the Judiciary Committee and before the task force that responds to that which estimates that even with $1.50 as Jeffrey Harris, who is probably the most thoughtful and competent unbiased health economist who has studied this for the longest period of time, has estimated that even with an increase of $1.50, that by the year 2003 the profits for the industry will be in excess of $5 billion just on the domestic sales of product here in the United States, a very, very generous profit for this industry--a generous profit for the industry even at $1.50. 
What is possibly the reason not to support the recommendation of the public health community which says we ought to go to $1.50 a pack if we are serious about stopping young people from smoking? 
That is overwhelming testimony. That is overwhelming presentation. It is overwhelming evidence. It has not been rebutted. It won't be rebutted. It hasn't been rebutted tonight. It won't be rebutted tomorrow. And it has not been rebutted by any of the publications, including the tobacco industry itself. It has not been rebutted. 
We will come back to what the tobacco industry has been doing. So this is the issue. Why wouldn't we want to do it? What is going to be the argument against it? I don't find the arguments very persuasive. I do not hear them. It is just, `Well, we have a better way of doing it.' But we are taking a very significant chance. Why do that when we have such overwhelming and powerful evidence this amendment can make a significant difference, and based upon the human tragedy that is taking place among our teenagers every single day across this country? It isn't a problem that is becoming less important. It is becoming more important. It isn't an issue that is resolving itself. It is becoming more acute. That is the question that we can ask. 
We in this body tomorrow can take a major step in improving the quality of life for young people in this country for years ahead. The overwhelming majority of the American people are for it. The powerful special interests of the tobacco industry are against it. And we are going to find out here on the floor of the Senate when that rollcall is going to be there whether we are going to stand with the families and stand with the children of this country and stand with the future, or whether we are going to stand with an industry that has been so discredited in terms of its representations and presentations in this whole discussion and debate and over the period of this past year. That is the issue. I don't think we can have many that are more clearly defined than the one we have before us and will have before us tomorrow. 
According to University of Illinois Professor Chaloupka, the Nation's leading authority on the impact of higher cigarette prices on teenage smoking, a $1.50 per pack increase in cigarette prices will reduce the teenage smoking by 56 percent over 10 years. A $1.10-a-pack increase, on the other hand, will reduce youth smoking rates by only 34 percent. In fact, the $1.15 increase will only return youth smoking to its 1991 level because of the recent surge in teenage smoking rates. That is clearly unacceptable.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we will be moving towards the votes as set out by the two leaders for votes on these amendments in approximately 2 hours. But while there is a brief moment, I would like to address the Senate on one of the issues that we will be addressing later this evening and on tomorrow. That is the amendment that will be offered hopefully in a bipartisan way by Republicans and Democrats on the tobacco bill to raise the cost per pack of tobacco from $1.10 to $1.50. 
I have hopes that this will be a bipartisan amendment since there have been Republicans and Democrats who have supported that position both in the Finance Committee when the Finance Committee accepted that concept last week and also in the Budget Committee. I think that there are those on both sides of the aisle that support that particular measure. 
I will strongly support the measure and welcome the opportunity to be one of those who commends that position to the Senate, when it is hoped, we will have some determination on that as one of the first orders of business. I believe that under the proposition, which will be announced later on this evening by the two leaders, that will be one of the measures which will be addressed and voted on tomorrow. So I will just take a few moments now to express my strong support for increasing the cigarette price by $1.50 per pack. 
Mr. President, youth smoking in America has reached epidemic proportions. According to the report issued last month by the Centers for Disease Control Prevention, smoking rates among high school students have risen by nearly a third between 1991 and 1997. Among African-Americans, the smoking rates have soared by 80 percent. And more than 36 percent of high school students smoke--a 19-year high. 
With youth smoking at such a crisis level and still increasing, we cannot rely on half measures. Congress must use the strongest legislative tools available to reduce youth smoking as rapidly as possible. 
The amendment we will have before us tomorrow will provide for a cigarette price increase of $1.50 per pack over the next 3 years. The $1.10 per pack increase over 5 years in the managers' amendment is not adequate to achieve the youth smoking reduction goals of 60 percent. And by raising it by $1.50 instead of $1.10 a pack, we can deter an additional 750,000 children from smoking over the next 5 years. That will mean 250,000 fewer premature deaths from tobacco-induced illnesses. 
Public health experts have overwhelmingly concluded that an increase of $1.50 a pack is the minimum cigarette price increase necessary to achieve our youth-smoking reduction goals. 
Dr. C. Everett Koop and Dr. David Kessler, the National Academy of Sciences, the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the American Lung Association, the American Medical Association, the ENACT Coalition, and the Save Lives Not Tobacco Coalition have all stressed the importance of a price increase of at least $1.50 a pack. It is the single most 
important step we can take to reduce youth smoking. 
More than a third of the Senate have already cosponsored bills proposing the $1.50 a pack increase. The Senate Budget Committee endorsed $1.50 on a bipartisan vote of 14-8 in March. Last Thursday, a bipartisan majority in the Finance Committee voted for a cigarette price index of $1.50. Too many young lives are at stake for us to ignore the advice of all the public health experts. 
Mr. President, the $1.10 increase, on the other hand, simply will not do the job. According to the University of Illinois' Professor Frank Chaloupka, the Nation's leading authority on the impact of higher cigarette prices on teenage smoking, an increase of $1.50 a pack would reduce youth smoking by nearly 50 percent. When combined with the youth access provisions and other tobacco control measures, the $1.50 per pack increase will reduce youth smoking by 60 percent and reach the target that we have set. In addition, if the tobacco industry plays by the rules and no longer targets young Americans with their advertisements and promotions, no look-back penalties would need to be applied above the $1.50 a pack increase. 
According to Professor Chaloupka, the $1.10 increase will reduce youth smoking by only a third. Even with the nonprice provision in the tobacco legislation, it would be very difficult to achieve the targets for reducing youth smoking. 
Ask any parents if saving 750,000 additional children from a lifetime of nicotine addiction and tobacco-induced disease is worth the extra 40 cents needed for the $1.50 price increase instead of the $1.10 increase. 
Ask any person who is concerned about the health of the Nation's children whether we should do all we can to prevent these young Americans from taking up this deadly habit. 
The vast majority of the American people support the $1.50 per pack increase and Congress should support it, too. Ask any taxpayer if they want to continue to shoulder the burden of paying the health costs of the Nation's smokers. Seventy-five percent of Americans do not smoke, yet the Department of Treasury finds that they pay $130 billion each year for the health costs in lost productivity of the 25 percent who do smoke. 
Ask any American if they have had enough of the tobacco industry's distortions and denials of the addictiveness of nicotine or about the industry's cynical marketing of cigarettes to children or about the industry's decades-long coverup of the health risks associated with smoking. 
This is an industry which once argued that cigarettes are no more addictive than Gummy Bears. This is an industry that used Joe Camel in advertising blatantly designed to hook children on smoking, yet they now ask us to believe that a $1.10 or $1.50 increase will lead to big tobacco's bankruptcy and a rampant black market for illegal cigarettes. 
The challenge is clear. One million young people between the ages of 12 and 17 take up the deadly habit each year--3,000 new smokers a day. The average smoker begins smoking at age 13 and becomes a daily smoker before age 15. One-third of these children will die prematurely from a tobacco-induced disease. 
Once children become hooked on cigarette smoking at a young age, it becomes increasingly harder for them to quit. And 90 percent of current adult smokers began to smoke before they reached the age of 18. Ninety-five percent of teenaged smokers say they intend to quit in the near future, but only a quarter of them actually do quit within the first 8 years of beginning to smoke. 
The tobacco companies have known these facts for years. They are fully aware that they need to persuade children to take up smoking in order to preserve their future profits. That is why big tobacco has long targeted children with billions of dollars in advertising and promotional giveaways that promise popularity, excitement and success for young men and women who take up smoking. 
The recent documents released in the Minnesota case against the tobacco industry reveals the true extent of the industry's marketing strategy to children. 
In 1981, in the Philip Morris memo, `Young Smokers, Prevalence, Implications and Related Demographic Trends,' the authors wrote that:  
It is important to know as much as possible about teenage smoking patterns and attitude. Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer. The overwhelming majority of smokers first begin to smoke while still in their teens. 
The smoking patterns are particularly important to Philip Morris. Furthermore, it is during the teenage years that the initial choice is made. Nothing is done to reverse this trend in adolescent smoking. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 5 million of today's children will die prematurely from smoke-caused illnesses. 
The American public has had enough of the daily tragedy of death and disease caused by tobacco use. They are demanding dramatic action by Congress to drastically curb youth smoking. This Congress will be judged in large measure by whether or not we respond effectively to that challenge. Increasing cigarette prices by $1.50 is the most effective way to reduce teenage smoking. The public health community agrees it is the minimum increase needed to achieve the national goal of reduced youth smoking by 60 percent over 10 years. Study after study has shown that raising cigarette prices is the most powerful weapon in reducing cigarette use among children, since children have less income than adults to spend on tobacco, and most children are not yet addicted. 
Philip Morris, the Nation's largest tobacco company, concedes as much in an internal memorandum as far back as 1981. That memorandum stated, `It is clear that price has a pronounced effect on the smoking prevalence of teenagers.' And the goals of reducing teenage smoking and balancing the budget would both be served by increasing the Federal excise tax on cigarettes. In 1982, R.J. Reynolds said essentially the same thing in that `the key finding is that younger adult males are highly sensitive to price. Price may create a barrier which prevents the appeal from developing into an ongoing choice to become a smoker.' 
Canada increased its cigarette prices between 1980 and 1981 until there was a $3 difference in cigarette prices with the United States overall. An increase of $1.50 a pack is clearly realistic. In addition, it is not likely that the $1.50 increase in the manufacturers' level will turn into a much higher real price increase at the retail level. 
The difference between a $1.10 increase and a $1.50 increase is literally that 750,000 more children will be deterred from smoking over the next 5 years. We shouldn't sacrifice these children to a lifetime of tobacco-induced illnesses. The lives of these children hang in the balance. 
The American people are calling on you to have the courage to act. The $1.50 increase has broad public support. The public health community deserves the support of the full Senate, too.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I yield myself 4 minutes on the amendments. 
As I am sure the Senator from Texas knows, about 85 percent of these jobs earn $75,000 a year, or less. I am just wondering what we have against Americans and American workers that we are so prepared to turn over these good jobs to foreigners. 
Now, if the Senator wants to say, well, what about these $75,000 jobs? The GAO pointed out that there is no increase in the salary of these workers. I thought supply and demand said that if we have that great a demand, we are going to see an increase in salaries; right? Wrong. The GAO report says there is no indication of that. 
So these are good jobs. I say, let's try an American first. Let's develop the kinds of skills employers need so that we won't need to have this continue after the expiration of this particular proposal. Let's try an American first. And if we are not going to do that, let's just ensure that an American who is in that job and working, as the record demonstrates today, isn't going to get laid off and replaced by a foreign worker who then is going to work longer hours and be threatened day after day that if they complain at all, they are going to have their green card taken and they will be shipped overseas. That is the case, in many instances. 
Madam President, I find it difficult to just accept the Senator's argument that this really is just the pure free market system working at its best. I think we owe something to American workers. It is so interesting that all of these companies want to have a free enterprise system--except when it comes to paying wages and salaries. Then they want to do it and get cheaper workers in from overseas and then exploit them. We want to protect against that. That is what those amendments would do. 
I withhold the balance of my time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I have 150 letters and scores more back in my office of Americans who have training and skills in computer knowledge and technology and are unable to get the jobs. You can, under this proposal, hire 1,000 foreign workers and displace 1,000 American workers and it doesn't violate any law. It violates no law. I think we ought to protect American workers, and if there is a job out there, an American worker ought to have a crack at it before it goes overseas. 
Madam President, I see my friend and colleague from Nevada who, under the agreement, is to be recognized to offer an amendment.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for bringing this matter to our attention once again. As we were saying a few moments ago, this was accepted in the last debate on immigration reform in 1996. When it went to conference, there were a number of us who were excluded. If we had been able to participate, we would have supported this measure. But we were in a different regime at the time. 
In so many areas of immigration policy there are the opportunities for abuse by a few. But as the Senator has pointed out, thousands can still be affected by the injustice. The Senator has identified one instance in which a family was harmed. We would be glad to work with him and with Senator Abraham to see what could be worked through in the conference. If somehow we are not persuasive in the conference, we will join with him later in offering his amendment on appropriations bills or other bills. But I think the Senator has made a strong case, just as he did the last time. I think he has identified a very important issue.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank the Senator, my friend from Rhode Island. We have had the good opportunity to work with the Senator from Rhode Island and also the Senator from Maine on this particular issue. I know that the Senator from Rhode Island is someone who has been on the education committees, not only in the Senate but also in the House of Representatives, and is someone with a number of years of experience with this important issue. The Senator from Rhode Island has spent a lot of time in developing an understanding of this particular program and how it works in the States. He has also found how it can best be targeted in ways that offer the best opportunity for needy students, giving focus in areas of important need--math and science and other skills. So, we will continue to work with him. We appreciate his leadership and the leadership of the Senator from Maine in this area. 
We have been trying to work to assure that Americans are going to develop the skills to be able to compete in these areas. This is really a combination of both the education and training aspects that Senator DeWine, Senator Reed, and Senator Collins have been working on, as well as the Senator from Michigan. And that is a reflection of the good faith of the Senator from Michigan on it. 
So I appreciate his willingness of the Senator from Rhode Island, at this time, to continue to work with us. We give the Senator the assurance we will continue to work very closely with him, and with the Senator from Maine, as we move on into the conference. But I appreciate his cooperation and leadership on this issue.

Mr. KENNEDY. I have listened to the debate on this issue. It has been an important and illuminating debate. We are really talking, as I understand it--and I am going to ask the Senator from West Virginia a question about this--we are talking about approximately 1,000, maybe 1,500 visas or green cards a year. We issue about 900,000 green cards annually, and with the investor visa, we are talking about a very small program by comparison. There is a principle involved and I have heard the Senator from Arkansas. But it actually is a very, very modest program. It was developed at a time when we had higher unemployment than we do at the present time. It was a recognition that in many of these areas of unemployment we were trying to devise as many different kinds of ways to bring jobs into those areas as possible. 
But I ask the Senator from West Virginia if he would not agree with me that the immigration policy is a policy which is basically to benefit the United States? That is overarching and a generalization, I know. But our overall immigration policy includes a number of different features. 
We have the reunification of families. That has a very high priority. 
We have provisions in our immigration laws for 140,000 skilled workers. Most of our major hockey league players are players from other countries. They come over here, play hockey, get citizenship, and make a lot of money. We have artists who come in here and appear on our stages and they make a lot of money. They have money when they come in here, and they make a lot of money, but we feel they add to the theater or to sports, so we let them in. We have artists who come over here who are wealthy and have particular talents and settle here, get green cards and become citizens. But we believe they add to the country, too, so we let them in. 
We are, as I understand it, not a nation that just is taking in the dispossessed, although we have an important tradition for that. As I look at immigration, the way that it actually works --a matter which we have been debating here--I believe we ought to give Americans the first crack at these jobs under the temporary worker program, which we can certainly do. But if we are talking about Andrew Lloyd Webber coming over here, he gets in here. He has not waited 2 years, 3 years to get in. He comes on in as fast as the Concorde can bring him. You can say, `Well, that is unfair. That is unfair. Why are we going to take Lloyd Webber? Why is he jumping over all these other people who want to come here?' But we still believe he is exceptional and adds something to our nation. 
These are all balances, though the Senator may not agree with me. What we did in creating the investor visa was very modest. No one quite understood it, because we had never done it before. But it was an effort to try to get some jobs in underserved areas. We had seen that the idea of an investor visa had been utilized in other countries with a modest amount of success--not great success but a modest amount. But we said that in our law, immigrant investors must also create jobs because jobs are needed in West Virginia, needed in Roxbury, MA, needed in Lawrence, MA, and needed in southeastern Massachusetts. 
Maybe this hasn't worked as well as many of us would like, but nonetheless in some areas, in my own State in some areas, there has been some positive development. Sure, it is 10 jobs per investor. Sure, I would like them to be better jobs than some of the investors have created, but there have been jobs that wouldn't have been there or that would have disappeared without these investments. 
But I would just say to the Senator, with all respect to my 
colleague from Arkansas, we have just let in, thank God, one of the best baseball pitchers that we have on the Boston Red Sox. He did not wait like unskilled people do, coming from all over the world. He came right in, and he has been pitching. He started pitching 5 days after he was in this country and he has been just superb. 
I wanted to say to the Senator and ask him, does he not believe that we have an immigration policy that includes a variety of these features; the overwhelming aspect of it is the reunification of families? That is its heart and soul, as I believe it should be. We have debated what is a family--a nuclear family, whether it is just brothers and sisters, older brothers and sisters, younger brothers and sisters, small children. We have had that debate. There are important differences in this body on that issue. But it has been families. 
We have also cut back on low-skilled workers which we did not do 20 years ago, and the reason why? Because we find that they are a depression factor on wages for American workers in entry-level jobs. Interesting. That was not a factor years and years ago. But it is now. It is now. That is why there has been some alteration and change. 
So I just wondered whether the Senator from West Virginia agrees with me that we have in our immigration policy a variety of different features. There are some features of it I disagree with and we have debated some in the last bill which came through this body, which I opposed for various other reasons, not important here today. 
In creating the investor visa, jobs were important. And that was the balance that was made--to permit the visa if it created jobs. It has been a very modest program and all of us hope that it can be strengthened. 
But I would ask my colleague whether he does not agree in the total lexicon of consideration of the immigration policy we shouldn't at least be able to consider the feature of national need.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are at the time where, in just a few minutes, we will be making a decision about expanding a provision of the immigration law that provides for temporary workers. This is a provision now that has been, by and large, used for workers 85 percent of whom make $75,000 or less. 
There is a small group of highly skilled, highly talented individuals who do a great deal better than that. They are really not an issue in this particular amendment, as far as I am concerned, because they only take a very small number of the green cards that will be issued. 
There is a substantive question about how much of a problem there is. Under the Abraham amendment, we will temporarily be opening up this quota in a very significant way. Tens of thousands of new immigrants will be coming to the United States. In our particular proposal, that was not so. 
Let me read two letters that indicate what the challenge is. One is from Sally Barnett. She is from Plano, TX:  
I just heard via the radio that several companies, including Texas Instruments, Microsoft, etc., wish to bring in immigrants to do high-tech engineering. I live in Dallas and have for 3 years. I graduated with a degree in mathematics and went back to school in the late 1980s and received my degree in computer programming. I have two positions in the field . . . I have applied all over Dallas but never get an interview. I have my resume on the Internet. I had a 4.0 average in my classes in the late 1980s . . . I do not even demand a high salary but I can't even get an interview for a job. 
This is a computer technician who is unable to get a job. I had scores of letters that I read from earlier in this debate. 
Jim Sizemore from Cupertino, CA, has a long letter: 
Do not increase the immigration quota for high-tech workers. This will force employers to act responsibly to get more from their high-tech talent . . . to invest in domestic training, to internally develop talent, and to take action to retain the talent they have. Don't let employers off the hook from taking such actions. 
Importing more foreign labor is a cheap and easy answer for companies who don't want to do what's right. Importing foreign labor is wrong for current workers . . . . 
Wrong for American workers. 
That gets to the heart of my two amendments. There are three different issues here. One is training, to make sure down the road that we provide adequate training so that American workers will have the skills to get all of these jobs and hopefully be able to do that in the next 3 or 4 years. We are working out that particular provision. 
But the two amendments that I offer say something else. They say that we will not permit Americans who have those jobs today to be laid off from those jobs and to substitute for those Americans foreign workers. That is permitted today, and that is wrong. That is wrong, because we know what has happened. Foreign workers come on in, and they are forced to work longer and harder and are in the position where they refuse to complain because they know if they do complain, they are going to have their green card pulled and will be sent back to their country of origin. We have the record; that happens, and that is wrong. That amendment no. 1. 
The second amendment says, before you go out and hire a foreign worker, you at least have to make a reasonable effort to try to hire an American worker. We do it by just saying any employer has to follow the industry standards for recruitment in that industry, and simply indicate on the application form that that is what they have done. 
Basically, we are saying, what is wrong with American workers? Clearly, they can be trained to take these jobs. We believe they should be able to do so. 
Secondly, we believe that there are tens of thousands of workers across this country who ought to be able to maintain their jobs and not be replaced by foreigners in this country. We also believe that Americans ought to be given a chance for these jobs in the United States before they go overseas. 
Those are effectively the two amendments before us. We believe in American workers. We believe they can be trained. We believe they ought to be given the first opportunity for hiring. And we believe that they ought to be able to hold those jobs and not be displaced if they have the needed skills. Mr. President, I hope that we will have a vote in favor of my amendments. 
I yield back what time I have, and I ask that it be in order to ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in my amendment we are basically saying let the best and the brightest come into the United States on the basis of their extraordinary contributions in our research facilities or universities or other places. 
But the fact of the matter is that most of jobs for which employers seek H-1B workers pay $75,000 or less, and 75 percent of them are $50,000 or less. Those are good jobs for Americans. We are saying: Make sure you are going to offer it to an American before you are going to apply to hire a foreign worker. 
We prescribe in our amendment that recruitment standard is whatever the industry does normally when recruiting workers. If employers follow that procedure, all they have to do is attest that they have followed those procedures and they are protected. 
These are good jobs. Americans are qualified for these jobs, and we ought to put American workers first. That is what this amendment is about. 
Mr. President, before we vote, I would like to thank Senator Abraham for his courtesies in this debate, and his staff, Lee Otis, Stuart Anderson and Cesar Conda. I would also like to thank my own staff, Michael Myers, my staff director, and Sandy Shipshock, who has worked diligently for many months on my staff as a Pearson Fellow from the State Department. I am deeply grateful for their help.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield such time as I might use. 
Mr. President, as of May 7 the immigration quota for skilled temporary foreign workers was full. The 65,000 visas available each year under the H-1B visa category have been claimed. For the remainder of the fiscal year--almost 5 months--no more visas are available. The quota filled rapidly this year because U.S. high-tech computer companies are bringing in foreign programmers in record numbers. America's high-tech industry is undergoing extraordinary growth, and the demand is high for more workers, so they have turned to the immigration laws to bring them in from abroad. A temporary increase in the immigration quota is justified. We all want to ensure that our high-tech industries get the workers they need to remain healthy and competitive. 
I have always felt that with regard to our immigration laws we ought to, first of all, recognize the importance of families and family reunification; and then, secondly, if they are going to bring in those who have special skills, which is going to expand the American economy, a case could be made for those individuals. They could make that--particularly in the years of 1980 and as we came into 1990, we are facing the unemployment that we are facing, we did recognize the importance of these special skills that will result in expanding the American economy and expanded employment. That does make sense. 
The demand for more foreign workers is an embarrassing indictment of our failure to provide adequate training for American workers. These are good high-tech jobs in the modern economy. Over the next decade, it is estimated that high-tech computer companies will need 1.3 million additional employees, and American workers deserve help in obtaining the skills to compete for them. 
It is not enough just to raise the immigration quota. Any bill that passes this Congress should, I believe, have two additional things. First, it must assure American workers that they will get the training opportunities they need to compete for these good jobs. It makes no sense to throw in the towel by increasing the immigration quota, even temporarily, without also investing substantially in the training of U.S. workers. We must not give away these good jobs forever. We must invest in our workers, and that means putting real money on the table for training American workers. 
The bill that came out of our committee, I believe, failed. It was a good-faith effort to try to do so, but I believe it failed in making that kind of commitment. We have been working with the chairman of the committee to address that particular issue. There is no reason in the world why we should not provide these kinds of skills for American workers. That is really what this debate here this afternoon is all about. We recognize that we may very well have a need to increase this category in order to bring in some of those that have particular skills that might be important in terms of our American industry, and we can have a chance to go over the record on that particular issue. I think, quite frankly, it is a mixed issue. Nonetheless, given the evaluation of the information that is out there, I think we should take a temporary step. But beyond that, there is no reason why we should not develop the kinds of training programs and the kinds of initiatives to make sure, to the extent possible, that we are going to provide the skills to American workers so they can have the jobs, and not just have a more open-ended immigration policy in these categories for foreign-trained workers. That really is an important part of this debate. 
A second very important part of this debate is how we are going to treat the American workers. We find that at least we will have a chance, probably, to go into this in some detail, and that there is at least a record out there that a number of these individuals come into this country, and they know that if they have their job terminated, they are effectively deported; they can't retain their green card. There is some evidence that these individuals have displaced American workers who were holding those jobs. 
Then, subsequently, there has been an adverse impact on the wages of those workers who are virtually handcuffed, so-to-speak, and trying to complain about it, because if they complain, they are shipped back overseas. We want to make sure that, one, as a great Nation that has the capacity to train our workers, we are going to provide skills for those workers. For every worker that goes into the job market today, they are going to have seven different jobs. Under the excellence bill, which was passed just over a week ago by the leadership of Senators DeWine, Jeffords, and Wellstone, we have tried to bring our training programs up to the demands of the turn of the century, so that Americans are going to have a continuing possibility for upgrading their skills. They are going to need that. 
We as a nation should make sure that those kinds of opportunities for self-improvement are going to be available to working families in this country. That is very, very important, I believe. 
The Senate went on record a week ago with a very strong bipartisan vote to do just that. We don't want to carve out an area. We don't want to say we will train Americans for some jobs but we are not going to train them for the computer jobs in this Nation. That makes no sense. That virtually turns our back on what we committed to American working families just a week ago. We shouldn't carve this area out and say, `We are not going to provide that.' That is why we have been working with our friend and colleague, the Senator from Michigan, to try to address that. I think we have seen some important movement on this issue. I certainly appreciate his understanding of that importance. We are trying to work out an approach on that. That is going to meet some of the concerns that he and others have. 
But a second important point is that we don't want to say to American workers who are working in the computer industry now, to have their boss come up to them and say, `You are fired because we have someone else who will replace you at the same wage.' That is legal in America today. Any of these large companies can bring in the temporary workers having met some rather fundamental kinds of requirements and just displace Americans. I think that is wrong. I think that is absolutely and fundamentally wrong. We will have an amendment to try to address that issue. 
Second, we want to make sure that there is going to be at least an effort, some effort. All we are talking about in this case is an attestation; we are saying to the employer that you attest that you have made an effort to try to hire an American worker. What we are saying is we are not setting up any type of rule or regulation. We are saying whatever the industry requires, whatever the pattern is in the particular industry. So if a particular industry is just publishing something on the Internet, e-mail, whatever, that is sufficient in terms of meeting that requirement. Whatever the industry does, we say that is fine. All the company has to do is just say OK, we have done that. That is all. That is the total amount of paperwork. But what we are trying to do is say that we are going to give some priority to American workers. The company is just going to have to follow whatever the industry does in recruiting, is going to have to do so with regard to these workers. I think that is very important. We don't want to displace American workers, and we want to make sure than an American worker who has those kinds of skills is going to be able to get that job. Those aren't, I don't think, very radical kinds of concepts if we are talking about what we are interested in--looking after American workers' families. 
What are these jobs? When you come down to it, we will probably come back to revisit this issue a little later in the debate. But, according to Department of Labor figures, from 1997 on the H-1B jobs, on the certification of what these jobs are, and what they pay, this chart is an indication of what the pay is for these particular jobs. If you look at this particular chart, Mr. President, you will see that 76 percent of these jobs are from $25,000 to $50,000 a year. These are good jobs. It is difficult for me to believe that we cannot develop training and education programs so that American workers can get 
those particular jobs. Those are good jobs for working families. We are not prepared to say that we are going to turn our back on Americans for these kinds of jobs. 
Another 16 percent go from $50,000 to $75,000. Those are good jobs, too. What you are talking about here is that more than 5 percent of those are below $75,000. 
Then you have these in the smaller group, approximately 5 percent, that are in excess of that $75,000. Those are represented by those, I think, that we call the `Best and the Brightest' in this category. We said they don't have to go and have an attestation or requirement in terms of seeking alternatives for those individuals who are going to universities or doing research. They don't have to go through even these very preliminary steps. What we are trying to do is to say for the basic jobs that are in these categories that fall roughly in $75,000 or less that they should not displace American workers and that American workers ought to get the first crack at it. That is basically what the amendment I will be offering later this afternoon calls for, and what we, I believe, should bring to our attention. 
Mr. President, it matters to U.S. high-tech companies that want more visas. But it also matters to workers who are laid off by unscrupulous employers and replaced by foreign workers. It matters to middle-aged computer programmers who work hard to keep up their skills but are laid off in favor of younger workers who will work longer hours at cheaper pay. And it matters to working families who would love to get one of these jobs and make $30,000, $40,000, or $50,000 a year. Many of the workers who come in under the H-1B visa program are obviously talented. We should put out the welcome mat for accomplished people who have unique skills to improve our economy and create jobs, but accomplished workers represent only a fraction of the foreign workers who come to the United States under the H-1B program. 
I have indicated that more than 75,000 would be about 5 percent. We might even stretch it to up to 20 percent. Most of those who are coming into this program are lower-level computer programmers. Many are physical therapists, occupational therapists, nurses, and 80 percent are paid less than $50,000, as I referred to. These are good jobs, and the working families of America should get the first crack at them. 
The bill before us does little or nothing to enhance the accountability and enforcement of the H-1B visa program. Some say the current program is satisfactory. They cite the low number of violators found by the Labor Department as evidence that the terms of the program are widely observed. But the reason so few violations are discovered is that the Labor Department's hands are tied. The Department cannot intervene unless a complaint is filed. And few workers dare complain. As I mentioned before, if they complain, they are shipped overseas and they are gone. No matter how poorly they are being trained and how overworked they are being worked, if they complain about that part and get fired, they lose their green card, and it is back to their country of origin. That has to be, and it is, an important factor. The fact that we have not had the complaints is because to do so would jeopardize their immigration status. So they either accept the abuses or change employers. But they don't complain. 
We know there are serious problems. This is the issue. Two years ago, the Labor Department's inspector general completed the largest study of the program. That is the basic program, the fundamental, the temporary worker program, which is the issue that we are talking about here today. They reviewed some 720 cases in 12 States. The results were appalling. In 75 percent of the cases, the inspector general could not even tell from the employer's records whether the employer paid the H-1B foreign worker the proper wage. If those are good documents on what they paid, 19 percent of the employers paid less than the wage that they had promised on their applications. 
Any bill that the Congress sends to the President must remedy this problem. The Labor Department should have the same authority to enforce the rules under this program as they have to enforce workplace standards and the minimum wage, and they should have the same authority that the Immigration and Naturalization Service has to ensure that employers do not hire illegal immigrant workers. That means giving the Labor Department authority to enforce the rule where there is reasonable cause to believe that they have been broken. 
We permit the enforcement. If we do not have enforcement, we have abuses. Your rights are diminished if you do not have the ability to have a remedy. That is just basic fact. We don't have to spend the time on the floor to really debate that issue. Unless we are going to have that kind of protection, you are going to have the kind of abuses that have taken place and continue to take place. 
Stephen Schultz is an engineer who was laid off from his job in Modesto, CA. 
He was then asked to come back to his company on a temporary basis in order to train his foreign replacement. There was nothing Mr. Schultz could do about it. He was laid off and replaced by a foreign worker. To add insult to injury, he was asked to train his foreign replacement. Can you imagine that, Mr. President. Here is the person who is laid off. The company hires someone from overseas, brings them over here, puts them in that job and then hires the worker that had been working there, I believe in this case 5 to 7 years he had been working there, to train that worker to fill that person's job. That was happening. That was happening. Now, that is absolutely and fundamentally wrong, and we do not want to permit, as we are seeing in the expansion of this program, those kinds of practices. 
I commend Senator Abraham for recognizing the problem, but unfortunately the antilayoff provisions in the bill, I believe, are inadequate. They apply only in a very limited circumstance. The employers who lay off U.S. workers and replace them with foreign workers can be penalized under this bill only if they break the law first. Only if they break the law first. Under this bill, you can lay off American workers and replace them with foreign workers as long as you don't underpay them or use them as strikebreakers or commit some other violation first. We should require employers to state that they have been unable to find qualified workers in this country before they apply for workers from abroad. 
Now, a high-tech facility in New Mexico announced a hiring freeze and refused to accept job applications, but at the same time they brought in 53 foreign workers under the H-1B visa program. Alan Ezer, a 45-year-old computer programmer with 10 years of experience in the field, has kept his skills up to date. He was willing to take a cut in pay to stay in the industry. After he was laid off, he sent out 150 resumes. He got one job interview and no job offers. Rose Marie Roo is an experienced computer programmer. When no one would hire her to do computer work, she and her husband opened a bed and breakfast in Florida. Peter Van Horn, age 31, with a masters degree in computer science, lives in California. Employers won't hire him either. The list goes on and on. 
Many of the Nation's high-tech firms are blatantly turning away qualified U.S. workers while appealing to Congress for more foreign workers. Not all but some. And those are the ones that need the attention. It is that kind of injustice these amendments which I will be introducing focus on. So this, too, must change. Employers should be required to state that they have made an effort to recruit in this country first. Some argue that if we impose these new requirements, the program will bog down in redtape. They say employers will have to wait too long to get their workers from abroad. 
Our solution, as I mentioned, is very simple. Employers must simply state on one sheet of paper they have laid someone off and that they have been unable to locate workers in this country. That is all. If you are concerned about redtape, then look at what the bill does. It transfers the program to the most overwhelmed and most backlogged agency in the Federal Government, the Immigration and Naturalization Service. It takes a year for American citizens to bring spouses or children here. That is supposedly our highest immigration priority, uniting citizens with their families, but it takes years just to process the paperwork to bring these families together. After 
individuals actually qualify for citizenship, it takes 2 years or even longer for them to have the forms completed. 
So we have an opportunity today to pass legislation that responds to the needs of the high-growth high-tech industry and our workers. We should increase the quota temporarily. We must provide our workers with the training they need to assure them that our immigration programs do not unfairly disadvantage them as they compete for the new jobs. 
Now, Mr. President, I will make some comments with regard to both of these amendments and then we can have some discussion. I will offer them with the understanding of the chairman so that we can move this process. 
Before going further, Mr. President, on the recruitment amendment, I know that Senator Abraham has announced the endorsement of this bill by certain groups. I have here in my hand 150 letters from American workers who are opposed to the bill. They are computer programmers and computer engineers who want a shot at these jobs. These are American workers. We believe they ought to be listened to. 
I might just selectively insert some of these letters, not to unduly burden the Congressional Record, but we have more than 150 and scores more back at the office. I will introduce a select group to be able to reflect the concern that these American workers have about this particular bill. 
It is interesting, Mr. President, when we were looking at what the needs were and we heard a good deal of testimony from different groups that one of the things that was pointed out by the General Accounting Office was the salaries in these particular areas have not increased effectively over time. At least some of the economists in the General Accounting Office found that sort of interesting because, generally speaking, when there is a greater demand for these kinds of skills, the salaries all go up. If you want to recruit people, with supply and demand, the salaries are going to increase, but they did not find that increase in the salaries. They sort of stayed standard in terms of other skilled occupations. That is where they had drawn some concerns about the legislation. 
Now, Mr. President, I would I ask unanimous consent that the time I now use be allocated to the recruitment amendment, if there is no objection.

Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. I will just make some brief comments here and then I will yield. 
My amendment says that before employers can bring in foreign workers under the H-1B visa program, they must attest that they have tried to hire U.S. workers first. 
These are good well-paying jobs created by the high tech American economy. My amendment assures that U.S. workers will get first crack at these jobs. If employers cannot find U.S. workers who are ready, able, and willing to do the job, then--and only then--should foreign workers be available. Employers should be required to recruit in Boston, Detroit, and Los Angeles before they recruit in other countries. 
We hear a great deal about the impressive contributions of foreign workers to our economy. We should welcome outstanding workers who are exceptional in their fields and have impressive track records of accomplishment. In fact, my amendment rolls out the red carpet for such workers. 
It exempts universities and non-profit research institutions from this requirement. The researchers they bring in from abroad under this program help to train college students for the future. There is no significant evidence of abuses in their recruitment. 
But 80 percent of the applications received under the visa program are for jobs paying $50,000 or less. Half the applications are for computer programmers, most of them at lower levels. A quarter of the applications are for health care workers, particularly physical therapists. Other applications are for teachers, accountants, dietitians, piano tuners, drafters, realtors, construction workers, and many others. 
Many of these workers are in the early stages of their careers. As the Republican views in the Committee report on this bill correctly note, `many H-1Bs are foreign students recruited off U.S. college campuses.' U.S. workers should have first priority for these jobs. 
In fact, American college students are specializing in computer studies in growing numbers. According to the Computer Research Association, the number of college students majoring in computer science increased by 91 percent from 1995 to 1997. My amendment will assure that when they graduate, they will not have to worry that they must compete with foreign workers for U.S. jobs. 
Some argue that this amendment creates unnecessary additional paperwork. In fact, the amendment requires only that employers attest--on a simple, one-page H-1B application form--that they have tried to recruit U.S. workers for the job and failed. They are required only to use recruitment procedures that are common for the industry. 
If the standard practice among computer companies is to post the job on the internet for five days, that's all they have to do to satisfy this requirement. 
The Labor Department does not investigate the application in advance of the foreign worker coming here. In fact, the Labor Department is required to act on the application within seven days. So all the employer would do, under my amendment, is complete the one-page form. Nothing more. 
Most high tech companies should have no problem meeting this simple requirement. They say they recruit in the U.S. constantly and still have hundreds of openings. 
All they have to do is check the box on the form, and send it in. 
The problem is that many American workers have applied for high tech jobs, only to be turned away. 
Peter Van Horn is a 31-year-old from Mountain View, California. He has a master's degree in computer science. He is an expert in computer graphics. But he can't get a job in his field. 
Bard-Alan Finlan is a computer engineer in his 40s. He knows the latest computer languages. He's received one interview in a year and a half, and still no job. 
Kurt Granzen is an electronics worker. He was laid off from a Silicon Valley firm after it started hiring H-1B workers. He has been unable to find a job in his field for the past four years, after hundreds of interviews. 
These well-trained U.S. workers deserve to know that we will not allow employers to bring in foreign workers before they have a fair opportunity to fill these jobs. 
I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.  
I see other colleagues who desire to speak so I will withhold at this time, Mr. President.

</TEXT>

<DOCNO>105-kennedy-ma-7-19980518</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, under this amendment, employers cannot lay off American workers and then import foreign workers to fill the same jobs. Believe it or not, it is perfectly legal today for an employer to lay off qualified American workers and replace them with foreign workers under the H-IB program, and unscrupulous employers have taken advantage of this loophole in the law. 
In recent weeks, we have seen announcements of layoffs from many of the biggest U.S. companies, and many of these companies have asked Congress to increase immigration quotas so they can bring in more workers from abroad. We owe it to those laid-off U.S. workers to make sure their employers do not bring in foreign workers to fill their jobs. 
On April 13, the Wall Street Journal reported: 
The past couple of weeks have seen a steady drum beat of layoff announcements in industry sectors that until recently have complained about personnel shortages. 
The article included a long list of high-tech computer companies laying off thousands of workers. For example, on April 13, Intel Corporation announced plans to cut 3,000 jobs. Earlier in the month, Compaq Computer announced that it plans to lay off 15,000 workers as part of its merger with Digital, and the list goes on. Not all of these lost jobs are the same jobs that would be filled with foreign workers under the H-1B visa program. But we must be certain that no employer turns around and brings in a H-1B worker to fill a job from which American workers were laid off. 
Stephen Schultz of Modesto, CA, an engineer, was laid off in November of last year. While he was looking for a new job, his former company called him back to train the foreign worker they had brought in to replace him. Mr. Schultz filed a complaint with the Department of Labor, complaining that he had been laid off and displaced by the foreign worker, but this offensive practice is currently legal under the current law. There is nothing the Labor Department can do about it. And that is plain, fundamentally wrong. This amendment addresses that injustice. 
My amendment would give those laid-off workers a fighting chance. It says, `You have just been laid off. You are trying to feed your family. You are struggling to find a new job. So we will not compound your suffering by letting your former employer bring in a foreign worker to replace you.' 
As I mentioned earlier, I commend Senator Abraham for acknowledging the problem. But, as I mentioned, the layoff protections in the pending legislation, I think, do not do the job. They offer little help to working Americans who lose their jobs in today's changing labor market. But under this bill, employers don't have to promise that they have not--and will not--lay off U.S. workers as a condition of their participation in the program. Under this bill, the only time that an employer can be penalized for replacing U.S. workers with foreign workers is if the employer also violates other requirements of the H-1B program. 
That is under the Abraham proposal. It is not bad enough for an employer to lay off U.S. workers, but then they replace them with foreign workers. The employer has to underpay them to have some other violation of the law before the Labor Department can act. We believe that we should not displace American workers with foreign workers who are doing the same job--and we have language which effectively is the same in both bills; ours has a different triggering mechanism--we believe that we should not displace Americans with foreign workers who are doing the same job. That is what my amendment will do with regard to the layoff proposals. 
Under the current bill, the engineer that I mentioned who was laid off in Modesto would have a case only if the employer who laid him off violated some other requirement of the program. He could be laid off, so to speak, as I understand the Abraham proposal, and they could hire another worker for his identical job, pay him less and, as in this particular case, if this person who was laid off wanted to, he could come back and train his replacement, and that American worker would virtually have no cause of action. 
Under the current bill, an employer can lay off 1,000 American workers and bring in 1,000 H-1B workers to replace them as long as the employer pays them the same wage, and it is OK. Some argue that employers are unlikely to go through the effort to lay off an American to replace with a foreign worker. They cite studies to suggest foreign workers are actually paid higher wages than their American counterparts. If that is the case, then the employer should have no problem attesting, as a condition of their participation in the visa program, that they have not and will not lay off U.S. workers. 
The fact is, employers do lay off American workers and replace them with foreign workers. That happens to be the information that we have. They want foreign workers because such workers are less likely to complain if their hours are extended and their working conditions are not as good. The Labor Department inspector general found that 75 percent of employers in the program could not even document that the wage they paid the foreign worker was the proper prevailing wage, and unscrupulous U.S. employers also want foreign workers because they are less likely to protest long hours and harsh working conditions. If they do, they know they may lose their jobs and have to leave the country. 
An American software developer called my office recently and asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisal by his employer. He spoke of how the high-tech firms are abusing their foreign workers. He said, `I had a good talk with an H-1B worker. He told me he was so anxious to work in this country that he would accept any salary. Even a pitifully low salary by our standards was high in his country. He has been here for 6 months and working 80-plus hours a week. The company knows they can pick up a well-educated foreign worker who will work many more hours for half as much salary. I have seen this, en masse, first hand.' 
The unscrupulous employers who engage in these flagrant abuses put honest employers at a severe competitive disadvantage. 
Mr. President, what happens is, the American worker is displaced and that impacts that American worker. But if they get some foreign workers and then work them harder and longer, they have a competitive advantage over a company that just has 
American workers, and that threatens those American workers. The other company that has foreign workers is competing with the company that has American workers, and they are not meeting their responsibilities. 
All we are trying to do is make sure that all play the game by the same rules by which so many companies are willing to play. We want to make sure we are not creating abuses, which have been recognized in the past, and we want to make sure that, since we are expanding this program, we are going to give American workers first shot; we are not going to displace American workers, and we are going to give them the first shot at those jobs. Also, we are going to work out a training program over the period of this legislation so that at the end of the 5 years, we will have in place a training mechanism so that these jobs--the 80 percent which go to families earning less than $75,000, good jobs--will be going to Americans because they are going to have the training to do so. That is effectively what we are saying, Mr. President. 
We need to address the abuses. We need to protect the workers. We should outlaw the abuses to protect the vast majority of American employers who play by the rules. We are protecting the American businessmen who are playing by the rules. They are playing by the rules because they are paying a fair salary for these computer experts and they are respecting them for their working conditions and are out there competing fair and square, while someone who is unscrupulous brings in the foreign worker in these circumstances and, in too many circumstances, displaces the American worker and has that worker working longer hours and under more difficult conditions. You have one worker who has already lost his or her job, and if you get several workers, they are going to be able to compete on an uneven playing ground with the American firm. 
All we are saying is, No. 1, you can't displace an American worker with a foreign worker; No. 2, you have to at least attest that you have made a reasonable effort to hire an American worker; and, No. 3, we are going to work out the training program so that at the end of this program, in a period of years, we are going to have sufficient training so that Americans are going to be qualified to get those jobs, which are good jobs. That is what this issue is really about, Mr. President. 
I did not want to leave the impression, but in my earlier comments, on which my staff has corrected me, if the foreign worker is paid less than Abraham, then the Abraham layoff does kick in, assuming a worker complains. 
My point is, under Abraham, they can lay someone off as long as they meet the other rules of the program. They can still lay off the American worker. They see a layoff as a freebie, a free ride for employers who want to bring in the foreign workers. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, currently the Labor Department can investigate violations under the H-1B program only if a complaint has been filed by an aggrieved party. The complaint can be filed by a temporary foreign H-1B worker, and affected American workers. Few complaints are filed because workers are afraid of retaliation. And the H-1B workers are afraid if they complain, they could lose their jobs and then have to leave the country. American workers are afraid they will be blackballed in the industry if they complain. 
So this amendment offers them the whistle-blower protection, and it penalizes employers if they retaliate against a whistleblower. So whether the whistleblowers are H-1B workers or affected American workers, the employer cannot retaliate against them. 
In addition, under my amendment workers who filed a successful complaint against an employer can switch jobs if they wish and still remain in the United States for the duration of their visa. They just have to let the INS know their new address.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I note that this bill contains authorization for programs that will assist in educating and training American workers for these positions. It is essential that we include education and training provisions within this bill, but I believe it is important that we go further. 
In particular, I believe that employers who are using this program to fill short term needs should also contribute to programs that will educate and train American workers to fill these positions in the future. If we are going to increase the immigration quota, then I believe we have an obligation to assure American workers that they can get the training to compete for these goods jobs. 
So Mr. President, I would hope that as this bill moves forward, we can continue to work together to secure funding for these programs as an integral component of this legislation, and in ways that assure that we are not taking away resources from other training programs to meet this need.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just while my friend from the State of Washington is here, I would ask him if he would read through both the amendments which I intend to offer about protection against displacement of U.S. workers, because the Senator has misstated what my amendment does and then differed with it. The amendment is very clear. It says: 
For purposes of this section the term `replacement' means the employment of the nonimmigrant at the specific place of employment in the specific employment opportunity from which the United States worker with substantially equivalent qualifications and experience in the specific employment opportunity has been laid off. 
That is identical language to what is in the Abraham amendment. So it is difficult--when the Senator talks about Microsoft talking about laying off some employee, not being able to hire someone for 6 months is completely inaccurate. I intend to speak further, but if the Senator wanted to make some comment I would be glad to hear it. But I hope perhaps he might look at page 2 at the definitions of the amendment and I think he would find it is different from what the Senator has stated.

Mr. KENNEDY. Well, Mr. President, this is the problem. Some companies distort and misrepresent what these amendments are. All The Senator has to do is read the amendment. In the recruitment area, our amendment says: 
Take such steps to include a good faith recruitment in the United States using procedures that meet industry-wide standards. 
Those are industry-wide standards. All we are trying to do is protect American workers. If there is a job out there and an American can do it, we are saying let him or her have the first crack at it. Let's not displace an American worker with a foreign worker and then find the corresponding pressure that is put upon them. 
As I mentioned before, over 90 percent of the workers who are coming in are making $75,000 or less. So it is difficult for me to listen to the Senator from Washington talk about the kind of esoteric job he was looking at in terms of what might be needed for Microsoft and relating it to the more than 90 percent of workers who earn less than $75,000 per year. These are the workers--75 percent earn less than $50,000 and 16 earn more than $75,000. It seems to me we ought to be able to develop the training programs for those workers. 
I would like to read through a few of the letters we have here that I mentioned earlier. One is from February of this year from Mr. Whittlinger in Torrance, CA. 
Chalk up a Republican's support for your stand on not allowing foreign high tech immigrants in until and unless more Americans are given a chance first. I am unemployed (downsized) and cannot get a job, yet I see companies bring in foreign programmers over hiring me who is already trained (although perhaps not to latest technology/ program languages). But I also see a reduced quality and wages (which I think is the primary goal of these companies.) 
This is from a technology information worker who expressed his views on this particular provision. 
Jay Roberts from the State of Maryland writes: 
Currently, I work in the information industry as a senior level individual. My observation is there is little if any shortage. 
This is a recruiter who says he is in the information industry. And he says: 
We are quite capable of hiring all the qualified help that we need at currently prevailing wages. Should there be any question on this point, prepare the most qualified software resume of which you can think and send it to Microsoft. There is a 95 percent chance that they will not even acknowledge it. 
There not being a true software professional shortage makes us face this for what it is--the H1B program is in effect an indentured servant program. H1B workers typically work at lower wages than Americans, and with less complaint. * * * * * 
The current technology revolution has the promise of restoring broad middle class prosperity, which has been severely eroded. . . . * * * * * 
If wages do increase to reflect temporary shortages, this soon corrects itself by more college graduates and career challenges. * * * * * 
Please demonstrate that you support the goals, prosperity, and future of your constituency by opposing increases in the H1B quotas. Furthermore, please begin efforts to force H1B employers to proactively demonstrate that they are hiring and training U.S. citizens prior to any H1B approval. 
This is to President Clinton on the same issue, from Mr. Burns, of Portland, OR. 
If companies are truly so desperate for engineers they should try raising salaries or expanding in areas of the US outside of Silicon Valley. And if the visa limit must truly be raised, then companies who hire H1B engineers should be willing to never layoff US citizen engineers, but I doubt they'll ever accept that. 
High-Tech companies are always in favor of a free market and want to limit government intervention. But, when it comes to employment, they demand special treatment rather than letting supply and demand dictate salaries. 
I guess he must be referring to what the GAO report showed, that there hadn't been any noticeable, significant increase in salaries in these areas. Generally, when you get a shortage of the professional personnel, salaries go up: Supply and demand. The GAO review of the Commerce Department's study indicates there is no increase, virtually, in these salaries. That is what we are seeing, and we are hearing from a lot of these American workers, who are trying to find employment. 
Here is a letter dated February of this year: 
Dear Mr. President, 
I am graduating with a degree of computer science this spring. I am in deep debt and hope to find work quickly so I may repay it. 
If you allow them to raise or eliminate the current 60,000 person quota on foreign computer workers it will be nothing less than a knife in my heart. * * * * * 
I hope you are on the side of indebted college students on this one. 
You know, the list goes on. Here is the letter from Martin Rojo, San Mateo. He said: 
. . .I am a professional software engineer who conducts hiring interviews. I can state that in my experience there is no shortage of qualified workers. While it is rare that someone exactly matches a job description in the esoteric world of software and hardware, the candidate's mental acumen is a more important indicator of success than any specific language or platform. 
The real purpose behind any attempt to lift visa restrictions is, in my opinion, to allow importation of cheap labor. Part of my past coworkers were hired on H-1B visas, and they were tied to an employer in the manner of an indentured servant, while perfectly qualified American citizens did not get the job. This might be fine in farm labor, but there are many Americans who would fill the open positions if allowed. 
We are basically saying OK, let's increase the numbers in a temporary way. But let us also develop training programs so Americans can fill those jobs in the future. And let's say no to displacing American workers with foreign temporary workers. And let's also say that there must be at least minimum efforts to recruit Americans, following whatever the industry standard is. 
All they have to do is attest, check the box, `We have followed the industry standard and attest we have tried to hire an American.' 
I find it difficult to understand, among our colleagues here--what is wrong with seeking American workers for these jobs? What is wrong with just asking employers to observe a requirement to recruit American workers? That is what these amendments do. They ensure that employers are at least going to make an effort to try to recruit Americans and make assurance they are not going to lay off Americans and to displace those Americans from a job that will then be filled by a foreigner. 
It seems to me, if we had those two measures and an effective training program, then we could respond to whatever the needs of the information technology industry are for the best and the brightest workers. 
But it comes down, Mr. President, to what we do for American workers who, despite doing a good job, in many instances, have been displaced. We find out that there is basic prejudice and discrimination against them. I think that is wrong. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose this legislation and I urge the Senate not to invoke cloture. 
Star Wars was a bad idea in the 1980s, and it is a bad idea today. Developing and deploying a national missile defense system has an enormous cost--billions of dollars a year to develop the system, and billions more to deploy it. 
In addition, it ignores more likely threats to our security, especially the danger of terrorist attacks on our territory and our citizens. 
Intelligence estimates suggest that there will not be a new, intercontinental ballistic missile threat from any rogue nation until at least 2010. At a time when we are trying to balance the budget and meet the essential readiness and modernization needs of our armed forces, it would be a mistake to spend additional billions of dollars on the proposed missile defense system. 
Throughout the Cold War, when the Soviet Union had a far larger nuclear arsenal than today, we decided not to deploy missile defenses because the cost did not justify the protection provided. Now, the Cold War is over. We have far more cooperative relations with Russia and other nations of the former Soviet Union, and they have a much smaller nuclear arsenal. The Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff tell us that now is not the time to deploy a national missile defense. It makes no sense to reject that advice and push ahead on this costly system. 
Declaring our intention to deploy a missile defense system now will also put U.S. policy on a collision course with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Such a step would send a strong signal to Russia that cooperation on nuclear arms reductions is not a U.S. priority. 
In fact, members of the Russian Parliament have stated that they will oppose ratification of the START II Treaty if the United States begins to develop or deploy ballistic missile defenses in violation of the ABM Treaty. By endangering the prospects for START II ratification by Russia, this bill will ensure that we will face many thousands more Russian nuclear weapons in the near future than we will face if arms reductions are implemented. 
This bill also fails to address the most pressing threats to American security. As the World Trade Center bombing and the Oklahoma City bombing make clear, we do face a serious threat of terrorist attacks. But, it is far more likely, for example, that a terrorist will use nuclear, chemical or biological weapons on American soil than that we will be the target of an ICBM attack from a foreign nation. Loose controls on nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union raise the serious threat that such materials can find their way into the hands of extremists bent on using them. This bill fails to address these far more likely threats. 
We should continue to do all we can to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons materials. The Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program has removed thousands of nuclear warheads from former Soviet arsenals, destroyed hundreds of missile launchers, and has safeguarded vulnerable stockpiles of nuclear materials. The nuclear tests conducted by India earlier this week are a wake-up call to the United States and all nations that our efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation are inadequate. We should do nothing to undermine that high priority even further. 
This body has also rightly funded systems to protect our troops from ballistic missile threats and cruise missile threats. To deal with the possibility of future ballistic missile threats to U.S. territory, we have worked with the Administration to prepare a plan that will give us ample time to deploy a missile defense system if the need is clear. Our military leaders continue to agree that this plan is the most sensible way to protect the nation against potential future missile threats. 
We need a strong defense, but we must give the highest priority to meeting the most serious threats. Failure to do so will waste billions of taxpayer dollars, and leave the nation less secure. I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, President Clinton and Democrats in Congress strongly support a fair increase in the minimum wage. The economy is in a period of record growth. The stock markets are at an all time high. Unemployment continues to fall to its lowest level in a quarter century. Yet, too many workers on the bottom rungs of the economic ladder are not receiving their fare share of this prosperity. 
Most Americans recognize that the minimum wage is not yet a living wage. According to an April NBC/Wall Street Journal Poll, 79 percent of those questioned support an increase. 
Time and again, opponents state that increases in the minimum wage are harmful to the economy, and especially harmful to minority communities. But such statements have no basis in fact, as the current evidence makes clear. 
In his recent `To Be Equal' column published in over 300 African-American newspapers across the country, Hugh Price, President of the National Urban League, strongly endorses the increase in the minimum wage that many of us have proposed, from its current level of $5.15 an hour to $5.65 an hour on January 1, 1999 and to $6.15 an hour on January 1, 2000. The National Urban League has played a prominent role in the civil rights community for over 80 years. Its 114 affiliates in 34 states and the District of Columbia are at the forefront of the battle for economic and social justice for all Americans.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, later today, we are voting on a motion by Senator Gramm to recommit the conference report on the Agricultural Research bill. I strongly oppose Senator Gramm's motion. 
The 1996 welfare law allows refugees to receive federal benefits, including SSI, Medicaid and food stamps, for their first five years in the United States. It made this exception because refugees and asylum-seekers generally come to the United States with little more than the shirts on their backs after escaping persecution abroad. They have no sponsors. The may have disabilities which make it difficult to work. They need time to get on their feet, and begin to recover from the persecution they fled in their former country. 
After five years in the United States, refugees can apply for citizenship. Unfortunately, there are serious backlogs of naturalization applications at INS. In many parts of the country, it takes two years to complete the naturalization process and obtain citizenship--and these backlogs are not expected to go down in the near future. Often, the earliest a refugee will gain citizenship is after seven years in the United States. 
As we did last year with SSI and Medicaid, the Agricultural Research bill extends the time that a refugee can receive food stamps from five to seven years. Senator Gramm wants to deny this extension to refugees who entered the United States after the welfare law was enacted. 
If we do not extend this time limit from five to seven years, thousands of refugees who have applied for citizenship could lose food stamps as they wait in the naturalization backlog for their applications to be processed. 
This group includes refugees like Dien Nwin, who fled Vietnam in 1992 with his wife and children. Dien fought on the side of the United States during the Vietnam War and was imprisoned in a Communist re-education camp for 9 and-a-half years. He was worked hard and supported his family for over five years. He applied for citizenship, but he's stuck in the backlog. 
Now, Dien and his family have fallen on hard times. In the past two years, Dien has developed nasal cancer and lung cancer. He has been unable to work since then, and his family has had to use food stamps to survive. Dien is lucky. He entered the United States before the passage of the welfare bill. Under Senator Gramm's motion to recommit, Dien would be cut off from receiving food stamps after his initial five years in the United States. 
Last year, over 25,000 refugees came to the United States fleeing religious persecution in the Former Soviet Union. These refugees included Jews, Evangelical Christians, Mormons and other religious minorities fleeing the restriction of their religious liberties. Under Senator Gramm's amendment, these refugees will only be eligible for food stamps for their first five years in the United States. Since refugees cannot apply for naturalization until they have lived in the United States for five years, there will be a gap in their food stamp eligibility, depending on how long the naturalization backlog is at the time they apply. 
The naturalization backlog is expected to increase without an increase in INS funding. Record numbers of legal immigrants are applying for citzenship--more than a million per year. This number is not expected to decrease. 
Few actions are a more important part of our time-honored commitment to freedom around the world than opening America's doors to those who are denied freedom and face persecution in their own lands. 
Whether it is Vietnamese fleeing communism, Bosnians exiled by ethnic cleansing, Jews from the former Soviet Union fleeing anti-semitism, Burmese seeking safe haven from oppression, or Africans escaping political retribution and genocide, our refugee program stands ready to aid, protect, and resettle those who need our help. Part of such help is ensuring that these refugees' needs are met in their new home in this country. Those needs will not be met if their eligibility for food stamps is not extended to seven years. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose Senator Gramm's motion.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support passage of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act. It is a privilege to join Senator Jeffords, Senator McCain, and Senator Hollings in sponsoring this bipartisan legislation, which looks to the future by strengthening our national commitment to research and development. It also ensures the continued success of the teacher training and professional development programs of the NSF. In addition, it will improve science and math education from kindergarten to graduate school, and help maintain America's competitive edge into the 21st century. 
Few federal agencies deliver as much `bang for the buck' as the National Science Foundation. It is now funding 20,000 peer-reviewed science and education projects at more than 2,000 colleges, universities, schools, businesses and research facilities in all parts of the United States. 
Last year, these projects involved 27,000 senior scientists, 21,000 graduate students, 28,000 undergraduates, 110,000 precollege teachers, and 14,000 students from kindergarten through the twelfth grade. Almost 15 million people are affected by NSF activities through museums, television programs, videos, journals, and outreach activities. 
NSF accounts for 4 percent of total federal research and development funding. But it provides 25 percent of basic research support at academic institutions. It provides as much as half of all federal funding for research in fields such as mathematics, computer science, environmental science, and the social sciences. 
NSF also plays an important role in training teachers and developing math and science curricula to prepare students for tomorrow's challenges. It promotes innovative education programs in partnerships with colleges, universities, elementary and secondary schools, science museums, and state and local governments. These programs encourage the discovery of new knowledge and its application to real-world problems. 
NSF support for basic research and science education has also had 
an important role in encouraging economic growth over the last fifty years. According to a recent study, each dollar that the federal government spends on basic research contributes 50 cents or more to the national output each year. In other words, investing in NSF pays for itself in two years. These benefits are spread throughout the economy, enhancing the productivity of the nation's workforce and improving the quality of life for all Americans. 
At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for example, NSF funds have enabled scientists to explore the commercial applications of their research. Technology developed at MIT had a role in the launching of 13 companies in 1995. They manufacture products ranging from computer chips to communication networks. These enterprises have bolstered the state and local economies, and provided jobs and opportunities for many citizens. In fact, a 1997 report by BankBoston found that research and development at MIT has created 125,000 jobs in Massachusetts. 
In our state, NSF is funding a wide range of other projects on the cutting edge of research. NSF grants have been instrumental in building the state's biotechnology industry, mapping the oceans at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, developing new superconductors at the Material Research Science and Education Center at Harvard, and creating cooperative partnerships with schools, parents, businesses, and community organizations to strengthen math and science education. 
Nationwide, NSF grants cover a broad range of projects from providing health care to fighting crime to protecting the environment. Specific grants are improving the treatment of arrhythmia, facilitating more accurate identification of crime suspects, developing new biotechnology techniques to cleanup hazardous waste sites, enhancing the speed of semiconductors in processing information, and even analyzing the Antarctic meteorite to determine whether life existed on Mars. 
NSF funds benefit the humanities as well. The Next Generation Internet Project will give researchers access to information from the world's libraries and museums at rates that are 100 to 1,000 times faster than today's Internet. 
This authorization Act will put research and development on a more secure footing over the next two years. It will increase NSF funding by 10 percent in FY1999 and 3 percent in FY2000, which are consistent with the levels recommended in President Clinton's FY1999 budget. The increased funding will provide larger award amounts, so that scientists can undertake longer-range projects. 
The legislation also strengthens efforts to improve science, mathematics, engineering, and technology training for teachers and students. In addition, it authorizes the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the White House to prepare a report analyzing indirect costs, which play a vital but little understood role in federal R&D spending. 
The National Science Foundation is doing an outstanding job in fulfilling its missions. Passage of this bill will strengthen America's leadership in science and technology, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation. 
I congratulate our chairman for bringing us to this point in the legislative process.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at long last, we are about to pass the Agricultural Research, Extension and Education Reform Act conference report. I support all its provisions, but I want to speak briefly about one of the most important--the restoration of food stamps for legal immigrants whose benefits were unfairly eliminated by the harsh 1996 welfare law. Although the amount in this conference report is less than half of the $2 billion proposed in the President's budget, it is at least a down-payment toward restoring food stamps to the nation's neediest legal immigrants. 
The food stamp program was cut by $25 billion over 5 years in the 1996 law. That reduction was clearly unfair. According to the Department of Agriculture, at least 935,000 low-income legal immigrants lost their federal food stamps as a result of the 1996 welfare law. Nearly two-thirds are families with children. Two years later, we are finally remedying a significant part of this injustice. 
This bill restores food stamps only to the most needy legal immigrants--refugees, the disabled, and some poor children. It helps only 250,000 out of the 935,000 immigrants cut off from the food stamp rolls. No one should think our work is done with the passage of this bill. 
The effect of the food stamp terminations is not limited to immigrants. Their children born here are American citizens, but they too are facing sharp reductions in their food stamps. These children remain eligible for food stamps themselves, but the removal of their parents from the program means that, as a practical matter, the food stamp benefits for their families have been cut by 50 to 70 percent in many cases. 600,000 poor children who are American citizens live in families where food stamp benefits have been unfairly lost. These children will not be helped by this bill. 
Many elderly immigrants will also receive no assistance from this bill. We cannot forget about their plight. We can and must do more in the future. It is unconscionable that their benefits continue to be denied. 
So I regard this legislation as an important step, but only a first step.

I was an original cosponsor of Senator Daschle's legislation, which preceded the legislation authored by my colleague from New York, that guaranteed breast cancer patients a minimum length of stay in the hospital following a mastectomy. And I worked with the breast cancer community--patients and providers--to write and introduce a bill that would require plans that cover mastectomies to also cover reconstructive surgery, prostheses and treatment for lymphedema, a complication of the surgery. In fact, Senator D'Amato modified his original bill, which covered only reconstructive surgery, to conform it more closely to mine. We share a commitment to this legislation. 
But his proposal does not include other provisions that are in our bill and which are equally important to breast cancer patients, their families and their doctors. The following protections, all of which are in the Patients' Bill of Rights remain unaddressed in the legislation proposed by Senator D'Amato: 
It does not guarantee access to specialists--provisions that would allow an oncologist to act as a cancer patient's care coordinator, or would allow a patient to see an oncologist directly, without first making an unnecessary visit to a so-called `gatekeeper.' 
It does not ensure for a smooth transition between new and existing doctors for breast cancer patients and survivors whose employers change plans or whose plans change providers in the network. 
It does not include access to and coverage of participation in clinical trials, which can so often mean the difference between life and death for patients with nowhere else to turn. 
It does not establish the right to an independent and timely appeal--a critical feature for those times when coverage decisions fall into a grey area. 
It does not create access to prescription drugs that are not on the formulary, if they are medically indicated in the case at hand. 
It does not guarantee that emergency care will be covered, provided a layperson believed they were in an emergency. 
With the limited exception for post-mastectomy length-of-stay determinations, it does not fully restore the doctor-patient relationship by returning treatment decisions to the attending physician. 
Finally, it does not allow patients to hold health plans accountable for their medical decision-making. 
Clearly, the problems are not with what is in the bill, but with what is not in the bill. 
We are effectively precluded from including these particular provisions in the D'Amato proposal. And that is why these matters are linked, Mr. President. The items contained in our Patient Protection Act are critically important to breast cancer patients and survivors. Our bill has the broad support from virtually all the various cancer groups and breast cancer groups. But, if we move forward on only those included in the D'Amato proposal, we effectively preclude movement on the rest of the provisions. 
One can say, `Well, we are still making some progress.' I understand, but there is no reason in the world--none, no reason--that we cannot include these particular provisions for women today--none, make no mistake about it. 
We have had eight hearings on the issues relating to the Patients' Bill of Rights. I introduced the original legislation on this issue more than a year ago--over a year ago. The President's advisory commission, which included among its members representation from the business community and insurance industry, reported unanimously last November about what ought to be included in a patients' bill of rights. We have incorporated their recommendations in our bill. They are needed today by women across this country. 
All we are asking is for the opportunity to have the Senate debate and go on record with regard to these kinds of protections. But we are foreclosed from acting today. We are denied doing it. We cannot even get a reasonable period of time. The Republican leadership is sitting somewhere in this building. They could have listened to the exchange that was done by the Democratic leader and the Senator from New York. They know what is going on on the floor of the U.S. Senate. They can just come out here and say, `All right, you got it, you are going to have an opportunity to debate this issue; we won't have a time limitation, call the roll and let's have a debate on what is the No. 1 issue before American families.' But, no, we are precluded from that. 
You don't have to be around here a great deal of time to understand what is going on. We are effectively excluded because of the power of the insurance industry. Do you hear that? We are excluded from having an opportunity to debate this because of the power of the insurance industry. That is what is going on here. That is the issue this morning on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
The industry does not want to provide patients with the protections to which they are entitled and have paid for, and their allies in the Senate are holding this up, Mr. President, by using parliamentary techniques to deny us the chance to consider this legislation. We cannot get a report out of our Labor and Human Resources Committee. We cannot take it up on the floor of the U.S. Senate. It is time for action, and we are denied an opportunity, not just today, not just tomorrow, not just June, but anytime whatsoever--whatsoever. 
We are asking the Republican leadership to give us a time. Call the Democratic leader. Bring it up in 2 days. Bring it up in 2 weeks. Bring it up in a month. But give us a time to bring this up. That is what this issue is all about, and that is where we are going, Mr. President. We will bring this issue up time in and time out, again and again. We may be foreclosed now, but the American people are going to demand it. Those women who have or have had breast cancer are going to understand it and demand it as well. 
I yield the remaining time to the Senator from California. 
I thank the Senator from New York for granting the time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in the United States we have the best doctors and hospitals in the world, and the investments we have made in research pay off each day in the form of new therapies and procedures that save lives or dramatically improve the quality of life for countless patients. Yet, too many people are being denied access to medically necessary care by cost-driven insurance companies that are bent on putting profits before patients. 
People across the country are concerned. In a recent survey by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal, 80 percent of the respondents said passing a bill of rights, a health care bill of rights, a Patients' Bill of Rights, is very important--including 33 percent who said it was vital. 
So, what is wrong with today's health insurance system? We could ask Glenn Nealy's young widow. But before we go through that rather tragic story, I will just review very quickly the essential elements in our Patients' Bill of Rights. 
It guarantees the access to specialists and emergency rooms and other needed care. 
It expands the choices, which enable patients to select doctors and plans, and it removes the gag law which, in too many instances, denies doctors the ability to tell their patients about the best medical procedures to take care of their particular needs. 
It ensures independent appeals. If individuals find they are denied access to certain types of procedures, there will be an opportunity for an independent appeal--to make sure the kind of care that those individuals are receiving is really the best. 
It holds plans accountable for medical decisions. That is extremely important. We should not be excluding these health plans from accountability for the decisions that they make. I am confident that the good plans have nothing to fear from this proposal. They make medical decisions that are carefully considered and justified. But there are increasingly too many plans in this country that are putting the bottom line first and are not living up to their responsibilities. And there is no reason in the world that those plans should not be accountable, consistent with what the State laws provide. 
It restores the doctor-patient relationship. All patients who are being treated need to know they are receiving the treatment that is necessary from the medical point of view, rather than from the insurance company's point of view, or some accountant's point of view, back in an office that may be practicing almost cookbook medicine. That is, obviously, not in the interest of the patient and doctor. This is a proposal that allows doctors--who have dedicated themselves to good patient care and then find themselves restricted by the various HMOs and insurance plans--the opportunity to practice the best in medicine. 
And it establishes quality and information standards so patients have information available to them and are able to make informed and good judgments. 
As one who was the principal sponsor for HMO legislation in the 1970s, I am a great believer in using the concept of preventive medicine in the treatment of patients and in trying to build into our health care system the concept that the system should generate income for those who are going to keep the patients healthy, rather than reward a system that treats patients only when they are sick. That was a very basic and fundamental concept. The good HMOs, and we have many of them in my own State of Massachusetts, have done this. They have invested a great deal in preventing illness and disease. That is not a general feature of our health delivery system today. But some HMOs have done that and have been very aggressive in doing it, in keeping people healthy. In those areas where they have been very successful in keeping people healthy and then providing quality care for those who are sick, they are an extraordinary example for good health care delivery in this country today, and we salute them. We salute them. 
But, what we are finding is that these excellent groups are, too often and increasingly, put at a disadvantage by those who are 
going to represent that they are going to provide those kinds of services to the patients and then, when the time comes, cut back on those services because they are being driven by the economics of treatment of the patients and are making decisions that are based on interest in the bottom line of these HMOs, rather than what is in the interest of the patients. 
So we have developed legislation here in the Congress for the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is legislation that also has strong support over in the House of Representatives. There is a broad group of Members of this body who have supported this legislation. There is a very considerable number of our Republican colleagues and friends who have supported this and similar legislation--Congressman Norwood, Congressman Ganske and others in the House of Representatives. There are some differences in the proposals, but there is a general recognition of the need for action in this Congress. That is what we are hopeful of, at least having some action in this Congress. 
This past week, we attended to the abuses in the IRS and its reform. It seems to me that we ought to now turn to the abuses that exist out there in the delivery of health care systems which, in many, many instances, mean the difference between life and death. 
All of us were shocked and horrified after learning of the abuses of bureaucrats in the IRS and how they treated individuals. That was shocking for, I think, all Americans. We passed legislation responding to that. We acted quickly. 
We have even more egregious challenges that are facing patients across this country, and this issue demands action as well. It is really going to be a question of whether we are going to have the opportunity to debate these issues and come to a resolution on those items and do it in the next several days, because we do not have a great deal of time in this session. The time is moving on. We are now into May. Only about 75 legislative days remain before we move towards adjournment. 
I cannot think of many measures that are more important than having legislative action to debate and pass this, and to send it to the President. 
The President of the United States supports it. There is strong indication by the vote that we had during the budget consideration that almost half of the Members of this body support these concepts. And I believe if we have a full opportunity to debate and discuss these issues, we can certainly develop broad support for this type of legislation. 
There is strong support by the American Medical Association. There is strong support because doctors know what is at risk. There is strong support from consumers. We have the support of more than 100 organizations across the country, representing all different factions of the health care system. That is an extraordinary--extraordinary--group of representatives who have strong interests in different aspects of our health care system. But I daresay, I rarely see that kind of a coalition support legislation. When they do, we ought to at least have an opportunity to address it on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We should not be effectively denied that opportunity, and we won't be denied that opportunity. 
We will not be denied that opportunity, Mr. President, because the great majority of American people believe that we should address this issue. And those of us who are in strong support of the bill that has been introduced by Senator Daschle, and of which many of us are cosponsors, know where there are areas of this bill that can be altered or changed. But we ought to have that opportunity on the floor of the U.S. Senate to do so. 
What is not right is telling the American patients in this country, telling the doctors in this country, telling the families in this country who have suffered abuses of the managed care system that, `You are going to be denied any kind of redress.' That is effectively what we will be saying if we do not have the opportunity to debate this issue. 
Mr. President, let me give you an example. We have been listening to these examples over the past several days. They go on and on. People may say, `Well, you can always find one or two instances out there, and that is not a sufficient reason that we ought to provide a patients' bill of rights.' 
Of course, that is hogwash, Mr. President, when you look at the range of challenges and problems we are facing in local communities across the country. The type of situation that I will mention in a moment is being replicated every single day in communities all across this Nation and cries out for action, and action we will have, Mr. President. Let me assure you: There is no shortage of tragic stories about families who have been hurt by the current system. And we will continue to raise these examples until this body passes legislation to address the abuses. 
I mention this morning a story about a young man, Mr. President, a gentleman called Glenn Nealy. Glenn had a heart condition and was under the care of a cardiologist. In March of 1992, his employer switched health plans, and Glenn chose a new plan after gaining assurances from the plan's agent that he would be allowed to continue seeing his cardiologist from the old plan. He was told that he simply had to choose a plan doctor as his primary care physician and that the plan doctor would then refer 
him to his current cardiologist for continued treatment. 
We are talking about access to a specialist for care that is clearly needed by the patient. Here is a young person, a worker, who changes health plans. He is concerned about changing health plans, but it is represented to him that he can change and continue to use his cardiologist who has been treating him for many months. He goes ahead and signs up with this new program, but he has to follow the procedures to go to a primary care doctor before he can see his cardiologist. 
On April 9, 1992, Glenn went to see his new primary care doctor to obtain the referral to his cardiologist, but the new doctor refused to see Glenn because he was not yet issued his new HMO card. It was represented to him, if he switched, there would be a continuity of care, better services. He believed that he would be treated in this manner. He was given assurances of continued care under his cardiologist, and all he would have to do is effectively get the signoff from his new primary care doctor. So he went ahead. 
As I mentioned, he went this primary care doctor, and he was told that his new HMO card had not been prepared. For 3 weeks, Glenn contacted the plan's offices to get the necessary paperwork and was twice issued incorrect cards. When Glenn finally was able to see his new primary care physician, his request for a referral to his cardiologist was refused. 
The family had indicated that they never would have signed up for this plan if they were going to be denied access to that doctor. They were given the assurances that they were going to be able to have a continuity of care, but the primary care doctor said no. The doctor professed not to know the HMO rules governing referrals. 
In addition, Glenn's prescriptions to treat his heart condition went unfilled because the HMO provided incorrect information to the local pharmacy. Yet another instance of ineptitude that contributed to the tragic result. 
On April 29, the HMO formally denied Glenn's request because they had another so-called participating provider in the area. That means they have another provider. It was not the cardiologist that he wanted. He had no idea whether that cardiologist had the training, had the background, or experience of his old cardiologist. He was just told that there was a participating provider for the kind of services that he needed related to his heart. He was assigned, by the plan, a new doctor. 
The promises they made while recruiting Glenn to join their plan were meaningless. For 2 weeks, Glenn fought with the plan to continue care with his old doctor, but when faced with no care at all, he agreed to see the HMO's cardiologist. An appointment was made for May 19. 
But Glenn never saw the plan's cardiologist. Tragically, he suffered a massive heart attack on May 18, the day before his appointment. He left behind a wife and two children. Glenn was only 35 years old. 
This should not happen in America. Health plans must be held responsible for the information they give patients, and patients must have the right to access the care that they bought with their premiums. It is fundamentally unfair to provide HMOs with immunity from bureaucratic decisions that mean the difference between life and death. 
Mr. President, we must take up and pass meaningful patient protections this year in the Congress. The legislation, as I mentioned, is supported by more than 100 groups representing millions of patients, health care professionals, and working families. We have the bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights, to prevent tragedies like this from occurring. Our bill would protect and restore the doctor-patient relationship. 
Our bill would guarantee that a change in plans does not mean an abrupt change in providers. Our bill would allow the Glenn family to hold their plan accountable for their negligence. 
The Senate must show the American people whether they stand with the patients or with the greedy guardians of the status quo. 
So next week the Senate may turn to a bill targeted only to breast cancer issues, but the women's community and the breast cancer community and the broader coalition of patients and professionals support comprehensive managed care reform legislation. They want the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
They understand the need for the Patients' Bill of Rights because this legislation will provide access to important clinical trials. Clinical trials are critical to promoting the discovery of new life-saving treatments and therapies. They offer hope and opportunity for patients who have nowhere else to turn. 
This will be the new century of life sciences. No one can help but pick up the newspaper every single day and find these extraordinary--extraordinary--changes that are taking place, to the benefit of all mankind. Whether we are discussing pharmaceutical breakthroughs, various kinds of surgical procedures, or other treatments--these discoveries are all taking place at this time. 
Those that have been afflicted with the terrible tragedy of breast cancer want to be able to participate in clinical trials. And they will be guaranteed that under the Patients' Bill of Rights. But they will not be guaranteed it under the legislation that has been referenced briefly here on the floor this last week. 
These women need access to the right specialists. They will be guaranteed that under our bill--but not under the other legislation--and they need to know that care will not be abruptly interrupted when the plans change. 
Mr. President, our bill includes the right to an independent and timely appeal, but the other bill does not. If a breast cancer patient or her doctor believe that she is not getting the kinds of treatment, she must have the right to be able to go through her HMO and, if necessary, outside the HMO for a timely appeal. Time is of the essence in these situations. Results are needed quickly--quickly. 
Let me be clear. I am strongly opposed to drive-through mastectomies. I cosponsored Senator Daschle's legislation to end that practice. And I believe strongly that insurance companies that cover mastectomies have an obligation to also cover reconstructive surgery and prostheses when a woman has had to have a mastectomy. I have worked closely with National Breast Cancer Coalition and many others to correct these injustices. But these two proposals address only a small portion of the serious problems faced by women with breast cancer. These are both included in our comprehensive bill, but they are augmented by additional matters that are of enormous continued importance to those same patients. 
We are guaranteeing them in our bill access to the kind of specialty care, the critically important clinical trials, and the ability to hold the plan itself accountable. And when you have a process whereby you can hold a plan accountable, where you have the possibility of enforcement, then you have real rights. When you do not have the ability to enforce something, then that right is not meaningful. 
That is true across the board. You can pass laws every day about burglary and robbery and other crimes, but unless you are going to have a penalty, those laws are meaningless--they are meaningless. That is what we understand. We want to have those various plans held accountable for the decisions they make. 
Mr. President, the HMOs that are providing good quality medicine have nothing to fear. It is understandable because they are living up to these kinds of quality challenges. They are at a competitive disadvantage by those plans that are trying to trim and reduce services, and therefore claim that they are providing the same range of services but doing so on the cheap. The obvious result is a diminution in care for those patients, and in a number 
of instances even the loss of life for those patients. And that is wrong. 
Mr. President, many Americans have seen that movie, `As Good As It Gets.' I think people understand this issue very well. Helen Hunt won an Oscar for her role in this movie. In it, she delivers a sharply worded criticism of her son's managed care plan, and audiences across the country erupt in laughter and applause. These hoots and the hollers make it very clear that the American people understand what is happening in too many of these managed care systems. 
Everyone loves their managed care system until they get sick. Then we find too many instances where managed care becomes mis-managed care. 
So, Mr. President, I am very hopeful that we can come to a full debate and discussion on this issue. It is a matter, as I mentioned, of life and death in many circumstances. Our colleagues on the floor of the Senate have given these examples. And these examples are not going to go away. The problem is not diminishing; the problem is increasing. This is an area that cries out for action, and the American people deserve no less. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 
it is an honor to introduce President Clinton's Education Opportunity Zones bill to strengthen urban and rural public schools where the need is greatest. Congress needs to do more to improve teaching and learning for all students across the nation, and that means paying close attention to school districts and children with the greatest needs. 
Too many schools now struggle with low expectations for students, high dropout rates, watered-down curricula, unqualified teachers, and inadequate resources. This legislation will lead to the designation of approximately 50 high-poverty urban and rural school districts as `Education Opportunity Zones,' and help them to implement the effective reforms needed to turn themselves around. 
These school districts will become models of system-wide, standards-based reform for the nation. They must agree to specific benchmarks for improved student achievement, lower dropout rates, and other indicators of success. Schools in these districts will also be eligible for greater flexibility in the use of federal education funds. 
Our goal is to increase achievement, raise standards, upgrade teacher skills, and strengthen ties between schools, parents, and the community as a whole. Under this proposal, schools can use effective reform measures such as ending social promotion, increasing accountability, improving teacher recruitment and training, and providing students and parents with school report cards. 
We know that this approach can work. Last fall, I visited the Harriet Tubman Elementary School in New York City, where 95 percent of the pupils are from low-income families. Before 1996, it was one of the lowest achieving schools in the city. In September, 1996, the principal, the superintendent, teachers, and parents worked together to reorganize the school. They put extra resources into training teachers to teach reading. They upgraded the curriculum to reflect high standards. They created a parent resource center to increase family and community involvement. These and other reforms worked. 
Each day, many parents are at the school too, helping maintain discipline and at the same time expanding their own education. 
Each morning, teachers stop their regular classwork and teach reading to their students for 90 minutes. Since 1996, scores on statewide reading exams have risen by 20 percent. 
In Boston, under the leadership of Superintendent Tom Payzant, schools are making significant progress by creating new curriculum standards, setting higher achievement standards, and expanding technology through public and private sector partnerships. They are focusing on literacy, after-school programs, and school-to-career opportunities. 
These successes are not unusual. Public schools can improve even when facing the toughest odds. We need to do all we can to help such schools get the resources they need, so that they can implement the changes they know will work and help children learn more effectively. 
Under the Education Opportunity Zone approach, urban and rural school districts can apply for funds to implement a wide range of reforms. School districts will apply to the Secretary of Education for three-year grants. The Secretary will ensure a fair distribution of grants among geographic regions, and among various sizes of urban and rural schools districts. 
In determining the amount of each grant, the Secretary will consider factors such as the scope of activities in the application, the number of students from poor families in the school district, the number of low-performing schools in the district, and the number of low-achieving children in the district. 
This legislation proposes funding of $200 million in fiscal year 1999 and $1.5 billion over the next 5 years to support these grants. 
I commend President Clinton for developing this worthwhile initiative, and I look forward to its enactment. Investing in students, teachers, and schools is one of the best investments America can make. For schools across the nation, help can't come a minute too soon.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleagues Senator Kerrey, Senator Bond, Senator Durbin, and Senator DeWine in sponsoring this legislation to assure adequate funding for resident training in independent children's teaching hospitals. 
These hospitals, such as Children's Hospital in Boston, have 60 pediatric training programs. They represent less than 1 percent of the training programs across the country, yet these hospitals train 5 percent of all physicians, 25 percent of all pediatricians, and the majority of many pediatric subspecialist. 
Too often today, these hospitals are hard-pressed for financial support. Medicare is the principal source of federal funds that contributes to the costs of graduate medical education for most hospitals, but independent children's hospitals have few Medicare patients, since Medicare coverage for children applies only to end-stage kidney disease. Medicaid support is declining, as the program moves more and more toward managed care. 
No hospital in the current competitive marketplace can afford to shift these costs to other payers. As a result, many children's hospitals find it very difficult to make ends meet. 
In 1997, all teaching hospitals relieved a $76,000 in Medicare graduate medical education support for each medical resident they trained, but the average independent children's teaching hospital received only $400. 
Last year, Children's Hospital in Boston lost over $30 million on its patient operations. Two-thirds of this loss was directly attributable to the direct costs of graduate medical education. Will limited resources and increasing pressure to reduce patient costs, such losses cannot continue. 
The academic mission of these hospitals is vital. Since its founding as a 20-bed hospital in 1869, Children's Hospital in Boston has become the largest pediatric medical center and research facility in the United States, and an international leader in children's health. It is also the primary teaching hospital for pediatrics for Harvard Medical School. For eight years in a row, it has been named the best pediatric hospital in the country in a nationwide physicians' survey conducted by U.S. News and World Report. 
Clinicians and investigators work together at the hospital in an environment that fosters new discoveries in research and new treatments for patients. Scientific breakthroughs are rapidly translated into better patient care and enhanced medical education. We must assure that market pressures to not interfere with these advances. 
Independent children's hospitals deserve the same strong support that other hospitals 
receive for graduate medical education. The current lack of federal support is jeopardizing the indispensable work of these institutions and jeopardizing the next generation of leaders in pediatrics. 
Congress needed to do all it can to correct this inequity. This legislation we are introducing will provide stop-gap support stabilize the situation while we develop a fair long-run solution to meet the overall needs of all aspects of graduate medical education. I look forward to early action by the Senate on this important measure.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 1/2 minutes. 
Mr. President, as was stated by the Senators from Ohio, Vermont, and Minnesota, in just a few moments we are going to vote on this legislation, which will make such a very, very important difference for millions of Americans. 
I want to express my very deep sense of appreciation for the really excellent work that has been done by the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator DeWine, and our friend and colleague, Senator Wellstone, and the chairman of the full committee, Senator Jeffords. 
These are complex issues and involve a variety of different interests and various constituency groups. But we all have a common purpose and a common goal; that is, to try to make sure that America has the best trained workforce we could possibly have as we move into the 21st century. 
The process has not been easy. It has been an issue which our committee has over a very considerable period of time wrestled with. In 1970s, we attempted improving the CETA job training program. There were many, many problems in that program. In the early 1980s, we moved in a different direction. That direction was the Job Training Partnership Act, which attempted to refashion and shape our job programs with greater emphasis on private sector employment. It was the only domestic program that passed between 1980 and 1984. In many respects, it has worked well. But, the enormous technological changes we have seen in the workplace require new training initiatives. Since the early 1990s, we have been working to develop the most effective approach. 
Now I am very, very hopeful that those hours and days of hearings, and the very solid work that has been done by the Committee will result in passage of this landmark legislation. I hope it will now not only receive the overwhelming support of the Members of this body, but also that we can move ahead into the conference and reach an agreement worthy of all our support. 1998 should be the year that workforce legislation is enacted into law. It would mean so much for millions of Americans in need of educational and career training opportunities. 
We have had a fairly contentious Congress so far. But this, I think, has been an extraordinary example of the legislative process working. I think it is a real tribute overall to our chairman, Senator Jeffords, with his leadership. 
We are designing legislation for a workforce that will have probably seven or eight different jobs during their careers. Thirty years ago, if a person worked in the Fall River Shipyard in Massachusetts, his father worked there and his grandfather worked there before him, and he spent his entire career there. But now we know that for new entries into that workforce, they are going to have seven different jobs. 
With the global economy, we are going to find there are going to be new industries that are highly successful. There will be other industries that will be facing consolidation. We will have downsizing. We will have expansion. New skills that will be necessary. Individual workers will need access to training to update their skills throughout their working lives. 
This legislation will provide the opportunity to get that training. It is really a very, very important new concept and new idea, and one that I think can really ensure that our workforce is going to be the best in the world. 
We are talking about included in this legislation programs for individuals who are dislocated workers and others who are disadvantaged adults and youth. We are talking about individuals with disabilities who want to be able to work and pull their fair share. We are talking about at-risk youth. We are also dealing with adult literacy, and vocational education programs. Together, these programs will prepare the workforce of tomorrow. 
Mr. President, this is really, I think, a major achievement. I am enormously grateful to my staff: to Jeffrey Teitz, who has done an outstanding job on the workforce and education issues; and to Connie Gardner, who has done an extraordinary job on vocational rehabilitation. Jeffrey Teitz, along with Sherry Kaiman of Senator Jeffords' staff, Dwayne Sattler of Senator DeWine's staff, and Brian Ahlberg of Senator Wellstone's staff, worked for over a year to fashion the consensus legislation which we are considering today. I am proud of their work. I also want to recognize Patricia Morrissey of Senator Jeffords' staff on vocational rehabilitation. 
All of us who are in support of this legislation believe it will make America have the best educated and the best trained workforce in the world; and that those families who participate in these programs will have the great opportunities open to them. It will enable them to realize their own American dreams. I hope my colleagues will support it overwhelmingly. 
Mr. President, while employment training legislation has not received the same level of public attention as some other issues on this year's agenda, very few bills will have a greater impact on more Americans than the Workforce Investment Partnership Act. 
The importance of highly developed employment skills has never been greater. The gap in earnings between skilled and unskilled workers is steadily widening. For those who enter the workforce with good academic training and well-developed career skills, this new economy offers almost unlimited potential. However, for those who lack basic proficiency in language, math and science and who have no career skills, the new economy presents an increasingly hostile environment. 
An educated workforce has become the most valuable resource in the modern economy. Our nation's long term economic vitality depends on the creation of an effective, accessible, and accountable system of job training and career development which is open to all our citizens. Schools must assume more responsibility for preparing their students to meet the challenges of the 21st century workplace. Disadvantaged adults and out of school youth need the opportunity to develop job skills which will make them productive members of the community. Dislocated workers who have been displaced by the rapid pace of technological change deserve the chance to pursue new careers. Individuals with disabilities need the opportunity to fully develop their career potential. The way in which we respond to these challenges today will determine how prosperous a nation we are in the next century. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act, unanimously approved by the Labor and Human Resources Committee will provide employment training opportunities for millions of Americans. It responds to the challenge of the changing workplace by enabling men and women to acquire the skills required to enter the workforce and to upgrade their skills throughout their careers. It will provide them with access to the educational tools that will enable them not only to keep up, but to get ahead. 
The legislation is the product of a true bipartisan collaboration. I want to publicly commend Senators Jeffords and DeWine for the genuine spirit of bipartisanship which has made this effort possible. Senator Wellstone and I appreciate it. The resulting legislation will, I believe, truly expand career options, encourage greater program innovation, and facilitate cooperative efforts amongst business, labor, education and state and local government. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act is designed to provide easy access to state of the art employment training programs which are geared to real job opportunities in the community through a single, customer-friendly system of One Stop Career Centers. The cornerstones of this new system are individual choice and quality labor market information. 
No training system can function effectively without accurate and timely information. The frequent unavailability of quality labor market information is one of the most serious flaws in the current system. This legislation places a strong emphasis on providing accurate and timely information about what area industries are growing, what skills those jobs require, and what earning potential they have. Extensive business community and organized labor participation are encouraged in developing a regional plan based on this information. Once a career choice is made, the individual must still select a training provider. At present, many applicants make that choice with a little or no reliable information. Under this bill, each training provider will have to publicly report graduation rates, job placement and retention rates, and average earnings of graduates. 
Because of the extensive information which will be available to each applicant, real consumer choice in the selection of a career and of a training provider will be possible. The legislation establishes individual training accounts for financially eligible participants, which they can use to access career education and skill training programs. Men and women seeking training assistance will no longer be limited to a few predetermined options. As long as there are real job opportunities in the field selected and the training provider meets established performance standards, the individual will be free to choose which option best suits his or her needs. 
There is no challenge facing America today which is tougher or more important than providing at-risk, often out-of-school, youth with meaningful education and employment opportunities. Far too many of our teenagers are being left behind without the skills needed to survive in the 21st century economy. I am particularly pleased with the commitment which the Workforce Investment Partnership Act makes to these young men and women. This legislation authorizes a new initiative focused on teenagers living in poverty in communities offering them few constructive employment opportunities. Each year, the Secretary of Labor will award grants from a $250 million fund to innovative programs designed to provide opportunities to youth living in these areas. The programs will emphasize mentoring, strong links between academic and worksite learning, and job placement and retention. It will encourage broad based community participation from local service agencies and area employers. These model programs will, we believe, identify the techniques which are most effective in reaching those youth at greatest risk. 
This legislation also provides for the continuation of JobCorps and the Summer Jobs Program as essential elements of a comprehensive effort to help disadvantaged youth gain valuable training and work experience. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act includes titles reauthorizing major vocational education and adult literacy programs. Both programs will continue to be separately funded and independently administered. We have incorporated them in the Workforce Act because they must be integral components of any comprehensive strategy to prepare people to meet the demands of the 21st century workplace. 
Students who participate in vocational education must be provided with both strong academic preparation and advanced employment skills training. Recognizing this core principle, the legislation supports broad-based career preparation education which meets both high academic standards and teaches state-of-the-art technological skills. 
Adult literacy programs are essential for the 27% of the adult population who have not earned a high school diploma or its equivalent. Learning to read and communicate effectively are the first steps to career advancement. A leading authority on this issue, Professor Richard Wade of the City University Graduate Center in New York, has called adult literacy `America's Silent Scandal', and he's right. This legislation will increase access to educational opportunities for those people most in need of assistance and enhance the quality of services provided. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act will make it possible for millions of Americans to gain the skills needed to compete in a global economy. I urge all of my colleagues to support it. 
I yield the remainder of the time. 
I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Hyannis Fire Department recently honored Harold S. Brunelle of Hyannis by appointing him as Fire Chief. This honor is a well-deserved tribute to Chief Brunelle, his 26-year career with the Department, and his commitment to the community of Hyannis. 
Chief Brunelle was chosen after nation-wide competition for the position of Fire Chief, and he was selected unanimously for the position in a field of 34 applicants. 
Chief Brunelle joined the Hyannis Department in 1972 as a Junior Firefighter and rose through the ranks because of his great ability and dedication. His selection as Fire Chief demonstrates the town's confidence in Mr. Brunelle and their faith in his able service and leadership to the residents of the community. 
Hyannis and Massachusetts are proud of Harold Brunelle's appointment as Fire Chief. I congratulate him on this distinction, and I look forward to working closely with him in the years ahead.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at the outset I want to express appreciation on this side, not just for our committee but for all of our Democratic Members, to the chairman of our committee, and also to Senator DeWine, who is the chairman of the subcommittee. I know I speak for Senator Wellstone, who was very much involved in the development of this legislation, in thanking them for their leadership and for their work with all of us in bringing this legislation to the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
This is a very important piece of legislation. It is going to make a significant difference in the quality of life for millions of Americans. It has been a long, arduous task to bring us to 
where we are today. Senator Kassebaum had been very interested in initially seeing how we could consolidate and coordinate 126 different programs in six different agencies and try and make some sense with a newer kind of workforce. 
So many of these various workforce programs have been targeted to particular needs--people who lost work as a result of imports; people who lost work because of environmental considerations; young people who dropped out of school; older workers who have been dislocated. There was a wide range of programs, and there was a solid effort to try to develop and fashion various efforts to make some sense out of these programs and ensure that we were going to invest in our fellow citizens, young and old, and to do it in an effective way. 
It hasn't been easy. We have tried to address this, and I can remember the times when we were not effective in doing so. I remember the CETA program and all of its difficulties and challenges in later years, under the leadership of Senator Quayle at that time and the members of our committee. I welcomed the opportunity of joining with Senator Quayle as we developed the Job Training Partnership Act to give greater local control and local input in terms of a shifting economy. This has been an evolving process. 
We have done a constructive review of all of the various job training programs to find out, with the new challenges we are facing, how can we do better in meeting these various needs: what the role of vocational training is; what the role of adult education programs is going to be; how we are tying this into evolving changes in our workforce as a result of technology, as a result of a change in our competitiveness, and as a result of the downsizing we have seen that has impacted a lot of people who have good skills, but in a particular area, that perhaps may not be as necessary today as they were in another period of time. 
It is only as a result of the hard work of the chairman of our full committee and the chairman of the subcommittee that we have been able to work through the process and make a recommendation that reflects the best judgment of all the members of the committee and the solid judgment of many men and women, and local, State, and national organizations who have given a great deal of time and attention to this issue, and who know the strengths and weaknesses of what is happening out in the local communities and at the State level, that we can present this legislation to the Senate. It is one of the most important pieces of legislation that we will pass. 
There are various pieces of legislation that are above the radar screen, and there are some that are just below the radar screen. Many of those which come just below the radar screen in so many respects have a dramatic impact, a much more important impact on our fellow citizens than some of those that might be highly visible, highly volatile pieces of legislation. 
We welcome the chance to be here this morning to make these recommendations and, hopefully, to consider some of the amendments that have been recommended by our colleagues and then move towards passage on Tuesday. We are urging all of our colleagues to support this legislation. We hopefully will then move in a timely way into the conference with the House, moving it along, recognizing that we do have a compressed time period but understanding that on this legislation we are not going to fail. I wanted to at least make those brief observations before commenting on the legislation. 
An educated workforce has become the most valuable resource in the modern economy. Our Nation's long-term economic vitality depends on the creation of an effective, accessible, and accountable system of job training and career development which is open to all of our citizens. Schools must assume more responsibility for preparing their students to meet the challenges of the 21st century workplace. Disadvantaged adults and out-of-school youth need the opportunity to develop job skills which will make them productive members of the community. Dislocated workers who have been displaced by the rapid pace of technological change deserve the chance to pursue new careers. The way in which we respond to these challenges today will determine how prosperous a nation we are in the next century. 
The importance of highly developed employment skills has never been greater. The gap in earnings between skilled and unskilled workers is steadily widening. I think all of us are very much proud of the fact that we have a strong economy. The figures, even in today's papers, indicate that is so. Hopefully, as a nation with a common purpose, we want to make sure that all Americans are going to be participating in the strength of our economy and that it isn't going to be just segmented among those who are already in a more favorable economic stance. 
For that to happen, having good work skills is an absolutely essential element and ingredient in terms of giving individual Americans the opportunities to participate in a more meaningful way in our economic expansion. For those who enter the workforce with good academic training and well-developed career skills, this new economy offers almost unlimited potential. However, for others who lack basic proficiency in language, math, and science, and no new skills, the new economy presents an increasingly hostile environment. 
Over 3 million young men and women between the ages of 16 and 24 in this country did not complete high school and are not enrolled in school. Many more graduate from high school without the level of knowledge and skill that a high school diploma should represent. They will require more education and job training in order to obtain stable, well-paying employment. Without it, they are in danger of becoming a lost workforce generation. 
Effective job training is also essential to the success of welfare reform. More than 40 percent of those in the JTPA program for disadvantaged adults have come from welfare rolls. Under the welfare reform legislation, an additional 1.7 million people will be entering the job market. Most of these individuals have little or no work background and very limited employment skills. In many cases, they are also the sole support of young children. They are making urgent, new demands on a job training system that is already burdened beyond its capacity. There is an approximately $3 billion program that has been recommended by the administration in terms of employment. We have tried to work that out to be complementary to what we are doing here so we have a more consolidated effort in terms of trying to meet those particular needs in the welfare-to-work programs. 
In addition, the combination of rapidly changing technology and the shift of manufacturing jobs overseas is creating an alarming number of dislocated workers. These individuals have extensive work experience but their skills are no longer in demand. We must give them the opportunity for retraining and for the development of new skills to enable them to compete in the 21st century workplace. 
Even today, we are only, I believe, dealing with about 30 percent of those who would otherwise be eligible for those programs, so we know that the need is out there. We have a better way of addressing that need with this program. 
The accelerating pace of technological change has made much of the existing job training system obsolete. Broad reforms are needed to meet the demands of the modern workplace. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act, unanimously approved by the Labor and Human Resources Committee, will provide the employment training opportunities for millions of Americans. It responds to the challenge of the changing workplace by enabling men and women to acquire the skills required to enter the workforce and upgrade their skills throughout their careers. It will provide them with access to the educational tools that will enable them not only to keep up but to get ahead. 
Thirty or 40 years ago, in my own State of Massachusetts, if your grandfather worked in the Four Rivers Shipyard, his son worked in the Four Rivers Shipyard, and his grandson worked in the Four Rivers Shipyard. All got paid pretty good wages, all had pretty good lives, and all were able to provide for their families and be involved in the community. 
Today, everyone who enters the workforce is going to have 
seven different jobs--seven different jobs. We know that the private sector provides some training, but it is small and it is primarily among the white collar. Only about 7 or 8 percent of the major companies provide training programs, and that is divided between white and blue collar. So those that are the great workforce, the engine for most of these companies, with the exception of some very important and significant training programs from some excellent companies, do not receive the kind of training that is going to continually equip them to participate in our economy. Broad reforms are needed to meet the demands of a modern workforce. 
Mr. President, this, as I mentioned, represents the best judgment of the bipartisan efforts in our committee. I want to publicly commend Senators Jeffords and DeWine for the genuine spirit of bipartisanship which has made this effort possible. Senator Wellstone and I appreciate it. The resulting legislation will, I believe, truly expand career options, encourage greater program innovation, and facilitate cooperative efforts amongst business, labor, education, and state and local governments. 
I also want to recognize the important role that the President has given in bringing about reform in our current job training system. He has consistently emphasized the need for greater individual choice in the selection of career paths and training providers. The philosophy behind his skill grant proposal is reflected in our legislation. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act is designed to provide easy access to the state-of-the-art employment training programs which are geared to real job opportunities in the community through a single, customer-friendly system of One Stop Career Centers. Over 700 such centers are already operating successfully across the country. This legislation will ensure that every individual in need of employment services will have access to such a facility. The cornerstones of the new system are individual choice and quality labor market information. In the past, men and women seeking new careers often did not know what skills were most in demand, which training programs had the best performance. All too often they were forced to make one of the most important decisions of their lives based on anecdotes and late-night advertisements. 
An individual comes into the One Stop Career Centers and takes the various kinds of tests. If he wants to look at some new career possibilities, find out what his or her aptitude is in the areas of his skills, find out in what particular areas there are available jobs, and take a look at the various training programs for those particular jobs, that center will have access to that information: what jobs are there, whether the training programs really lead to jobs, and how those graduates of that particular training program are doing after 2 or 3 or 4 years. 
The individual will be able to make a judgment themselves about which training program is best suited for them, and know that they have the excellent opportunity of moving ahead into a training program. That is a concept that has been developed in a number of different areas. 
My own State of Massachusetts has a very innovative program that was developed initially through Governor Dukakis and has been strongly supported by Governor Weld and our current Lieutenant Governor Cellucci. Lieutenant Governor Cellucci actually came down and testified for us. The One Stop Career Center approach is an area where we have had strong bipartisan support and important involvement by management, as well as labor. 
No training system can function effectively without accurate and timely information. The frequent unavailability of quality labor market information is one of the most serious flaws in the current system. This legislation places a strong emphasis on providing accurate and timely information about what area industries are growing, what skills those jobs require, and what earning potential they have. Extensive business community and organized labor participation are encouraged in developing a regional plan based on this information. Once a career choice is made, the individuals must select a training provider. At present, many applicants make that choice with little or no reliable information. Under this bill, each training provider will have to publicly report graduation rates, job placement and retention rates, and average earnings of graduates. 
We have found in my own State of Massachusetts, with these consolidations in what we call the REBs, that we have much greater involvement of community-to-business and worker participation, 
because these programs have been united, with a common spirit and a common focus. There has been much greater interest, support, and effectiveness because of greater consolidation, as opposed to so much of the scattered programs that have been out there previously. 
Because of the extensive information that will be available to each applicant, real consumer choice in the selection of a career and training program will be possible. The legislation establishes individual training accounts for financially eligible participants, which they can use to access career education and skill training programs. Men and women seeking training assistance will no longer be limited to a few predetermined options. As long as there are real job opportunities in the field selected and the training provider meets established performance standards, the individual will be free to choose which option best suits his or her needs. 
An essential element of the new system we have designed is the accountability. The chairman has mentioned this. As we noted earlier, each training provider will have to monitor and report the job placement retention achieved by its graduates and average earnings. Only the programs that meet an acceptable performance will be eligible for receipt of public funds. The same principle of accountability is applied to those agencies administering State and local programs. They have been given wide latitude to innovate under the legislation, but they, too, will be held accountable, if their programs fail to meet the challenging performance targets. 
The rapid pace of technological training in the workplace has produced an alarming number of workers who have become dislocated in mid-career. The dislocation has been compounded by an increasing number of labor-intensive production employers relocating their businesses abroad. This trend has been particularly acute in the manufacturing sector. We have a special obligation to these dislocated workers who have long and dedicated work histories and now are unemployed through no fault of their own. The Workforce Investment Partnership Act makes a commitment to them by maintaining a special dislocated worker program supported by a separate funding stream geared to their retraining needs. The current dislocated program serves approximately 540,000 dislocated workers nationwide in the most recent year. Of those who completed the program, 71 percent were employed when they left the program, earning, on average, 93 percent of their previous wages. America's dislocated workers have earned the right to assistance in developing new skills which will allow them to be full participants in the 21st century economy. 
There is no challenge facing America today which is tougher and more important than providing at-risk, often out-of-school youth with meaningful education and employment. I am particularly pleased with the commitment the Workforce Investment Partnership Act makes to these young men and women. This legislation authorizes a new initiative focusing on teenagers living in poverty in communities offering them few employment opportunities. 
Each year, the Secretary of Labor will award grants from a $250 million fund to innovative programs designed to provide opportunities to youth living in these areas. The programs will emphasize mentoring, strong links between academic and work-site learning, and job placement and retention. It will encourage broad-based community participation from local service agencies and area employers. These model programs will, we believe, identify the techniques which are most effective. That is what we want to try to do. 
Another important program for young people who face the highest barriers to employment is Job Corps. Most of the participants grow up in extreme poverty with limited opportunities. Job Corps, at its best, moves them from deprivation to opportunity. But, for many of them, it is an extremely difficult transition. Job Corps is a program worth preserving and worth expanding too. Our legislation decisively rejects the view that Job Corps should be dismantled. Instead, it strengthens the program in several ways. It establishes closer ties between individual Job Corps Centers and the community they serve. It ensures that training 
programs correspond with the area's labor market needs. It extends follow-up counseling for participants up to 12 months and established detailed performance standards to hold programs accountable. 
The legislation also provides the continuation of some jobs as an essential element of the youth grant. For many youth, summer jobs are the first opportunity to work and their first critical step in learning the work ethic. The summer jobs program also provide many youth with quality learning experiences and follow up during the school year. Studies by the Department of Labor's Office of Inspector General and research by Westat, Inc., have reported positive findings regarding the program, concluding that work sites are well-supervised and disciplined, that jobs provide useful work, that the education component teaches students new skills that they apply in school, and that students learn the value of work. 
What we have seen in Massachusetts, particularly in Boston, where we have anywhere from 8,000 to 10,000 jobs a year, is that many of the youth go 1, 2, and some even 3 years. The private-sector involvement in these programs works very closely in the supervision and development of programs and then has a very active stream of bringing these young people who are going through high school at this time, and moving them right into jobs at some of our major companies in Boston. It has been very, very successful because they have coordinated the public-private partnership in a very effective way. 
I believe that the summer jobs program needs to continue to be available on a significant scale with sufficient funding. This bill recognizes the critical importance of the summer youth program by requiring that it be a part of each local area's youth program and allowing local communities to determine the number of summer jobs be created. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act includes titles reauthorizing major vocational education and adult literacy programs. Both programs will continue to be separately funded and independently administered. We have incorporated them in the Workforce Act because they must be integral components of any comprehensive strategy to prepare people to meet the demands of the 21st century workplace. Students who participate in vocational education must be provided with both strong academic preparation and advanced employment skills training. Recognizing this core principle, the legislation supports broad-based career preparation education which meets both high academic standards and teaches state-of-the-art technological skills. Adult literacy programs are essential for the 27 percent of the adult population who have not earned a high school diploma or its equivalent. Learning to read and communicate effectively are the first steps to career advancement. This legislation will increase access to educational opportunities for those most in need of assistance and enhance the quality of services provided. In vocational education and adult literacy, we place the same emphasis on program accountability which we did in job training. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act will make it possible for millions of Americans to gain the skills needed to compete in a global economy. In doing so, we are enabling them to realize their personal dreams. 
An educated workforce has become the most valuable resource in the modern economy. Our nation's long term economic vitality depends on the creation of an effective, accessible, and accountable system of job training and career development which is open to all our citizens. Schools must assume more responsibility for preparing their students to meet the challenges of the 21st century workplace.

I also want to recognize the important role President Clinton has played in bringing about this dramatic reform of our current job training system. He has consistently emphasized the need for greater individual choice in the selection of career paths and training providers. The philosophy behind his skill grant proposal is reflected in our legislation.

An essential element of the new system we have designed is accountability. As I noted earlier, each training provider will have to monitor and report the job placement and retention achieved by its graduates and their average earnings. Only those training programs that meet an acceptable performance standard will remain eligible for receipt of public funds. The same principle of accountability is applied to those agencies administering state and local programs. They are being given wide latitude to innovate under this legislation. But they too will be held accountable if their programs fail to meet challenging performance targets. 
The rapid pace of technological change in the workplace has produced an alarming number of workers who have become dislocated in mid-career. The dislocation has been compounded by the increasing number of labor intensive production employers relocating their businesses abroad. This trend has been particularly acute in the manufacturing sector. We have a special obligation to these dislocated workers who have long and dedicated work histories and now are unemployed through no fault of their own. The Workforce Investment Partnership Act makes a commitment to them by maintaining a special dislocated worker program, supported by a separate funding stream, which is geared to their retraining needs. The current dislocated worker program served approximately 540,000 dislocated workers nationwide in the most recent year. Of those who completed the program during that year, 71 percent were employed when they left the program, earning on average 93 percent of their previous wages. America's dislocated workers have earned the right to assistance in developing new skills which will allow them to be full participants in the 21st century economy. 
There is no challenge facing America today which is tougher or more important than providing at-risk, often out-of-school, youth with meaningful education and employment opportunities. Far too many of our teenagers are being left behind without the skills needed to survive in the 21st century economy. I am particularly pleased with the commitment which the Workforce Investment Partnership Act makes to these young men and women. This legislation authorizes a new initiative focused on teenagers living in poverty in communities offering them few constructive employment opportunities. Each year, the Secretary of Labor will award grants from a $250 million fund to innovative programs designed to provide opportunities to youth living in these areas. The programs will emphasize mentoring, strong links between academic and worksite learning, and job placement and retention. It will encourage broad based community participation from local service agencies and area employers. These model programs will, we believe, identify the techniques which are most effective in reaching those youth at greatest risk. 
Another important program for young people who face the highest barriers to employment is Job Corps. Most of the participants grow up in extreme poverty. Their educational opportunities are limited. Job Corps, at its best, moves them from deprivation to opportunity. But, for many of them, it is an extremely difficult transition. As a result, critics of the program are always able to point to failures. But for each story of failure, there are many stories of success. Job Corps is a program worth preserving and worth expanding too. Our legislation decisively rejects the view that Job Corps should be dismantled. Instead, it strengthens the program in several ways. It establishes closer ties between individual Job Corps Centers and the communities they serve. It ensures that training programs correspond with the area's labor market needs. It extends follow-up counseling for participants up to 12 months and established detailed performance standards to hold programs accountable. 
The legislation also provides for the continuation of summer jobs as an essential element of the youth grant. For many youth, summer jobs are their first opportunity to work and their first critical step in learning the work ethic. The summer jobs program also provides many youth with quality learning experiences and follow up during the school year. Studies by the Department of Labor's Office of the Inspector General and research by Westat, Inc. have reported positive findings regarding the program, concluding that work sites are well-supervised and disciplined, that jobs provide useful work, that the education component teaches students new skills that they apply in school, and that students learn the value of work. 
I believe that the summer jobs program needs to continue to be available on a significant scale with sufficient funding. This bill recognizes the critical importance of the summer youth program by requiring that it be a part of each local area's youth program and allowing local communities to determine the number of summer jobs to be created. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act includes titles reauthorizing major vocational education and adult literacy programs. Both programs will continue to be separately funded and independently administered. We have incorporated them in the Workforce Act because they must be integral components of any comprehensive strategy to prepare people to meet the demands of the 21st century workplace. Students who participate in vocational education must be provided with both strong academic preparation and advanced employment skills training. Recognizing this core principle, the legislation supports broad-based career preparation education which meets both high academic standards and teaches state- of-the-art technological skills. Adult literacy programs are essential for the 27% of the adult population who have not earned a high school diploma or its equivalent. Learning to read and communicate effectively are the first steps to career advancement. This legislation will increase access to educational opportunities for those people most in need of assistance and enhance the quality of services provided. In vocational education and adult literacy, we are placing the same emphasis on program accountability which we did in job training. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act will make it possible for millions of Americans to gain the skills needed to compete in a global economy. In doing so, we are also enabling them to realize their personal American dreams.

Mr. KENNEDY. I wanted also to discuss the Rehabilitation Act amendments of 1998. I welcome the opportunity to commend again Senator DeWine and Senator Jeffords for their leadership in making this reauthorization a priority and including this legislation as a part of the larger workforce development systems in the states. 
I also commend Senator Wellstone, Senator Harkin, Senator Dodd, and the Clinton Administration for their leadership in developing a bipartisan bill. I especially want to commend all of the staff members for their skillful work to make this process successful. 
For over 20 years, since the Vocational Rehabilitation Act was first enacted in 1973, state vocational rehabilitation systems have brought new hope to individuals with disabilities throughout the country, so they can reach their full potential and actively participate in their communities. Through the vocational rehabilitation, individuals with disabilities have access to training, counseling, support and job opportunities they need in order to become independent and productive, and live fulfilling lives. 
The Rehabilitation Act Amendments give us an excellent opportunity to do more to keep the promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act--by ensuing that all working-age individuals with disabilities, even those with the most significant disabilities, have realistic opportunities to obtain the support they need to reach their employment goals. 
With this legislation, we are building on the past gains by strengthening employment possibilities for all individuals with disabilities. 
The new provisions of this bill streamline the role of government by simplifying access to vocational rehabilitation services. It widens employment opportunities by establishing linkages with the larger statewide workforce systems. It also makes services available to individuals with disabilities who do not require extensive rehabilitation in order to become employed. Those who achieve work outcomes through this assistance will receive at least the minimum wage. This measure also recognizes that individuals receiving disability benefits through Social Security are significantly disabled and should be presumed to be eligible for vocational rehabilitation services. 
Throughout this process, we have heard from consumers, advocates, and program administrators. The bill strengthens the role of individuals in developing their own employment plans. It makes it easier for agencies to work together, so that individuals with disabilities can obtain the support and services they need. 
I commend all the consumers, the advocates, the families, and the administrators who have done so much to help us shape the legislation. Their commitment to constructive compromise will improve the lives of all people with disabilities. 
Our larger goal is to see the talents and strengths of individuals with disabilities are recognized, enhanced, and fairly rewarded in communities and workplaces across the Nation. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to achieve this great goal. I think this is another very important piece of legislation. I commend our leaders for the way this has been fashioned and shaped. 
Through vocational rehabilitation, individuals with disabilities have access to the training, counseling, support and job opportunities they need in order to become independent and productive, and live fulfilling lives. For millions of these Americans, vocational rehabilitation can mean the difference between dependence and independence, between lost potential and productive careers.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly disagree with the adverse comments of the Senator from Missouri regarding the School-to-Work Opportunities Act. That Act has provided countless young men and women across America with educational and career development opportunities which they would never have otherwise had. It has given those teenagers a greater range of choice in preparing for their future careers. It has opened the doors of prospective employers to these students and afforded them invaluable work opportunities. The evidence is there. I could speak for hours reciting success stories resulting from the School-to-Work program. 
However, this is not the appropriate time to debate the merits of School-to-Work. The Workforce Investment Partnership Act does not even mention the School-to-Work Opportunities Act once in its 444 pages of text. It does not amend or alter the School-to-Work Act in any way. 
The concern of all Senators today should be focused on the Workforce Investment Partnership Act which we are now considering. I have been assured by those advocating the Ashcroft amendment that it does not in any way limit the use of funds made available under the Workforce Act for any activity authorized by the Workforce Act. That is the issue which is most important today. Notwithstanding the Ashcroft amendment, funds available under each title of the Workforce Act will be able to be used to support any activity which that title authorizes. Based on that representation regarding the intent of the amendment, I do not request a rollcall vote.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri would require applicants and participants in job training programs to submit to drug testing. I am opposed to the amendment because it represents an unwarranted and unprecedented intrusion into the privacy of the thousands of ordinary Americans who use job training services. 
In addition, the amendment is a costly and unfunded Federal mandate. One of the innovations of this job training bill is the degree of flexibility it gives States and localities. The Ashcroft amendment is completely out of step with that goal. 
Drug testing has an important role in certain job training settings, just as it has in certain workplace settings. But the proposal by the Senator from Missouri is overbroad, excessively expensive, and an example of the intrusive Federal policy role that this bill is designed to combat. 
The vast majority of the people who will use the job training services authorized in this bill are upstanding citizens, not criminals. They are displaced defense workers. They are blue collar workers who have been laid off as a result of a factory closing. They are professionals seeking to improve their skills in specialized fields. They are victims of natural disasters and runaway plants moving overseas. 
The Ashcroft amendment says to these people: If you want this assistance to try to improve your skills and obtain employment, you have to agree to submit to a Government test for possible drug abuse. I do not believe that the privacy of ordinary citizens hoping to improve their job skills should be routinely invaded in this intrusive manner. 
The Government uses drug testing today for airline pilots, train conductors, and other employees involved in sensitive public safety tasks. If programs funded by this bill train people in sensitive jobs, there is nothing that would prohibit drug testing. 
But routinely testing of everyone is too extreme. We do not do it in other programs, and we should not do it in this one. 
We do not drug-test people seeking Government assistance in financing a mortgage; we do not drug-test flood or earthquake victims applying for disaster relief; we do not drug-test crime victims seeking assistance from the Federal Office of Victim Services; we do not drug-test farmers seeking crop subsidies. We do not drug-test corporate executive seeking overseas marketing assistance from the Commerce Department. 
Why are job training recipients singled out for this stigma? No case has been made that this population is more susceptible to drug abuse than the population at large. 
The amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri requires drug testing in two situations. First, every applicant to 
 a job training program is subject to testing on a random basis. Second, participants in training programs are subject to testing based on reasonable suspicion of drug use. Both random basis and reasonable suspicion are undefined concepts. They raise the specter that excessive distinctions will be made based on stereotypes and prejudices. 
As we have often been told, Washington does not have all the answers. We should not replace one set of Federal mandates with another set of Federal mandates. This bill is designed to maximize local flexibility, but the Ashcroft amendment goes in the opposite direction. 
Indeed, the Ashcroft amendment would actually preempt some State laws. A number of State legislatures have addressed the circumstances under which drug testing can be utilized, but the Ashcroft amendment would actually override the considered judgments of those legislative bodies and put in place a one-size-fits-all Federal mandate. 
Drug testing on the scale contemplated by this amendment would be enormously expensive. By some estimates, 1 million Americans use the job training services included in this bill. The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that the average cost of a drug test is about $35. 
That means it would cost $35 million each year to administer an average of one test to each person. Either this amendment saddles local governments with a huge unfunded mandate, or it eats up a large portion of the Federal funds made available under this bill. 
It is also important to note that drug testing technology is not infallible. Depending upon the type of testing technology that is used, as many as 4 percent of all drug tests result in false positives. That means that if a million drug tests are administered, some 40,000 Americans might be inaccurately labeled as drug users. 
Of course there are often opportunities for appeals and confirmation tests and retests. But we should think long and hard before we adopt this amendment and subject tens of thousands of ordinary, law-abiding Americans to the Kafka-esque nightmare of being falsely accused of drug use. 
The amendment requires those who test positive for drugs to obtain drug treatment. But who will pay for treatment? Right now, only a third of the Americans who need substance abuse treatment receive it because insurance coverage and public funding are inadequate. In light of that fiscal reality, it makes no sense to institute a massive new Government drug testing program. 
Finally, the amendment is objectionable because it may deter people who need job training services from seeking them. The threat of an intrusive drug test may put off drug users and non-drug users alike. We want to encourage people to improve their skills. We want to encourage the unemployed to become employed. We should not erect barriers to the services authorized in this bill. 
Job training programs do not need the Federal Government to tell them how to deal with drug abuse. They have the tools they need. Where drug testing is appropriate, it will occur. But a sweeping Federal mandate is completely unnecessary and excessively expensive. 
I have concerns about the privacy issue, concerns about the cost issue, concerns about preempting State laws, concerns about issues relating to standards and to quality control for random tests. They are all sound reasons to oppose this imprudent amendments.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to include the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary. The inclusion of these three countries will alter the Alliance, but the benefits clearly make this expansion both timely and worthwhile. 
In 1949, if the founders of NATO had been asked to predict where the alliance would be five decades later, few if any could have foreseen a more extraordinary success. The NATO nations stood firmly together as the great bulwark against communism during the Cold War. NATO is, without doubt, the most successful security alliance in history. 
The original purpose of NATO was to protect the West against the former Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact nations. Now, even though the Cold War is over, NATO continues to be essential. It makes sense to adopt this modest expansion of the Alliance beyond its Cold War borders to include three nations which were once part of the Warsaw Pact. 
The greatest threats to European security are now the long-standing ethnic conflicts that have simmered inside many of these nations for centuries. Two world wars in this century began in Central Europe. Extension of NATO's security umbrella to these three additional nations will place them in a part of Europe where wars no longer happen. 
Obviously, there are concerns about the expansion of NATO that Congress and the country must be sensitive to--especially the potential impact of this expansion on our relationship with Russia. 
We have rightly spent much of the past decade and billions of U.S. taxpayers' dollars in working with Russia to achieve nuclear arms reductions and to help Russia safeguard its nuclear arsenal and its nuclear materials. Russian cooperation with the U.S. under the Comprehensive Threat Reduction Program and our bilateral nuclear arms reduction treaties with Russia have substantially reduced the chance of nuclear war. In my view, anything that would disrupt or harm this vital progress would be a fateful error. 
Many of Russia's leaders do not support NATO's invitation to Poland, Hungary or the Czech Republic. But the addition of these countries to NATO poses no threat to Russia. I commend President Clinton for his effective leadership in making this point clear. We must continue to work to assure President Yeltsin and other Russian leaders that the expansion of NATO is not a danger to their country or their security. We must do all we can to address Russia's concerns and increase our cooperation in all key areas with Russia to ensure that our goal of a more secure future is achieved. 
We must also deal with the concerns over costs, especially the costs that Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic will have to bear to upgrade their military forces to NATO standards. These costs will inevitably have to compete with pressing domestic needs in those countries. 
Together, these three nations will have to spend as much as $14 billion over the next 10 years to meet NATO standards. These costs are the responsibility of these prospective new members. They committed to pay these costs when they asked to become members of NATO. The U.S. already pays 25% of NATO's commonly-funded expenses. NATO expansion should not impose costly new burdens on U.S. taxpayers. 
Nevertheless, these countries are on the right track, and so is NATO. This expansion of NATO is amply justified. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic will strengthen NATO. They are solid democracies, and they will make our alliance for peace even stronger. Their rightful place is in NATO, and I urge the Senate to support this Resolution of Ratification.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in congratulating the people of Israel on the 50th anniversary of their independence. 
Fifty years ago, Israel's first prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, declared the establishment of the State of Israel, ending a centuries-old struggle by the Jewish people to return to their rightful ancestral homeland. The modern dream of a Jewish state had been reborn over 50 years earlier, when Theodore Herzl shared his vision of such a nation during the First World Zionist Conference in Switzerland. Our predecessors in the U.S. Congress supported this vision when they passed a resolution in 1922, calling for the founding of a Jewish nation. 
Tragically, the Jewish people were unable to achieve that great goal during the early years of the modern Zionist movement. They were forced to endure the most brutal and systematic repression of a people that humanity has ever witnessed. The six million Jewish men, women, and children who lost their lives during the Holocaust had committed no crime. They were killed, not because of anything they had done, but because of who they were, as part of an inhuman, racist policy that robbed its victims of both life and dignity. The extraordinary courage with which the Jewish people bore this tragedy is a timeless tribute to their enduring faith, and we owe the victims and the survivors a commitment that such persecution and prejudice will never occur again. 
From its beginning 50 years ago, the nation of Israel has had a very close and special relationship with the United States. In a perennially turbulent and unpredictable region of the world, Israel has always been a bulwark of stability. It is our closest ally not only in the Middle East, but also in the United Nations. And during times of crisis and conflict in the region, this bond has only been strengthened. 
It was no coincidence that America was chosen as the site for the historic Declaration of Principles agreement between the Israeli and the Palestinian people in 1993, since we have always worked with great dedication and commitment to achieve a lasting peace in the Middle East. The Israeli people know that we will continue to work with them and support them during this long and difficult peace process. 
No other ethnic or religious group in human history had endured so much pain and prejudice and overcome so many enormous difficulties in establishing a nation of their own. No other new nation faced so great a threat to its immediate survival as did Israel during its first year of existence. They have created a thriving democracy in a region known for its dictatorships. They have generously opened their land to Jews from all over the world. As we celebrate this inspiring Golden Anniversary of the birth of Israel, we also honor and commend the Israeli people for their courage and commitment in achieving their dream of a homeland and in building the strong and vital democracy and friend that Israel is today.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this week we were supposed to be debating our Nation's policy on education. Where our Nation's children are going to school is to the public school systems. We do not have anything against the private school system, but we ought to be testing every single recommendation against does it really help our public schools or are we taking needed funds away from our public schools? 
This does absolutely nothing for our public schools. It gives no help and assistance to hard-working parents whose children are going to public schools. What it does do is it says we are going to give a preference in terms of charitable giving to these specific organizations over charitable giving to cancer, over charitable giving to heart disease, over charitable giving to Alzheimer's, over charitable giving to a wide range of other very worthwhile factors. 
What is possibly the justification for that? We ought to consider tax policy in that respect, but this is not good education policy. It does not advance our common interest of moving the public schools toward greater academic achievement and accomplishment. That ought to be the test. This fails on the education standard, and it fails on tax policy. 
Mr. President, I hope that the amendment will not be accepted.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Republican approach these days often seems to be `one ideology fits all.' They want to privatize everything. They want to privatize Social Security, they want to privatize Medicare, and now they want to privatize education, and that would be their biggest mistake of all. 
People ask why this bill is so important and why this debate has been so hard-fought. The answer is clear. This is not just another ordinary bill, or ordinary day, or ordinary vote in the life of the Senate. The Republican Party is making a massive mistake, a mistake of truly historic dimensions, if they turn their backs on public schools, if that is the clear signal they are sending the country by pushing this misguided bill, because its fundamental purpose is to aid private schools, not help public schools. We all know that public schools have problems, but our goal should be to fix those problems, not ignore them or make them worse. 
Over the past few days, the Senate has had the opportunity to correct the defects in this bill and direct scarce resources to the public schools that have the greatest need. But at every turn Republicans have chosen to make this bad bill even worse. The bill 
uses tax breaks to subsidize parents who send their children to private schools, and it is a serious mistake. It diverts scarce resources away from public schools that have the greatest need. It undermines the important Federal role in education, and it bans voluntary national tests. It does nothing to improve public schools. It does nothing to address the serious need of public schools to build new facilities and to repair crumbling existing facilities. It does nothing to reduce class sizes in schools. It does nothing to provide qualified teachers in more classrooms across the Nation that will be needed. It does nothing to provide after-school activities to keep kids off the streets, away from drugs, and out of trouble. It does nothing to help children reach high academic standards. It does nothing to improve the quality of education for children in public schools. 
On issue after issue, the Republican bill undermines Federal support for education, and that is irresponsible. We know what it takes to achieve genuine education reform. The place to start is by resoundingly rejecting this defective bill that destroys the national commitment to improving education for all students. 
The challenge is clear: We must do all we can to improve teaching and learning for all students across the Nation. We must continue to support efforts to raise academic standards. We must test students early so we know where they need help in time to make that help effective. We need better training for current and new teachers so that they are well-prepared to teach to high standards. We must reduce class size to help students obtain the individual attention they need. We need after-school programs to make constructive alternatives available to students. We need greater resources to modernize and expand school facilities to meet the urgent need of schools for modern technology and up-to-date classrooms. 
We cannot stand by and enact a regressive bill to help private schools at the expense of public schools. It is clear that our Republican friends are no friends of public schools. This Republican anti-education tax bill is wrong for education, it is wrong for America, and it is wrong for the Nation's future. 
Public education is one of the all-time great achievements of our country. Education is the key that unlocks the golden door of opportunity. Great leaders of a century and more ago understood that. They understood what may be the greatest experiment of all in American democracy. They insisted on free public education for all, and in doing so they laid the solid foundation that made this country the most powerful and most successful nation on earth in this century. None of us--no Republican, no Democrat--should retreat from that basic bedrock principle. Yet, this unacceptable bill does that. It hangs a sign for all to see on the front door of every public school in America: Abandon hope, all ye who enter here. Get out while you can, public schools have failed. Find a private school that will take you in and we will subsidize the cost. 
I categorically reject that view. Public schools have not failed. Public schools are still the backbone of American education, and they always will be. Let's solve their problems, not abandon them. Let's defeat this bill and make a fresh start to do all we can to help our public schools. 
Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Hyannis Fire Department recently honored Harold S. Brunelle of Hyannis by appointing him as Fire Chief. This honor is a well-deserved tribute to Chief Brunelle, his 26-year career with the Department, and his commitment to the community of Hyannis. 
Chief Brunelle was chosen after nation-wide competition for the position of Fire Chief, and he was selected unanimously for the position in a field of 34 applicants. 
Chief Brunelle joined the Hyannis Department in 1972 as a Junior Firefighter and rose through the ranks because of his great ability and dedication. His selection as Fire Chief demonstrates the town's confidence in Mr. Brunelle and their faith in his able service and leadership to the residents of the community.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am not sure that I qualify for being in opposition because I will urge our colleagues to support this amendment. I want to commend the Senator for giving some focus and attention on the floor of the Senate to the issues of literacy and literacy training. 
On next Tuesday in our Human Resources Committee, Senator Jeffords will be having a hearing on our literacy legislation. It is his hope and certainly all of ours in the committee that we will pass out a strong, bipartisan proposal that will incorporate a number of the ideas that are included in the Coverdell amendment and a number of the ideas that have been included in President Clinton's literacy proposal of a little over a year ago. As we all know, now that the President has asked the colleges of this country in the work-study program for those young people to devote time for literacy training, I take pride that our Massachusetts colleges are No. 2, with California being No. 1, in the number of colleges where the young people who are benefiting from the work-study program are actually involved in tutorial work. We have tried to get every one of the colleges in our State--there are 126--to be involved in that tutorial work. 
I think, the fact that this afternoon we are focusing on the issue of literacy, hopefully we will pave the way for a bipartisan effort and for an outcome that will result in our ability to utilize the $250 million which have been designated for literacy training as a part of the budget of last year and was worked out in a bipartisan way. We may have had differences on the number of the education issues that we have been debating in the past days, but I certainly hope that we can in these next very, very few weeks have legislation out here that will have a responsible literacy initiative. 
Mr. President, we know that the Academy of Sciences has recommended a modality for the development of literacy programs. If we take the Coverdell proposal, we will find it quite prescriptive in relationship to the range of initiatives that have been recommended by the Academy of Sciences that provide greater flexibility. How we eventually are going to come out on that issue remains to be seen. But the strong emphasis on the teachers that they be well trained to teach is something that we all would have common agreement on. The idea of the role of the tutors under the President's program is an important role. I think under the Coverdell proposal we find that feature of it, hopefully, would be strengthened. 
I think there is probably some difference in this body 
about the administration of the program. Under the Coverdell proposal, you set up a whole new bureaucracy effectively with your partnership program rather than working with the State programs. It is quite prescriptive in the naming of a number of members that will serve on various boards. You have a number of States now that are doing some very, very important work. This would be a circumstance where I hope that the program would work through the State agencies that are in the Coverdell proposal. 
I also believe that you have particular features in here where you have the devoting of a good deal of money for assistance grants for tutors. I think most of those involved in literacy training feel that having a school-based system is a better use and a more effective use of the funds. 
Mr. President, I hope that at the time we address this issue Members will vote in favor of the Coverdell amendment. Then we will have an opportunity to vote after in terms of the Bingaman and Reid proposal. I hope that we will vote in favor of that as well. 
I think the President's proposal and ones which will be advanced in our Human Resources Committee will give greater emphasis to volunteers and to tutors than would necessarily be the case in the Coverdell proposal. 
We have under the leadership of our colleague and friend, Senator Jeffords, the Everyone Wins Program, which is a reading program which a number of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle have been involved in at the Brent School on the Hill. We have good attendance from a number of our Members here where they go over and read each week to students. I think the kind of flexibility provided in the President's program as well as the kind of support for a number of school-based systems has some additional credibility. I hope that we will support it. 
I commend the Senator for giving focus and attention. I want to pledge to the Senator from Georgia, as well as to our other colleagues, that we will certainly work every way that we possibly can, those of us on the Education and Human Resources Committee, to work under the leadership of Senator Jeffords who has really been a strong, strong leader on the issues of literacy long before many others in this body, and hopefully we will have a chance to all be together and join in something that can pass and be successful and really move us towards a country that has a real commitment towards literacy. 
It is interesting that, if you go back into the history of our country, in the early days of this Nation at the time of the birth of the Republic we had a much higher rate of literacy than we have today. That is rather surprising to many, many people. The reason was because of the reading of the Bible, because we had church-related efforts for literacy in every community across the country in order that children were going to be able to read the Bible. We had much higher degrees of literacy at other times in our history than we have at the present time. That is one of the areas where we have slipped. I think we need to call for focus, attention, energy, and I think some resources to really galvanize the sense of voluntarism, which I believe is out there, in an effective way to really make a dramatic impact on reducing illiteracy in the country. 
I hope our colleagues will support that amendment. I commend him for bringing it. I pledge that we will try to work to find ways to get a meaningful program. 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just take one moment. I hope we can move forward. We may have a number of differences--probably will--in the conference, but this is an area where we really ought to try to get the best ideas that all of our Members have and then move it forward. 
I look forward to working with the Senator from Georgia on that. I know I speak for all of the Members on our side on the Labor and Human Resources Committee. No matter how the underlying legislation comes out, I will look forward to working with the Senator from Georgia and others to make sure that we are going to get an effective bill.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to just commend Senator Coverdell for focusing on the issue of literacy. As we know, President Clinton advanced a literacy program in 1996. Our colleague, Senator Jeffords, has been having the hearings on this literacy issue in his committee and has been a leader on literacy issues--child literacy, family literacy, and adult literacy programs. I am very hopeful we will have a good bill that will be strong and bipartisan in the very near future. So I hope everyone will support this program. 
I want to just mention quickly the concern that I have is that it is too prescriptive in terms of how it develops the programs. The Academy of Sciences has outlined a series of ways of doing it. I think we ought to consider that. It establishes a new State bureaucracy. I think we ought to build on the States. The tutorial programs are not school based, and I think they would be stronger if they were. 
These are important issues, but what I think is enormously encouraging is that we have strong, bipartisan commitment to try to work out in the very near future a strong bipartisan literacy program. I commend Senator Coverdell for developing this amendment and his strong commitment to work with all of us. We look forward to working with him to get a good, strong bill.

 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Betsy Stevens, who recently retired as Disaster Chairman for the Cape Cod Chapter of the American Red Cross. 
Betsy Stevens has served with great distinction in this position for the past six years. One of her most impressive achievements was hosting the recent Eastern Disaster Conference. Over 200 Red Cross disaster volunteers from the Eastern United States attended this conference hosted by the Cape Cod Chapter. 
In her capacity as Chairman, Mrs. Stevens did an excellent job organizing and training volunteers to provide services to the victims of disasters. During her tenure, Red Cross volunteers responded to disasters such as the Oklahoma City bombing, the hurricane in Guam, and the paralyzing ice storm in Maine. 
On Cape Cod, Betsy Stevens was renowned for her availability to deal with sudden crises at all hours. She responded to fires and airplane crashes, and manned shelters during severe storms. She was skillful in recruiting shop owners to donate goods and services. She found emergency housing for victims and served countless holiday dinners. She deserves great credit for the exceptional readiness and high quality of the Red Cross volunteers of the Cape Cod Chapter. Her leadership will be greatly missed, but she has the gratitude of all of us for the job she did so well.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Gorton amendment. I listened with great interest to the Senator's presentation, as I did the last time we debated this issue. Of course, we understand now that if the States want to go out to their taxpayers and raise taxes and to vote those taxes to any of the points that the Senator desires, they have every right to do so, and there is nothing that any of us are doing here that would prohibit them from doing it. 
The fact is that the resources which are being provided here and which the amendment is directed to are the resources that are being raised at the Federal level and have been targeted to those aspects of our educational systems that have been identified as being meaningful in terms of our national interest and our national purpose. The Senator's amendment 
effectively eliminates the Drug-Free Schools Program. That would be included in his block grant, but the funding would not be there. 
Maybe parents are speaking to the Senator from Washington and saying they don't like a drug-free program in their schools, but parents in my State are saying they like it and they hope it will be enhanced. 
They talk about dispute resolutions that are being developed in various schools. They don't want that program emasculated or effectively destroyed. It does not reach a level of priority in the Gorton amendment. 
When I go around my State of Massachusetts, particularly after all of the publicity that was received in the international competition about where the United States stood in areas of math and science, they are not saying cut out the Eisenhower Math and Science Education Training Program. They are asking me, `Do we have in our schools qualified teachers in math and science, and what are you going to do in your higher ed bill to try to have enhanced math and science qualified teachers who are going to teach our children in our schools?' 
Too many of the teachers who are teaching in the schools in my State--and in every other State, I might add--are not qualified to teach in their particular courses. One of the most effective programs is math and science under the Eisenhower program. That doesn't exist in the Gorton amendment. 
Maybe people are going around and saying to their Senators that math and science training and additional enhancements for our teachers is something in which they are not interested. But I do not hear that in Massachusetts. I do not hear that. 
We have support for programming that is going to enhance academic achievement and accomplishments to raise the bar. One of the most important transitions we have seen in terms of education policy is to free ourselves from dumbing down academics, from social promotions in the various schools, and setting high academic standards. The provisions that exist in Federal law would be virtually eliminated by the Senator's amendment. I do not find parents in my State saying, `We are not interested in establishing higher academic standards in our schools.' That is eliminated. 
If, in particular, communities do not choose to take advantage of these programs, they do not have to take advantage of these programs. But why deny the people in my State the opportunity to take advantage of it if it is desired in the local community and the State makes that determination of priority? It is a partnership today. It is a partnership, but they effectively are denying it under the Gorton block grant resolution. 
Mr. President, our role is extremely limited. We provide maybe 7 cents out of every dollar that is extended locally--maybe 6, 7, 8 cents. A chunk of that goes into nutrition programs. A good part of that is the title I programs, additional help and assistance in terms of IDEA, a small part in terms of the bilingual program and a few others, such as the math and science programs. In the Eisenhower math and science training, it is about $360 million, but it is a very good qualified program. 
And for the life of me, I do not understand where this demand is coming to vitiate that and eliminate those programs. 
If a particular community wants to innovate and create and try to do all these other kinds of matters that the Senator talks about, then let them go ahead and do it, let them go ahead and do it. But these programs have been targeted, been basically developed with strong bipartisan support, I might add, or they would not be on the books. We have had strong bipartisan support in terms of the safe and drug-free schools. 
We have had it with regard to the Eisenhower training programs, math and science training programs. They will be reinstated when we are dealing again with the Higher Ed Act, with strong bipartisan support. Effectively, we are saying, without a day of hearings, with a very limited debate here for 30 minutes--a few hours in the last session of Congress--that we are effectively emasculating all of these programs. 
It is not sound education policy, and I think it is unwise policy for us to be considering at this particular time. We ought to be looking and evaluating each of these programs one by one. If they are having a heavy administrative burden, we ought to examine that and address that. That is why we are commending the work that has been worked out with Senator DeWine, Senator Wellstone, Senator Jeffords, and others in our committee for consolidating various work training programs, 126 work training programs in six different agencies to eliminate those administrative costs and to try to do it in a way as to protect the function but eliminate a lot of the administrative costs. 
We have been involved in the last several years with waiving various rules and regulations in States and in educational districts, which is working out. And we can do that, selectively and effectively. We welcome the opportunity to do so. We have had evaluations, and they are effective. We welcome the opportunity to work with Members here. The leader in that effort was Senator Hatfield of Oregon, who is a leader in education as well as an attempt to try to give the focus of limited Federal funds to areas which have national purpose and national accord. 
Finally, Mr. President, we do not have accountability under the Gorton amendment. We hear a great deal about trying to have greater accountability so we know what are going to be the results of investments of scarce Federal funds. We do not have that in the Gorton amendment. We do not know what is going to happen when that money goes out into these various communities. There may be some feel-good measures that people feel good that they are able to try to move various resources around in different directions, but we do not know what the outcomes are going to be. You do not have the accountability. 
So finally I just say that we have a relationship at the Federal, State, and local community levels in terms of education. It is a partnership. I think it is fair to review that partnership. It is fair to examine various programs and what is effective in that partnership. But we raise money at the Federal level for national purposes, safe and drug-free schools. We made that a part of our war on drugs in this country. 
It is a matter of national policy. We said we want, as a national policy, to have drug-free schools. That is effectively eliminated in this program. We said we want focus and attention on math and science in our schools, and we developed a program that if initiated in the local communities on a competitive basis will provide those resources. That program is eliminated. 
We have said as a matter of national policy that--and just about everyone agrees with that--we ought to raise the bar in terms of academic achievement and accomplishment. Let us go ahead and do that. And we have an agreement by parents. They are enthusiastic about it. And that is going to be eliminated under this program. 
Mr. President, this is not an advance. It is rearranging the deck chairs, but we are not enhancing the academic opportunities for children in this country with this amendment. And I hope that 
it will not be accepted. 
Mr. President, how much time do we have on this side?

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the amendment of the Senator from Washington is really targeted on a key area of educational policy--that is, the reduced class size--for all the reasons she eloquently presented to the Senate just a few moments ago. It is a time-tested way of enhancing academic achievement and accomplishment for our public schools. The fact is that she has taken this proposal, offered it to the Senate so that we would have an opportunity to state whether we believe that smaller class size would be useful and helpful, particularly in the early grades. That is what this is really targeted on. 
The Senator from Arkansas has come in and offered an amendment that effectively vitiates her amendment, by saying that we should be committed to at least 95 cents of the educational dollar going into the classroom. Well, we are in favor of that. This is a rather clever way, evidently, by our Republican friends of trying to obscure the issue of whether smaller class size is an important educational tool. 
We agree that 95 percent of the funds ought to go to the classrooms. In many programs, it's more than 95 percent; 98 percent goes through to the classrooms. So why the Senator has made this proposal is to wipe out the Murray amendment. Let's not fool ourselves. We can stand up here all day long and say how we want to preserve taxpayer funding to targeted areas in educational programs. We are for it. We are all for it. It is not a new idea. It has already been accepted in the House of Representatives. We hope there will be a voice vote on it. But we ask the Senator, why attempt to vitiate the excellent program or deny the Senator the opportunity to get a vote on her program for smaller class size? 
That is what you are basically about. Let's not kid ourselves. Let's not stand up here and take the time of the U.S. Senate and try to say we are all for trying to get the money into the classroom. We are all for that. The Senator has the legitimacy to take the time of the Senate to do so. We are for it. But what you should say is: By accepting my amendment, we effectively emasculate the Murray amendment, which has tried to put the Senate on record saying that smaller classrooms can be one of a number of tools to try to enhance academic achievement and accomplishment. 
You are effectively trying to deny that. Let's call a spade a spade. That is why I certainly hope that we have every intention of getting a vote on the Murray concept. 
We will have that opportunity to do so at some time. I hope we will persevere. 
I think the amendment of the Senator from Washington is a carefully crafted amendment and that we in this body understand the importance of moving towards smaller class size. I heard the Senator eloquently speak from her own personal experience. There isn't a Member in this body who can speak with the personal experience of the Senator from Washington. She has been in the classroom. She has been in large classes and in smaller classes and has been a school board member. There isn't a Member in the Senate who can claim those kinds of credentials. She knows about this as an important concept. 
We are not going to be denied by any Senator in here from at least getting an opportunity to vote on that. You can try what you like, but you are not going to be successful. I hope we can get beyond the chaff that is out here and get to the real wheat, which is the Senator's amendment. 
If the Senator wants to have a vote on his, good. I hope we would get on with it, if we are serious about having an education debate. But make no mistake about it. The thrust of the Senator's amendment is to effectively deny the Senate an opportunity to vote on the Murray amendment because we all virtually agree. I have not heard a voice out here that isn't going to support the Senator's amendment, which is about 95 cents out of every dollar going to the classroom. That is not what this is about. It is to deny the Senator from Washington of having a fair chance to have her amendment heard. We know our Republican friends are so tied up with this idea of using scarce resources for private schools, and we know the drive that has in terms of the whole Coverdell proposal. But they want to deny even the opportunity for the Senate to address in a short period of time a very important and significant educational policy issue. Even under these restrictive rules, which we had to agree to, they are not going to be able to prohibit the Senator from getting a vote on it. 
I hope that we do that in a way that will be accommodated. We can do it nice or do it rough. But we are going to get a vote on it. The Senator can make up his mind which way he wants to play with it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Two minutes. No one has represented that. 
But what we have found, for example, as a result of very extensive hearings--I do not know which ones were cited--is that in Flint, MI, efforts over the last 3 years to reduce class size in grades K through 3 have lead to a 44 percent increase in reading scores and an 18 percent increase in math scores. In Wisconsin, student achievement in grades K through 3 is also finding similar results. Project STAR in Tennessee, K through 3 in 80 different schools in Tennessee. And in California similar kinds of results. So the idea that this is not a worthwhile educational policy tied into other education policy as a way to help to assist local schools that make that judgment fails, I think, to be credible, and I think that is why we are all grateful we are going to be in a situation that we can have the vote on the amendment of the Senator from Washington and a vote on the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas. I hope this body will vote in favor of both. 
I thank the Senator from Washington for bringing this very important measure to the Senate.

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 8 minutes. 
Mr. President, I strongly oppose the Ashcroft amendment to prohibit the administration from developing voluntary tests for academic achievement. Schools need clear-cut standards of achievement. Realistic tests to measure achievement are an essential part of good education. The same voluntary tests that received broad support in the Senate last year, the testing compromise, had a vote of 87-13. 
Voluntary national tests based on widely recognized national standards makes sense. They give parents and communities and schools an effective way to improve education and to chart the progress they are making. The voluntary national tests will be designed to assess fourth grade reading and eighth grade math. They are basic subjects and basic stages in each students' academic development. The assessments are timely and worthwhile. 
Every student, parent, and school will benefit from them. The Ashcroft amendment will keep them in the dark. Parents want to know how well their children are doing and how well their schools are doing compared to other students in other schools across the Nation. Today, too many schools in communities across the country are attempting to educate their students without the kind of assistance and guidance that ought to be available. They have no way to compare the performance of their students with students in other schools and other communities in other parts of the country. 
We know by every current indicator the performance of American elementary and secondary school students falls far short of the performance of students in many other nations. We have to do better. Knowing where schools and students now stand is an essential part of helping them do better. 
As the Senator from Michigan, Senator Levin, pointed out, the tests will be entirely voluntary. I repeat, entirely voluntary. States and local districts will have the opportunity to participate if they choose to. Nothing is mandated by the Federal Government. Nothing is mandated by the Federal Government. There is no Federal control of local education. What is being made available on a voluntary basis is a long overdue opportunity for schools across the country to have realistic guideposts to measure the academic progress of their students. The tests will be based on national and international standards that will show whether students are meeting widely accepted criteria for achievement in reading and math. 
No current test is available to provide this essential information to students and parents and teachers and school administrators. Families have no way to measure the performance 
of students in their community on a comparative basis with students in other schools and other communities and other States. 
Mr. President, 87 of us agreed last year that the National Assessment Governing Board, which is a bipartisan group, is well equipped to oversee the tests. It is a time-honored bipartisan group of skilled educators, made up of different representatives of the educational community. Voluntary national tests do not undermine local efforts on school reform. They enhance them. We need to do what we can to support local efforts to improve teaching and learning, especially in such vital areas as reading and math. Voluntary tests are an important way to support local school reform. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Ashcroft amendment. 
Finally, I think this is an empowerment issue for parents. Basically, we are permitting on a voluntary basis, the States and then again the local communities, to make a decision about whether they are going to have these tests in the various communities and then to permit, obviously, the parents to know how their children are doing. By knowing how they are doing, then the parents can make judgments and decisions about what additional steps ought to be taken to try to improve the academic achievement and accomplishment of their children. 
These kinds of tests are in the interests of the parent, so they know how their children are doing in schools, it is in the interests of the school board member to know whether they are making the correct judgments in terms of allocating resources and priorities, and it is in the interests of the community so they will know how they are doing in comparison with other communities. 
All of these issues were debated at very significant length in the last Congress, and steps were taken to make sure that the bipartisan or virtually the nonpartisan education group was going to be developing these tests. They are in the process of doing so at the present time. They are not going to go into implementation until the year 2002. We are in 1998 at the present time and they are going into effect in 2002. So we are approaching this issue very modestly. They are going to be tested before they will be accepted. We will have ample opportunity to review the results of both the tests, the testing results as they give application to the tests, long before they go into effect. 
The question is whether we will take this step by step and make judgments that will ultimately enhance the power of parents in knowing how their children are doing. If the Ashcroft amendment goes into effect, we are terminating that and denying a very important ingredient to parents and local communities. Parents in local schools want to know how their children are doing. Too often they have been kept in the dark. If there is a local decision, a local judgment, a State judgment, to put these into effect, they ought to have that opportunity to do so. Under the Ashcroft amendment, they will be denied that opportunity to do so. 
I think this is a very modest program that is being put into the process at the present time and we should not undermine it this early in the process. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Before the Senator from Indiana leaves the floor, I was very persuaded by the logic and eloquence of the Senator on the reasons he supported the compromise last time. I was under the impression that we still had NAGB doing that test at the present time. The independent board has already taken, as I understand it, several steps to address the key concerns that were raised during the debate and discussion. I understand they are doing the test at the present time. Is the Senator's information different?

Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I wonder why we are going through this, because I am strongly committed to achieving the compromise that was worked out with the leadership. The Senator from Indiana and, I believe, Senator Gregg were interested in this. We had a great deal of debate and discussion. I thought that giving the assurances in terms of the integrity of the test should be the tough kind of criteria that the Senator from Indiana established in terms of the makeup of these tests. I understood this was in the process now. That is why I think it is premature to wipe all of that out. I hope that if there are differences, we can try to work those out in a way that is consistent with that agreement rather than just halting the whole process now. As the Senator knows well, we are not going to have this go into effect until 2002. We have a long way to go. Rather than stop it and start it, it might be wise if we can sort of measure it at the present time rather than end it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we heard from the Senator from Indiana, the reasons for these kinds of reviews are 
basically that there is nothing wrong with setting high standards for the achievement for the Nation's children and giving parents the opportunity to know how their children are doing. I think that is the basic policy issue. 
The Senator from Indiana and the Senator from New Hampshire insisted that this is being done in a nonpartisan, bipartisan way, and I agree completely. I believe that is the way it is being done. It should be a national priority to do all we can to help the children meet these high standards. 
Under the existing proposal, that would be done voluntarily. The States would make a judgment, local communities would make a judgment. I think we ought to retain the current system and try to adjust it if it needs to be adjusted rather than to effectively stop it in its tracks. Therefore, I oppose the Ashcroft amendment.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there is no question that there are tests that are out there, but quite clearly the hearings demonstrated they would not provide the kind of information to the parents across this country that this kind of initiative would provide. It seems to me that we want to challenge the young people of this country, setting the high standards for the Nation's children and giving the parents the opportunity and responsibility to know how their children are doing and then taking action at the local level on how they are going to deal with it. That was the principle that was accepted by the Senate and the strong bipartisan vote last year. Let's continue with that and give that a try before effectively stopping it in its tracks.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we all know what our priorities are in education. We need to do all we can to support and improve our public schools. That means additional assistance to every State to repair crumbling schools and to build new facilities. It means recruiting more teachers to meet the existing demand and to deal with the crisis of rising enrollments, especially in priority disciplines, in math and science. It means reducing class sizes. It means more support for afterschool programs to keep kids off the streets, away from drugs, and out of trouble. It means a major effort to teach young children how to read because we know that literacy is the foundation of every other aspect of learning. It means setting higher standards for schools to meet in educating their students. We know these ideas will work. But schools across the country are in desperate need of funds to make them work. 
Our goal is to improve public schools, not abandon them. It makes no sense to call for greater priority for education and then earmark aid for private schools instead of public schools. Public schools are instituting these ideas and getting results. We should make sure that every school and community has the resources to put in practice what works so that no child is left out or left behind. 
Mr. President, this chart here shows what is happening to the schools in this country. And this is according to the General Accounting Office: 14 million children learn in substandard schools; 7 million children attend schools with asbestos, lead paint, or radon in the ceilings or walls; 12 million children go to school under leaky roofs; one-third of all American children study in classrooms without enough panel outlets and the electrical wiring to accommodate computers and multimedia equipment. 
This is a tragedy, a national tragedy. It is not only a physical tragedy in terms of the facilities are getting more and more antiquated every single year, but it is also a tragedy in the kind of subliminal message--and it isn't so subliminal a message--that it sends to children and their parents. Because as grownups and as political leaders are talking about the importance of children in our country and in our society, and that the children are our future, on the other hand, we are sending our children into these kinds of conditions every single day. We are sending the message that we do not really care about the kind of facilities where you are trying to learn, and we do not really care very much about education. That is the message that is being hammered home every single day to these millions of children who are going to school in these kinds of conditions. That is wrong. We are trying to address that. And that is a principal policy difference between the Republicans and the Democrats on the education issue. 
Massachusetts is no exception. Forty-one percent of Massachusetts schools report that at least one building needs extensive repairs or should be replaced. Seventy-five percent report serious problems in buildings, such as plumbing or heating defects. Eighty percent have at least one unsatisfactory environmental factor. It is difficult enough to teach or learn in modern classrooms, and it makes no sense to compound the difficulty by subjecting teachers and students to dilapidated facilities. We cannot tolerate a situation in which facilities deteriorate while enrollments escalate. 
Mr. President, in far too many communities across the country, children are also learning in overcrowded classrooms. 
This year, K-12 enrollment reached an all-time high, and will continue to rise over the next 7 years, and will increase by about 4 million children in K-12 over the period of the next 4 years. 
That is why it is so important that we are going to have a major effort in terms of increasing the teaching profession and giving them the skills to be able to teach these children to ever higher standards and to take into consideration the utilizations of the new electronics and to tie those into curriculum, all of that so that our children are going to have a world-class education. That is a new phenomenon. That is a national phenomenon--the expansion and growth of our children in our schools. We know this is happening. 
And now we need 6,000 new public schools built and needed by the year 2006 just to maintain the current class sizes. We know this is happening. We have been given that information by the Department of Education and by everyone that has studied this situation. 
Due to the overcrowded schools, they are using trailers for classrooms and teaching students in former hallways, closets, and bathrooms. And overcrowded classrooms undermine the discipline and decrease student morale. 
We have had the testimony during the earlier debates--I have given examples of these kinds of conditions--and for the first time heard from an outstanding president of a very important school in neighboring Virginia the fact that because of these overcrowded conditions, a new phenomenon is developing in their school, and it is called hall rage--hall rage. I never heard those words used before. 
What he was pointing out was, with the increasing number of students in these confined areas, that from the brushing against one another and the kinds of violence that is taking place in the classroom, you see the explosion in the number of fights, misunderstandings, and a deterioration in both morale and discipline because of hall rage--too many students trying to get to too many different places, and often in these trailers for classrooms and in closets and other situations. That is what is happening in the United States of America. That is what is happening. 
We ought to give a helping hand to the local communities. We are not interested in superimposing some Federal solution, some `new bureaucracy,' those old cliches. I have listened to the same cliches for 30-odd years. You would think they would have new ones, talking about the `new bureaucracy,' `one size fits all,' `Washington doesn't know everything.' You hear those every single day for 30 years, and you would think they would find some new ones. 
What we are finding out with overcrowded classrooms is, we have the demand for additional teachers and we have the demand for additional kinds of support for students as well in other areas. 
Mr. President, class sizes are too large. Students in small classes in the early grades make much more rapid progress than students in larger classes. In the exchange earlier today, I pointed out what some of the States are doing, and the findings in Wisconsin, the findings in California, Flint, MI, very important findings in terms of increasing literacy and academic achievement with these smaller classes. It is not the answer to everything, but it is a pretty clear and compelling case to be made. And it was made so clearly by the Senator from Washington, Senator Murray, on the importance of getting into smaller classes. As a former teacher and school board member, she is talking about what is happening out on Main Street. This is a message that should have been listened to. And we will have an opportunity to vote on her excellent amendment in just a little while. 
The benefits are greatest for low-achieving minority and low-income children with smaller classes. Smaller classes also enable teachers to identify and work effectively with students who have learning disabilities and reduce the need for special education at later grades. 
The Nation's students deserve modern schools with world-class teachers. But too many students in too many schools in too many communities across the country fail to achieve that standard. 
The latest international survey on math and science achievement confirms the urgent need to raise standards of performance for schools, teachers, and students alike. It is shameful that America's 12th graders ranked among the lowest of 22 nations participating in the international survey on math and science. Here we have prospectively, in the year 2000, on a voluntary basis, on the States and local community tests, so that we can raise the standards of American children in areas of math and science--we have an amendment to strike that, strike that proposal--tests that will be developed in a bipartisan way so parents have greater information to make decisions locally to enhance academic achievement and accomplishment, a compromise that was agreed to by 87 Members of this body, a bipartisan compromise, and now we have an amendment to strike that at a time when we are having these results and effectively denying the parents the opportunity to have knowledge and understanding about where their children are, in their school, in their community, in their State, relevant to other communities across the country, if they want to, if they believe that is important. I think that makes no sense whatever, and I hope the Ashcroft amendment will be defeated. 
Teacher shortages forced many school districts to hire uncertified teachers or to ask certified teachers to teach outside their area of expertise. That is what is happening in every area of the country. Each year, over 50,000 underprepared teachers enter the classroom. One in four does not fully meet State certification requirements. Twelve percent of new teachers have no training teacher at all. Students in inner city schools have only a 50 percent chance of being taught by a qualified science or math teacher. Listen to that: only a 50 percent chance of being taught by a qualified science or math teacher. 
Instead of putting the $1.6 billion in tax advantage for individuals who will send their kids to private schools, let's do something about those schoolteachers who are not certified in the areas of math and science, and upgrade their skills. They will go back to the public schools and be able to enhance the quality of education for those kids. This is a basic difference between our Republican friends and those on this side on the issue of teachers and the importance of having high standards on which to measure our children. 
Another high priority is to meet the need for more afterschool activities. Each day, 5 million children, many as young as 8 or 9 years old, are home alone after school. Juvenile delinquent crime peaks between the hours of 3 and 8. Children left unsupervised are more likely to be involved in antisocial activities and destructive patterns of behavior. It isn't just that there are greater opportunities for them to get in trouble, it is that there are advantages of having those children in circumstances where they are able to go into local community-based systems where they may get some help and assistance with their homework over the afternoon or maybe participate in some sports events that are supervised, so when the parents get home after a long, hard day, the children can have some quality time instead of having parents too often come home, know the kids have been watching television, or not knowing where their kids are, and sending them to their room to do the homework, and the parent lacks that opportunity to spend quality time. No one denies if the parents want to work with the child, well and good, but for the parents hard-pressed and working from early morning to late in the evening, and who have the responsibility in terms of the family that value the afternoon kind of program, they ought to be at least available.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, literacy is another very high 
priority, to date. Too many children are reading at unacceptable levels--40 percent of the fourth graders fail to attain the basic level of reading. 
Incredibly, Mr. President, the tax proposal that is the Coverdell proposal ignores each and every one of these pressing needs. The regressive Republican tax bill does nothing to improve public schools, nothing to address the need for public schools to build new facilities, nothing to reduce class size in school, nothing to provide qualified teachers, nothing to provide afterschool activities to keep children away from drugs, nothing to help all children learn to read, and nothing to help reach higher academic standards. It does nothing to improve the quality of education for children in public schools. Tax breaks for private schools is not the answer to the serious problems facing the Nation's public schools. 
There are serious problems in the Nation's public schools. We can do much more to turn troubled schools around and undertake a wide-range of proven reforms to create and sustain safe and high-performing schools. There are no magic remedies to improve schools and improve student learning. We need to use our limited resources wisely to get the most benefits for our tax dollars. 
The Republican approach would divert urgently needed funds away from public schools into private schools. That is wrong for education, wrong for America, and wrong for the Nation's future.

Mr. KENNEDY. We have now an opportunity to make a choice as we are going to vote on this measure, the Coverdell bill, which has been estimated to be $1.6 billion over the period of the next 10 years. We will have a choice either this evening or tomorrow as to how we are going to expend those funds, whether they will be used primarily, as the Tax Committee says, for private schools or, as I understand the Senator's amendment, to recognize excellence in schools all across this country as a result of local decisions that are being made by parents, local community decisions, and to give a financial reward. $100,000 is a considerable reward, but I imagine, since these schools are dedicating themselves to improving and strengthening their academic achievements and accomplishments, those resources are going to be used to further student advancement, thereby giving some real meaning to the local initiatives to put excellence first in terms of public education. 
So on the one hand we are going to have a choice for recognizing excellence at the local level selected by peer review or the funds will be primarily used in terms of private education. Do I understand it correctly?

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I agree with the Senator from Washington that if the State wants to tax its own people and do whatever it wants to, it should have the ability to do it. If the local community wants to tax its people, they ought to be able to do whatever they want. But what Senator Gorton is saying is, we are going to use Federal taxpayers' money, the money that is directed by the Congress. 
We have designated three very important areas that are eliminated by the amendment of the Senator from Washington. 
First, drug-free schools. I do not find any parents from Massachusetts saying, `Abolish drug-free schools.' The Gorton amendment will abolish it. 
Secondly, for the training of teachers in math and science, I do not find parents saying, `We ought to abolish that program.' The Gorton amendment does it. 
And third, in terms of raising high academic standards, the programs that help and assist local schools to be able to do it, I do not find parents in my State saying, `Abolish that program.' It will be abolished by the Gorton amendment. 
It makes no sense, Madam President. And there is no accountability under the Gorton amendment how these funds are being spent and what the effect of it is in improving academic achievement and accomplishment. To do it after 30 minutes of debate makes no sense whatsoever. I hope that the amendment will be defeated.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Health Care for Working Families Act. 
Today we resume the battle for health insurance for all Americans. 
We face a continuing crisis in health care for millions of workers and their families. Forty-one million Americans are uninsured. The number grew by more than one million last year, and if we do nothing, it will continue to grow at the same alarming rate. 
The vast majority--85%--of these uninsured Americans--are workers or members of their families. These citizens work hard--40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year in most cases--but all their hard work cannot buy them the health insurance they need to protect their families, because they can't afford it and their employers won't provide it. 
Every uninsured American is an American tragedy waiting to happen. Infants lose their chance to grow up strong and healthy because they do not get critical prenatal care. A young family loses its livelihood because a breadwinner cannot afford essential medical services. Middle-aged parents see the savings set aside to send their children to college or pay for their retirement swept away by a tidal wave of medical debt. 
These conditions should be unacceptable in America today. The time has come to take a simple but important step toward the day when every job carries with it a guarantee of affordable family health care. 
Every business is expected to pay a minimum wage, and to obey the child labor laws. Every business is expected to provide safe and healthy working conditions, and to protect against injury on the job through worker's compensation. Every business is expected to contribute to retirement through Social Security, and to the health needs of the elderly through Medicare. It is long past time for businesses also to contribute to the cost of basic health insurance coverage for their workers. 
Some small firms have special problems that may call for special solutions. But there can be no excuse for large firms to shirk their responsibility to provide affordable health insurance for their workers. 
Under the bill we are introducing today, businesses with 50 or more workers will be required to provide health insurance coverage. Approximately half of all uninsured employees and their families--15 million people--will gain the coverage they need and deserve. This legislation is a giant step toward the day when every American will be guaranteed the fundamental right to health care. 
Many--even most--businesses already provide insurance. The vast majority of large business, in particular, fulfill this obligation. But too many others do not. In more and more cases, unfair competition from firms that refuse to provide insurance for their workers is compelling other firms to reduce health benefits or drop coverage altogether. 
Health insurance for working Americans does not have to mean complicated regulations or excessive government intervention. The legislation we are introducing today is simple--less than ten pages. It will not cost taxpayers a dime. It includes no specific mandated benefits or burdensome red tape. It simply says that every business with 50 workers or more must offer its employees coverage equal in value to the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Standard Option Plan that is available to every Senator and Representative and must pay at least 72% of the cost--the same proportion that taxpayers contribute for every member of Congress. 
The American people deserve health care for their families that is every bit as good as the health care they provide to every member of Congress. The incremental reform enacted in recent years has helped many families, but it is far from sufficient. The time has come for Congress to take a larger step.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in expressing my sadness over the death of our former colleague, Senator Terry Sanford, and I commend the Senator from North Carolina for his eloquent statement. Senator Sanford was an extraordinary leader of many talents. He was an outstanding Member of this body, an outstanding educator, and an outstanding Governor of North Carolina. 
Many of us had the privilege of serving with him in the Senate and of knowing him personally. We admired his great ability, his unusual eloquence, and his abiding commitment to the people of North Carolina and the nation. 
In a sense, I inherited Terry Sanford from President Kennedy. He was one of the first Southern leaders to endorse my brother for President in the 1960 campaign. My brother had visited North Carolina as a Senator, and had been very impressed by Terry Sanford. I know the very high regard that my brother had for him as a voice of the New South, as a champion of education, and as a leader who understood the importance of bringing people together. 
In July 1960, at a critical moment leading up to the Democratic Convention in Los Angeles, Terry Sanford endorsed my brother and then seconded my brother's nomination for President. It made an enormous difference. In a very real sense, Governor Sanford helped to lay the foundation for my brother's New Frontier. 
Later, after serving with great distinction as Governor, Terry Sanford became a President himself--of Duke University, where he served for 16 years, and won world-wide renown as one of the pre-eminent educators of the century. 
He won election to the United States Senate in 1986. All of us on both sides of the aisle held him in great respect--and in great affection as well. In so many ways, Terry Sanford was a Senator's Senator. He was fair-minded and warm-hearted, and he knew the issues well. Above all, he impressed us with the power of his commitment, the eloquence of his words, the remarkable moral authority of his leadership, and his dedication to excellence in all aspects of public service. We admired him for his statesmanship, and we loved him for his friendship. We will miss him very much. He was truly a profile in courage for our time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the purpose of the amendment of the Senator from Texas is to permit separate classrooms for different genders, you can already do that. We already have it. So there is no purpose in this. If the purpose is to set up schools which are separate and allegedly providing, as the amendment says, `comparable,' all you have to do is look at the court opinions and what `comparable' means, and it fails to meet the constitutional standard in terms of real equality. 
We don't have to learn in this country again that, when you have either minorities in separate facilities or women in separate facilities, it is second-level education or treatment. We can debate that at another time. That is the history. If you just want to have separate classrooms, you can already have them, and it is constitutional. 
There is a much more sinister and real issue of constitutionality that is raised by this. We virtually had no hearings. If you don't want to undermine the whole movement of trying to get equal treatment for women in the classrooms and education, vote in opposition to the amendment of the Senator from Texas.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, it is important to note that under the Moseley-Braun amendment the provision dealing with the construction, the Graham amendment, is not struck, it is preserved, as well as the tuition assistance programs. What is struck is the Coverdell proposal. And the 
Coverdell proposal, according to the Joint Tax Committee, provides that the majority of its money is going to go to private schools. Now that is a fact. 
You have the choice of whether you want that or whether you want to have a downpayment in our public schools to try to help ensure that we are going to free our public schools from asbestos, from boilers breaking down, and from leaky pipes. 
Mr. President, I want to just mention a case here that is right on point. And this is the Revere public schools. That is a blue-collar area in Massachusetts. It has increased by 25 percent the enrollment over the past 5 years in the elementary schools. Revere recently passed a $2.2 million referendum to repair roofs in three schools and to remove the asbestos panels and modernize the fire alarm system in the high school. Since then, the high school roof has begun to leak, threatening to ruin the new fire alarm system. The town estimates it will cost $1 million to repair the roof. The mayor says: We would repair the roof if we had the Carol Moseley-Braun amendment. 
What I hear from the mayors all over Massachusetts, in the old towns and communities, as well as in the rural areas, is that interest on some of these bonds runs up to 40 percent of the burden and the debt, in many instances, if they are not attended to in a prompt way. 
This provides a helping hand to those needy communities. And it is an essential part of the President's program. I commend the Senator from Illinois for making this strong case and hope our colleagues will support her.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the issue that is before the Senate now is whether we are going to take the $1.6 billion and use it in such a way that is going to effectively help and assist the private schools--because that is where the majority of the money is going to be invested--or whether we are prepared to invest that money to increase the total number of teachers. 
Again, Mr. President, the legislation that we have before us this morning will provide $1.6 billion. We have to decide whether we are going to use that money to create an IRA which will be primarily used to support private schools, or whether we will take that $1.6 billion and use to it create more teachers across this country. If we use the $1.6 billion, we will provide 100,000 new schoolteachers for the public schools across this Nation. 
It is estimated that we are going to need 2 million new high school teachers. This will at least provide 100,000. It seems to me that if we are interested in academic achievement and accomplishment and we support our public schools, then getting highly qualified teachers to invest in those schools is the way to go. That is what this amendment does. It takes the $1.6 billion and uses it to create 100,000 more schoolteachers rather than to use it to create additional funds to support private schools. 
We have a modest program in our higher education bill that will provide $200 million for 5 years, which is $40 million a year. That is bipartisan. I support it. But it is not enough. We have a major opportunity now to do something significantly for the public schools, and that is to increase the number of qualified teachers who will serve in our public schools.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to increase the nation's supply of qualified teachers. Investing in teachers is an investment in our children, an investment in the future, and an investment in America. If students in communities across the country are to be prepared to compete in the global marketplace, we must attract and retain the best and the brightest teachers. 
We know that having a qualified teacher in the classroom is one of the most important influences on a child's academic success. Yet too many schools are already understaffed. During the next decade, rising student enrollments and massive teacher retirements mean that the nation will need to hire 2 million new teachers. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, between one-third and one-half of all elementary and secondary school teachers are 45 years old or older. The national average age of teachers is 43 years old. The average age of Massachusetts teachers is 46 years old--tying the District of Columbia for having the oldest teachers in the Nation. 
Boston alone expects almost half of the city's teachers to retire over the next decade. In addition, Boston already has acute teacher shortages in areas such as bilingual education and high school science. At the same time, Boston's student enrollment is growing by 900 students a year. 
The teacher shortage has forced school districts to hire more than 50,000 under-prepared teachers each year, and to ask certified teachers to teach outside their area of expertise. One in four new teachers does not fully meet state certification requirements. 
We need to do more--much more--to assure that quality teachers are available for each and every child and classroom. 
This amendment provides for the forgiveness of federal student loans as an incentive to college students to become teachers. We know that qualified young men and women can often make more money in private industry. Many of them, burdened with heavy undergraduate and graduate debts from student loans, refuse to even consider teaching as their career. Reducing the burden of their debt can be a significant incentive to encourage them to become teachers, and to agree to teach in areas where the need is greatest. 
Attracting more qualified teachers to the teaching field over the next ten years will help to address teacher shortages across the country and improve student achievement. This amendment will move us closer to that goal. 
The Labor Committee has recommended a similar provision as part of the Higher Education Act Amendment. But it is entirely appropriate to consider this here as part of the pending bill as well. 
Our goal is to recruit 100,000 additional teachers over the next 10 years, especially in high-need subjects such as math and science. 
We should be doing all we can to encourage good students to become good teachers. It is one of our highest priorities in education. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to help us meet that goal.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to oppose the anti-education Republican tax bill. Improving education can and must be a top priority for Congress and the Nation, but this Republican bill flunks the test. They call it the A+ bill, but it is anti-education and deserves an F. This Republican bill and its proposed Republican amendments are bad tax policy and bad education policy, and it clearly deserves the veto that President Clinton has pledged to give it. 
It is the Nation's public schools that need help. So what do our Republican friends do? They propose legislation to aid private schools. That makes no sense at all. Our goal is to strengthen public schools, not abandon them. Our goal is to help all children get a good education, not just the ones with wealthy parents. It is clear that our Republican friends are no friends of public schools. They have an anti-education agenda. They want tax breaks for the wealthy who send their children to private schools. 
The underlying bill uses tax breaks to subsidize parents to send their children to private schools, and it is a serious mistake. It diverts scarce resources away from public schools that have the greatest need. The regressive Republican tax bill does nothing to improve public schools--it does nothing to improve public schools. It does nothing to address the serious need of public schools to build new facilities and repair the existing crumbling facilities. 
This afternoon, we will have the excellent amendment of the Senator from Illinois, Carol Moseley-Braun, who has really been the leader in this body and in the country in recognizing the challenges that so many of our schools are facing. They are old and crumbling, and we need to modernize them. 
It is a powerful amendment because the amendment says we are prepared to put resources to reconstruct our schools, but it also has a subliminal message, and that is that we want our children to go into the best facilities. If we say to the young people of this Nation that education is a priority, and day after day they go to dilapidated schools or schools that have leaky ceilings or the windows are broken or they have inadequate facilities, we are sending a message to children that they are not a priority in this country and that education is not a priority. 
When we ask our children to spend the time to do the hard and difficult work to master subject matters, they have to really wonder whether the message that is coming from an older generation has much merit. That is why the amendment of Senator Carol Moseley-Braun is so important and why I think all of us are very hopeful that we can attain the objectives of that amendment and see that amendment approved. 
I know she will have an opportunity to go into very considerable detail about the General Accounting Office study of the schools across the Nation. It estimates that $110 billion is needed to invest in our schools in order to bring them up to satisfactory condition. Her amendment is much more modest, but it is an important amendment, and it is one that deserves the 
support of all of us who are interested in making sure that at least the physical facilities are going to be first rate for the future generations of children. It just makes common sense. 
In many of our communities, particularly older communities, whether it is in urban areas or rural communities, they just don't have the wherewithal to do that. But the amendment of the Senator from Illinois, Carol Moseley-Braun, provides some help and assistance in providing interest-free loans to those communities so that they can themselves make the judgment, make the determination, but they will get some help and assistance in terms of borrowing those funds interest free. 
It makes a great deal of sense. I think we will have an alternative and an opportunity to say whether that amendment is really where we want to go or, on the other hand, if we want to continue with the Republican proposal that will provide just some tax benefits for a certain group of Americans who are going to use those tax benefits to benefit children attending the private schools. That is going to be a very, very important debate and one where I hope our colleagues will find compelling reasons to support that amendment. 
Second, Mr. President, the underlying Coverdell proposal does nothing to reduce the class size in our schools. I don't know how many more hearings we have to have in our education committee and how many other examinations of what is happening in a number of different States--in Kentucky and in many other communities across this country--to understand that when you have too many children in the class--you may have teachers who are able to handle it and do it very well, and we take our hats off to them--but when you are talking about having classes with 30 students, 25 students, 20 students, you are talking about an enormous demand on the teacher and also inappropriate lack of attention for the students. We will also have an opportunity to vote on that later in the course of this debate. That can make a major difference in helping and assisting local communities in having reduced class sizes. That, I think, is a higher priority than, again, providing the tax benefits for those who want to use those for private schools. 
This underlying proposal does nothing to provide qualified teachers in more classrooms across the Nation. We had an opportunity to address that briefly in our debate earlier today. It was turned down. I welcome the fact that we had 41 Senators who supported our proposal that said, if we are going to spend $1.6 billion in education, let us make the decision that we want to invest it in more teachers for the 4 million additional children who are going to be attending our public school system, to help meet the gap, which we recognize is 2 million teachers that we are going to need for our public schools over the next 10 years; let us at least have 100,000 new, well-qualified teachers to teach in those schools. That is a preferable way of spending $1.6 billion rather than, again, spending this as a tax break, as a new entitlement--a new entitlement program--that is going to benefit, again, those who send their children to private schools. 
It does nothing in this underlying amendment to help children reach high academic standards. I don't, again, know how many hours of hearings we have to have to say that children respond best when they are challenged. Most of us as human beings do. Our Nation does. It always has at a time of its greatest need. We should challenge children to raise the bar, rather than teaching down to them. We should create higher 
academic standards. We ought to be doing that. 
There is nothing in this legislation that will do anything like that for the public schools in this country. It does nothing to provide afterschool activities to keep kids off the street, away from drugs, and out of trouble. We know the value of afterschool programs. 
We have some 5 million children in our country who this afternoon at 2 or 2:30 will go home to empty houses. They will be told by their parents, `Look, maybe have a little snack, and if you have to watch television, watch television on X station; try and get your homework done.' But we know what happens in those circumstances. Too many of those children who are left alone, unsupervised, more often than not will find that the temptations of getting into trouble are increased dramatically. 
This is not just a diversion from education, but it also has an important impact in terms of crime in our local communities. 
A city that has made about as much progress as any city in this country is my city of Boston. It has gone 2 years and 4 months without a single youth homicide. And if you ask Paul Evans, who is the commissioner of the police department in Boston, MA, he will say, yes, dealing in an appropriate way with gangs, that is No. 1. No. 2, tracing various weapons that are used in gangs. But No. 3, afterschool programs. Afterschool programs keep kids out of trouble. That is very, very important. 
Is there anything with the $1.6 billion that is being recommended on the floor of the U.S. Senate to try to develop programs that we know are tried and tested, that will provide an incentive for children to go to various community centers, to work with volunteers? The number of young people who are volunteering is increasing every single day to help children with their homework so that when they do go home and they see their parents, who have been working hard all day, they will have quality time with their parents rather than hearing from their parents, `Well, you ought to go upstairs and make sure you get your homework done.' This is enormously important, and it is recognized by educators and those who are concerned about law enforcement across this country. 
There isn't a nickel in this program--not a nickel in this program--to try to address that particular issue. 
So, Mr. President, we know where these benefits are going to go. They are going to go to the individuals who are going to invest those benefits in the private schools rather than investing in our public schools. 
The challenge is clear. We must do all we can to improve teaching and learning for all of the students across the country. We must continue to support efforts to raise academic standards. We must test students early so we know where they need help in time to make that help effective. We must provide better training for current and new teachers so they are well-prepared to teach to higher standards. 
We must reduce class size to help students obtain the individual attention they need. We must provide afterschool programs to make constructive alternatives available to students. We must provide greater resources to modernize and expand the Nation's school buildings to meet the urgent needs of schools for up-to-date facilities. We cannot stand by and let regressive tax policy pass to help private schools at the expense of the public schools. 
In those items that I have just mentioned, every superintendent of schools, every schoolteacher, every department of education across this country would agree with those essential parts of a sound education program to help and assist the public schools in this country. Where in that list do we find `Let's have tax breaks. Let's have the creation of a new entitlement. Let's create a new entitlement that is basically going to be used in order to support the private schools in this country'? It makes no sense.

Mr. KENNEDY. We cannot stand by and let this regressive tax policy pass to help private schools at the expense of public schools. Parents across the country want real solutions, not token gestures in the name of education. We should not waste $1.5 billion of public tax dollars on a do-nothing tax break program. So I hope my colleagues will join us in opposing this bill. We should do all we can to help the public schools and not abandon them. 
Finally, I just want to say that we will be under the close timeframe this afternoon, but I want to just add my strong support again to Senator Moseley-Braun's substitute for the Coverdell bill. It is well-designed to help communities across the country to modernize, repair, and expand their school facilities. 
Schools across the Nation face the serious problem of overcrowding. Antiquated facilities are suffering from physical decay and are not equipped to handle the needs of modern education. Across the country, 14 million children, in a third of the Nation's schools, are learning in substandard buildings. Half the schools have at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition. It would take over $100 billion just to repair the existing facilities. 
It is difficult enough to teach or learn in dilapidated classrooms but now, because of escalating enrollments, classrooms are increasingly overcrowded. The Nation will need 6,000 new schools in the next few years just to maintain the current class size given the expansion of the number of children who will be going to our schools. 
Democrats have made this a top priority to see that America has the best education system in the world. Providing safe and adequate school facilities is an important step towards meeting that goal. 
So, Mr. President, I hope that our Members will go and support the excellent amendment of the Senator from Illinois this afternoon and that it will be successful. It is far preferable to just providing a tax break for individuals who are going to use that to support the private schools.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, this week marks the fourteenth annual observance of `Tuftonia's Week' in Massachusetts. During this remarkable week, Tufts University alumni from around the world return to Medford to honor their alma mater and call attention to the leadership of so many Tufts graduates in contributing to public service in their own communities. 
In fact, the theme of Tuftonia's Week is community service. The university will honor the large number of Tufts graduates across the country who are volunteering in their communities and helping to improve the lives of others in their neighborhoods through the TuftServe program. Since 1995, Tufts alumni have contributed over 300,000 volunteer hours to make their communities better places. 
78,000 students have graduated from Tufts since the college was founded in 1852. Today, the university enrolls 8,500 students from all 50 states and 90 foreign countries. 
Tufts deserves great credit for its leadership among the nation's universities in emphasizing service-learning and in providing opportunities for students to combine community service with their academic curriculum. Every American should have the opportunity to participate in projects that help others and improve their community, and I congratulate Tufts for giving its students such an opportunity. I commend Tufts' President, John DiBiaggio, and the rest of the Tufts community for their impressive leadership in both education and community service.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the amendment, which hopefully we will have more of an opportunity to debate later this week, deals with meeting the demand for qualified teachers in this country. We are seeing an expansion of the number of students in our elementary-secondary education. This amendment would provide for an increase of 100,000 schoolteachers a year for the next 10 years. It would effectively meet half of the Nation's requirements to do so. 
There are very compelling reasons to support this amendment if we are going to be serious about ensuring the adequacy of the academic achievement and accomplishment for those students who are attending our public schools. We have devised a way of doing this through a loan forgiveness program that is taking the concept, for example, of the National Health Service Corps--which is a resounding success. Doctors serve in underserved areas and see a diminution of their debt with the years of service in the Health Service Corps. Given the need that we have for teachers to serve in our schools, this would provide an incentive for those who have indebtedness and would like to work as schoolteachers but are unable to do so because they are required to go to other jobs that may have more financial reward although they would prefer to work in the schools. This provides the means for them to do so. I plan to speak of that at greater length tomorrow or the next day and will take the opportunity to do so at that time, when the leadership works out the scheduling of the particular amendments. 
Mr. President, given the shortage of time, I just want to come back to some rather fundamental and basic issues that are involved in this debate. When all is said and done and when all the explanations are made, I think it is appropriate that we find out who are going to be the winners and who are going to be the losers. It is always interesting to listen to our colleagues explain what they hope might be achieved by the amendment, and then also examine what, in fact, will be achieved by this amendment and who will benefit from this particular amendment. 
As we had seen during our earlier debate and discussion on the Coverdell amendment, there are some very important winners and important losers. But the fact remains that, according to the Joint Tax Committee--which is neither a Republican committee nor a Democratic committee, but serves to provide technical information on the impact of a tax proposal to the membership, 
that the bill gives the benefit to those going to the private schools. At the present time, nationwide, 93 percent of American families send their children to the public schools, 7 percent to the private schools. We certainly know the important role private schools have in our society. But with scarce resources we have to ask the question whether we want to use scarce resources to add to the private schools or to the public schools. I do not believe we should abandon the public school system in this country. I think we have a responsibility to the public schools. If we have scarce resources, we ought to find ways of targeting scarce resources in ways that can be academically important and enhance the ability of our children to make progress in the public schools. 
So, with the analysis that was done by the Joint Tax Committee, they indicated where the money would go. Mr. President, 48 percent of the tax benefit would go to families that send their children to the public schools and 52 percent would go to families that send them to the private schools. Then, if you see that only 7 percent of Americans go to private schools, you see that a majority of the benefit of this proposal will go to a relatively small number of families who are sending their children to the private schools. 
That is not what the Senator from Massachusetts is saying; that is what the Joint Tax Committee tells us. We have a certain amount of resources that will be collected through the tax system. When they are collected, they will be disposed of--at least according to the Joint Tax Committee estimate--in this way. There are better ways to spend public tax dollars. An after-school program, could benefit the 5 million children who left school just about a half-hour ago, and will go home without any supervision. Maybe we should have the kinds of programs that we have seen that are effective, which provide some opportunity for those children to go to after-school programs, where they are able to work with their homework and get that homework done so when they finally go back home to their parents, one or two of whom may be working, that they can have quality time with their parents rather than having the parents telling them you better go upstairs and get your homework done. 
This is really a basic, fundamental issue, whether we have sufficient funds that are available to the Congress where we want to try to provide this kind of benefit to a relatively small group of parents. I do not think that we do. 
I have heard a lot from our colleagues on the other side talking about entitlements. There was a great debate about entitlements here on the floor of the U.S. Senate over the last 3 or 4 years. This basically is a new entitlement. This is a new entitlement by our Republican friends. We heard the criticisms of so many entitlements over the past. Now we have the creation of a new entitlement. Once this is passed and goes into the Internal Revenue Code, it will be out there available to anyone who would be able to develop this kind of an IRA. 
That effectively is an entitlement. But it is an entitlement that is going to benefit a relatively small group of families who are going to be using those resources primarily in the private schools. 
There may be those who feel that is the way we ought to go. But I think you will find here on our side, on the Democratic side, a range of different proposals that say we will not abandon our public schools in this country. We think they need modernization, they need some help and assistance in the construction program. We are very creative. An important, significant amendment will be offered by the Senator from Illinois, Carol Moseley-Braun. There will be programs that will say we ought to have smaller class sizes. That has been demonstrated to improve academics for children. That amendment will be offered by Senator Murray. We ought to support public schools. 
The benefit of those programs go to all of those parents whose children are going to the public schools. That is a very important, basic difference. It is targeted programs that can really make a difference in enhancing academic achievement and accomplishment. 
We will have an opportunity, as well, to debate concepts such as that proposed by the Senator from the State of Washington, Senator Gorton, that block grants education programs, undermining targeting of scarce resources, and undermining accountability. We will have a chance to debate those.

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 1 more minute. We will have a chance as well to debate whether we will uphold the civil right of children with disabilities. That is going to be a very important debate. 
But I hope, as we are starting off on this Monday, and as we are going through this debate over the period of the next 4 or 5 days, to understand what is really the issue. With the amount of funds that are going to be made available under this program, which is effectively a new entitlement program, $1.6 billion, are we going to say we should use that in such a way that it is going to benefit a small number of families who are going to primarily use these funds for private schools? Or are we going to say, with scarce resources, we ought to use that money in order to benefit the large number of children who are going to the public school systems and we ought to use that in an effective and creative way, to make sure that children who are going to our public school systems are going to get a good education in safe, modern schools? 
Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

Doesn't the Senator draw a distinction between the mandatory requirements that we have for the public school system for our 55 million children and those who are going to higher education, which is basically not a mandated requirement? That is an optional requirement and, therefore, historically higher education has always been treated differently.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself a minute just in response to the Senator from Indiana. 
This is a basic substitute to the Coverdell amendment. We have an opportunity to say it is more beneficial to the children that are going to our public schools to support our amendment that is going to increase the number of qualified teachers than to support the Coverdell amendment which is primarily going to benefit the parents who are sending their children to private schools, No. 1. 
Secondly, I hope that my friend and colleague would read my amendment more carefully, because it does target the teachers into the underserved areas, and also it targets teachers into the areas where the State finds that there are critical shortages in terms of the type of specialty needs--for example, in subject matters, for example, in math and science, and others, and does it, I think, more creatively than we have done in the higher ed bill. 
I yield myself another minute. 
It is clearly responding to what our Human Resources 
Committee has had hours of hearings on, and that is the importance of having high-quality teachers for our expanded school-age population. I am a strong supporter of what we have done in the higher ed bill, but it is not going to be enough to be able to meet the needs of the Nation. And every study we have done has pointed this out. If you want to try and benefit public schools and teachers, my amendment is the way to do it. If you want to abandon public schools and move towards the support of families that are sending their children to private schools, then the Coverdell bill is the way to do it. 
I withhold the balance of my time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask the Senator to reread the amendment. If he looks at the loan forgiveness for the teachers, on line 8 it talks about the title I programs which are targeted to the poorest schools. At paragraph (2), line 12, it makes reference to teachers who teach math, science, foreign languages, and that the State educational agency determines it. 
So I do realize that we have supported a good program that is coming out of our Human Resources Committee. But the Budget Committee put hands down, thumbs down, on a very similar program that was advanced by the President of the United States. We have real money here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. And this is an opportunity that if you want to do something about increasing the number of qualified teachers, our amendment does it. If you do not want to do that, and you want to benefit the private schools, you will vote against this. 
I urge the Senate to oppose the anti-education Republican tax bill. Improving education can and must be a top priority for Congress and the nation. But this Republican bill flunks the test. They call it their `A+' bill. But, it's anti-education, and it deserves an `F.' This Republican bill and its proposed Republican amendments are bad tax policy, bad education policy, and bad disability policy, and it clearly deserves the veto that President Clinton has pledged to give it. 
It is the nation's public schools that need help. So what do our Republican friends to? They proposed legislation that aid private schools. That makes no sense at all. Our goal is to strengthen public schools, not abandon them. Our goal is to help all children get a good eduction--not just the ones with wealthy parents. 
It is clear that our Republican friends are no friends of public schools. They have an anti-education agenda. They want tax breaks for the wealthy who send their children to private schools. They want to cut the budget for public schools. They want to dismantle the federal role in education. They want to eliminate civil rights protections for children with disabilities. The Republicans have put the cards on the table--and it's a losing hand for education. 
Over the course of the limited debate on this bill, we will discuss good ideas that will help improve public schools such as rebuilding the nation's schools, reducing class size, forgiving student loans for college graduates who teach in high-need areas, and increasing funding for children with disabilities. I urge my colleagues to support these very important Democratic amendments. I also urge my colleagues to oppose Republican amendments to that undermine public education, and make a bad bill worse. 
I understand that we will be voting on a new version of a block grant for education, sponsored by Senator Gorton. It is clear that this amendment will undermine the federal commitment to improve the nation's schools. There have been no hearings on this proposal and no committee review of the proposal. It would be irresponsible for the Senate to support this proposal to revamp the federal role in education after a total of only 30 minutes of debate. 
The proposed Gorton amendment hurts students and goes against the nation's commitment to helping poor and educationally disadvantaged students who need our strong support. It also undermines the partnerships that have been created by federal, state, and local education agencies to improve all schools for all children. 
We all agree that education is a local responsibility. But the states and the federal government are important partners in helping to improve education for all children. We all need to work together to improve the nation's public schools. 
This amendment rejects that basic principle. It destroys carefully crafted and widely supported federal programs. And it undermines accountability for improving the achievement of all students. 
Currently, federal funds are offering a helping hand to local school districts in meeting high priority responsibilities important to the nation as a whole. The funds help schools and school districts improve reading and math skills of disadvantaged students, help teachers get the extra skills they need to teach all children to higher standards, help communities create safe and drug-free schools, and help communities modernize their schools. 
This amendment creates a `General Education Block Grant' by combining funds from 20 targeted programs. Then it limits the use of those funds to only 8 activities. It denies local communities the funds to make schools safe and drug-free. It denies local communities the funds to improve skills of math and science teachers. It denies local communities the funds to continue their efforts to set high academic standards for all children. 
In addition, in response to growing needs of schools in communities across the country to address problems such as low student performance, rising enrollments, and lack of adequate modern technology, the amendment would cap spending at 2.3 percent per year for the next five years. These limits are far below the necessary increases we made over the last two years of 15 percent and 12 percent. It would be irresponsible for Congress to do so little to help communities address their growing and pressing educational needs. 
Contrary to arguments made by proponents of the amendment, federal education laws are more flexible and school-friendly than ever before. States and local education agencies are working in closer and more effective cooperation. The result is that schools are doing a better job of helping all children meet higher standards of achievement. 
The federal-state-local partnership in education isn't broken, and this amendment can't fix it. Congress should be doing all it can to strengthen that partnership, not destroy it. 
As a nation, we have made a commitment to help all students have the opportunity to get a good education. We have a responsibility to make sure that public tax dollars are well spent. This amendment provides no accountability for how these dollars are spent. Reforming the federal role in education does not mean abdicating 
that role. 
This amendment is the wrong direction for the nation's children and the wrong direction for education. It is not an attempt to offer a helping hand to local schools. It is simply a thinly-veiled attempt to dismantle the federal role in education. 
We should support efforts to improve education for all students, not undermine them. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Gorton block grant amendment. 
Another problematic amendment that I understand will be introduced later in the debate is the Gregg amendment to allow states and school districts to strip civil rights protections for students with disabilities. 
The proposed Gregg amendment would repeal the critical civil rights protections included in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act that ensures that children with disabilities are not denied educational services. Prior to the enactment of IDEA, over half the children with disabilities in this country were receiving an inadequate education or no education at all. Under the proposal, children with disabilities could be unilaterally thrown out of school, even if the child was being `disciplined' for a behavior caused by the child's disability. 
This proposal is not in the interest of children with disabilities and it is not in the interest of the nation. In fact, a similar amendment was rejected on the Senate floor last year during consideration of the reauthorization of IDEA. The Senate did not support the proposed policy last year, and we should not support it now. 
Proponents of the bill claim that under current law, schools cannot discipline children with disabilities when they break the rules. That is simply not true. 
IDEA allows school officials to discipline a child with a disability when discipline is warranted. IDEA already allows immediate action against a child with a disability who brings a weapon to school, who knowingly possesses, uses, or sells illegal drugs or controlled substances, or whose behavior is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others. In addition, if the behavior resulting in the disciplinary action is not the result of a child's disability, IDEA allows the school to apply any relevant disciplinary procedures that they would apply to a child without a disability. 
Police, prosecutors, and groups representing school officials and children with disabilities all support pursuing policies that ensure that our schools are safe and conducive to learning, and to help all children, including children with disabilities, learn personal responsibility. But, discipline should never be used as an excuse to exclude, segregate, or deny services to children with disabilities. 
The goal of public education is to give all children the opportunity to pursue their dreams. We must be committed to every child--even the ones who aren't so easy to teach. This amendment would undermine that goal and put children with disabilities on the street. It's bad policy and we should overwhelmingly reject it. 
These amendments simply make the bad underlying bill even worse. The underlying bill uses tax breaks to subsidize parents who send their children to private schools, and it is a serious mistake. It diverts scarce resources away from public schools that have the greatest need. 
The regressive Republican tax bill does nothing to improve public schools. 
It does nothing to address the serious need of public schools to build new facilities and repair their crumbling existing facilities. 
It does nothing to reduce class sizes in schools. 
It does nothing to provide qualified teachers in more classrooms across the nation. 
It does nothing to help children reach high academic standards. 
It does nothing to provide after-school activities to keep kids off the street, away from drugs, and out of trouble. 
It does nothing to improve the quality of education for children in public schools. Tax breaks for private schools are not the answer to the serious problems facing the nation's public schools. 
This bill would spend $1.5 billion of public tax dollars over the next 10 years on subsidies to help wealthy people pay private school tuition and other private school expenses. 
According to the Joint Tax Committee, the bill will cost $1.5 billion over the next 10 years, and half the benefits will go to the 7 percent of families that have children in private schools. That's unacceptable, when public schools are desperate for additional help. 
The Joint Tax Committee also estimates that while 83 percent of private school families will use this tax break, only 30 percent of public school families will use it. 
The bill disproportionately benefits private school families, and it disproportionately benefits the wealthy. The majority of the tax benefits will go to 
families in the highest income brackets, who can already afford to send their children to private school. 
Working families do not have enough assets and savings to participate in this scheme. This regressive bill does not help families struggling to pay day-to-day expenses during their children's school years. 
This so-called education bill does nothing for education. It simply provides a tax shelter for the rich. 
Congress should be building new schools--not building new tax shelters for the wealthy. 
Congress should be reducing class size--not reducing aid to public schools. 
We know what it takes to achieve genuine education reform. The place to start is by resoundingly rejecting this defective bill, and then amending it in ways that will genuinely help the nation's schools. 
The challenge is clear. We must do all we can to improve teaching and learning for all students across the nation. 
We must continue to support efforts to raise academic standards. 
We must test students early, so that we know where they need help in time to make that help effective. 
We must provide better training for current and new teachers, so that they are well-prepared to teach to high standards. 
We must reduce class size, to help students obtain the individual attention they need. 
We must provide after-school programs to make constructive alternatives available to students. 
We must provide greater resources to modernize and expand the nation's school buildings to meet the urgent needs of schools for up-to-date facilities. 
We cannot stand by and let this regressive tax policy pass to help private schools at the expense of public schools. 
Parents across the country want real solutions--not token gestures in the name of education. We should not waste $1.5 billion of public tax dollars on a do-nothing tax break program. 
I hope that my colleagues will join me today in opposing this bill. We should be doing all we can to help public schools--not abandon them.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is the last item of President Clinton's education proposal. It basically provides help and assistance to communities for these educational opportunity grants for those communities in this country, both in rural and urban areas, that are showing a special kind of designation in reforming and rehabilitating their total educational package. 
This is one of the areas that has been recommended by most of the educational groups. It has been tried and tested in the past year and a half with very small, modest programs, with very substantial improvement in academic achievement and accomplishment. 
It does provide $1.5 billion over 5 years, and it is paid for with an across-the-board cut in nondefense by less than two-tenths of 1 percent of the budget program. I hope the Senate will adopt the amendment.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the equal employment amendment calls for a 15% increase in the budget for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for the coming year. Under this amendment the EEOC's budget will increase from $242 million to $279 million next year. 
One of the most basic civil rights protected by current law is the right to equal opportunity in employment, your right to be free from job discrimination because of your race, your sex, your age, your ethnic background, your religion, or any disability you may have. This country has made significant progress against job discrimination, but we still have a long way to go to guarantee that you are hired or paid or promoted on the basis of your abilities. Too often, the right that you have on paper is not a right in reality, because your remedy is inadequate or non-existent. 
The EEOC has the principal responsibility to combat discrimination in the workplace and that responsibility has grown significantly in recent years. The passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, the growing awareness of the problem of sexual harassment in the workplace, and the effect of downsizing on older workers have all added greatly to the responsibilities of the EEOC, but there has not been a commensurate increase in the agency's resources. The Commission's workload is growing and its budget must keep up, or vast numbers of Americans will have a meaningless right--a right without a remedy. 
In fact, EEOC funding has increased only by 5.2% over the last four years. That is not enough to keep up with inflation--let alone keep up with the agency's increased responsibilities. Without substantial new funding, the EEOC will fall farther and farther behind in its vital work. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
The numbers tell the story. In 1990, 62,000 charges of discrimination were filed by employees in the private sector. That number increased to 81,000 in 1997, an increase of almost 30%. Ninety percent of the Commission's budget is allocated for fixed costs, with the vast majority--75%--going to salary and benefits. When its budget doesn't keep pace with inflation, the Commission must get along with fewer investigators and attorneys. As a result, although the workload has increased, the size of the staff has fallen. The number of employees declined from 2800 employees in 1993 to 2600 employees in 1997. Since 1980, the number of employees has dropped by 23%. Think about that--mushrooming responsibilities, declining resources. That's an invitation to employers to think they can get away with discrimination in the workplace. 
The agency has tried to hold the line, but there is a limit to doing more with less. The Commission urgently needs this budget increase, and I want the Senate to approve it.

<TEXT>
Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 5 minutes. 
This sense of the Senate is very, very simple and, I believe, extraordinarily compelling. I find it difficult to understand why it would not be accepted. 
I think the best way to really explain it is to go through the amendment itself, because it is so simple and so compelling. All we are saying is that it is a sense of the Senate that we should pass a patient's bill of rights. 
It says that Congress finds that patients lack reliable information about health plans and the quality of care that health plans provide. We have had demonstrated this through a number of different hearings in the Labor Committee and in other Committees. Secondly, it says that experts agree that the quality of health care can be substantially improved, resulting in less illness and less premature death. We have heard this statement or similar statements from the business community, from the provider community, in hearings before the Presidential Commission and the Labor Committee, and in many peer-reviewed 
journal articles written by experts in the field of quality measurement and improvement. No one can argue with this finding. 
Third, this amendment finds that some managed care plans have created obstacles for patients who need to see specialists on an ongoing basis and that some have required women to get permission from their primary care physician before seeing a gynecologist. These were central findings, again, of the President's Commission on the Quality of Health Care and, again, these rights are overwhelmingly supported by the American people and by the doctors and other professionals who care for them. 
Fourth, this amendment finds that a majority of consumers believe that health plans compromise their quality of care to save money. One study shows an astonishing 80 percent of the American people have reached that conclusion. All you have to do is see the movie `As Good As It Gets,' and see Helen Hunt's extraordinary performance. Attend any movie theater in this country if you have any questions on this particular issue, and they will be resolved. 
Fifth, this amendment finds that the Federal preemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 prevents States from enforcing protections for 125 million workers and their families receiving health insurance through the employer-based group health plans. This factual statement has been repeatedly confirmed by the U.S. Department of Labor and by the courts. In fact, Federal judges have pleaded with Congress to fix ERISA. State insurance commissioners see these problems on a daily basis, but their hands are tied with respect to these plans. There is no reason at all to maintain this special exclusion for one group of health plans. Those who make medical decisions that result in death or injury must be held accountable for those decisions. 
Sixth, Mr. President, the Advisory Commission on Consumer Protection and Quality in the Health Care Industry has unanimously recommended a patient's bill of rights to protect patients against abuses by health plans and health insurers. Let me repeat this--the President's Commission, which included representation from health plans, corporations, consumers, providers and others, unanimously recommended that each patient be accorded the protections reported in their Bill of Rights. Regardless of whether they receive their health insurance through an employer or on their own. 
So, this sense of the Senate says that the assumption underlying this resolution provides for enactment of legislation to establish a patient's bill of rights for participants in health plans. Then, Mr. President, we point out very briefly exactly what those protections ought to be, and if there are Members in the Senate who want to differ with these, I welcome the opportunity to debate those or discuss them. 
This amendment says that our legislation should include the following provisions. 
First, a guarantee of access to covered services, including emergency care, specialty care, gynecological care for women, and prescription drugs. Does anyone really dispute that we ought to be able to ensure patients have access to the coverage and health care that they have paid for? 
Second, provisions to ensure the special needs of women are met, including protecting women from being forced to endure drive-through mastectomies. There are more than half a dozen Members of the Senate who have various pieces of legislation to address that particular need. This sense of the Senate refers to those efforts. 
Third, provisions to ensure the special needs of children are met, including access to pediatric specialists and centers of pediatric excellence. 
Mr. President, this is an extremely important and significant need. All you have to do is listen to parents and pediatricians. Senator Reed is a leader in this particular issue. We know the kinds of challenges that exist, particularly for newborn babies. It used to be that 90 percent of the kinds of health difficulties that newborns faced were excluded from any coverage of health insurance. 
Some insurance forms say any particular needs of a child that occur within the first 10 days of life `will be outside the coverage of this insurance policy.' The fact of the matter is that 90 percent of the difficulties occur during that period of time. But so many mothers do not know that. We are still facing very, very important needs in terms of protecting children in this country. 
Four, provisions to ensure that special needs of individuals with disabilities and the chronically ill are met, including the possibility of standing referrals to specialists or the ability to have specialists act as the primary care provider. 
Forcing a patient who has a legitimate need to see a specialist to jump through extra hoops before every appointment is counter-productive and more expensive in the long run. Persons with disabilities and chronic illnesses face these kinds of challenges every single day. They can cite chapter and verse about the various exclusions and barriers they face--not just physical barriers, but barriers put up by their health insurance. They have special needs and they need special protections. 
Five, a procedure to hold health plans accountable for decisions and a procedure to provide for appeal of a health care decision to an independent impartial reviewer. 
This is to make sure that when these accountants in many of the insurance companies say `no' to a patient--say that they are not entitled to that particular health care service--there is an appeal procedure that can bring about a timely and independent decision. I won't take the time now, nor do I have the time, to point out the number of individuals who have lost their lives or been permanently disabled because the plan's accountant or an insurance executive turned thumbs down on a procedure recommended by the treating physician. 
Six, measures to protect the integrity of the physician-patient relationship, including a ban on gag clauses and on improper incentive arrangements. 
We have had testimony time and again that says that doctors cannot tell the patients about all of their options because the plan denies them the chance to do so. That is absolutely, completely wrong. We have other instances where doctors have moved ahead and prescribed expensive treatment, only to effectively be dropped from the panels of various HMO's. We want to protect the physicians in these circumstances. We want to permit the physicians to be able to do what they should be able to do, and that is to be able to practice medicine to the best of their abilities. 
Finally, measures to provide greater information about health plans to patients and improve quality care. 
Mr. President, that is the sum and substance of this amendment. I really question how anyone can take issue with the findings and how anyone can take issue with the kinds of protections that we believe ought to be accepted by the Senate and included in a patients' bill of rights. 
This particular measure has the strong support of the American Medical Association, and of the AFL-CIO. It has the support of the National Breast Cancer Coalition; it has the support of Families USA; it has the support of the mental health community, including the National Alliance for Mental Illness, the National Mental Health Association and the American Psychological Association; it has the support of the Consumers Union and countless other consumer and patient groups representing hundreds of thousands of people. 
So I hope that we can have this measure accepted as a sense of the Senate on this budget, and then we will go about the business of debating on the floor of the U.S. Senate the actual legislation that incorporates these provisions. If some Senators have better ideas and they want to adjust or change something, we will have the opportunity to do so. But let's go on record at this time, on this occasion, to say that we want to make sure that the patients in this country are going to be guaranteed the kind of protections that we would want for every member of our families, and that we are going to put health care needs first, rather than the bottom 
line of the health insurance industry. Let's say that we are going to permit our doctors, not industry accountants, to practice medicine. 
Mr. President, I withhold the rest of our time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
I am absolutely appalled at the response of our friends and colleagues on the other side. First of all, the President's panel unanimously said that these rights ought to be available to every American consumer, No. 1. 
Now, what good does it do to have a right if you don't have a remedy? That is like saying we are for the Bill of Rights but we don't want to put it in the Constitution. Come on, Senators. You have to have a better answer than that. It doesn't hold up. 
No. 2, this is not our legislation; this is a sense-of-the-Senate. I listened to my friend from Pennsylvania. 
He is talking about a slogan, not a program. What does he object to in here? Do you object to drive-by mastectomies? Do you object to making sure that women are going to have gynecological and obstetrical care? If you do, let's say it. Do you object to being able to get the best information and not have your doctor gagged? 
This is what is in this amendment. This is what is important, not just some gray areas. So let's respond to what is in this sense-of-the-Senate. We have outlined it. It incorporates what the President's commission unanimously recommended should be available to every single consumer. 
That is all we are saying--no specific legislation but extending it to every consumer. And if you think it is bureaucratic to say we are not going to permit health care plans to deny you at the emergency room when you have chest pains and are short of breath and may be having a heart attack, then go and defend that position. 
Ask any consumer in this country. Ask any woman in this country. Ask any disabled person in this country. They are entitled to the best that their particular policy has guaranteed. 
Finally, Mr. President, I am not going to yield to anyone about defending HMOs. I introduced the legislation and passed it in 1974. I supported it. We passed it five times here, and I led the fight for it. 
All I want to do is to make sure that all of the HMOs are going to live up to what the best of the HMOs are living up to today. The best of the HMOs today support this. They support our resolution. We just want to make sure that every HMO is going to provide that kind of protection for the consumers they have enlisted and whose premiums they are accepting and using to pay very substantial salaries to their executives. 
I withhold the remainder of my time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes. 
I urge our colleagues to support the Nickles amendment. I have outlined, as the Senator has, and, while I disagree with some of his statements, I think the Senate ought to go on record in favor of it. But I also invite others to support the amendment offered by myself, Senator Durbin, Senator Boxer and others, which basically says the Senate should pass a patients' bill of rights. Our amendment and the rights embodied in it is commonsense. 
As we know around here, if you don't have a remedy for a right, you don't have a right. We have a Bill of Rights that we 
have enshrined in the Constitution of the United States. We have that to ensure all of our rights. All we are saying now is let us go on record in support of the rights that are included in this sense of the Senate. 
This amendment says that we will protect women from being thrown out of the hospital hours after a mastectomy and against the advice of their physician. We will assure that women are going to be able to get direct access to the gynecological and obstetrical care they need. These are rights that many plans say they already offer. With this amendment, we will make sure that they are realized. 
We will make sure that children with special needs have access to qualified pediatric specialists. We will make sure that we protect the rights of persons with disabilities. These rights are written in some of the various insurance policies, but too often they are not realized. We want to make sure that every American, if they have a heart attack or a stroke, can go to the nearest emergency room. 
Here are the basics, and they have been undisputed. No one has challenged that. Let's get aboard and say let us, in this Congress--Republicans and Democrats--draft legislation that will protect those consumers. That is what the President's commission did unanimously. It said these ought to be the rights of every single American. We have a chance this afternoon for the Senate of the United States to say `yes.' Every good plan already provides these rights. Consumers need protections against those insurance companies who put profits ahead of patients. Many organizations representing patients and doctors are on our side. Only those who profit from the current abuse are opposed to us. 
I hope the Senate will go in favor of this resolution. 
I yield the remaining time to the Senator from West Virginia.

There are not going to be any additional costs for those insurance companies and those HMOs that are doing a good job. Massachusetts' HMOs, for example, are the best in the nation. I have the highest regard for them. But there may be an extra cost for HMOs that are shortchanging the consumer--the Senator is right--but not for those that are doing what they have represented to the consumers. In other words, if they are doing a good job, they have nothing to fear. That is why we have the support of a number of HMOs at the present time. This sense of the Senate focuses on the ones that are not doing a good job.

I am all for that. Let's all support that. 
But this does not address the issues raised when we talk about protecting basic rights of patients. The amendment I have offered gives the Senate the chance to go on record as saying it is time for Congress to decide that profits should not take priority over patients. My amendment and this amendment are not in conflict. 
The broad principles in my amendment are supported by the American Medical Association, the disability groups, the advocates for mental health, consumer groups, the women groups, and the labor movement.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the time has come for action to protect families and curb the insurance company abuses. This amendment gives the Senate a chance to go on record as saying it is time for Congress to decide that profits should not take priority over patients. 
I just ask our colleagues to read page 3 of this sense of the Senate. It ensures coverage of emergency services, and allows women direct access for obstetrical and gynecological care. It ensures women will not be subject to drive-through mastectomies. It meets the special needs of children and the special needs of individuals with disabilities. It provides for the protection of the relationship between the doctor and the patient, and the elimination of the gag clauses. And it provides greater information about health care plans to the patients. 
Our opponents will argue that these rights will raise premiums. But it will not cost an additional cent for any of the good plans. It may cost more for those plans who do not currently do these things. We all know that the easiest way to save money is to deny care. 
Let us stand for the patients and the medical profession. They have basically endorsed these rights, as has the President's commission. This amendment says that we are going to pass legislation which will protect them. That is what this sense of the Senate guarantees.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise today to support Senator Feingold in his amendment to create a disability reserve fund to allow people with disabilities to become employed and remain independent. The amendment would ensure that the budget resolution incorporates the flexibility to allow offsets for the bipartisan Work Incentive Improvement Act of 1998. This bill allows people with disabilities to become employed and remain independent, by providing more affordable and accessible health care. 
Despite the extraordinary growth and prosperity the country is enjoying today, persons with disabilities continue to struggle to live independently and become fully contributing members of their communities. Of the 54 million disabled people in this country, many have the capacity to work and want to become productive citizens, but they are unable to do so because they are afraid of losing their health care. 
Today, 7.5 million disabled Americans depend on public assistance. The cost to the taxpayer is $73 billion annually and will continue to increase at 6% a year. If we can support just one percent of the these 7.5 million individuals to become successfully employed, savings in cash assistance would total $3.5 billion over the work lives of these individuals. 
Senator Feingold's amendment creates a narrowly targeted reserve fund, which allows savings or revenues from various sources to be used to offset the costs associated with this proposal. The reserve fund is limited in the total spending it permits for this specific purpose, and is permissive--it allows the Senate leadership to use savings from unrelated areas to be dedicated to support disabled people to become employed. Work is a central part of the American dream, and it is time for this Congress to support our disabled citizens in achieving that dream.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier this year, the Senate lost one of our ablest, most respected, and most beloved former colleagues, Senator Abraham A. Ribicoff of Connecticut. 
Senator Ribicoff served his constituents and his country with extraordinary distinction over a career that spanned more than four decades. His interests ranged far and wide, and his achievements were legion in both domestic and foreign policy. He led the effort to establish the Departments of Education and Energy. He was a consistent and eloquent advocate for civil rights, and an opponent of bigotry in all its forms. He was a brilliant leader in advancing the cause of peace in the Middle East. In these and many other ways, he was a giant for the people of Connecticut and the nation. 
For my family, Senator Ribicoff was far more than the distinguished leader of a neighboring state. He was a loyal friend and trusted adviser, and one of President Kennedy's closest and most loyal friends. 
My brother had immense respect for him. They had served together in the House of Representatives in the 1940's and early 1950's. After Congressman Ribicoff went on to become Governor of Connecticut, and my brother was elected to the Senate, they continued their close ties. 
At the Democratic Convention in 1956, Abe encouraged Jack to run for Vice President. Four years later, Abe was one of my brother's strongest supporters in his 1960 campaign for the White House. 
When Jack became President in 1961, he chose Governor Ribicoff to join his Cabinet as Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and he did an outstanding job. But in many ways, he was a legislator at heart. He was elected to the Senate in 1962, the same year I was elected, and we served together for 18 beautiful years until he retired in 1980. In a sense, I inherited Abe from Jack, and our friendship was all the stronger because of that.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier this year, Michael E. McAdams, a respected consultant and friend to many of us here in Washington, D.C., passed away. 
Mr. McAdams--affectionately known as `Goose' by his many friends and associates--was a passionate, intelligent, effective advisor and consultant. During his extraordinary career, he worked closely with me, with our colleagues Senator Dodd, Senator Biden, and Senator Pell as well as with Speaker Tip O'Neill and many others, and we admired and respected him very much. 
In addition, Goose worked abroad with the National Democratic Institute. To citizens of South Africa, Botswana, Czechoslovakia, and many other countries, he brought his vast knowledge of the institutions of democracy, and his fervent belief that democracy is the best hope for freedom and political stability.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last week, the conferees on the Agricultural Research bill made a down payment toward restoring food stamps for the needy legal immigrants. The conference report on the bill includes $818 million for this program. It is far less than the $2 billion proposed in the President's budget, and it covers a much smaller group of immigrants. 
The conferees' proposal is a bipartisan effort. Both Republicans and Democrats urged them to take this step as soon as possible. 
Yet, the Republican leadership in the Senate is ignoring the urgent need. The Republican budget does not include a single penny to restore food stamps to immigrant children, refugees, Hmong veterans, or elderly and disabled legal immigrants, and the Republican leadership has declined to allow the Senate to pass the Agricultural Research bill. 
The food stamp cut-off has hurt immigrant families, and it has also hurt state and local governments, who must fill the gap. As a result, governors and state legislatures have joined Congress to restore these food stamp benefits. As Governor Bush of Texas said, `Food stamps are a federal program and the federal responsibility, but the federal government is shirking its responsibility. The rules have changed unfairly and retroactively for those least able to help themselves.' 
Today, the Massachusetts House of Representatives passed a resolution urging Congress to restore adequate federal funding to the food stamp program so needy immigrants in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts can receive desperately needed food aid. I ask unanimous consent that this resolution be placed in the Record following my remarks. 
It is time for the Senate to act on the Agricultural Research bill. It is unconscionable that these benefits can continue to be denied.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Moseley-Braun's amendment to the budget resolution to help modernize and repair the nation's public school facilities for the 21st century. 
Schools across the nation face serious problems of overcrowding. Antiquated facilities are suffering from physical decay, and are not equipped to handle the needs of modern education. 
Across the country, 14 million children in a third of the nation's schools are learning in substandard buildings. Half the schools have at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition. It will take over $110 billion just to repair existing facilities nationwide. 
Massachusetts is no exception. 41% of our schools across the state report that at least one building needs extensive repair or should be replaced. Three-quarters report serious problems in buildings, such as plumbing or heating defects. 80% have at least one unsatisfactory environmental factor. 
In Boston, many schools cannot keep their heating systems functioning properly. On a given day, 15 to 30 schools complain that their heat is not working. 
Faulty boilers and leaky pipes are responsible for sewage leaks and backups at many schools in Springfield, Massachusetts. 
The leaking roof at Revere High School is so serious that the new fire system is threatened. School Committee members estimate that fixing the roof will cost an additional $1 million, and they don't know where to get the money. 
It is difficult enough to teach or learn in dilapidated classrooms. But now, because of escalating enrollments, classrooms are increasingly overcrowded. The nation will need 6,000 new schools in the next few years, just to maintain current class sizes. 
The student population in Pomona, California has increased 37% in the last ten years, and most students are now forced to study in poorly ventilated and dimly lit portable classrooms. To accommodate the large number of students using the cafeteria, school officials have had to schedule five different lunch periods every day. 
Malden, Massachusetts is in the process of building five new elementary schools to accommodate increases in student enrollment. The estimated cost for constructing these schools will exceed $100 million. 
The Senate recently heard testimony from a student in Clifton, Virginia whose high school is so overcrowded that fights often break out in the overflowing halls. The problem is called `Hall Rage,' and it's analogous to `Road Rage' on crowded highways. The violence in the hallways is bad enough. But it's even worse, because it's difficult for teachers to teach when students are distracted by the chaos in the hallways and outside their classrooms. 
State governments and local communities are working to meet these challenges. In Massachusetts, under the School Building Assistance Act, the state will pay 50-90% of the most severe needs. 124 schools now have approved projects, and are on a waiting list for funding. The state share should be $91 million this year, but only $35 million is available. More than 50 other projects are awaiting approval. With that kind of deficit at the state and local level, it is clear that the federal government has a responsibility to act. 
Incredibly, the Republican budget proposal ignores these pressing needs. The Republican plan cuts funding for education. It refuses to provide needed new investments to improve public education, including school modernization and construction. 
Democrats have made it a top priority to see that America has the best education system in the world. Providing safe and adequate school facilities is an important step towards meeting that goal. 
I urge the Senate to approve this amendment. Investing in education is one of the best investments America can possibly make. For schools across America, help is truly on the way--and it can't come a minute too soon.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment offered by Senators Conrad and Lautenberg, which will ensure that any revenues generated from an increase in the price of cigarettes is directed first and foremost to protecting the nation's children from nicotine addiction and smoking-induced diseases. 
The Republican budget creates a number of serious barriers to these efforts by prohibiting tobacco revenues from being used for anti-smoking initiatives. 
In fact, the budget uses Medicare as a smokescreen to make funding more difficult for important smoking cessation programs, counter-advertising to deglamorize tobacco use among children, biomedical research to cure smoking-caused illnesses, and public education to inform the American people more fully about the dangers of tobacco use. 
If the current restrictive resolution is adopted, a vote of sixty Senators would be required to waive the restrictions. The result is that millions of Americans who want to quit smoking will have a much more difficult time achieving their goal. Anti-smoking programs are central to any effective measure to reduce tobacco use, and they should be the first priority for the dollars raised by a cigarette price increase. 
If these anti-tobacco initiatives are not funded, the problem of teenage smoking in the United States will only increase. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a million youngsters start smoking each year--almost 3,000 a day. One third of them will die prematurely from smoking-induced illnesses. The average smoker begins at age 13, and becomes a daily smoker by age 15. 
These facts are serious enough. But the crisis is growing worse. A Spring 1996 survey by the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research found that teenage smoking has continued to rise since 1991. It climbed by nearly fifty percent among eighth and tenth graders, and by nearly twenty percent among high school seniors between 1991 and 1996. 
The industry strategy is obvious. The tobacco companies target children, because once children are hooked on cigarette smoking, they become customers for life. Ninety percent of current adult smokers began to smoke before they reached the age of 18. By contrast, if young men and women reach that age without beginning to smoke, they are unlikely to take up the habit in later years. 
The tobacco companies know these facts. They are fully aware that if they do not persuade children to start smoking, the industry may collapse within a generation. That's why Big Tobacco has targeted children with billions of dollars in advertising and promotional giveaways that promise popularity and success for those who take up smoking. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that the average 14-year-old is exposed to $20 billion in advertising--$20 billion--beginning at age 6. In fact, the name `Joe Camel' is as familiar to children as `Mickey Mouse.' 
Two recently disclosed industry documents illustrate the blatant marketing to youths. In a 1981 Philip Morris memo entitled `Young Smokers--Prevalence, Implications, and Related Demographic Trends,' the authors wrote that: 
It is important to know as much as possible about teenage smoking patterns and attitudes. Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer, and the overwhelming majority of smokers first begin to smoke while still in their teens. . . The smoking patterns of teenagers are particularly important to Philip Morris. . . Furthermore, it is during the teenage years that the initial choice is made. 
A marketing report by R.J. Reynolds researcher Diane Burrows, written prior to launching the Joe Camel advertising campaign, stated: 
Younger adult smokers are critical to R.J. Reynolds' long-term profitability. Therefore, RJR must make a substantial long-term commitment of manpower and money dedicated to younger adult smoking programs. 
A related RJR document states that `young adult' refers to the 14-24 age group. 
It is no coincidence that shortly after R.J. Reynolds launched the Joe Camel campaign in 1988, Camel's share of the youth market soared from 0.5% to 32.8%. 
Unless Congress takes action to reverse this disturbing trend in adolescent smoking, five million of today's children will die prematurely from smoking-caused illness. That's unacceptable. 
Although all of us agree that Medicare should be protected for future generations, one of the best ways to keep Medicare strong is to invest in important public health and tobacco control programs that prevent children from beginning to smoke, and that help current smokers to quit smoking. Americans will lead healthier lives, and the burden of tobacco-induced diseases will be greatly reduced. 
Unfortunately, the Republican budget earmarks all of the tobacco revenues for Medicare. It prohibits using even one dollar of the tobacco revenues to deter youth from smoking. 
Smoking has inflicted great damage on people's health. It is the leading preventable cause of death and disability in the nation. Tobacco products are responsible for a third of all cancers, and 90% of all lung cancers. 
Smoking also causes great harm to nonsmokers. A recent study by the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research reports that second-hand smoke is responsible for as many as 60% of cases of asthma, bronchitis, and wheezing among young children. It makes sense to use tobacco revenues to discourage children from beginning to smoke. 
These programs work. Smoking cessation programs are among the most effective means to reduce health care costs. At the same time, they save and improve the lives of millions of Americans. 
They are also cost-effective. Every dollar invested in a smoking cessation program for a pregnant woman saves $6 in costs for neonatal intensive care and long-term care for low birthweight babies. 
Dr. Michael Fiore, Director of the Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, noted that:  
smoking cessation programs are the most cost-effective prevention intervention a physician can engage in. . . It is a paradox in America that virtually every health insurance policy pays for the outcomes of smoking, whether it is a heart attack, stroke, or cancer, but only half of them pay the $100 to $200 it would take to prevent these very expensive illnesses. 
The Republican budget offers no help in cases like this, and that makes no sense. The Republican budget offers no help to states and communities for public health advertising to counteract the $5 billion a year that the tobacco industry pours into advertising to encourage people to start smoking and keep smoking. 
Paid counter-advertising is extremely effective in reducing tobacco consumption. Both Massachusetts and California have demonstrated that counter-advertising can discourage children from beginning to smoke and encourage smokers to quit. It helped reduce cigarette use in Massachusetts by 17% between 1992 and 1996, or three times the national average. Smoking by junior high school students dropped 8%, while the rest of the nation has seen an increase. 
In California, a counter-advertising campaign reduced smoking rates by 15% over the last three years. 
A soon-to-be-published study by Professor Frank Chaloupka of the University of Illinois found that tobacco counter-advertising can also reduce illegal drugs use among youth. 
The Republican budget, however, will provide no funding for these important efforts. 
The Republican budget offers no help to the Food and Drug Administration to enforce the laws against the sale of tobacco products to minors, even though young people spend $1 billion a year to buy tobacco products illegally. 
Last year, Congress tried to get away with underfunding the FDA's tobacco regulations by providing only $5 million of the $34 million President Clinton requested to begin enforcement of the youth access rule. An amendment by Senator Harkin to the Agriculture Appropriations bill to restore the funding was defeated on the Senate floor. 
Two months later, as public outrage grew, Congress reversed itself and overwhelmingly approved the full amount. A similar outcry from our constituents and the public health community is likely if we do not provide funding for these important enforcement efforts. 
Finally, the Republican budget offers no help for medical research on tobacco-related diseases, even though such research can lead to enormous savings for Medicare. 
Funding for tobacco-related medical research is vital to fulfilling our hopes for healthy lives for all citizens. The promise of new medical research is boundless. As impressive as the progress of the past has been, it pales in comparison to the opportunities of the future. 
In addition, a recent study by researchers at Duke University indicates that expanded funding for medical research can help keep Medicare and other federal health care programs solvent for the long-term. 
If the goal of this budget resolution is to protect Medicare, it makes no sense to prevent tobacco revenues from being used to support anti-smoking programs that will reduce future costs for Medicare. 
Currently, smoking-induced diseases cost the federal government over $20 billion a year. If we invest in medical research to make Americans healthier, we can save enormous sums, protect these programs for future generations, and prevent many of the illnesses caused by smoking. 
The country supports these fundamental priorities, and the Senate should support them too. They have been endorsed by the public health community, and by Doctor Koop and Doctor Kessler. They are included in virtually all of the tobacco bills introduced in Congress by Republicans as well as Democrats. I urge my colleagues to support the Conrad/Lautenberg amendment.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment sounds innocuous, but it is a direct assault on Social Security, and it deserves resounding rejection by the Senate. 
Millions of senior citizens depend on Social Security. In fact, Social Security benefits comprise more than 75% of the income of half of the nation's 28 million recipients. It is a sacred compact between citizens and their government that says, `pay into Social Security during your working years, and we will guarantee you a decent retirement income during your golden years.' 
Social Security is one of the most popular programs ever enacted. It is also one of our nation's most successful anti-poverty programs. In 1959, 35% of the nation's elderly lived in poverty. Today, that number has dropped to 9%. 
We all recognize that legislative action is necessary to assure that Social Security will be solvent throughout the 21st century. There is no crisis--but there is a problem, and the sooner we take action to solve it the better. All of us know that Social Security will run out of money in 2030. All of us know that the single highest priority of the American people is to see Social Security preserved. 
All of us know that the President has said that none of the budget surplus should be spent until we solve the Social Security problem--and the American people strongly support this approach. 
But this amendment takes a different approach. It says: `Let's forget about preserving Social Security. Let's go ahead and spend the surplus on a risky and untried experiment with individual retirement accounts.' 
We all know what is going on here. There are a number of members of this body who want to throw Security on the scrap heap of history. They think it ought to be privatized. They think the concept of Social Security is wrong. They think individuals, instead of relying on the tried and true and guaranteed support that Social Security provides, should take their chances by speculating in the stock market. If they do well, they can become rich. If they do poorly and are impoverished in their old age--so be it. 
I reject that philosophy. The American people, I believe, also reject that philosophy. And the Senate should reject that amendment.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the 1996 welfare law unfairly reduced SSI, Medicaid and food stamp benefits for legal immigrants. Food stamps alone were cut by $25 billion. No other program has been cut as deeply. 
Last year, recognizing that these cuts were too extreme, Congress restored SSI and Medicaid to many elderly and disabled immigrants. It's time to finish the job and ensure that those whose Medicaid and SSI were restored, do not go hungry. And we should do the same for children of legal immigrants. 
Last week, the conferees on the Agricultural Research bill made a down payment toward restoring food stamps for the needy legal immigrants. The conference report on the bill includes $818 million for this program. It is far less than the $2 billion proposed in the President's budget, and it covers a much smaller group of immigrants. 
The conferees' proposal is a bipartisan effort. Both Republicans and Democrats urged them to take this step as soon as possible. 
Yet, the Republican leadership in the Senate is ignoring the urgent need. The Republican budget does not include a single penny to restore food stamps to immigrant children, refugees, Hmong veterans, or elderly and disabled legal immigrants, and the Republican leadership has declined to allow the Senate to pass on the Agricultural Research bill. 
According to Department of Agriculture estimates, at least 935,000 low-income legal immigrants lost their federal food stamps in 1997 as a result of the 1996 welfare law. Nearly two-thirds are immigrant families with children. 
Many legal immigrants live in poverty and have great difficulty feeding their families. In fact, according to the Department of Agriculture, the average legal immigrant denied food stamps has an income equal to just 62 percent of the poverty line, or about $8,000 for a family of three. 
In addition, thousands of refugees who have applied for citizenship could lose food stamps as they wait in the naturalization backlog for their applications to be processed if the 5 year limit on food stamps for this group is not extended to 7 years. 
The effects of these food stamps terminations is not limited to legal immigrants. Their children born here are American citizens but they too are facing sharp reductions in their food stamps. Their children remain eligible for food stamps themselves, but the removal of their parents from the program has meant that the food stamp benefits for their families have been cut by 50 to 70 percent in many cases. 600,000 poor children who are American citizens live in families where food stamp benefits have been reduced for this reason, resulting in less food for all family members, including the children. 
The food stamp cut-off has hurt immigrant families, and it has also hurt state and local governments, who must fill the gap. As a result, governors and state legislatures have joined Congress to restore these food stamp benefits. As Governor Bush of Texas said, `Food stamps are a federal program and the federal responsibility, but the federal government is shirking its responsibility. The rules have changed unfairly and retroactively for those least able to help themselves.' 
It is time for the Senate to act on the bill. It is unconscionable that these benefits can continue to be denied.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, the Senator from West Virginia, for his analysis of this issue. He is one of the real experts on Medicare and Medicaid and is very much involved in the subcommittee of the Finance Committee dealing with all of these issues. He brings a very sound perspective to this issue. His comments identified the weaknesses of the Kyl proposal and also what are the dangers for so many of our senior citizens. I hope that our colleagues pay close attention to his words. 
I join in urging the Senate to oppose the Kyl amendment and defeat this attempt to undermine Medicare by eliminating the protections in current law that prevent doctors from overcharging senior citizens. This is not a `freedom of choice' amendment for patients; it is a `freedom to price gouge' 
amendment for physicians, and it deserves to be rejected by the Senate. 
Medicare patients already have freedom of choice. In fact, because Medicare is one of the only insurance programs that still offers a true fee-for-service option, senior citizens generally have more choices in health care than other citizens, including those of us in the Senate. 
According to a February 23 report from the General Accounting Office, the information available to us indicates that Medicare beneficiaries have ready access to physicians. The report emphasizes the high participation rate in Medicare by physicians. Ninety-six percent of all the doctors accept and treat Medicare patients. 
The report also emphasizes that few Medicare patients have problems in obtaining health care. Only 4 percent report difficulty in finding a physician. This does not appear to be due to the reimbursement levels. The GAO found reimbursement levels for physicians under Medicare are adequate and do not jeopardize access to health care for senior citizens. 
The Kyl amendment is no answer to the problems of Medicare. It will only make those problems worse. The freedom it proposes is the freedom to exploit senior citizens and the freedom to dismantle the fundamental guarantee of affordable health care for the elderly that has served American senior citizens well for so many years. 
Senior citizens deserve affordable health care provided by Medicare, and that they have earned through a lifetime of hard work and service to this country. The Kyl amendment takes the choice out of the hands of the vast majority of senior citizens and puts it in the hands of the doctors. That is the key flaw in the Kyl amendment. 
Who is going to be making the decision? Is it going to be the patient, or is it going to be the provider? The patient already has that kind of freedom today. If they want to indicate that they do not want their doctor to bill the Medicare system, then they can go ahead and pay if they want to. They have that opportunity to do so. 
That is not what the Kyl amendment is about. The Kyl amendment puts the power in the hands of the doctors. If such legislation were to pass, doctors would be free to charge unlimited fees and patients would be free to pay them. Some freedom. Some choice. 
Medicare works well for patients and physicians alike. Senior citizens are free to chose their doctor and are free to self-pay if they desire. Physicians must abide by limits on what they can charge for services covered by Medicare, which means that senior citizens know they cannot be overcharged. 
In addition, because Medicare covers the basic services, but not all services, the elderly are free to pay out of pocket for services not covered by Medicare. If they are able to afford it and they want to pay privately for Medicare-covered service, they can do that too by asking the doctor not to submit a claim. If the patient wants to pay the doctor, and pay the doctor more, and pay the doctor an exorbitant amount, the patient is free to do so now at the present time and not have them submit the claim to Medicare. 
This was the case before the Balanced Budget Act was enacted last year, and it is the case today. The current system works and works well. This aspect of Medicare is not broken, and it does not need to be fixed. The only fix the Kyl amendment provides is the authority for doctors to fix the higher prices than Medicare allows. 
Current law favors the patient by guaranteeing that it is the patient who initiates actions to pay outside of Medicare. Medicare's balanced billing limits continue to apply. The patients have the choice. They are the ones who can initiate or end the private transaction. The power is in the hands of the patient. That is where it should be. The Kyl amendment gives that choice to the physician. That is the serious mistake that would jeopardize Medicare coverage for large numbers of senior citizens. 
The reality is that in a number of instances the patient will ask the doctor not to submit the claim or the bill under Medicare. These are primarily in the cases of mental health and substance abuse where the individual, for any number of reasons, fears what might happen to them in the job market or because it might make it more difficult or complex in terms of other different personal reasons and chooses to pay themselves and tells the doctor, `Look, don't bill Medicare. I'll pay you. I'll pay you.' That happens today. It is not widely advertised, not widely proclaimed, but it happens today. That goes on, and the Medicare system respects that. 
But that isn't what this is about. This is about where the doctor says to the patient who is in that doctor's office and needs help and assistance, `Look, you're not going to effectively get it'--it might be a little smoother than this, but the message is going to be clear--`unless you're going to pay me whatever I say.' Now, that is the beginning of the end. That is something that we have guarded against over a long period of time, and we should not open up those gates today. 
Congress should not imperil the financial security of 38 million senior citizens. Congress should not take the money out of the pockets of the elderly and put it in the bank accounts of wealthy physicians. That is what this issue is really about. Simply put, who is going to be the one who is going to make the decision? Is it going to be the patient, which I think all of us feel is the way that it should go, and it is that way at the present time, or is it going to be the physician who is going to be making that judgment, looking into the eyes of a sick patient, virtually at the will of the physician, when they have that illness and sickness and are told, `Look, if you want my treatment, if you want to be treated by me, it's going to cost 
you a bundle.' That we have guarded against over a long period of time. It is a key element in terms of the whole guarantee of quality, good care for our senior citizens, and we should not alter and change that particular protection now. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge the Majority Leader to schedule a vote on the nomination of James Hormel as U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. 
Jim Hormel is a man of outstanding qualifications with a clear and deep commitment to public service, the promotion of human rights, and the national interests of the United States. America would be well served to have a leader of his high caliber representing this country in Luxembourg. 
On the international level, he has recently completed his term as Alternate Representative of the U.S. Delegation to the 51st Session of the United Nations General Assembly. He was confirmed by the Senate for that position in 1997. He was also a member of the U.S. Delegation to the United Nations Human Rights Commission. In 1995 he participated in President Clinton's Conference on the Pacific Rim. 
Jim Hormel is a talented lawyer who has shown his commitment to public service by establishing the James C. Hormel Public Service Program at the University of Chicago. This program is designed to encourage law students to enter careers in public service. 
Jim Hormel is also a dedicated and energetic community activist. He was instrumental in developing resources for organizations serving people affected by HIV and AIDS, and he serves on the board of directors of the American Foundation for AIDS Research. Recently, he was honored by Breast Cancer Action for his leadership of the Men's Campaign Against Breast Cancer. He has also been a leader for human rights in his capacity as a director of the Human Rights Campaign Foundation. 
Jim Hormel is also a renowned philanthropist, and he has supported an impressively diverse array of causes, including the American Indian College Fund, the United Negro College Fund, Jewish Family and Children's Services, the Catholic Youth Organization, the NAACP, the San Francisco Symphony, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the San Francisco Public Library, the San Francisco Ballet, and the Virginia Institute of Autism. 
It was entirely fitting that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee overwhelmingly approved his nomination last November. At the time, no Senator spoke in opposition. Only after the meeting did two Senators ask to be recorded against the nomination. 
I share the concern expressed by other strong supporters of this nomination that action on Jim Hormel's confirmation is being delayed because he is gay. Delay on that basis would be irresponsible and unacceptable. Prejudice based on sexual orientation should have no place in this debate, no place in the Senate, and no place in America. 
It is long past time for the Senate to vote on this nomination. Jim Hormel will be an excellent ambassador for the United States, and deserves to be confirmed as soon as possible.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the time for action to protect patients and curb insurance company abuse has come. We face a crisis of confidence in health care. A recent survey found that an astonishing 80 percent of Americans now believe that their quality of care is often compromised by their insurance plan to save money. One reason for this concern is the explosive growth in managed care. In 1987, only 13 percent of privately insured Americans were enrolled in HMOs. Today 75 percent are in some form of managed care. 
At its best, managed care offers the opportunity to achieve both greater efficiency and higher quality in health care. In too many cases, however, the priority has become higher profits, not better health. Conventional insurance companies, too, have abused the system by denying coverage for treatments that their customers need and that their faithful payment of premiums should have guaranteed. 
And the issue is not just confidence. It goes to the heart of the issue of quality care and to the fundamental doctor-patient relationship. In California, a Kaiser Foundation study found that almost half of all consumers reported a problem with their health plan--and substantial proportions reported that the plan's misbehavior caused unnecessary pain and suffering, delayed their recovery, or even resulted in permanent disabilities. Projected to the national level, these results indicate that 30 million Americans actually developed additional health problems because of their plan's treatment of them, and a shocking 11 million developed permanent disabilities. 
The list of those victimized by insurance company abuse grows every day. 
A baby loses his hands and feet because his parents believe they have to take him to a distant emergency room rather than the one close to their home.

Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. 
Mr. President, over the next few days, we will cast important votes on the budget resolution, including some of the most important votes this year on education priorities. We will also address issues affecting children, health care, enforcement of our antidiscriminatory laws, and on the proposed tobacco legislation. 
I look forward to those debates. We will be having virtually all of them within a relatively short period of time. We will be debating many public policy questions. I want to take a few moments this afternoon to address some of those issues that I believe deserve the attention and support of the Members of the Senate. 
We will consider a very important amendment by the Senator from the State of Washington, Senator Murray, on reducing class size. The President proposed to help ensure high academic achievement by all students by reducing the ratio of the number of teachers per student. It would help increase effective communication between the teacher and the students, and give students more individual attention. The President's proposal will help reduce class size by increasing the total number of teachers for students in K through 12. We are going to have to actually increase the number of teachers by 50,000 a year just to maintain the current ratio of teachers to students, and this doesn't take 
into consideration the fact that in many parts of the country, we have an aging teaching population, as well as current shortages of teachers. 
There was a request by the President of the United States to recognize that need and to also commit resources to that effort, and that was turned down by the Republican Budget Committee. The Budget Committee did not address the need to modernize our schools, even though a General Accounting Office study showed that we need over $110 billion to ensure that students in our schools are safe and secure, free from environmental hazards, and in an atmosphere and climate where students can grow and learn. That effort, led by Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, would provide $22 billion in bonding authority to States and communities--and they would get the bonds interest-free. 
The President has also advanced a concept called education opportunity zones. We should help school districts and communities address the challenges that they are facing, whether it is academic failure or significant problems in school dropouts or other kinds of difficulties giving them needed resources to implement creative and innovative reforms that work for their communities. 
Chicago, for example, seems to be having success with its reforms. This city is tackling school reform head on, and it's working. We should help more communities that are attempting to do that. 
But the Republican budget ignores those needs, and turned down the Education Opportunity Zones proposal as well. 
The Republican Budget ignores the fact that 5 million children were going home to empty homes or empty apartments, unattended, unsupervised, after school. Their only friend was a television set--with all of the problems and challenges that exist out there for young students, creating temptations for misbehaving. After-school programs have been so successful in this country, and they have had a dramatic impact in reducing violent crimes, reducing teenage pregnancy, and increasing academic achievement. Some of the programs I have seen in Boston help students develop skills that might eventually develop into job skills in photography or in cooking. 
Parents and students alike support after-school programs. Parents know their children are safe and engaging in productive activities, and when they get home, the children have done their homework and are able to spend quality time with their parents. 
It is clear that the Republicans do not want to address these issues. Perhaps we will have a chance later on in the Congress to resurrect these measures. But the way that the procedures work here, they will need what we call a supermajority, not just a bare majority, to get approval--we will need more than 60 in order to be successful. 
So these debates will be very, very important in these next few days. We also should support efforts to increase funding for the IDEA program, for children with disabilities. There was some increase in those funds, but not nearly to the degree that they should be. We ought to at least have an opportunity to debate those issues and make a judgment on them. 
We are effectively cut into a short period of time as a result of the Budget Act. And then when we return after the Easter break, we are restricted further on debate on the Coverdell bill. So it is obviously frustrating, when we know that the American people put the question about education front and foremost, but we are not being able to give the kind of full attention and support that we think these issues require. 
Nonetheless, I wanted to say why I support the proposal that Senator Murray will be advancing and we will have an opportunity to debate on tomorrow, on the question of reducing the class size in grades K through 3 across the country. 
And I say, Mr. President, I hope that all of our Members will pay special attention to Senator Murray as a former schoolteacher, former member of a school board, someone who has been active in the local life of a community, in the school policy issues. She brings enormous, refreshing insight and awareness and understanding of what really works in local communities, and I congratulate her on her leadership on this particular issue. I think all of us who listen to her benefit immensely from her range of knowledge, her understanding, and her real insight into education issues, and particularly when she speaks to the importance of reducing class size in grades K through 3 across the country. 
A necessary foundation for success in school is a qualified teacher in every classroom to make sure that young children receive individual attention. That is why it is so important we help bring the 100,000 new qualified teachers into the public schools and reduce class size in the elementary schools. Research has shown that students attending small classes in the early grades make more rapid progress than students in larger classes. The benefits are greatest for low-achieving, minority, and low-income children. Smaller classes also enable teachers to identify and work effectively with students who have learning disabilities and reduce the need for special education in later grades. 
A national study of 10,000 fourth-graders in 203 school districts across the country and 10,000 eighth-graders in 182 school districts across the country found that students in small classes perform better than students in large classes for both grade levels. Gains were larger for fourth-graders than eighth-graders. Gains were largest of all for inner-city students 
in small classes. They were likely to advance 75 percent more quickly than students in large classes. 
Another significant analysis, called Project STAR, studied 7,000 students in grades K through 3 in 80 schools in Tennessee. Again, students in small classes performed better than students in large classes in each grade from kindergarten through third grade. The gains were larger for minority students. 
We also know that overcrowded classrooms undermine discipline and decrease student morale. Many States and communities are considering proposals to reduce class size, but you cannot reduce class size without the ability to hire additional qualified teachers to fill the additional classrooms. And the Federal Government should lend a helping hand. 
This year, California Governor Wilson proposed to spend $1.5 billion to reduce fourth-grade classes to 20 students or less, after having reduced class sizes for students in grades K through 3 last year. 
In Pennsylvania, a recent report by the bipartisan legislative commission on urban school restructuring recommended capping class sizes in kindergarten through grade 3 in urban districts at 20 students per teacher. 
In Wisconsin, the Student Achievement Guarantee In Education Program is helping to reduce class size in grades K through 3 in low-income communities. 
In Flint, MI, efforts over the last 3 years to reduce class size in grades K through 3 have led to a 44 percent increase in reading scores and an 18 percent increase in math scores. 
Congress can do more to encourage all of these State and local efforts. We've tested the effects of reducing class sizes, and we are seeing positive results. But it is only taking place in a handful of places across the country. The Murray amendment will take the success of those particular impressive outcomes and make them available to other communities across the country so that when the demonstrated success is out there, it will be replicated and duplicated all across the Nation. 
This is a concept whose time is overdue. We have an excellent opportunity to make a very, very important contribution to helping local communities. This is a partnership between the local, State, and the Federal Government. We have all acknowledged that our participation at the Federal level is extremely small, about 7 cents out of every dollar. This is a modest program but one that can demonstrate very, very significant. We can help lead the way in reducing class size. I certainly urge my colleagues to support Senator Murray's amendment and to increase our investment in education. The Nation deserves our support.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to be a sponsor of the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998 with Chairman Jeffords and Senators Coats and Dodd. The reauthorization of this Act is a bipartisan effort of all members of the Labor Committee, and I am pleased that we have achieved a consensus on so many issues. 
Our goal in this bill is to strengthen federal support for higher education. Our legislation increases the maximum authorization for Pell grants, and expands the formula for need analysis to protect more of the income of working parents and students. 
The bill also continues the critical investment in graduate education through the institution-based program of Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need, as well as the portable Javits Fellowships, which are vital for talented students in the arts, humanities, and social sciences, where other sources of funding are limited. 
An additional initiative in the bill will enable institutions to work with faculty and administrators to improve teaching for students with disabilities. Increasing numbers of students with disabilities are participating in higher education, and faculty members often have little experience in adapting their teaching techniques for these students. This initiative will reach out to many different types of institutions, including community colleges, graduate schools, and urban and rural institutions. It also includes graduate teaching assistants--the faculty of the future. This program was first suggested by the University of Massachusetts, and it is supported by the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities on behalf of 20 disability groups. 
The bill takes a major step to improve the training of teachers by creating strong programs for training and recruitment. The training program has two parts. Fifty percent goes to local partnerships that include elementary and secondary schools, programs or schools of teacher training, schools of arts and sciences, and other groups, such as teachers unions, businesses, and community organizations. The other 50 percent of the funding goes to competitive grants to state education agencies. This teacher training proposal represents a thoughtful compromise, and I hope it will receive strong support in the Senate. 
The bill helps teachers in another way, through loan forgiveness. I have long supported more loan forgiveness for teachers, and I am pleased that there is bipartisan support for this proposal. It forgives loans for teachers who teach for at least 3 years in high-need schools. Many college graduates with heavy debt loads cannot afford to go into teaching in schools where we need them most. This loan forgiveness program will make it easier for idealistic young men and women to work with needy children. 
The bill also calls for the creation of a Performance Based Organization at the Department of Education. Following Vice President Gore's initiative to re-invent government, this organization will streamline and improve the financial aid functions at the Department. We are working with the Department to make a plan that will work well for it, for students, and for all others involved in student aid. 
Two provisions of the bill raise significant question. One of those provisions modifies the payment structure for the guaranty agencies that work with banks in the student loan program. But greater reform of these agencies is needed. They are paid too much if students go into default, and they are not paid enough for preventing defaults in the first place. I am pleased, however, that the bill does allow guaranty agencies to enter into voluntary, flexible agreements with the Secretary of Education that will be more business-like and will focus more heavily on preventing defaults. ASA, the guaranty agency in Massachusetts, has been at the forefront of the reform movement, and supports these voluntary agreements. 
Finally, the bill, like the House bill, reduces the interest rate that students pay on their college loans by almost 1% from the current rate. This reduction will be a substantial benefit for students. The average borrower with a loan of $12,000 will save $650 in interest over the life of the loan, and the average master's degree student with a debt of $20,000 will save more than $1000. For borrowers with larger loans, the savings will be greater. I am pleased that Republicans and Democrats agree that reducing the interest rate on student loans is necessary. 
But the bill trims the rates paid to banks only slightly. As under the House bill, students will pay less interest to the banks, but the federal government will make an additional payment to the banks, so that bank receipts will go down only slightly from the high rates now in effect. This subsidy is paid by the taxpayers. The cost is at least $1.2 billion over 5 years, and may be as high as $3.9 billion. 
The banks complain that they cannot live with even this very modest cut. In 1992, they told us that they could not accept any cut in the interest rate on student loans. Congress cut the rate anyway, and the bank loan program continued to thrive. Today, however, at a time when interest rates in the economy are low, the interest rate for government guaranteed student loans is higher than the rate for either car loans or home mortgages. A recent report from the Treasury Department shows that if the interest rate on student loans is cut by almost 1%, the banks can still make a reasonable profit. 
The interest rate subsidy in this bill is not offset by other revenues. We will have to work with the Budget Committee, with our colleagues in the House, and with the Administration to resolve this problem. We must do all we can to reduce the high cost of borrowing for students, without subsidizing banks at the expense of taxpayers. 
This legislation is designed to improve higher education in all parts of America. It renews our commitment to needy students, to graduate education, to teacher training, and to improving loan service for students. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this important legislation in the weeks to come.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was saddened to learn this morning of the death of Dave Powers, who was one of President Kennedy's closest friends and advisors throughout my brother's entire political career. 
President Kennedy loved Dave Powers like a brother, and so did all of us in the Kennedy family. My brother couldn't have had the New Frontier without him, and we will miss him very much. 
Dave had a warmth and wit and charm that were impossible to match. His Irish eyes were always smiling, and almost everyone he met became his `pal.' His extraordinary common sense and his down-to-earth genius for politics at its best made Dave Powers at home in the White House and in anyone else's house. 
President Kennedy and Dave discovered each other while climbing the stairs of three-decker houses in Charlestown, MA, in my brother's first campaign for Congress in 1946, and they were inseparable ever after. 
They both were veterans of World War II, and both were new to politics. The instant bond they formed took them to the House, the Senate, the White House, and around the world, including their most moving and memorable journey of all, to the Ireland of their dreams. Together, they touched and improved and inspired the lives of countless people in this country and many other lands. 
In happy times and stressful times, Dave had a special human quality that could bring an instant smile from Jack or Jackie, or a hug from John and Caroline. Dave's total recall made him the unofficial historian of the New Frontier. He loved to regale my brother by reciting the earned run average of a Red Sox pitcher, or the name of a State convention delegate from a decade ago. 
Later, Dave's extraordinary energy and dedication in carrying out his labor of love at the Kennedy Library made it a magnificent tribute to my brother and the years of the New Frontier. In a very real sense, Jack's Library became Dave's Library too. 
I extend my deepest sympathy to Dave's wife, Jo, his children Mary Jo, Diane, and David John, and all of Dave and Jo's wonderful grandchildren. 
`David, we hardly knew ye.'

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to join Senator Feinstein to introduce legislation to grant a temporary increase in immigration quotas for high tech jobs, while taking additional steps to ensure that more American workers are trained for these jobs. 
For the next decade, high tech industries will create over a million new jobs in the United States. Some have called for a permanent increase in the quotas, to ensure that companies have the workers they need to survive in this highly competitive market. 
The problem is obvious. A permanent increase would permanently deny these good jobs to American workers, and that's not acceptable. The labor market will adjust in time, as it always does, as more and more Americans enter this field. It would be a mistake to tilt the balance unfairly against them. 
Our immigration laws should not undercut the ability of young Americans, downsized defense workers, and others to enter this dynamic field. 
This week, the General Accounting Office sent a clear warning on this issue, saying that the job market studies used by the industry are flawed, and do not prove that significant worker shortage exists. 
Our legislation will accomplish three goals: 
First, it provides a temporary increase in immigration quotas from 65,000 to 90,000 visas a year for the next three years. This increase will enable U.S. companies to hire the workers they need now. 
Second, we invest in training U.S. workers. Americans want these jobs, and they deserve the training needed to get them. Our bill proposes a modest $250 application fee for each foreign worker sought under the immigration quota. The fee will raise approximately $100 million each year over the next three years to fund training opportunities for Americans. 
Third, our bill strengthens the enforcement of the immigration laws. It gives the Labor Department greater authority and resources to ensure that employers pay the proper wage and meet other standards in hiring foreign workers. We specifically make it illegal for employers to lay off American workers and hire foreign workers to replace them. In other words, employers should hire at home first in obtaining new workers, before importing them from abroad. 
We believe these steps meet the immediate needs of this important industry, while preserving the priority we own our own workers, and we urge Congress to enact them.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Nation's students deserve modern schools with world class teachers, but too many students in too many schools in too many communities across the country fail to achieve that standard. 
The latest international survey of math and science achievement confirms the urgent need to raise standards of performance for schools, teachers and students alike. It is shameful that America's 12th graders rank among the lowest of the 22 nations participating in this international survey of math and science. 
Schools across the Nation face serious problems of overcrowding. Antiquated facilities are suffering from physical decay, and are not equipped to handle the needs of modern education. 
Across the country, 14 million children in a third of the Nation's schools are learning in substandard buildings. Half the schools have at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition. It will take over $100 billion just to repair the existing facilities nationwide. 
This chart is a good summation as to what the current conditions are. This year, K-12 enrollment reached an all-time high and will continue to rise over the next 7 years. 6,000 new public schools will be needed by the year 2006 just to maintain current class sizes. We will also need to hire 2 million teachers over the next decade to accommodate rising student enrollments and massive teacher requirements. And because of the overcrowding, schools are using trailers for classrooms and teaching students in former hallways, closets, and bathrooms. Overcrowded classrooms undermine discipline and decrease student morale. 
This chart reflects, again, the kind of crisis we are facing for our 52 million American students: 14 million children learn in substandard schools; 7 million children attend schools with asbestos, lead paint, or radon in their ceilings or walls; 12 million children go to school under leaky roofs; a third of America's children study in classrooms without enough outlets and electrical wiring to accommodate computers and multimedia equipment. 
The General Accounting Office has determined that it will take in excess of $100 billion just to repair existing facilities nationwide. We send a very powerful message to the children in this Nation when they are going to substandard schools. The message is this: The parents, or the older generation, don't give education the priority which it deserves. 
Politicians of both parties are out there talking about our responsibility to education and to our children and our future, but we fail to have decent facilities with enough classrooms and well-trained teachers and fail to care for children both before they get into school and in the after school hours. Putting children first--when we fail to do that, we send a very powerful message to children that it really doesn't make an awful lot of difference how they perform in school and whether they conform to various rules and regulations. We send a message to children every single day that they go to dilapidated schools or overcrowded schools that education for the children of this country is not our first priority. 
We have to ask ourselves as we begin the budget debate, How does this budget reflect our Nation's priorities? This budget, which we are beginning a debate on today and will continue to debate through the course of next week, how is that really going to reflect our Nation's priorities? What are we prepared to do to try to work with States and local communities to improve the schools in our country? 
Just throwing money at a problem is not the answer; we have all learned that. But I tell you that the amount of resources you allocate to a particular purpose or policy is a pretty clear reflection about what kind of priority the Nation is going to place on it. 
If we are not going to provide the resources that are necessary to reduce class size and enhance educational achievement, if we are not going to try to address the problems of dilapidated and decaying schools, not only in urban areas but in rural areas, if we are not prepared to help recruit additional schoolteachers who are well trained and certified to teach the courses which they are instructing, if we are not going to help provide education opportunity zones to assist communities that are trying to innovate and be imaginative and work with teachers and parents to enhance academic achievement--all of which have been proposed by the President--if we are not going to say we care sufficiently about children when they leave school in the afternoon, the 5 million children that go home to empty houses every single day, we don't care about them--if we don't care enough about children before they go to school in Head Start programs, if we are not prepared to invest in children, then we are sending a very powerful message. 
Those speeches that Members are making in here are empty. We are challenging our Republican leadership and Republican colleagues to invest in children, reject what the Budget Committee has done in turning its back on children--and I say `turning their back on children.' We will get into the particular details of the budget resolution later. 
Now, incredibly, the Republican budget proposal ignores the pressing needs that I have outlined here. The Republican plan cuts funding for education. It refuses to provide key new investments to improve public education. If that anti-education plan is passed, schools and students will get even less help next year than they are getting this year. Let me repeat that: If this budget that is before the Senate now is not altered and changed, then the help and assistance for public schools will be less next year than it was this year. That is the end result, because even if the Appropriations Committee increases funding later on during the course of this Congress, it will violate the budget resolution. 
This budget resolution is the time to debate the allocations of resources to enhance the public schools in this country. Under the resolution that is before the Senate this afternoon, there is a real cut, a real cut in support for public education. That is what I find so incredibly offensive in terms of the budget proposal that is before the Senate. The Republican anti-education budget cuts discretionary spending by $1.6 billion below the President's budget. It cuts funding for education and Head Start programs by $1 billion below the level needed to maintain current services. 
The Head Start Program had bipartisan support. We have expanded Head Start programs for Early Start on the basis of the Carnegie Commission Report and the wide range of different testimony that has been before our Education Committees: The earlier the kind of contact, as the child's brain is developing, and building confidence and helping and assisting that child through a nurturing experience and expanding their horizons, has a very, very important impact in the ability of that child to expand their academic achievement in the growing years of education. That has been proven. We saw a small allocation--about 4 percent--in the early education programs in the Head Start Program, and it has been successful. We have been trying to expand it. But all of those resources are being cut back in the Republican budget proposal that is out here before the Senate. 
As I said, it cuts the Head Start Program. The Republican anti-education budget denies 3.7 million students the opportunity to benefit from smaller class size. It denies 900,000 disadvantaged students the extra help they need to improve their reading and math skills. It denies 400,000 students the opportunity to attend after-school programs, those programs which are so essential. 
We know that the best teacher that any child has is the parent--the parent; second, it is the schoolteacher. But we also know what children do before they come to school in the morning is important, and we know what happens to children in the afternoon is very important. We won't take the time to elaborate on the after-school programs and what it means in terms of helping and assisting a child, working with that child, to help them with their homework, help them with auxiliary programs as I have seen out in Dorchester, MA, just 3 weeks ago in an excellent program. I saw the liveliness of those children in the after-school programs. 
You would think a child, after going through a full day of education, would be pretty tired, but the light in those children's eyes as they are involved in doing their homework and involved in artwork, involved in photography, and even in cooking so that they would be of help and assistance in the home--the idea of helping those children get their homework done in the afternoon with help and assistance, so when their parents are at home at nighttime after a full day of work, they can enjoy some common time together and the parents are not going to the child saying, `You better go off and do your homework.' 
These are pretty commonsense recommendations, after school programs. I won't take the time, at least now, to go through the excellent presentations of Paul Evans, our police commissioner in Boston, who talks about the importance of after-school programs in order to reduce crime and violence in a community--eloquent, eloquent testimony. I daresay that we have had a better record in Boston in reducing youth homicide than any city in the country. We went over 2 years without a single youth homicide--over 2 years without a single youth homicide. 
If you had Paul Evans here on the floor of the U.S. Senate this afternoon, he would say there are three elements. You need to have a tough kind of action in dealing with the violent youth that are involved in gangs, you have to have an effective program to police the proliferation of weapons, and you have to have an effective after-school program. How many times I have listened to his eloquence. Those three elements are the key. 
But an after-school program is key if we are serious in terms of trying to do something about violence in our society, and that case is so powerful. The President has an after-school program. It has been a modest program for the last year. It has been tried and tested. It recognizes that the increase in crime among juveniles rises about 60 percent between the hours of 3 and 4 every single day, just when kids get out. And 70 percent of the illegitimate births among teenagers are caused during the time of between 3 and 6 in the afternoon. It is a key time, Mr. President, when too many of our young people are cast loose out into society, or just into their own homes with a television set, or if they are older, to a street corner. This is an important ingredient in terms of the education component. 
Now the President requested that program, and it is effectively zeroed out in the Republican program. So you are going to deny some 400,000 students the opportunity to attend after-school programs. 
The Republican budget denies 6,500 middle schools, serving 5 million students, extra help to ensure that they are safe and drug free. It denies 1 million students in failing schools the opportunity to benefit from innovative reforms. It denies 3.9 million needy college students an increase in their Pell grants. 
The President requested a very modest increase in Pell grants, which would have a significant impact on students such as those who attend UMASS-Boston. Their tuition may be up now to $1,350 a year. Eighty-five percent of those kids' parents never went to college. Eighty-five percent of them are working 25 hours a week or more. When the tuition is up $100 at UMASS-Boston, they see a 10 percent decline in admissions requests. That $100 makes a difference to those kids. That $100 is a life-and-death thing to those kids. And the President had recommended some $300 on it. The way it works out, in terms of the formula, it would be a little over $100 per kid in the Pell grant program that was lost dramatically in purchasing power over the past years. That is eliminated, Mr. President. 
All of these are paid for in the President's program. These aren't add-ons to the budget. They are all paid for under the President's program that moves us to a balanced budget. But no, no, we have to cut those programs investing in kids and provide a $30 billion tax cut for wealthy individuals. Take that money that is going to after school, take that money away from Pell grants, take that money away from children for math and science, take that money away from smaller classrooms and take that money away from strengthening teacher training, and put it where? In a tax break. Now, that is the issue. It is an issue of priorities. It is an issue of priorities. It is who is on whose side? If you want to cut to the meat of it, who is on the side of working families and their kids, and who is on the side of those that need another tax break? It isn't the working families that get a tax break, because the Republicans have opposed any increase in the minimum wage. This isn't even a tax break. These are men and women who are working hard, playing by the rules, and want to provide their kids 
with food on the table and, after working two jobs, to be able to spend some time with them. 
You would think they would at least say that if we are not going to give them a tax break--because they don't benefit from a tax break--at least say let's give them an increase in the minimum wage. No, no, no. That is what we heard last year, but we were eventually able to win it. But we haven't got one single Republican cosponsor of an increase in the minimum wage for this year--not one--when we have seen the most expanding, growing economy, with 320,000 jobs added in the job market last month, and 12,000 in the restaurant industry; they are always complaining about any increase and how it is going to be devastating to the restaurant industry, but they grew 12,000 jobs just last month. 
So, Mr. President, these are some of the issues that are in this budget and what we have to address. We must test students early so that we know where they need help in time to make that help effective. We must provide better training for current and new teachers so that they are well prepared to teach to high standards. We must reduce class size to help students obtain the individual attention they need. We must provide after-school programs to make constructive alternatives available to students. We must provide greater resources to modernize and expand the Nation's school buildings to meet the urgent needs of schools for up-to-date facilities. 
I hope that during the consideration of the budget resolution next week, we will give education the high priority that it deserves.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment of the Senate's time to talk about another decision and another priority that was made in the Budget Committee in the past 10 days. 
The Republican budget would also prohibit using the money raised by a cigarette price increase from being directed to programs that prevent children from starting to smoke and help those who are already addicted to quit smoking. These programs are essential to any effective antismoking effort. 
What you have to have, if you are going to be serious about trying to stop the youth from smoking, is a dramatic increase in costs in a short period of time. That is the record. We have examples of it. We can spend some time in going through those various reports. You need to have that. It also has to be accompanied by an effective counteradvertising campaign. If you only rely on an increase, what happens is the tobacco industry goes out and increases their advertising, and that overwhelms the discouraging aspect of a price increase. That is the record of it. We have seen that, and we will have a chance at another time when we go through the whole debate on tobacco. 
So you have to find a corresponding action. What the public health community, who studied this for years, says is that you not only have to have counteradvertising of tobacco, which amounts to $5 billion a year--you don't expect to match it with $5 billion a year, but under the Republican proposal it talks about $125 million that they are prepared to authorize but won't even guarantee. Even the last spring settlement, which was deficient in some important areas, provided for the mandatory spending for counteradvertising. But not this Republican budget, not this Republican budget. No. They said, effectively, no, we won't require that moneys that come in as a result of an increase in price--sure there should be some moneys for the Medicare Program, but let me depart for a moment. 
The best way to help the Medicare Program is to get kids to stop smoking. The costs of the Medicare Program are $9 billion a year, approximately. When you stop kids from smoking, you are going to save Medicare billions of dollars. So we allocate, under the Conrad proposal, some resources on Medicare. But we are talking now about the public health measures that have been turned down by the Budget Committee. These public health measures had been included in the first McCain proposal that was offered last 
fall. He knew they were important. They were included in the Hatch proposal, which also includes these measures, funds to try to deal with the public health aspects of children. They were included in a bipartisan program on Harkin-Chafee. They included that. But not the Budget Committee, not the Budget Committee, well-known protectors of the public health; not the Budget Committee, no, sir. 
Zero in terms of counteradvertising; zero in support of local communities for cessation programs to stop kids from smoking in the schools, to try to help local communities, work in local schools, nonprofit agencies, groups that have been working with cessation programs for years, zero for them, no way; zero for studying the problems of addiction to narcotics, and to study the problems with health-related issues that are attached to tobacco, such as lung cancer; effectively zero for any kind of a review, study, or investment in those particular programs; and zero with regard to looking out after farmers who are going to be impacted by this program. I may have my differences on the public policy issue on tobacco, but I am not prepared, like the tobacco industry has done it, to do it on the backs of those tobacco farmers. 
If you look back over what those tobacco farmers' increase has been over the past 10 years, when you have had record profits by the tobacco industry, it was pittance for those tobacco farmers. The first thing that happens, if the tobacco industry gets in any problem, they rent those big buses and park them on the mall and let them come up here and ask us why we are against those individuals and their families. How many times have we done that, Mr. President? We will have a chance to go on through that. 
But the point that we are making, Mr. President, is that these programs are essential to any effective antismoking effort and education on the dangers of tobacco use, counteradvertising, deglamorizing smoking among children, smoke cessation programs, and medical research to cure tobacco-induced diseases. 
They should be the first priority for the dollars produced by a cigarette price increase. 
All of us agree that Medicare should be protected for future generations. All of us recognize that tobacco imposes a heavy cost exceeding $9 billion a year on Medicare, and that a share of any tobacco revenues should be used for Medicare. 
But one of the best ways to keep Medicare strong for the future is to invest in important public health and tobacco control programs that prevent children from beginning to smoke and help current smokers to quit smoking. 
But not this budget. Every public health official that has appeared before Republicans and Democrats alike in the House and in the Senate has said these are essential. But not the Budget Committee. But we will have a chance to address that. That is an important priority. 
Americans will lead healthier lives, and the burden of tobacco-induced diseases will be greatly reduced. 
Obviously, it makes good sense to earmark funds for Medicare and smoking cessation programs, for tobacco counter-advertising campaigns, for tobacco-related research and education programs, and for FDA enforcement of provisions to reduce smoking by children. 
Unfortunately, the Republican budget earmarks all of the tobacco revenues for Medicare. It prohibits using even one dollar of the tobacco revenues to deter youth from smoking. That's unacceptable. 
Smoking has inflicted great damage on people's health. It makes sense to use tobacco revenues for these important anti-tobacco initiatives too. 
These programs work. Every dollar invested in a smoking cessation program for a pregnant woman saves $6 in costs for neonatal intensive care and long-term care for low birthweight babies. 
Listen to this. Every $1 invested in a smoking cessation program for a pregnant woman saves $6 in costs for neonatal intensive care and long-term care for low-birthweight babies. But there is nothing in this program for that. 
The Republican budget offers no help in cases like this, and that makes no sense. 
The Republican budget offers no help to states and communities for public health advertising to counteract the $5 billion a year--$5 billion--that the tobacco industry pours into advertising to encourage people to start smoking and keep smoking. 
The Republican budget offers no help to the Food and Drug Administration to enforce the laws against the sale of tobacco products to minors, even though young people spend $1 billion a year to buy tobacco products illegally. 
You would think that we would want to try to do something about that as well. Talk to any serious official in the public health community, and they will say that we need a multidisciplined approach if we are going to have an impact in reducing tobacco use among young people. We have to do all of these things. But not the Budget Committee. And the Republican budget offers no help for medical research on tobacco-related diseases, even though such research can lead to enormous savings for Medicare. The country supports, I believe, these fundamental, sound public health proposals, and the Senate should as well.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern about the continuing efforts of some in Congress to undermine the rights of the first Americans--the American Indian and Alaska Native people of our country, their tribal governments, and their unique and historic government-to-government relationship with the United States. In America today, there are 557 federally recognized tribes. In hundreds of treaties signed by the President and ratified by the Senate over the years, Indian tribes have traded vast amounts of land for the right to live on their reservations and govern themselves. An honorable country keeps its promises, even those made many years ago. We must reaffirm our commitment to self-determination for tribal governments. 
In the first session of this Congress, numerous proposals were introduced to limit the sovereign rights of tribal governments. One of the most objectionable of the proposals would have required tribal governments to waive all sovereign immunity against suit as a condition of receiving federal funds. It would have authorized suits against tribal governments to be heard in federal courts rather than tribal courts. 
Other legislation similar in scope contains extremely broad waivers of tribal sovereign immunity, and would subject tribal governments to virtually any type of suit in both federal and state courts. Any such measure would make it nearly impossible for tribal governments to carry out basic governmental functions and would jeopardize the resources and the future of tribal governments. 
Indian nations are forms of government recognized in the U.S. Constitution and hundreds of treaties, court decisions and federal laws. Tribal governments are analogous to state and local governments. They carry out basic governmental functions such as law enforcement and education on Indian lands throughout the country. Tribal governments are modern, democratic, fair and as deserving of respect by Congress just as Congress respects state and local governments. 
Sovereign immunity is not an anachronism It is alive and well as legal doctrine that protects the essential functions of government from unreasonable litigation and damage claims. Like other forms of government, tribal governments are not perfect, but any changes should be based on a careful study of current needs and circumstances, and be guided by the fundamental principle that it is the federal government's role to protect tribal self-government. 
In addition to challenges to their sovereign immunity, tribal governments also face constant attempts to undermine their ability to take land into trust, to impose taxes upon their revenues, and to impose `means testing' on their federal funding. 
As the Senate deals with these issues, I urge the Senate to act responsibly. Broad generalizations and one-size-fits-all solutions may seem tempting, but they will have disastrous effects when applied to the diversity of Indian Nations in this country. A realistic review of the variety of circumstances and specific issues is far more likely to lead to workable solutions. 
Many of the issues that are being raised today involve matters of purely local concern that can be resolved at the local level by the tribes and states. The role of the federal government in these cases should be to encourage local cooperation, rather than to create new legislation with broad, unintended consequences. 
Above all, any solutions by Congress should be guided by the principle that it is the federal government's role to protect tribal self-government. 
Tribal self-government serves the same purpose today that it has always served. It enables Indian tribes to protect their cultures and identities and provide for the needs of their people. By doing so, tribal self-government enriches American life and provides economic opportunities where few would otherwise exist. 
A common misperception is the belief that most tribes are growing wealthy from gaming proceeds. Nothing is further from the truth. Indian reservations have a 31% poverty rate--the highest poverty rate in America. Indian unemployment is six times the national average. Indian health, education and income are the worst in the country. Only a very small number of tribes have been fortunate enough to have successful gaming operations. 
Instead of undermining them, Congress should be doing more to help tribes create jobs, raise incomes, and develop capital for new businesses. We should also be doing more to invest in the health, the education and the skills of American Indians and Alaska Natives, as we do for all Americans, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and House to do so.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senate votes to deny the administration's request for additional funding to fulfill the responsibilities bestowed by Congress under the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation, tens of millions of Americans will be denied the protection of a law we passed unanimously, not once but twice. Supporting the Nickles amendment is like saying, `We'll give you a car, but not the keys.' 
What good does it do to pass a law that we are not willing to enforce? This amendment will effectively reduce, in a very important and significant way, the enforcement and the protections that were included in the legislation. 
Every Senator in the 104th Congress voted for the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation--not a single vote against it on passage or on the conference bill. And every Senator went back to his or her State to take credit for the good work that they had done to hail the promise of accessible and portable health insurance. 
But now we have this proposal to effectively break the promise by denying the enforcement agency, in this instance HCFA, the staff and the resources they need to make that promise a reality. 
So let us be very clear. This really isn't about the budget. This is not about wasteful spending or an ever-expanding government. The HCFA request is fully paid for by a transfer from another HCFA budget, and it is a justified, targeted response to the situation before us, which has been outlined in the GAO report. 
Yesterday, questions were raised about whether this request affected more than the five States that have yet to act and whether the request affected HCFA's ability to enforce the legislation that created the mental health parity and the banned so-called drive-by 
deliveries. 
But HCFA Administrator Nancy-Ann Min DeParle answered these questions following our debate yesterday in a letter she sent to clarify the situation. She writes that this money is needed to implement not only Kassebaum-Kennedy, but also the mental health and drive-by delivery bills. The fact is that there are many gaps beyond just the five State references that were included in the GAO report. 
I have, Mr. President, in my hand, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners' report as of December 3, 1997, that indicates that 30 states have yet to enact the legislation to implement the law on the mental health parity. Thirty States have not implemented those particular protections on mental health. 
We had a strong vote here on the Domenici-Wellstone amendment. And we now see that there are effectively 30 States that have not implemented the mental health parity law. If HCFA is not given the resources to enforce it in those states that fail to act, then the persons with severe mental illness who live in those states will not benefit from the parity provisions we voted to give them. 
The Senator from Oklahoma continues to insist that this is a short-term problem and that the only real problem that we are faced with in implementing HIPAA is just in five States. And this, as I mentioned, is wrong. The duration of the problem is not yet known. We have already mentioned that 30 states require federal enforcement for mental health parity. We know on the drive-by delivery issue, which we also passed in a bipartisan way in 1996, was to be implemented with the same kind of enforcement mechanisms--and there are eight States, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners--that have not enacted legislation to conform with or implement the federal bill to ban drive-by deliveries. 
The request in the bill under consideration today will be used to make sure that women in these eight States are going to have the similar kind of protections as the women in 42 other States. It will be used to ensure that the mental health parity provisions are enforced in the 30 states that have not yet come into compliance. And there are many others. Oklahoma is one of 11 states that have not passed laws to guarantee renewability in the individual market, thereby needing federal enforcement of this key HIPAA provision. These are all in addition to the five States that have been referenced by the Senator from Oklahoma. And there are more. 
There are very, very important needs, Mr. President. 
Now, the supplemental request will simply allow HCFA to move forward with what Congress asked of them. Some of my colleagues have suggested that HCFA should have asked for this increase last year. But we all know that if they had asked last year, they would have been told that it was premature and to wait for State action. Some have suggested that they wait for the regular budget for next year, but such a delay is unnecessary and an insult to the American public. 
Each year, HCFA staffing levels are revisited during the appropriations process. If Congress finds in the future that the States are fully compliant and HCFA no longer needs to fulfill this function, I am confident that the Appropriations Committee will adjust accordingly. They do so. 
HCFA's duties have significantly increased in the past two years. Among other things, they have chief responsibility for providing guidance to states to implement the new Children's Health Insurance Program, for cracking down on fraud and abuse, and for implementing of the various and important changes in Medicare and Medicaid resulting from the Balanced Budget Act. All of those are being implemented virtually at the same time as the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill--including the provisions on mental health and maternity protections--is being implemented. And the proposal that came to the floor of the Senate did not increase the budget but reallocated resources within the agency. They aren't asking for more money, just a transfer to allow them to hire people to do the jobs we asked of them. And the Nickles amendment seeks 
to gut these efforts by striking this proposal. 
Mr. President, it is unconscionable to deny the American public the rights we voted to give them almost 2 years ago. They have waited long enough. The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill bans some of the worst abuses by health insurers, abuses that affect millions of people a year. Prior to its enactment, more than half of all insurance policies imposed unlimited exclusions for preexisting conditions. Prior to its enactment, insurance companies could refuse to insure--redline--entire small businesses because one employee was in poor health. Prior to its enactment, 25 percent of American workers were afraid to change jobs and to start new businesses for fear of losing health insurance coverage. 
Prior to its enactment, people could be dropped from coverage if they had the misfortune to become sick, even if they had faithfully paid their premiums for years. 
The General Accounting Office stated that as many as 25 million people would benefit from these protections. These are the protections that are in the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation. All we are saying is, let's make sure, now that we have passed them and told families that they will have those protections, let's make sure that we are making good on that promise. We have the personnel to be able to do that, and it has been included in this legislation. 
Reference is made: Why don't they shift around personnel? They have a lot of people in that agency; certainly they could shift around personnel. The fact is, in this particular area, as I mentioned, are specialists in a particular area in the insurance industry. This is not something that HCFA has a background and experience in. These are protections because of many of the abuses. Therefore, they need certain types of personnel and individuals that have some very specialized skills in this area to be able to do the job. That is what is being called for. That is the case that is being made. If they do not have it, what we will find is, people will be left confused, things will be uncertain, people who thought they had various rights will not have those rights guaranteed. 
Patchwork enforcement and concerted efforts by unscrupulous insurers to violate the law raised serious concerns during the earlier implementation period. While the provisions affecting the group market appear to be going well--that is about 80 percent of the legislation which is going well--the GAO has identified many concerns in the individual market provisions. 
Our legislation specifically deferred to the States in recognition of their longstanding and experienced role as regulators of health insurance. We gave States more than a year to design their own legislation based on the Federal law. Federal regulation was only a backup if States failed to act. Most States have passed implementing or conforming legislation. There are significant gaps. In every State that has failed to act in whole or in part, the responsibility for assuring compliance, responding to complaints, and informing the public has fallen on the Health Care Financing Administration. HCFA is just over 20 people working on this issue in its headquarters, and a handful more spread across the regions. Most State insurance departments have hundreds of people. California, for example, has more than 1,000 people on staff to handle these issues; HCFA has 1 person in San Francisco. 
GAO explicitly and repeatedly expressed concerns that HCFA's current resources are inadequate to effectively enforce the bill. The NAIC--which is the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the commissioners in each of the 50 States; this is their national organization--in testimony before the Ways and Means Committee last fall said, `The Federal Government has new and significant responsibilities to protect consumers in these States. Fulfilling these responsibilities requires significant Federal resources.' 
The legislation that passed over 20 months ago was being implemented in January of this year, but the States were taking the steps in the previous 18 months to comply with the legislation, with it being implemented in January of this year. In February, we had the GAO report that pointed out the failure of some of the States to take the steps to provide the protections and said additional kinds of resources were going to be necessary. This is really a response to that particular reality. 
The GAO found that many companies were engaging in price gouging, with premiums being charged to consumers exercising their rights to buy individual policies when they lost their job-based coverage as much as 600 percent above standard rates. They found other carriers continue to illegally impose preexisting condition exclusions. We cannot deal with that; nor do we intend to. That ought to be an issue for another time. It ought to be addressed in 
terms of that kind of abuse. We are not talking about that issue. But we are talking about the implementation of these other protections, to make sure, for example, if you are moving from a group to individual, that there is going to be available insurance in those States that are going to cover the individuals that have preexisting conditions, and also what they call renewability, to make sure that those individuals are going to be able to be renewed if they pay under the terms of their premiums--that it takes that kind of an action to ensure coverage or otherwise people are going to be outside of the coverage. That is an area where a number of States have not taken action. 
Some companies or agents illegally fail to disclose to consumers they have a right to buy a policy. Others have refused to pay commissions to agents who refer eligible individuals. Others tell agents not to refer any eligibles for coverage. Some carriers put all the eligibles with health problems in a single insurance product, driving up the rates to unaffordable levels, while selling regular policies to healthy eligibles. 
The Senate should not be voting for a free ride for failure to comply with these protections which most States have complied with. It should not be an accomplice to denying families the kind of protections for preexisting conditions that they were promised by unanimous votes just 2 years ago. The need for the additional staff goes beyond enforcement. The GAO found wide gaps in consumer knowledge, gaps that prevented consumers from exercising their rights under the laws. HHS wants to launch a vigorous effort to address this problem, but according to the GAO, because of the resource constraints, the agency is unable to put much effort into consumer education. 
Now, the point that has been raised by the Senator from Oklahoma that this is not an emergency situation--for millions of Americans, the failure to enforce the legislation is an emergency. Every family who is illegally denied health insurance faces an emergency. Every child that goes without timely medical care because this bill is not enforced faces an emergency, and every family that is bankrupted by medical costs because this bill is not enforced faces an emergency. This may not be an emergency for abusive insurance companies, but it is an emergency for families all over this country. For some, it is a matter of life and death. 
But don't take my word for it. Since our debate yesterday, more than 20 organizations have sent letters, which are at the desk, urging that we defeat the Nickles amendment. Leading organizations representing persons with disabilities, the mental health communities, women with breast cancer, and consumers generally have written asking opposition to this unwarranted attack on the law. More are coming. The Senate should reject this amendment. We need to toughen the Kassebaum bill, not weaken its enforcement. This is a test as to whether the Senate wants to really ensure that those provisions in the bill that will guarantee the protection on the preexisting condition will actually be protected. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have seen many smokescreens on the Senate floor before. But I just heard one of the largest smokescreens ever from those who just tried to cut Medicare by some 
$270 billion in order to give tax breaks to the wealthiest individuals and corporations. We defended that position here on the floor of the U.S. Senate not long ago. Now what we are talking about at this time is an administrative cost. This isn't going to affect one single dollar in terms of benefits or in terms of health care costs for senior citizens. 
So before we all cry crocodile tears at the suggestions of my good friend from Texas, maybe he would spend an equal amount of time discussing his justification for his proposal to seek major cuts in the Medicare program to fund tax breaks for wealthy individuals. That may be suitable for another time. 
I do not suggest that the Republicans who are Members of the Appropriations Committee that supported and reported out the provision that is in the current bill are Republicans that have a distaste for Medicare or want to ignore our nation's senior citizens. This proposal was reported out of the Republican Appropriations Committee. That is how it got here on the floor. And you have not heard the Senator from Massachusetts charging that they have hurt the Medicare system. 
Mr. President, fortunately, our good colleagues in the Senate know the facts on this situation. Basically, what you are talking about is transferring $16 million in administrative costs to enforce a law to protect millions of American citizens. We are talking about women with breast cancer or others with preexisting conditions who are turned down for insurance every single day; we are talking about children with disabilities who are locked out of the private health insurance system; we are talking about small businesses who are refused health insurance because one employee is in poor health. And many others. Without enforcement, the stick to ensure compliance by the insurance companies, these protections are simply not there. They are not there. 
We have a GAO report that says HCFA needs help, and we have the insurance commissioners of the States that say HCFA needs the help--Republicans and Democrats alike--as do the various organizations that speak for the elderly, and the disabled, and the mentally ill, and the cancer patients, and the consumers. Are they all wrong? Are all 30 of these organizations all wrong? They don't want to throw out the Medicare system, as the Senator from Texas says. Of course, not. They understand what this is all about. These are organizations that have been fighting for Medicare since they were formed. They have unimpeachable credentials in terms of protecting Medicare. 
So, Mr. President, we are back to where we were in this debate and discussion. These funds are needed. HCFA asked in their request of the Appropriations Committee, which was approved, and later in the letter that they sent up to the Congress, to me following my inquiry after yesterday's debate, reiterating the request and clarifying that the requested funds were also needed to enforce the mental health parity and drive-by delivery provisions. And this $6 million of appropriated funds that otherwise would be used administratively is going to be used to ensure that the promises made in the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill and in the Mothers Health Protection Act and the Mental Health Parity Act are not merely illusory. 
The Senator from Oklahoma says that states have not complied because the regulations came out in December. The irony is not lost on me--blame HCFA for not issuing regulations and then deny them the necessary resources to fulfill their responsibilities. But states have had more than a year to comply with this relatively straightforward law. They didn't need to wait for regulations to act. And many of the States did act prior to the regulations. Nonetheless, 30 States did not. 
This request is needed to prevent the kind of discrimination that is being committed against millions of Americans that have preexisting conditions. It is needed to ensure that mothers that live in the eight States that still allow drive-by deliveries, and that those who are afflicted with mental health problems have the same level of protection as those in their neighboring states. 
Mr. President, this is really what this debate is all about. We have had a GAO report that made recommendations that we take this action. The States have been, over the period of the last 18 months, getting themselves effectively in shape for the implementation of this legislation, which started in January. But the GAO report said there are a number of very important areas that need attention if this bill is really going to do what the Congress has said is going to be done. 
We are responding to that particular need, and that is what the committee responded to, Republicans and Democrats alike. The idea of suggesting that the members of the Appropriations Committee that reported this out are somehow less interested in the protection of Medicare is preposterous. It is preposterous on its face and the Senator knows that. 
I am prepared to take some parliamentary action, but I see others here on the floor who want to address this, so therefore I withhold.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we will have a good opportunity to debate. I am glad to hear my friend from Texas indicate his support for effective tobacco legislation. We will have, hopefully, a good opportunity to debate that. 
I was listening to the Senator speak so eloquently. I was remembering that in checking my facts, the Republican Contract With America provided a $270 billion cut in Medicare, with a $250 billion tax break for the wealthiest individuals. So we have debated this at other times, if we want to discuss who truly cares about Medicare. That is not what we are about here today. We have explained what the issue is before us.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's concern about the excessive spending. I am offering a compromise to his amendment. The Senator from Oklahoma proposes an amendment to eliminate the HCFA request by striking the entire $16 million. We have cut that amount in half to $8 million as a way of trying to find common ground on this issue. It cuts the amount given to HCFA in half. This is less than I want, but it will still make a substantial contribution to enforcing the insurance reform. 
The issue is clear: Will the Senate stand with families, with children, with persons suffering severe mental illness, with persons with disabilities, and with expectant mothers to make sure that the protections that were included in the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation will actually be implemented? 
Did we really mean it when we passed those important reforms about 2 years ago? I believe that we did mean it. I think those reforms are enormously important protections for millions of our fellow citizens. The States have done a good job. But there are still some areas where those protections are not there. 
With these resources, we can guarantee that the law fulfills its promise of protecting our fellow citizens. It will allow us to nip in the bud some of the egregious situations that have been 
outlined in the GAO report. 
This bipartisan amendment provides $8 million, half of the Administration's request--$3 million for implementation and enforcement of Kassebaum-Kennedy and $5 million for the other purposes outlined in the Administration's original $16 million proposal that was advanced by Senator Bond and others in the Appropriations Committee. I hope that our colleagues will feel that this is a good-faith effort to try to find common ground. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, this is not an add-on. This is an administrative judgment made by HCFA that there was a greater need and priority to use additional resources to implement the Kassebaum bill. We are not adding on the funds. The Senator is right in recognizing that we are trying to accommodate the concerns raised about the number of people and trying to move this process forward, so we have cut out half of the request. 
Mr. President, I want to reserve the last 45 seconds. 
I want to read a few words of a letter from the National Breast Cancer Coalition: 
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill is meaningless without adequate resources for implementation and enforcement. The National Breast Cancer Coalition is a grassroots advocacy organization made up of over 400 organizations and hundreds of thousands of individuals. Adequate implementation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act is critical to this end. 
Critical to this end. Those are the words of the National Cancer Breast Coalition, which represents some 400 different grassroots organizations. We have the same kind of statements made by all of the various groups affecting the disability community, all supporting the position which we have taken and which we have advocated. 
Mr. President, I believe that it is important to make sure that those protections for individuals who have preexisting conditions or disabilities should be protected. 
This amendment, which pares down the original request, goes halfway on this issue, but is still able to provide some of the necessary protections we have debated today. I hope that the Kennedy-Bond-Wellstone amendment will be accepted.

This does not take one dime out of Medicare--not one dime. The disabled have a greater dependency on Medicare than any other group in our society. They are more dependent upon it than anyone else, and they support our position. That ought to speak to where the priorities are. They understand the importance--the importance--of implementing the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill and providing the protections for families in this country. That is what our amendment will do.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank our leader, Senator Daschle, for the efforts he has made to try to raise the education issue for debate here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I think that, historically, there have been great debates on education, when we found common ground, and they were basically bipartisan in nature. It has been rare that we have been unable to at least have a good, full debate on the education issue. 
It is regrettable that our Republican friends are so unsure of their position on education policy that they would deny the opportunity for a debate on upgrading and modernizing our schools, providing for smaller classrooms, improving the teachers in our country and the after-school programs. 
So I say to our leader that I look forward to the time here on the Senate floor when we can have the kind of debate that I think the country wants. The country recognizes that education is the key issue for the future of our Nation, and we ought to be debating the best ideas of Republicans and Democrats alike.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment by the Senator from Oklahoma should be called `The Abusive Insurers Protection Act.' 
The Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation, which protects consumers against insurance company abuses, passed the Senate by 100-0 on April 23, 1996. The conference agreement passed it on August 2, 1996, by a vote of 98-0. It has unanimous support--not once but twice. But now some Senators are proposing to effectively gut that legislation by denying HCFA the staff and the resources they need to enforce the bill. 
Let us be very clear. This is not about the budget. This is not about wasteful spending. The HCFA request is fully paid for by a cut elsewhere in the HCFA budget. This is about an inexplicable effort to deny millions of people the right to portable, accessible health insurance. 
Let me review the history of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill and explain to the Members why the request for the additional staff and resources is needed. 
The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill bans some of the worst abuses by health insurers--abuses that affect millions of people a year. It says that insurers could not impose preexisting condition exclusions on people who have faithfully paid their premiums but changed insurance carrier because they changed their job. It says that insurers could not penalize members of a group by excluding workers who happen to be in poor health or by charging them additional premiums. It says that small businesses could not be denied insurance coverage or have their policy canceled because one worker developed a health problem. It says that people who lost their job through no fault of their own could not be denied insurance in the individual market. 
According to the General Accounting Office, as many as 25 million people annually benefit from this health insurance bill of rights. But patchwork enforcement and a concerted effort by unscrupulous insurers to violate the law have raised serious concerns during the early implementation period. 
For too many Americans the promise of the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill has been a broken promise. The President and the Department of HHS are moving decisively to address some of the worst abuses, but their ability to do so will be crippled if this amendment passes. 
When our legislation initially passed, we envisioned that enforcement against insurance carriers would be a State responsibility, since State insurance commissioners have traditionally been the regulators of health insurance. Federal regulation was the fallback only if States failed to act. Most States have passed implementing or conforming legislation and are enforcing the law. But there are a significant number of States that have not yet come into compliance. Four States have failed to pass implementing legislation and have no comparable State laws on the books. Many, many more have only implemented parts of the law. One of the States that has failed to act is California with more than 30 million people. 
The issue goes beyond the insurance performance standards included in the original Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. Congress has acted to expand the bill by passing the mental health parity requirements and a ban on drive-by deliveries. These provisions, too, will remain an empty promise if HCFA does not have the staff to enforce the law. 
In every State that has failed to act, in whole or in part, the responsibility for assuring compliance in responding to complaints and informing the public has fallen on the Health Care Financing Administration. But HCFA has just over 20 people working on this issue in its headquarters and a handful spread across the regions. 
The recent GAO report expressed concern that HCFA's current resources are inadequate to effectively enforce the bill. If this amendment passes and the supplemental request is denied, HCFA will have to wait for the completion of the regular budget process for next year. But consumers cannot afford to have HCFA wait a year or more to hire new staff. And because HCFA lacks the institutional expertise to deal with private insurance issues, it cannot simply transfer responsibilities to existing staff. The GAO report was a preliminary one. If anything, it only scratches the surface of insurance companies' attempts to evade or subvert the law. But even in the short time the law has been operative, it is clear that there is a substantial abuse by greedy insurance companies and more rigorous enforcement is needed to make the right granted by Kassebaum-Kennedy a reality. 
The GAO found that many companies were engaging in price gouging with premiums being charged to consumers exercising their rights to buy individual policies when they lost their job. They were charged as much as 600 percent above standard rates. These overcharges make a mockery of the right to purchase coverage. 
Other carriers continue to illegally impose preexisting condition exclusions. Still others, the GAO found, delayed the processing of enrollee applications beyond the 63-day window allowed by the law, leaving applicants high and dry. Other carriers illegally failed to disclose to consumers that they have a right to buy a policy. Some carriers refuse to pay commissions to agents who referred eligible individuals, and others told agents not to refer any eligibles for coverage. Other carriers put all the eligibles with health problems in a single insurance product, driving up the rates to unaffordable levels while selling regular policies to healthy eligibles. Without the staff increase requested in this bill, this situation will get worse--not better. 
The Senate should not be voting for a free ride for greedy insurance companies, and it should not be an accomplice in denying 
families the health benefits they were promised by unanimous votes just 2 years ago. 
The need for additional staff goes beyond enforcement. The GAO found wide gaps in consumer knowledge--gaps that prevented consumers from exercising their rights under the law. HHS wants to launch a vigorous effort to address this problem. But, according to the GAO, because of resource constraints the agency is unable to put much effort in consumer education. 
I understand that the assistant majority leader believes this isn't an emergency situation. This logic makes me wonder if he opposes the other nonemergency provisions in the bill. I can count some two dozen. 
For millions of Americans, the failure to enforce this legislation is an emergency. Every family who is illegally denied health insurance faces an emergency. Every child who goes without timely medical care because this bill is not enforced faces an emergency. Every family who is bankrupt by medical costs because this bill is not enforced faces an emergency. This may not be an emergency for an abusive insurance company, but it is an emergency for families all over this country. For some, it is literally a matter of life and death. 
The Senate should reject this amendment. We need to toughen the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill--not weaken its enforcement. This is a test of whether the Senate wants to protect greedy insurance companies that break the law or protect American families. 
Mr. President, I see my friend from Minnesota wants to address this issue and then I will have more to say with regard to the GAO report.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think it is worthwhile to get back to the real situation with regard to the implementation of this legislation. With all respect, my good friend from Oklahoma has failed to describe accurately the kind of crisis that is affecting so many families in this country and then differ with what the conclusions would be in terms of his amendment on that particular crisis. 
No. 1, there is an emergency. It is an emergency for individual families. The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill addressed the group-to-group issues, where you have large groups moving into other groups in terms of the State, where about 80 percent of those have insurance and have some preexisting condition. But it has significant problems with regard to groups going to individual policies in the State. That is basically what we are talking about. 
Let's get serious about understanding what the issue is and the kind of pain and anxiety that is taking place. Every Member of this body ought to understand and get ready, that if the Nickles amendment goes through, you had better put on three or four more people in your office to answer the phones, because that is what is going to happen, from individuals all across this country who are going to be facing many of these kinds of problems, such as gouging by some of the unscrupulous insurance companies that have raised the premiums to gouge American families some 600 percent. We are not addressing that particular issue today, although the administration has a proposal and I have a proposal. We didn't believe that was going to be a problem under the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. We said let the States do this, and the majority of the States have done it and have done it well with regard to the issues of pricing, but not all of them have. We ought to try and address that. We will do that but at a different time. 
What we are talking, Mr. President, with all due respect to my colleague, is many States, not just five. There are five States that have not passed State laws to address this issue, but there are many, many other States that have passed laws that are still out of compliance. The Senator does not recognize that. Just read in the GAO report, which I will. 
Let's think about what we have asked. I am not here to try to defend HCFA, although I will on this particular occasion. We have put a very heavy burden on HCFA. We put a heavy burden on HCFA to try to implement the changes in the Medicaid Program to provide the savings in the budget last year. 
We have put a heavy burden on HCFA to try to deal with the fraud and abuse issues with new rules and regulations as a result of the excellent hearings that were held by Senator Harkin, and that has broad bipartisan support. 
We put the burden on HHS and HCFA to implement the legislation dealing with children's health insurance last year--that is taking place all across the country--to work with States. I have attended those conferences. There are HCFA people there trying to work with the States to implement the program we passed last year. That is State implementation, and HCFA is working with those States--just to mention a few of the additional burdens we have put on them. 
We have put on them the drive-by deliveries to make sure the States are going to comply with the legislation that was initiated by Senator Bradley and others, a bipartisan effort, to make sure we are not going to have drive-by deliveries. 
Also, to implement the provisions of mental health that Senator Domenici and Senator Wellstone added to it, to make sure that the States--and many States have not--are going to be able to include the mental health programs that are being included in 
the existing programs. We had a serious debate on that. We made very, very important progress. We had bipartisan support. 
Mr. President, it is true this bill went into effect last January, but I think it was the height of responsibility that the chairman of our Human Resources Committee, Senator Jeffords, asked the GAO to do a review of the implementation of the bill to find out where the bugs were so we could try to address them before it deteriorated and became more serious. That is an important, responsible oversight function. And we got the report back on the result of the legislation, being implemented now for 2 months, but we have the warning signs out there. We have the recommendations, and we have a proposal that doesn't increase the burden on the American taxpayer. It is a transfer of funds, not an additional burden. It is a recognition by the agency that we need to get additional personnel who have a high degree of expertise and an understanding of the insurance problems. 
This is the first time HCFA has had to face the various issues on insurance. They have to go out and hire people. It isn't somebody you are bringing up to run the garage down at HCFA, it isn't that you can just hire and fire people at will. These are very specialized and important functions, and you need a considerable degree of skill and experience in order to make sure that they are going to be done right and well to protect the people. That is what we are talking about in this circumstance. There is no additional burden or weight in terms of expenditures for the taxpayers, but just the recognition within HCFA that this is a priority and we need these quality people to be able to do it. That is where we are at, Mr. President. 
Let me respond to the Senator from Oklahoma on this issue. And make no mistake about it, all of us have been around this place long enough to know that if you don't have the people in these various agencies, the phones just continue to ring. And the people who will be ringing are the people who have these preexisting conditions and disabilities--make no mistake about it. They are already stretched out, as far as the mind and eye can possibly see, and they will not be able to get any kind of responses. 
We have in this GAO report the recognition that if you have more than a 63-day gap in your coverage, you do not have an entitlement to get the insurance at the State level. We have testimony in the GAO report that many companies stretch out the period beyond the 63 days in order to effectively deny people from receiving what they otherwise would be entitled to. That is in the GAO report. We want to stop that. 
So, if you are going to vote for the Nickles amendment, be prepared to face a mother in your State or a father in your State who says, `I was strung out; I wasn't aware of the 63 days, and my insurance people dragged this thing out; I finally found out after 64 days that I should have gotten this proposal, and now I am denied. What am I going to do for my child?' 
This does not cost the taxpayers any more. We are responding to real needs, not needs that the Senators from Massachusetts or Minnesota are saying, but the General Accounting Office is saying and HCFA is saying. It is going to make a major difference to people who have these kinds of preexisting conditions and illnesses. 
Look at what the General Accounting Office has said: 
 preliminary data from an October 1997 NAIIC survey indicate that while most States have made progress in enacting statutes implementing key HIPAA provisions, many gaps remain. For example . . . in the individual market, eight States have not passed laws to implement guaranteed renewal. In the group markets, two States had not passed laws to implement small-group guarantee access, and four States had not passed laws to implement guarantee renewal and limits on preexisting condition exclusion periods in the large-group markets. In addition, these preliminary data do not include HIPAA's certificate insurance requirement, and anecdotal evidence suggests that many States have not incorporated this requirement into State statutes.  
There are not just the States that haven't passed the law, there are all of these kinds of problems. It is all spelled out. 
While States continue to pass legislation to close some of these gaps, the possibility remains that not all the provisions in all market segments will be addressed, necessitating an expansion of HHS's enforcement role. 
That is what the GAO understood, that is what the appropriators understood, that this has a higher priority. Here it is in the GAO report. 
Then it goes on in the report, saying: 
HHS resources will be further strained if the enforcement role it is serving in these five States becomes permanent or expands to other States. If HHS determines that other States have not passed one or more of the HIPAA provisions, as the preliminary data suggest, HHS will have to play a regulatory role in these additional States. 
Mr. President, Senator Kassebaum believed all the States should, and we want all the States to conform to this. But the fact of the matter is, we have the warning signs right out here in this GAO report. We have the suggestion in the emergency supplemental, and the reason that it is in there is because this is a real emergency for families that will not be able to get coverage as the law was intended and as the testimony indicated, individuals with preexisting conditions. 
I listened to the Senator talk about his conclusions on the GAO report. It was very interesting, but it was limited. He read part of one page but did not read the conclusion. 
It points out in the conclusion of the GAO report: 
Finally, two implementation difficulties are substantive and likely to persist unless measures are taken to address them. First, among the 13 Federal fallback States, some consumers are finding it difficult as a result of high premiums to obtain the group-to-individual guaranteed access coverage that HIPAA requires . . . Second, HHS's regulatory role could expand as the status of States' efforts to adopt and implement HIPAA provisions becomes clearer in 1998. HHS's current enforcement capabilities could be inadequate to handle the additional burden unless further resources become available. 
I do not know how much clearer that can be. We can say, Mr. President, `Well, we will just let it go and see what happens.' It is extraordinary to me--extraordinary to me--when we are putting at risk families that have, primarily, children or parents or other families who have preexisting conditions and disabilities, we are going to say on the floor of the U.S. Senate, `We are going to put you at risk'? It might get better; sure, there are one or two people in each State that can try and work it all out. We have been put on notice. It is the height of irresponsibility to fail to respond to that notice. This is not just shuffling papers around, this is not just a question of bureaucracy, this is a question of whether we are going to provide the protection for those families. That is the issue. 
We know what is happening, and families now--too many of them--are being gouged by the 500-, 600-percent increase in the premiums. We had hoped the States would address those. Many States have. The majority have. We are proud of them. But we know that some have not. What if you or someone you knew lived in that State, or family lived in that State, and you found out these games were being played? These games are being played. The GAO report points out in its study that, `Some carriers initially attempted to discourage the consumer from applying for products with guaranteed access rights. Some are charging premiums 140 to 600 percent of the standard rate.' 
What kind of a chance does a family have with a child with a preexisting condition to pay 600 percent more? It is gouging. 
This measure is trying to say, OK, let's implement the enforcement of these programs to the extent that we can protect the public. What is the point of passing a law on burglary and then saying we are not going to have any policemen to enforce it? That is what we are doing. 
We all celebrate the fact that we passed this law--bipartisan--passed the law. And then to take away the enforcement of it? What sense does that make? Particularly when it isn't costing any more. 
Now, Mr. President, as you go through this GAO report 
After the Federal fallback provisions took place on July 1, 1997, many consumers complained to State insurance regulators that carriers did not disclose the fact that a product with HIPAA guaranteed access rates existed, or, when consumers specifically requested one, they were told that the carrier did not have such a product available. One State regulator we visited said that some carriers told consumers HIPAA products were not available because the State had not yet approved them. However, the regulator had notified all carriers that such products were to be issued starting July 1997, regardless of whether the State had yet approved them. 
Here we have examples of various agents who are completely distorting and misrepresenting what the bill was all about. All we are saying is, let us have an opportunity to work with the States to make sure that these individuals and families are going to be protected. 
We have in the GAO report examples where agents are not demonstrating the options to eligible individuals. They say the policies are not available. We have allegations in this GAO report that some of the major insurance companies are docking the agents' fees if they sell these policies to people with preexisting conditions. That is happening today--today. And the Senator from Oklahoma says that we do not have a problem. We will just wait another year and get another GAO report. We have this now, here. This isn't just some document that was produced for the Senator from Massachusetts or any of the rest of us who are going to oppose the Nickles amendment. 
They talk in here about the confusion among consumers. And with the confusion among consumers, we find out that these parents are calling Members of the Senate or calling whoever they can to find out what the information is. There is one individual out in the State. The Senator says 24 individuals ought to be able to work this. We have one individual in northern California covering about 10 million people, responding to all of these questions, all of the kinds of questions that have come up. 
What did HHS say when it came and testified? We have had a hearing on this very measure in our Human Resources Committee, Mr. President. And what the HHS said is that they needed these resources because they wanted to go out and help educate consumers--who are the consumers? those with the preexisting conditions--about how this law works, if they have the protection or if they have not got the protection. And that was one of the things that they wanted to do. Because as a result of the GAO review that said there is confusion out there, they wanted to address this problem. But you are not going to be able to do that if the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma is accepted. They will not be able to reach out and educate because they will not have the resources to be able to do it. 
Mr. President, one of the really insidious aspects of this was the finding of the GAO report on the questions of the waiting period. They had an example. According to NAIIC, the National Association of the Independent Insurance Commissioners, some health plans have established waiting periods of up to a year during which certain conditions or procedures, such as organ transplants, are excluded from an enrollee's coverage. Requiring such waiting periods effectively excludes such preexisting conditions from coverage, and, according to regulators, it is contrary to the statutory intent to provide the portability of coverage. It is here in the GAO report. We can take--and I will take--time to go through this in greater detail. 
But the idea, Mr. President, that we have just five States that have not conformed, that they are going to do it, that the bill has just been put into effect and we have no problem out there, is a complete distortion and misrepresentation of an 
excellent GAO report that points out what is happening out on Main Street--what is happening out on Main Street--to the families with these preexisting conditions. Those with the disabilities are facing very high hurdles. They are facing those hurdles every single day. 
Finally, we have some opportunity to work out in a bipartisan way a bill that got votes of 100-0 and 98-0 for some relief for 25 million Americans who have some preexisting condition or disability. The GAO report flagged for us the need for some oversight as well as some of the real problems. Although the solution will not cost the taxpayer additional money, we are being told that we do not have to be concerned about this, that there really isn't such a need out there, that all of these problems are going to be easily resolved. That flies in the face of this excellent report, and we should not--we should not--accept it, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. I see other friends and colleagues who want to speak on this issue. I want to review just for a minute or two the provisions of the legislation. 
First of all, the GAO report came out January 25 and the request for the additional funds was made last Thursday. This was all done within a relatively short period of time. I am quite amazed they were able to get their act together to be able to make the assessment and to be able to review the various materials of the Appropriations Committee. The Appropriations Committee responded in finding offsets so we weren't going to increase the expenditures. These are basically offsets. 
Mr. President, this legislation was put in the form of a request to the States to conform. If the HCFA had been up here last year, the voices out here would say, `Well we haven't seen what the States are going to do. We believe the States will conform. We have to wait to see what has actually happened with the States before we know whether there is going to be conformity with this provision or not.' 
At the excellent request of our chairman of our Human Resources Committee, 2 months into the bill we get a report that says there are these kinds of problems and they need these kinds of solutions. Then we had the corresponding action to try to have the personnel to deal with this. That is really the history of this. 
I know the Senator from New Mexico has spent an enormous amount of time on the whole issues of mental health because he knows that issue is of particular importance. Although it was not illustrated in the central findings of the GAO, the Senator would know, based upon past experience, that it is always the lost child in any kind of discussion of health insurance policies. There will always be more complexities and difficulties dealing with that. That is just the history. The Senator knows this better than I, as well as the Senator from Minnesota. So if they are having these kinds of implementation problems now with the existing kind of statute, I think it is not unreasonable to think that we are going to have those kinds of problems on the issues of mental health. 
I am just mindful, Mr. President, and my friend from Oklahoma--Oklahoma has hired five more people in their insurance department in order to help implement this in its State. We are talking about a handful of people nationwide, at no additional cost, dealing with disability, our most vulnerable citizens. We are on notice. These are our most vulnerable citizens, those that have preexisting conditions and those that have disabilities, most of them children. We are going to be put on notice by the GAO, and through a nonadditional-dollar cost to the taxpayer, saying, no, we are not going to permit the agency that has the prime responsibility for enforcement to have the adequate personnel. 
That may carry the day here on the floor of the U.S. Senate, but I just hope that our colleagues who support that position--as I mentioned before, these parents are going to be calling all of our offices, and they are going to be calling the agency asking questions about what to do about their children.

Mr. KENNEDY. Well, the Senator is absolutely correct. We are on notice now. The decision was made--and I give great credit to Senator Kassebaum--that we were going to have State implementation of this. There were many of us on this side that believed that there would be danger, in terms of the escalation of insurance premiums, if we did not at least set some kind of parameters for the increase. We had testimony based on different models to indicate what the framework for that kind of an increase was. It was a decision that was made that we would defer and then have an examination of what the States would do. 
So we have now had a preliminary finding. In a few States, we have seen this dramatic escalation, a 600 percent increase in the premiums. But in many States, we find out all of these other kinds of enforcement problems, where we have had agents for various insurance companies that are being penalized if they include in their various programs children with disabilities or those individuals with some preexisting condition. They are penalized. Or, if individuals call up, they are given misinformation or disinformation about what their rights are. We have all of that illustrated in this GAO report. We have had it illustrated out there. 
Now, what the Appropriations Committee said is, OK, if we have this problem, we have read through this, we have a way of trying to make important progress in alleviating the anxiety of these families that are facing the most extraordinary kinds of pain and suffering that one can imagine when they have disabled children in these circumstances. I know that because the Senator from Rhode Island has a superb bill on the issues of pediatric patients' rights, the whole issue on children. The Senator has been a real leader here. I think he knows this issue well. Now we have a way of trying to address this issue and we have our colleagues--we are talking about the emergency supplemental, which is dealing with these major issues that comes up with an amendment to strike this $16 million. Now, as the Senator from New Mexico pointed out, $6 million is the most important of that $16 million because that will 
be for the actual implementation of the enforcement. The others, I think, are important, too. I think a case, perhaps, can be made if we are following a very strict interpretation--and that is another issue--a strict interpretation about whether we could not defer that, but certainly not with regard to the protection of those families.

Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is entitled to ask a question. He was asking whether the suggestion that because 45 States passed laws, does that mean that all 45 States are in conformity, which is a reasonable question since that has been the statement made on the floor. The answer to his question is that it is not a fair indication of the amount of implementation of this particular program, according to the GAO, because even though those States have passed laws, within those laws they fail to conform with a number of the other provisions in here. I have indicated those particular provisions. They are primarily targeted on the group-to-individual. As I pointed out, the record on this legislation with regard to group-to-group in the States has been good. As it should also be for group-to-individual policies. It was supposed to give the States the first crack. There were some general criteria established for moving ahead on that. That criteria has been spelled out. We can take some time to go through that criteria. But it has been spelled out in those areas. I have outlined some of those, and I will come back to those at a later time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator is absolutely correct about the hearing. We had the hearing, and we heard testimony from the General Accounting Office. I tried to get the transcript, which has not been printed up, because I think any fair presentation on the basis of the review of the transcript would support our position very clearly. 
Our position is that States were invited to pass the legislation that was going to conform with the various provisions of the legislation, and some 45 States have. Some States have not, 
and some States even at this time have indicated that they are not going to conform with the mental health various provisions. But even with the States that have filed legislation, a number of those States are out of compliance. That is illustrated in the GAO report. In the GAO report, as well as in the testimony of the individual who made that report--I think his name was Bill Scanlon--there was an excellent presentation, basically outlining the concerns that I have expressed here. I believe that my representation, having attended that hearing, is a fair summary of what his position is. 
Nonetheless, what we have, Mr. President--the bottom line is that as a result of careful oversight, we have a report on a bill that was just passed recently, some 20 months ago, going into effect in January of last year, reviewed by the General Accounting Office, some important abuses that have been outlined, and the effort by the Appropriations Committee--correctly I think--to try to address those abuses. And now we have an amendment that will effectively make it much more difficult to protect those individuals that have disabilities. 
I have been around here long enough to know the problems that we have been facing in order to strike down the barriers of discrimination on the basis of disability. We have had a difficult time, and it is interesting that we have only in recent years passed the Americans With Disabilities Act. It took a long time. This country has been reluctant to bring those that have been facing physical and mental challenges into the bright sunshine of fair treatment. So it doesn't surprise me that we are out here on the floor of the U.S. Senate battling for those who have disabilities and preexisting conditions once again. It doesn't surprise me all that much. But that is what we are doing. You make a step forward and you have a step that goes back. We have been around here long enough and we have seen that, unless you are going to provide a remedy, a right that you provide is not an awful lot. 
We passed the 1968 Fair Housing Act to try to eliminate discrimination on the basis of race in housing. It didn't mean a darn thing. A remedy wasn't out there. We passed the 1987 Fair Housing Act that had remedies in it and enforcement provisions in it. Now we need to have enforcement protections in here for those who have disabilities. 
It isn't costing the taxpayer an additional dollar. We are basing it not on just our own kind of assessment, but on an independent study by the General Accounting Office on a supplemental. Now, I know the good Senator, my friend from Alaska, wants to get on with this issue. We are not the ones who raised this issue. This was just a small housekeeping provision about setting some different priorities in HCFA, setting some different priorities. But it is more than a housekeeping provision to those families that are going to be affected. 
We are not going silently into the night on it. We don't want to be labeled as holding up the supplemental on this issue because we are contesting something that isn't going to cost the taxpayer another dollar, on which the Appropriations Committee itself made a decision and a judgment that it ought to go ahead. This is about protecting families that have disabilities--mental disabilities, physical disabilities, and preexisting conditions. We are standing here to protect those individuals, and we have the GAO report that says we should. 
So, Mr. President, this is a very important kind of question that we are faced with here. I think it takes some time. Some came in last evening when it was offered. We have only had a brief time to sort of talk about this issue, but there is more that ought to be said about it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join Senator Jeffords and Senator Harkin in introducing the Work Incentives Improvement Act to provide more affordable and accessible health care for persons with disabilities so they can work and live independently. 
Despite the extraordinary growth and prosperity the country is enjoying today, persons with disabilities continue to struggle to live independently and become fully contributing members of their communities. We know that of the 54 million disabled people in this country, may have the capacity to work and become productive citizens, but they are unable to do so because of the unnecessary barriers they face. 
We have made progress through a special education system committed to excellence in learning, and through a rehabilitation system designed to promote independent living skills. Too often, however, the goals of independence are still out of reach. Too often, disabled people are afraid that if they take jobs they will lose the medical coverage that makes such a large difference in their lives. Too often, disabled people are afraid of losing their current cash benefits if the salary they earn at work is too large. We need to do more so that the benefits of our prosperous economy are truly available to all Americans, including our fellow citizens with disabilities. We need to ensure that all disabled children and adults have access to the benefits and supports they need to achieve their full potential as American citizens. 
Our long term goal is to restructure and improve existing disability programs so that they do more to encourage and support a disabled person's dream to work and live independently. That goal should be the birthright of all Americans--and when we say all, we mean all. 
This bipartisan work incentive legislation will help us to remove the unfair barriers facing persons with disabilities who want to work. It will make health insurance coverage more widely available, through opportunities to buy-in to Medicare and Medicaid at an affordable rate. Social Security will be able to fund demonstration projects that gradually phase out the loss of cash benefits, instead of the arbitrary sudden cutoff that so many disabled workers face today. 
Our goal is to create fair and realistic new assistance that offers greater support for disabled persons who want to work, live independently, and be productive and contributing members of their community. This bill is the right thing to do, and it is the cost effective thing to do. For too long, our fellow disabled citizens have been left out and left behind. 
I commend Senator Jeffords and Senator Harkin for their impressive leadership on this issue. We look forward to working with all members of Congress to help give disabled persons across the country a better opportunity to fulfill their dreams and fully participate in the social and economic mainstream of our nation.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just take a few moments of time to revisit the proposal of the Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, to strike the funding that would be available under this legislation to implement the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill. According to GAO that legislation benefited some 25 million Americans who change or lose their job every year and could face preexisting condition exclusions or denial of coverage. That legislation passed 100-0 in the Senate; the conference report passed 98 to 0. 
We know there are gaps in terms of the implementation for providing these critical protections to those in the disability community and really for any American who has a condition that could make it difficult for them to get or keep insurance. HCFA asked the Appropriations Committee to reallocate resources to give them the ability to hire the necessary skilled staff, primarily with expertise in the insurance business, who would be able to assist them to carry forward these protections for the disabled community, the mental health community, and for all Americans. That is very, very important, Mr. President. We had some debate and discussion about this earlier today. 
At this time, I want to read into the Record a very fine letter from Nancy-Ann Min DeParle, who is the head of HCFA. She writes: 
Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing to request your assistance in securing funding for HCFA to implement the insurance reform provisions of HIPAA. The $6 billion and 65 FTEs that we have requested for this purpose will allow us to implement the HIPAA provisions as well as those enacted subsequently in the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act and the Mental Health Parity Act in those states that have not fully implemented HIPAA. As you know, currently, 5 states are not implementing HIPAA. HCFA is requesting these resources to guarantee these protections to the 54 million people--or one in five Americans--that live in these five states where under HIPAA, HCFA is the backup federal enforcement agency. 
Moreover, we understand that as many as 30 states may not have standards that comply with the Mental Health Parity Act and as many as 10 states may not have standards that comply with the Newborns' and Mothers' Health Protection Act. We don't have precise numbers because states are not required to notify HCFA about their intentions to implement these two laws. In addition, we believe that many states may not have implemented other parts of HIPAA. For example, some states have not implemented guaranteed availability in the group market or certificates of creditable coverage. Moreover, HCFA also has enforcement authority over non-Federal governmental plans.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will also have printed in the Record the various letters that support our position in opposition to the Nickles amendment: 
Families USA hopes that the Nickles amendment will be defeated; 
The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, more than 20 different organizations that have been in the vanguard of protecting and advancing the cause of those disabled Americans. They are in strong opposition to the Nickles amendment; 
The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill is in strong opposition to the Nickles amendment. 
These are only some of the organizations, but they represent the leading organizations that have over the past years been the most involved and active in protecting the rights of the disabled and of consumers--all in opposition to the Nickles amendment. We are not talking about adding more money. We are talking about reprogramming existing money.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is the exact quote: 
Moreover, in enacting HIPAA, Congress may not have anticipated that certain States would choose not to implement and enforce its provisions and would instead place that responsibility in the hands of the federal government. This is now the situation in Missouri, Rhode Island and California. The Federal Government has new and significant responsibilities to protect consumers in these States. Fulfilling these responsibilities will require significant Federal resources. 
This is not HCFA, this is not the Senator from Massachusetts. These are the commissioners of the States that have indicated that HCFA would need additional funding to make sure that the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation to protect portability for those individuals who have preexisting conditions would be implemented. 
Wisely, the chairman of our committee asked the GAO to do a report on how this program was going. The GAO report made the recommendations which the Appropriations Committee has followed in terms of the allocation of resources. It is only $16 million, Mr. President--and the most important aspect of that provision is the $6 million which HCFA has related to the enforcement provisions. The others, I think, are desirable to make the program of Administration proceed more efficiently, effectively. We are going to be faced tomorrow, or at least sometime, with the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma to effectively wipe out that Federal enforcement. 
Mr. President, I think that is unacceptable. That is unacceptable. 
I have in my hand--and I will get into this more tomorrow--but the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, as of December 3, 1997, indicated that 30 States have failed to implement the mental health provisions. Thirty States as of December have failed to implement the mental health protections. 
We were arguing out here, debating whether they had, and Senator Nickles said, `Oh, they have implemented.' We have the GAO report and through the afternoon we have been able to come up with this information, Mr. President. 
What about the maternity provisions? Remember we had the drive-by deliveries just a few years ago where expectant mothers were in the hospital for 24 hours and then out the door they went and the tragedies that ensued. We took action in order to protect those mothers. 
Through the legislative process, that became a part of the HIPAA program. We find out that, with regard to the States that have not enacted the provisions in terms of protecting mothers, eight States have not provided those protections--eight States. Eight States have not done that. 
We were all around here at the time, Republicans and Democrats alike, commending ourselves about how we enforced that and protected the mothers, and we have this. The list goes on. We will have more of a chance to go into this in greater detail on the morrow. 
But I hope that our colleagues will at least take the time to review the excellent letters that have been sent to them this afternoon that indicate strong opposition to the Nickles amendment by the leaders in the mental health community, in the disability community, as well as in other groups that are most affected. We will have others to refer to tomorrow, Mr. President. 
I hope that we will, if we are serious about this issue--and I believe that we are--at least give the opportunity for the enforcement of these rights and protecting these families from the kinds of discrimination which has taken place. 
I will go through tomorrow again briefly some of these stories, real life stories with real life families that had some tragic experiences that motivated us into making this change with Senator Kassebaum. I will go through those tomorrow, Mr. President. We were trying to remedy the kinds of harsh experiences that took place and devastatingly wiped out different families. I will have an opportunity to go through them in some detail on tomorrow. 
So, Mr. President, we are looking forward to the continued debate on this issue. This is a very, very important matter. We are not going to take it lightly. We are all in favor of moving this legislation forward and having a final conclusion, but not with this unacceptable amendment that would break the promise we have made to millions of American families. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I opposed the amendment by the Senator from Missouri. The so-called `Family Friendly Workplace Act' is anything but family-friendly. It is anti-worker and anti-family, and it should not take time away from this emergency appropriations bill. 
The amendment was offered three times in the last session, and each time, my colleagues on the other side failed to invoke cloture. The reason is clear: the `Family-Friendly Workplace Act' has an appealing title, but appalling substance. It will never become law--nor should it. 
This amendment was offered last June while we were debating another necessary appropriations bill. That bill provided billions of dollars of relief to Americans in the Midwest, who were suffering the devastating effects of floods. Yet my colleagues on the other side insisted on delaying that emergency legislation, so they could offer this amendment. 
On this side of the aisle, we stood up to the opposition. We said `no.' We said that Americans in the Dakotas and Minnesota desperately needed help. They needed assistance to recover their homes, their property and their lives. We defeated the opposition's efforts to jam this bill through the Senate. 
Each time the legislation was offered, we defeated it. Finally, last June, the bill's supporters withdrew. We thought we had seen the last of this regressive legislation. 
But no, here we go again. Another essential appropriations measure is on the floor, and what do my friends on the other side do? They return to this anti-worker, anti-family amendment. 
We won't let it happen this time, any more than we did last June. 
Before I discuss the fatal flaws in this legislation, let me make one additional point. For the past ten days, the Senate has been trying to consider an education bill. Throughout that period, the Majority Leader has insisted that only amendments `germane' to the bill should be discussed. He refuses to allow those on this side to discuss amendments addressing the nation's crumbling public schools. He won't allow debate on amendments dealing with reducing class size. And he blocks discussion of amendments meant to encourage more college graduates to become teachers. 
Somehow, these education amendments aren't important enough to warrant consideration on the floor of the Senate. The Majority will not allow full and fair debate on these significant policy issues. 
But there is a double standard at work. The appropriations measure currently before us is an emergency measure. It provides essential support to our troops in Bosnia and other troubled areas of the world. And, it gives emergency relief to families devastated by tornadoes, floods and ice storms, from Maine to Florida to California. 
Apparently the Majority Leader is prepared to delay this emergency appropriations bill with a totally unrelated amendment. 
The inconsistency is obvious. The Majority will not permit debate on important education amendments, because they do not want to delay tax breaks to families who can afford to send their children to private school. But when it comes to postponing essential financial help to American soldiers overseas, and American families at home suffering from disastrous weather conditions--that is acceptable to my Republican friends. Those on the other side of the aisle may find this approach satisfactory, but those on this side couldn't disagree more. 
Now, I'd like to offer a few words on the substance of the amendment. Just a brief review demonstrates why it is unacceptable, and why it will never become law. 
First, the amendment is a pay cut for 65 million American workers. The so-called `biweekly work schedule' lets employers schedule workers for 60, 70, even 80 hours in a single week. Employers pay every hour at the employee's regular rate, as long as the total number of hours worked in a two-week period does not exceed 80. Under current law, every hour worked over 40 must be paid at time-and-a-half. This proposal would abolish that guarantee. 
Second, the amendment cuts benefits. In many industries, health and retirement benefits are based on the number of hours that employees worked. But the amendment does not guarantee that `comp time' or `flexible credit hours' must be considered `hours worked' for these important purposes. The result could be lower pensions and fewer health benefits. This does not help working families. 
The amendment does not even assure employees an increase in time off. If an employee takes 8 hours of comp time on a Monday in order to spend time with her family, the employer is free to force the employee to work on Saturday to make up for the lost time. The employer does not even have to pay time-and-a-half for the hours worked on Saturday. The comp time hours used on Monday do not count toward the 40-hour week. This does not help working families. 
Despite supporters' claims, this provision does not move the Fair Labor Standards Act into the 21st century. Instead, it turns back the clock, and makes it harder for workers to juggle the obligations of their job with the demands of their family. 
Third, the proposal abolishes the 40-hour week. That protection has been basic to employee-employer relations for nearly 60 years. Yet the Republicans want to return to the days when employees could be forced to work from sunup to sundown, day after day. This does not help modern working families juggle their obligations at home and at work. 
Finally, the amendment does not guarantee employee choice. The employer chooses who works overtime and when an employee can use accrued comp time. The employer is free to assign all the overtime work to employees who will accept comp time. Those employees who need the money the most, who can't afford to take time off, would be hurt the most. Their paychecks would be smaller. This is discrimination, and it is wrong--but the proposal does nothing to prevent it. 
And nothing in the proposal guarantees that workers can take time off when they want to or need to. The proposal does not guarantee any worker the right to use compensatory time under any circumstances. Even if the employee has a legal right under the Family and Medical Leave Act to take time off, the amendment does not give the employee the right to use earned compensatory hours for that purpose. 
This amendment is a cruel hoax. It does not help working men, it does not help working women, and it does not help working families. 
Many organizations that have historically struggled for the rights of working women and their families recognize the fatal flaws in this proposal. 9 to 5, the National Association of Working Women; the American Nurses Association; the Business and Professional Women; the National Council of Jewish Women; the National Women's Law Center; the Women's Legal Defense Fund; the League of Women Voters; the American Association of University Women--the list goes on and on. 
These organizations have fought for years to improve working women's lives on the job and in the home. They have supported affordable and high-quality child care. They have supported a living wage on the job. They were in the forefront of the battle to achieve Family and Medical Leave. From pay equity to pension equity to equal opportunity at home and at work, these organizations and others like them have worked tirelessly with and for working women. 
Yet these groups uniformly oppose this proposal. Last spring they sent a letter to Senators Lott and Daschle, expressing their belief that the bill `fails to offer real flexibility to the working women it purports to help while offering a substantial windfall to employers.' 
These organizations understand that working women may want more time with their families, but they cannot afford to give up overtime pay. As the letter to Senators Lott and Daschle explained, `Women want flexibility in the workplace, but not at the risk of jeopardizing their overtime pay or the well-established 40-hour work week.' 
Democrats in Congress understand these concerns, and we are prepared to honor them. Unfortunately, this legislation either ignores these problems or makes them worse. 
This is a bad bill, and the President has rightly promised to veto it should it ever reach his desk. But it should never leave the Senate. 
The Senate was right to reject this proposal last year, and we would have done so again today.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have just a question of the floor manager. I have no amendments. I am quite prepared to vote at any time on this particular measure. I am just wondering if we are going to have any time prior to the 5:30 vote so we could discuss the Coverdell amendment. I want to accommodate the floor manager. I don't want to interrupt the orderly procedure. It is 9:40 now. I note we do have an issue before the Senate which is not directly related to the supplemental which will be taking up some time. So I am just wondering if there is any time that is preferable to the Senator, or whether there might be a designated period of time before a vote on the legislation of Senator Coverdell, and maybe those that oppose it--not a lengthy time, but maybe there is a time that we could address it prior to 5 or 5:30 that would be convenient?

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I want to just commend our leader and friend for his response to the proposal. As I understand his position, it is that we would like at least an opportunity to offer and vote on amendments on the important issues that have been introduced by the President of the United States such as increased support for early childhood education, smaller class size, more teachers, after-school programs, and education opportunity zones. Would he think it is appropriate, if we are dealing with an education proposal, that at least he be given, or those ideas be given, an opportunity for debate and discussion here on the floor of the U.S. Senate? 
Would I be correct in thinking that at least those proposals ought to be among the ones being advanced by our Republican friends, which targets public tax dollars to private schools rather than, as the President's does, to the public schools? Am I right?

Mr. KENNEDY. Does the Senator, finally, really understand what our Republican leadership or Republican friends are really afraid of? Are they afraid to debate these issues? 
Is it just a question of working out a time agreement to discuss these matters fully and openly, or they afraid that their proposal won't measure up?

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, according to a recent study by sociologists at Michigan State University, and Princeton University, one of the great contributions of immigrants to America, in addition to their own skills and hard work, is the values they instill in their children--respect for hard work, doing well in school, succeeding against the odds, loving their families and their cultures, and an abiding belief that the United States is the best country in the world. 
Contrary to many of the myths about immigrants, this study concludes that the vast majority of immigrant children learn English. Nine out of 10 speak their native languages at home, but 88 percent preferred English by the time they completed high school. 
This study is also significant because it does not gloss over the challenges that many immigrant families face along the way. The study reminds us that immigrant children struggle against discrimination and anti-immigrant attitudes and policies. The study found that as a result of attacks on immigrants in public policy in recent years, children of immigrants were less likely to regard themselves as `Americans' and more likely to regard themselves as members of their ethnic groups. This kind of polarization could have profound consequences for our society in the future, and we need to be vigilant against it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I know that we are debating very important issues on the supplemental appropriations bill. But I would like to take a few moments this afternoon to address another important issue, the Coverdell bill. There is a very important question we must all ask. Will Congress support public education or abandon it? I believe the vote tomorrow, and the debate going through next week on the Budget Resolution, may very well be the most important days that we will have to talk about the issue of education in this Congress. I would like to outline the challenges we face in the nation's public schools. May I yield myself 5 minutes? Can I do that; if the chair will let me know?

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we ought to understand exactly where we are as a nation and measure the proposal that we will be voting on tomorrow against our particular national needs. I think that is a fair way of making the decision whether we ought to eliminate any opportunity for additional debate and discussion on the question of support for public education across the country. No one is questioning whether the Coverdell bill will make a substantial contribution to private education. But if you are going to spend $1.6 billion, which is the amount of money that will be lost from the Federal budget under the Coverdell bill, we ought to know whether the money we spend will benefit the majority of the children in this country? Does this proposal abandon our support for public education, where about 48 million--90 percent--of our children are educated? 
This year, K-12 enrollment has reached an all-time high and will grow by 4 million students over the next 7 years across this country. Second, 6,000 new public schools will be needed by the year 2006 just to maintain the current class size--6,000 new schools by the year 2006. Due to overcrowding, schools are using trailers for classrooms, teaching students in former hallways, closets and bathrooms. Overcrowded classrooms undermine discipline and decrease the students' morale. America's children are learning in overcrowded classrooms. These are the undisputed facts on the condition of education in the United States of America. 
This chart is called `America's Children Are Learning In Crumbling Schools.' Madam President, 14 million children learn in substandard schools; 7 million children attend schools with asbestos, lead paint or radon in the ceilings or walls; 12 million children go to school under leaky roofs; one-third of American children study in classrooms without enough panel outlets and electrical wiring to accommodate computers and for multimedia equipment. 
These are the conditions today and these are the expectations of tomorrow. We are going to be faced with a Republican education program that says we will answer this national challenge with a $1.6 billion tax break for wealthy individuals. I call it an entitlement. I want to hear our friends who are always talking about entitlements address that issue, because this is an entitlement. Once the proposal goes into effect, anyone who is qualified is going to get a tax break every year--that's an entitlement in my book. It's an entitlement for the wealthy who send their children to private school. 
Should we have a good chance to debate different public policy alternatives to the Coverdell bill that is offered on behalf of the Republicans? We would welcome that debate. We do not fear that debate; we welcome it. We think the country would welcome it. We have our ideas. The President has his ideas. The President, in his State of the Union and in his speech on education, has outlined some very important measures--school construction and modernization, smaller class size, better trained teachers, increase in the number of qualified teachers, after-school programs, and expansion of the Head Start programs. Those are out there. These crucial programs are paid for in the President's budget. 
How did the Budget Committee address these issues? Thumbs down on all of those programs. Not only thumbs down on those programs, but reducing aid for education by $1.6 billion on existing programs below the President's level. We have not had that debate here. And we are being asked now to provide a new entitlement for the wealthier individuals who are sending their children to the private schools--not the public schools; to the private schools. That is what we are being asked to do. 
So let's get out and debate this issue. But, no; we are facing a cloture motion that says we are going to be absolutely denied the opportunity for considering alternatives. That is wrong. But it is something that American parents ought to understand, that this is basically an ill-conceived program that is abandoning the public schools in order to get additional tax entitlements and tax breaks for tuition for children to go to private schools. We do not have anything against the private schools, but with the scarce resources that are available, they ought to be carefully invested in the public schools. We should not be creating more tax breaks for the wealthy individuals. We should not be abandoning the public schools of this country. We ought to be responding to their particular needs. 
Mr. President, I believe my 5 minutes is up, and I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. As you know, the Budget Committee approved $30 billion in tax breaks--$30 billion. So, on the one hand, Republicans cut back education funding $1.6 billion below the President's program, and then spend $1.6 billion to create a $37 tax break for individuals that send their children to private school. Then they have the gall to come out here to say that Coverdell is the answer to the problems in education. Instead, the Coverdell bill is another Republican effort to abandon the public schools. 
I wonder, if the Senator will yield for another moment, I would like to just mention David Rosborough and ask my colleague whether this is the kind of situation that is troubling the Senator. 
Hi, my name is David Rosborough and I am a junior at Centerville High School in Clifton, Virginia. My school is extremely overcrowded, having well over 2600 students in a school that holds 2000, and whose optimal size is 1800. As a result of this, we have 32 makeshift trailers as classrooms this year and will have a total of 40 next year. Nearly 1000 students are in these trailers at any one time, and we have been forced to go to a complicated `double master' schedule. This new schedule which divides the school in two, is a great idea, and makes it so that class changes are staggered, however also created many new problems. Lunch periods begin at 10:00 a.m. and don't end until well after 1:00 p.m. 
This bill-- 
He was talking about the President's bill-- will put an end to ridiculous situations, like that of my school. 
The tremendous size of the school has caused inconveniences and problems, some minor, like the assembly situation. Right now, a simple music assembly will have to run three or four different times throughout the day, creating scheduling problems and keeping students out of class for unnecessarily long periods of time. 
Some problems are a lot more significant. `Hall rage' -- 
I never heard of that word before; `hall rage' are the words that this young student, a junior, uses-- 
`Hall rage' as our principal calls it, is one of them. Last year, before the new schedule was implemented, there was a huge outbreak of fights, many caused by frustration of being knocked around in the overflowing halls. Teachers found it much harder to teach with the distraction of `hall rage,' causing students to have difficulty focusing on class work with all the chaos outside. Teachers very rarely even get to teach in the same classroom all day, and some move between three and four classrooms. 
The new schedule at our school has solved some of these problems, but many still remain, and the school's size keeps on mushrooming. The `double master' schedule has caused many conflicts which limit the courses available to students. Hopefully this bill will pass-- 
Talking about the President's bill-- and bring . . . long-term relief to my school as well as many others like it. 
This is not the inner-city; this is in the suburbs. School repair, modernization, and expansion problems affect every community--urban, rural, or suburban. 
I ask the Senator from Connecticut, will the Coverdell legislation do anything about the kind of problems that this student is talking about; that would shock any parent?

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's Friday noontime, and I want to make clear that the eyes of the Nation are going to be on the Senate of the United States next Tuesday when we will vote on a proposal that will provide a $1.6 billion tax cut that will mostly benefit the wealthy individuals who send their children to private school. That is $1.6 billion that could be used to support our public school system. 
I think it's important for the Nation that parents review what has happened in the U.S. Senate over the last few days. Some very important decisions have been made by the Budget Committee. They have decided how to allocate the nation's scarce federal resources--and education doesn't get its fair share. And, next week, we will be voting on this $1.6 billion tax break that will primarily benefit the private schools. 
I take issue with those who believe we ought to support the Budget Committee's decision to cut $1.6 billion from education. We should not abandon the public schools in this country. No challenge we face as a Nation is more important than strengthening the academic achievement and accomplishment of the young people in this country--the 48 million young people who attend the public schools in this country every single day. 
On the one hand, Republicans want to use $1.6 billion to support for tax breaks to help private schools. And, at the same time, our Republican friends on the Budget Committee cut federal education funding by $400 million from last year, and $1.6 billion below the President's level. Those who are making the speeches about the importance of public schools, if they stand behind the public school system, are going to have to answer the questions why they continue to cut crucial support for education. 
Now, look at what the Budget Committee provided in this past week. We will have the chance to debate the budget when it comes up here in the next several days. But let's look at where our Republican friends place their priorities and what they said about public education. They cut $1.6 billion below President Clinton's budget on public education. Now, money is not always the final indicator about what is a good program or what is a bad program; we recognize that. But it is a pretty good indication about where a nation's priorities are. If we go out and start to cut, as the Budget Committee did this past week, $1.6 billion in discretionary assistance for the public schools, we know that education is not a national priority. 
That means that they cut education and Head Start funding by $1 billion below the level needed just to maintain the current services. In order for communities to be able to continue to serve the current number of children in Head Start, you would need an additional $1 billion just to meet inflation. Right now, we provide enough funding in Head Start to serve about 40 percent of all the children that are eligible. But now some of those children currently in Head Start programs won't get the help the need. 
Now, the Head Start Program doesn't solve all of our problems in early education. But what is undeniable is the importance of early intervention with children. What we have seen with the various Carnegie Commission reports, and the other reports, is that the earlier the intervention, the more confidence young children will have. The Head Start Program is a tried and tested program. If a chid gets help in the Head Start Program, they are more likely to succeed in school and as adults. All you have to do is look at the Ypsilanti programs, the Beethoven project, and various other studies that have been done, and they show what the importance is in terms of early intervention. This Republican budget cuts $1 billion out of that Head Start Program and other important 
education programs. It also cuts funding for the education programs $400 million below even last year. It prohibits funding for any of the new programs. 
So we are having a reduction of $1.6 billion in discretionary funding for education, which includes cuts in the Head Start Program. That Head Start Program has had bipartisan support. President Bush increased it $300 million or $400 million a year. We ran into problems during that period of time that we weren't giving sufficient support and help for those teachers that were involved in those programs. And some of the quality issues were important to address, but we addressed them in a bipartisan way. We also indicated in the reauthorization of the Head Start Program some special funding for the earliest interventions, going down to 3-year-olds and 2-year-olds. That was very important. But this Budget Committee says no to those programs, no to even those that are in those programs, by cutting back funding. 
The President of the United States is working hard to address the challenges that we are facing out in our public schools, particularly that we are going to need additional teachers in our schools and we need to rebuild the nation's school buildings. Because of enrollments rising and massive teachers retirements, we are going to need 100,000 new teachers. The President has committed enough funding for 100,000 new teachers in his budget to reduce class sizes in the early grades. The President of the United States said, let's try a smaller class size for the early years, when the children are just beginning their education experience and they need more individual attention. But, the Republican Budget Committee has said no to the 100,000 new teachers and no to smaller class sizes. 
Then the President of the United States introduced a plan to help disadvantaged communities--urban or rural--improve failing schools. A number of communities across this country, such as Chicago and my own city of Boston, are making dramatic improvements in educational opportunities for children. The President's program for creating educational opportunity zones is one of the most important investments we can make to get quick help for tough reform in these needy communities. 
The President has proposed help for local communities that are going to take some dramatic steps to try to enhance academic achievement. He calls them `education opportunity zones.' We have the record on these, where these are being tried across the country to try to provide additional help and support for those teachers. That program won't be given a chance to get off the ground. There won't be a nickel for that program that was advanced by the President of the United States. 
Senator Moseley-Braun has introduced a very important program to modernize and rebuild the nation's schools. That is very important in every community in this country--whether you have to address overcrowded or crumbling schools. I believe that my own State has the second oldest schools in this country. We find that on a cold day where the temperature goes down to 20 degrees in Boston that 10 or 15 schools in Boston are effectively closed because of poor heating systems. Those children have to stay home. We are talking about a very modest program that will bring $22 billion in bonding authority to the states interest-free. Senator Carol Moseley-Braun has been fighting for that day in and day out. 
But, the Republicans refuse to make a strong investment in rebuilding the nation's schools. 
There is no funding for the High Hopes School College Partnership Program to help young people from disadvantaged communities reach their dream of going to college. 
There is no increase in the Title I funding to improve students achievement in math and reading. 
What has to happen before Republicans will stop the attack on public education? The Third International Math and Science Study was just released that shows our students aren't measuring up. We have had hours and days of discussion, and volumes of reports, that talk about the importance of early intervention programs, and the importance of programs that provide extra help in areas of math reading, and science. The Title I program for needy children has made a tremendous difference in the reading and math skills of young people. We have been reminded as a nation about the importance of furthering our efforts in math and science. And yet, Title I and other important programs will not get an increase. 
The Republican budget won't even allow for an increase in Pell grants that are so crucial to helping needy college students afford to go to college. About 80 percent of the children in the highest income bracket finish college, but only about 8 percent of students in the lowest 25 percent finish college. Many of those students cannot afford to finish. But the Republicans won't help more needy students get the assistance they need. 
I can remember not long ago, at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, their tuition used to be $1,100. They raised it to $1,200, and they lost 10 percent of all their applicants--$100. What is the profile of those students? Eighty-five percent of those students' parents never went to college, and 85 percent of them are working 25 hours a week, or more. One hundred dollars makes a major difference. A modest increase in the Pell grants, even an increase of $300, is a lifeline to those young people so that they can finish college and get good jobs. 
All of these programs that the Republicans have rejected or frozen are paid for in the President's budget. They are paid for. But, nonetheless, we see that the Budget Committee said no --no to each one of the President's programs to try to strengthen education. Then we are faced with billions of dollars of cuts from the President's levels. And at the same time, the Republican program provides a tax break for the wealthiest individuals in this country. And for what? To help improve public education? No! To subsidize the private school tuition they already pay. 
If that makes sense, then my colleagues should vote for cloture next week. But every parent in this country ought to know what is happening on education, and every parent ought to know that we are being closed down from any opportunity to debate this issue--the most important debate we are going to be facing. It is Friday afternoon. We are going to have a little time to speak here on Friday afternoon, and a only little time before the cloture vote on Tuesday. Education is a key issue and it deserves a long debate. And, it deserves the discussion of other ideas, not just one way. 
Mr. President, I can't believe that as an institution and as 
representatives of the people we constantly talk about education but our first order of business in education is to provide a tax break of $1.6 billion that does nothing to improve public schools. This is their education program: nothing to strengthen teachers; nothing to reduce class size; nothing to modernize and rebuild schools; nothing to expand after-school programs; cutting back on the Head Start Program that provides skills for children to go into the public school system. They say that this is their answer to their education. And we are being denied the opportunity to debate it. 
Mr. President, I think this is really the kind of irresponsible approach on education that really does an enormous disservice to the parents in this country. We should improve our public schools, not abandon them. 
I see my good friend from Connecticut on the floor who serves on the Labor and Human Resources Committee that governs education issues, and who has been tireless in advancing the cause of education. I am wonder if he is not as perplexed by the allocation of this $1.6 billion. As I understand, the Joint Tax Committee has stated that the bill spends $1.6 billion to allocate to private schools. Of the 35.4 million public school families, only 30 percent would be able to use this IRA. And those public school families would only get an average benefit of $7--$7 per family. Of the 2.9 million who send their children to private schools, 83 percent will be able to use it. And the private school families will get an average benefit of $37. 
I am just wondering if he is not as perplexed by that whole approach and that whole program--and the allocations of the benefits of this program--and whether he would agree with me that this really is a sham. When we talk about trying to strengthen academic achievement, academic accomplishment, and investment in the young people of this country in our public school system, is this what we should accept?

Mr. KENNEDY. I must say that the Senator makes a powerful case. We urge those who are watching to write to their Members of the Senate. The vote is on Tuesday. Get busy and let them know that they shouldn't be voting to cut off this debate on how to support public education. We are just trying to have this debate and offer amendments on our own ideas. 
I firmly believe that we should be building schools and not be building new tax shelters for the wealthy. We should be reducing the class size and not reducing aid to public schools. 
But I will ask the Senator one final question on this: Does the Senator also find it extraordinary that just this past week the Budget Committee--on a party line vote--have passed a Republican budget that will cut $1.6 billion in education funding below the President's budget, to cut $1 billion below current services for education and Head Start, and to provide no funds for new teachers, smaller classrooms, or for safer, more modern school buildings? Does the Senator agree with me that last week our Republican friends cut $1.6 billion from education programs that are tried and tested and proven to be effective and helpful, and then came to the floor of U.S. Senate and said that they are really the friends of public education because the Coverdell bill to provide tax breaks to the wealthy will solve the problems in public education? Is he troubled by this juxtaposition where one day they are cutting the heart out of the public school budget and then coming onto the floor and emphasizing that their goal is to help public schools? The problem is that they can't answer the question that the money is going to private schools. And the bottom line is that if they get cloture, does the Senator agree with me that we would be seeing a significant reduction in our national commitment to the public schools of this country, if we continue to support the Coverdell bill and permit these cuts to go ahead?

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to reject cloture on this bill. Improving education can and must be a top priority for Congress and the nation. But this Republican bill flunks the test. They call it their `A+' bill, but it's anti-education. It deserves an `F.' 
It is the nation's public schools that need help. So what do our Republican friends do? They propose legislation to aid private schools. That makes no sense at all. Our goal is to strengthen public schools, not abandon them. 
Incredibly, the Republican strategy on the Budget Committee is more of the same. The Republican plan does not provide for key investments to improve public education. It does not provide help to reduce class size. In fact, the Republican plan proposes a cut of $400 million--$400 million--in the budget category for education next year. If that anti-education plan is passed, schools and students will get even less help next year than they are getting this year, just when they need help the most. 
It is clear that our Republican friends are no friends of public schools. They have an anti-education agenda. They want tax breaks for the wealthy who send their children to private schools. They want to cut the budget for public schools. The Republicans have put their cards on the table--and it's a losing hand for education. 
If they really wanted to improve the nation's schools, they wouldn't propose a $30 billion tax break, while cutting funds for education. 
Now, with this cloture vote, they are trying to gag Democrats to prevent us from offering proposals that will genuinely help education. They are trying to force the Senate to pass their private school bill or no bill. 
The use of tax breaks to subsidize parents who send their children to private schools is a serious mistake. 
This chart indicates who the winners and losers are. Ninety-three percent of the children in this country go to public schools; 7 percent go to the private schools. Yet when you look at the money, where the money goes, 48 percent to the public schools, and 52 percent to the private schools. 
This bill does nothing to address the serious need of public schools to build new facilities and repair their crumbling existing facilities. It does nothing to reduce class size in school. It does nothing to provide qualified teachers in more classrooms across the Nation. It does nothing to help children reach high academic standards. It does nothing to provide after-school activities to keep kids off the street and away from drugs and out of trouble. It does nothing to improve the quality of education for children in public schools. 
Working families do not have enough assets in savings to participate in this scheme. This regressive bill does not help families struggling to pay day-to-day expenses during their children's school years. This so-called education bill does nothing for education. It simply provides a tax shelter for the rich. 
Congress should be building new schools, not building new tax shelters for the wealthy. Congress should be reducing class size, not reducing aid to public schools. 
We know what it takes to achieve genuine education reform. The place to start is by resoundingly rejecting cloture on this defective bill and then amending it in the ways that would genuinely help the Nation's schools. 
How much time does the Senator from Nebraska desire?

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 
a recent GAO report makes clear that significant insurance company abuses are undercutting the effectiveness of one of the key parts of the Kassebaum-Kennedy health insurance reforms enacted in 1996. The legislation that I am introducing today will stop these unconscionable practices. 
The 1996 legislation was enacted in response to several serious problems. Large numbers of Americans felt locked into their jobs because of pre-existing health conditions that would have subjected them to exclusions coverage if they changed jobs. 
Many more who did change jobs found themselves and members of their families exposed to devastating financial risks because of exclusions for such conditions. Other families faced the same problems if their employers changed insurance plans. Still others were unable to buy individual coverage because of health problems if they left their job or lost their job and did not have access to employer-based coverage. 
The legislation addressed each of these problems. It banned exclusions for pre-existing conditions for people who maintained coverage, even if they changed jobs or changed insurers. It required insurance companies to sell insurance policies to small businesses and individuals losing group coverage, regardless of their health status. It banned higher charges for those in poor health in employment-based groups.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join with Senator Daschle and other Democratic Senators to introduce the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 1998. This proposal is strongly supported by President Clinton, and is also being introduced today in the House of Representatives by Congressman David Bonior, Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt, and many of their colleagues. 
The federal minimum wage is now $5.15 an hour. Our bill will raise it by $1.00 over the next two years--a 50 cent increase on January 1, 1999, and another 50 cent increase on January 1, 2000, so that the minimum wage will reach the level of $6.15 at the turn of the century. 
These modest increases will help 20 million workers and their families. Twelve million Americans earning less than $6.15 an hour today will see a direct increase in their pay, and another 8 million Americans earning between $6.15 and $7.15 an hour are also likely to benefit from the increase. 
The nation's economy is the best it has been in decades. Under the leadership of President Clinton, the country as a whole is enjoying a remarkable period of growth and prosperity. Enterprise and entrepreneurship are flourishing--generating an extraordinary expansion, with remarkable efficiencies and job creation. The stock market is soaring. Inflation is low, unemployment is low, and interest rates are low. 
In the past 30 years, the stock market, adjusted for inflation, has gone up by 115%. In 1997, the average compensation of a Wall Street executive was $280,000--a stunning $120,000 increase over 1996. These lavish salaries contrast starkly with the 30% decline in the value of the minimum wage over the past three decades. To have the purchasing power it had in 1968, the minimum wage would have to be $7.38 an hour today, instead of $5.15. 
But the benefits of this prosperity have not flowed fairly to minimum wage earners. Working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, they earn $10,712 a year--$2,600 below the poverty line for a family of three. 
According to the Department of Labor, 60% of minimum wage earners are women. Nearly three-fourths are adults. Three-fifths are the sole breadwinners in their families. More than half work full time. These families need help, and they deserve this increase in the minimum wage. 
Increasing the minimum wage can make all the difference to these workers and their families. They will be able to survive without food stamps or other social services to supplement their incomes. They can fix up their homes and invest in their neighborhoods. They can spend more at the local grocery store. They can work two jobs rather than three, and spend more time with their families. Their utilities won't be cut off. They can pay the medical bills they accumulated from not having health benefits at their jobs. As one minimum wage earner told me earlier this year, `The best welfare reform is an increase in the minimum wage.' 
Opponents typically claim that, if the minimum wage goes up, the sky will fall--small businesses will collapse and jobs will be lost. This hasn't happened in the past, and it won't happen in the future. In fact, in the time that has passed since the most recent increases in the federal minimum wage--a 50-cent increase on October 1, 1996 and a 40-cent increase on September 1, 1997--employment has increased in all sectors of the population. 
Since September 1996, 700,000 new retail jobs have been added in the economy, including 200,000 new restaurant jobs. Overall employment is at an all-time high. Overall unemployment is at an historically low rate--4.6 %. The teenage unemployment rate has declined by 1.3 percentage points. The unemployment rate for African-Americans has declined by 1 percentage point over the same period. 
Seventeen renowned economists--including Nobel Prize winner Lawrence R. Klein and former Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall--recently wrote to President Clinton, supporting an increase in the minimum wage. According to these experts, `the 1996 and 1997 increases had a beneficial effect, not only on those whose earnings were increased by 90 cents an hour, but also on the economy as a whole. Billions in added consumer demand helped fuel our expanding economy in those years. . . . Given the nation's low unemployment rate and strong economy without inflation, now is the time to deepen our public commitment to a decent minimum wage.' 
The American people understand that you can't raise a family on $5.15 an hour. We intend to do all we can to see that the minimum wage is increased this year. No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am interested in a brief review of what is in the proposal of the majority leader. I am interested in whether the proposal that is included in the submission that we have now here is the proposal that would provide the funding for projects of private companies for the building and the construction of private schools. The limitation on any State would be approximately $5 million. That is my understanding of at least what would be included in the Republican proposal, which is a pale shadow of what I think most of us understand would be the Moseley-Braun proposal, which would provide much more dramatic health assistance to public schools. I am just interested in that. Is my understanding correct?

Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate the leader responding. I just wanted to mention that it is a proposal in support of the Senator from New York, because there are different approaches on 
the question of the modernization and the reconstruction of the public schools. Senator Graham has a proposal. It has been included in the proposal. Senator Moseley-Braun has a very interesting proposal. But, as I understand it, they will be precluded. Would they be precluded from having that be considered under the cloture motion?

Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate that. Effectively we are being told if we do not accept the way it is being packaged they won't have an opportunity to have a debate on these very important measures in terms of achieving what the majority leader has pointed out. I am wondering, the amendment of our friend, Senator Boxer, on after-school programs, is related to education, as I understand it. Under cloture, that would be precluded as well. Would that amendment be excluded? It has been published. It deals with after-school proposals for children. I am wondering if that would be permitted under the cloture motion.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a recent GAO report makes clear that significant insurance company abuses are undercutting the effectiveness of one of the key parts of the Kassebaum-Kennedy health insurance reforms enacted in 1996. 
President Clinton announced today that he has called for vigorous enforcement against companies that are violating the law. But it is abundantly clear that additional action by Congress is needed to end the worst abuse--price-gouging by the insurance industry. I intend to introduce legislation this week to block that irresponsible practice. 
Individuals who lose their group coverage and attempt to obtain individual coverage are being charged exorbitant premiums by insurance companies. We recognized that potential problem in 1996, but Republican opposition blocked any Federal role in preventing such abuse, on the ground that state regulation would be an adequate remedy. As the GAO report makes clear, state regulation is no match for insurance industry price-gouging. 
The 1996 legislation was enacted in response to several serious problems. Large numbers of Americans felt locked into their jobs because of pre-existing health conditions which would have subjected them to exclusions coverage if they changed jobs. 
Many more who did change jobs found themselves and members of their families exposed to devastating financial risks because of exclusions for such conditions. Other families faced the same problems if their employers changed insurance plans. Still others were unable to buy individual coverage because of health problems if they left their job or lost their job and did not have access to employer-based coverage. 
The legislation addressed each of these problems. It banned exclusions for pre-existing conditions for people who maintained coverage, even if they changed jobs or changed insurers. It required insurance companies to sell insurance policies to small businesses and individuals losing group coverage, regardless of their health status. It banned higher charges for those in poor health in employment-based groups.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on the issue that is before us, which is basically the Coverdell education proposal, I will take a few moments of the Senate's time to express my strong reservations in opposition to the proposal, and I will outline the reasons why. 
Public schools need help--and this `do-nothing' bill doesn't even get us to the front door. In fact, it goes in the opposite direction, by earmarking most of its aid to go to private schools. 
The nation's students deserve modern schools with world-class teachers. But too many students in too many schools in too many communities across the country fail to achieve that standard. The latest international survey of math and science achievement confirms the urgent need to raise standards of performance for schools, teachers, and students alike. It is shameful that America's twelfth graders rank among the lowest of the 22 nations participating in this international survey of math and science. 
The nation's schools are facing enormous problems of physical decay. 14 million children in a third of the schools are learning in substandard school buildings. Half the schools have at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition. 
Massachusetts is no exception. Mr. President, 41% of Massachusetts schools report that at least one building needs extensive repair or should be replaced; 75% report serious problems in their buildings, such as plumbing or heating defects; 80% have at least one unsatisfactory environmental factor. 
The challenge is clear. We must do all we can to improve teaching and learning for all students across the nation. That means: We must continue to support efforts to raise academic standards; we must test students early, so that we know where they need help in time to make that help effective; we must provide better training for current and new teachers, so that they are well-prepared to teach to high standards; we must reduce class size, to help students obtain the individual attention they need and we must provide after-school programs to make constructive alternatives available to students and keep them off the streets, away from drugs, and out of trouble. 
We must provide greater resources to repay or modernize the Nation's school buildings in order to meet the urgent needs of schools for up-to-date facilities. 
I oppose the Coverdell bill because it does nothing to improve the public schools. Instead, it uses regressive tax policy to subsidize vouchers for private schools. It does not give any real financial help to low-income working and middle-class families, and it does not help children in the Nation's classrooms. What it does is provide an unjustified tax giveaway to the wealthy and to private schools. 
Public education is one of the great success stories of American democracy. It makes no sense for Congress to undermine it. This bill turns its back on the Nation's longstanding support of public schools and earmarks tax dollars for private schools. It is an unwarranted step in the wrong direction for education, for public schools, and for the Nation's children. Senator Coverdell's proposal would spend $1.6 billion over the next 10 years on subsidies to help wealthy people pay the private school expenses they already pay and do nothing to help children in public schools get a better education. 
This chart I have is based on the Joint Tax Committee memo, which is the committee designated by the Congress to review tax bills and provide analysis of various tax changes. The Joint Tax Committee memo demonstrates the distorted priorities of the Coverdell bill. The bill has a $1.6 billion price tax over the next ten years--and half the benefits--$800 million--go to the 7 percent of families with children in private schools. That's an eight hundred million dollar tax bread for the tiny fraction of parents with children in private schools. That's unacceptable, when public schools are desperate for additional help. 
We have nothing against the private schools. They are superb in many circumstances. But, scarce tax dollars should go to the public schools that have great needs. 
We should invest scarce resources in ways that will help children raise academic performance and enhance their abilities? That is my test and the Coverdell bill fails it. 
The Joint Tax Committee memo also estimates that while 83 percent of private school families will use this tax break, only 30 percent of public school families will use it. 
The majority of the tax benefits will go to families in high income brackets, who can already afford to send their children to private school. 
But working families and low-income families do not have enough assets and savings to participate in this IRA scheme. This regressive bill does not help working families struggling to pay day-to-day expenses during their children's school years. 
The Joint Tax Committee memo says that the few public school families that do use the provision will get an average tax benefit of $7--$7! That means that a working family has to find $2,000 in extra resources in order to get back $7. This education bill does nothing for education. It simply provides a tax shelter for the rich. 
The majority of families will get almost no tax break from this legislation. 70 percent of the benefit goes to families in the top 20 percent of the income bracket. Families earning less than $50,000 a year will get a tax cut of $2.50 from this legislation--$2.50! You can't even buy a good box of crayons for that amount. Families in the lowest income brackets--those making less than $17,000 a year--will get a tax cut of all of $1--$1! But, a family earning over $93,000 will get $97. 
Even families who can save enough to be able to participate in this IRA scheme will receive little benefit. IRAs work best when the investment is long-term. But in this scheme, money will be taken out each year of a child's education. Only the wealthiest families will be able to take advantage of this tax-free savings account. 
Proponents of this bill argue that assistance is available 
for families to send their children to any school, public or private. But that argument is false. The fact is, the public schools do not charge tuition. Therefore, the 90 percent of the children who attend the public schools do not need help in paying tuition. What they do need is the best possible education. We should be doing much more to support efforts to improve local schools. We should oppose any plan that would undermine those efforts. 
On this next chart, it is clear that this bill disproportionately benefits families with children already in private school. Of the 35 million public school families, 30 percent could use the Coverdell IRA. But 83 percent of the 2.9 million private school families could use the IRA. 
Again, the issue of fairness. The issue of the test should be what is going to benefit children and enhance their academic achievement. This particular proposal does not meet this test. The Coverdell bill is a back-door attack on public education, and it should be defeated. 
Scarce tax dollars should be targeted to public schools. They don't have the luxury of closing their doors to students who pose special challenges, such as children with disabilities, limited-English-proficient children, or homeless students. This bill will not help children who need help the most. 
Proponents say it will increase choice for parents, but the parental choice is a mirage. Private schools apply different rules than public schools. Public schools must accept all children. Private schools can decide whether to accept a child or not. The real choice goes to the schools, not the parents. The better the private school, the more parents and students are turned away. Public schools must accept all children and build programs to meet their needs. Private schools only accept children who fit the guidelines of their existing policy. We should not use public tax dollars to support schools that select some children and reject others. This bill is bad tax policy, bad education policy. It does not improve public education for the 90 percent of the children who go to public schools. Therefore, it is not an appropriate allocation of tax dollars. 
This bill is simply private school vouchers under another name. It is wrong for Congress to subsidize private schools. Our goal is to improve public schools, not abandon them. 
I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, too many Americans nearing age 65 face a crisis in health care. They are too young for Medicare, but too old for affordable private coverage. Many of them face serious health problems that threaten to destroy the savings of a lifetime and prevent them from finding or keeping a job. Many are victims of corporate down-sizing or a company's decision to cancel the health insurance protection they relied on. No American nearing retirement can be confident that the health insurance they have today will protect them until they are 65 and are eligible for Medicare. 
Three million Americans aged 55 to 64 have no health insurance today. The consequences are often tragic. As a group, they are in relatively poor health, and their condition is more likely to worsen the longer they remain uninsured. They have little or no savings to protect against the cost of serious illness. Often, they are unable to afford the routine care that can prevent minor health problems from turning into serious disabilities or even life-threatening illness. 
The number of uninsured is growing every day. Between 1991 and 1995, the number of workers whose employers promise them benefits if they retire early dropped twelve percent. Barely a third of all workers now have such a promise. In recent years, many who have counted on an employer's commitment found themselves with only a broken promise. Their coverage was canceled after they retired. 
The plight of older workers who lose their jobs through layoffs or downsizing is also grim. It is hard to find a new job at age 55 or 60--and even harder to find a job that provides health insurance. For these older Americans left out and left behind through no fault of their own after decades of hard work, it is time to provide a helping hand. 
And finally, significant numbers of retired workers and their families have found themselves left high and dry when their employers cut back their coverage or canceled it altogether. 
The legislation we are introducing today is a lifeline for millions of these Americans. It provides a bridge to help them through the years before they qualify for full Medicare eligibility. It is a constructive next step toward the day when every American will be guaranteed the fundamental right to health care. It will impose no additional burden on Medicare, because it is fully paid for by premiums from the beneficiaries themselves. 
I commend Senator Moynihan and Senator Daschle and our other co-sponsors for their leadership on this issue. I especially commend the President for his initiation of this national debate by including this proposal in his budget. When this legislation becomes law, millions of older families will have him to thank. 
The opponents of this constructive step are already waging a campaign of disinformation against the program. They claim that it will somehow harm Medicare--even though that is not true. They say we should wait for the Medicare Advisory Commission to report--but older uninsured Americans have waited too long for the help they need. They say that this is just another entitlement program--ignoring the fact that it will be paid for in full--and primarily by the participants themselves. They say it is another attempt to inject government into the health care system--even though it simply gives uninsured older Americans better access to the health care they need through the most successful health program ever enacted. 
The opponents of this proposal will do everything they can to keep the program from coming to the floor of the House and Senate for a full and fair debate. They have a lot of power in Congress. But they don't have the President on their side. They don't have the vast majority of Democrats in Congress on their side. And most of all, they do not have the American people on their side. 
We intend to do all we can to bring this issue to the floor of the Senate early this year. There will be a vote, and, if necessary, there will be many votes. Despite the opposition of the Republican Leadership, this Congress has already taken a major step to expand health insurance coverage for American children. This can also be the Congress that extends help to older Americans who need health care. The American people want us to act, and I am confident that Congress will respond.

 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, yesterday, unfortunately, Judge Massiah-Jackson asked President Clinton to withdraw her nomination to serve as a federal judge in the U.S. District Court in Philadelphia. 
I know that this was a difficult decision for Judge Massiah-Jackson and her family. She is a distinguished state court judge with a distinguished record. She has the strong support of the people of Philadelphia. She earned the President's nomination to this distinguished office, and she should have been confirmed by the United States Senate. 
Instead, she was subjected to numerous unfair attacks and gross distortions of her record. The attacks on Judge Frederica Massiah-Jackson by her opponents are full of half-truths, and misinformation. 
In fact, she is a remarkable lawyer and judge with a long history of service to the people of Philadelphia, and she deserved to be confirmed to serve as a federal judge on Pennsylvania's Eastern District Court. 
Judge Massiah-Jackson has worked long and hard and well to get where she is today. She is the daughter of immigrants. Her father came to the United States from Barbados, and her mother came from Haiti. They taught her the value of hard work, commitment to family, and giving back to the community. Judge Massiah-Jackson's entire life and career are testimony that she lives by these virtues. 
She was born and raised in Philadelphia. She graduated from the University of Pennsylvania Law School, one of the nation's most prestigious law schools. She could have made a career in private practice and been a great financial success. But instead, she has devoted her life to public service. 
Upon graduating from law school, she served as a law clerk, then as chief counsel to the Business Committee of the Pennsylvania State Senate. In 1984, she was elected to the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, and re-elected to that position in 1993. 
Most nominees for the federal court have a background in either civil law or criminal law. But Judge Massiah-Jackson has a background in both. In her first years on the Court of Common Pleas, she handled criminal cases. In recent years, she has handled the court's docket of complex civil cases. So this eminently qualified judge will bring a wealth of experience to the federal district court. 
Her opponents unfairly ignored this impressive record. Instead, they latched onto a few isolated cases, mischaracterized them, and then used them to defame the reputation of this distinguished judge. When she answered their questions, they invented still more reasons to object to her nomination. 
This process is unfair. It is unfair to Judge Massiah-Jackson and her family. It is unfair to the people of Philadelphia. It is unfair to the nation's system of justice. And it is a disgrace to the United States Senate. 
Even if the cases that her critics cite were wrongly decided, they represent less than one percent of the 4,000 cases over which she has presided in her long career. 
How many United States Senators can say that they have been right over 99 percent of the time? 
Look at the process that led to her nomination. 
She passed the bipartisan judicial selection committee established by Senator Specter and Senator Santorum with flying colors. 
She was screened by the Justice Department to ensure her qualifications. 
The FBI conducted a thorough background investigation of her character. 
The American Bar Association reviewed her professional qualifications for the job. 
Senator Specter, Senator Santorum, and Senator Biden conducted their own hearing in Philadelphia to review Judge Massiah-Jackson's qualifications even further. 
Finally, she appeared before the Judiciary Committee not once, but twice. And yesterday, she patiently and professionally answered each and every question that Senators put to her. 
But perhaps most significant, Judge Massiah-Jackson had the most important endorsement that any nominee before this committee could have--the respect and admiration of the people who know her best--the people she has served for 14 years--the people of her hometown of Philadelphia. 
Her opponents have distorted her record by mischaracterizing isolated cases from among the thousands she has handled over the past decade and a half. But the citizens of Philadelphia know better. 
Listen to what the people who really know her have to say. 
The Philadelphia Bar Association says, `We know Judge Massiah-Jackson to be an outstanding jurist--fair, patient, and thorough.' This is what her fellow lawyers in Philadelphia have to say about her. And they know her better than anyone in the United States Senate. 
Mayor Ed Rendell of Philadelphia strongly supported her nomination. He says, `It is clear that she should be confirmed.' 
As the Pennsylvania Legislative Black Caucus wrote to the Judiciary Committee, `Judge Jackson is an outstanding and able jurist. She has labored long and hard in the trenches of the judiciary and is a demonstrated supporter of fair and even justice.' 
The organization `Philadelphians Against Crime' ran an ad in the Philadelphia Daily News on February 25, saying, `We support Judge Massiah-Jackson for the federal judgeship.' 
Barbara Burgos DiTullio, President of the Pennsylvania Chapter of the National Organization for Women, writes, Judge Massiah-Jackson `is highly qualified to hold this position, and anyone looking at her record instead of listening to those who have personal vendettas would know this.' 
The Philadelphia Tribune endorsed her, saying `[Judge Massiah-Jackson] is eminently qualified for the federal bench.' 
Here is the Philadelphia Daily News: `Frederica Massiah-Jackson's record demonstrates her suitability for the federal bench.' 
In addition, Judge Massiah-Jackson received the support of lawyers who have appeared before her in court. In a survey conducted by the Philadelphia Bar Association, the vast majority of the lawyers who appeared before her expressed their confidence in her integrity and judicial temperament, and found her to be industrious and efficient. 
Judge Massiah-Jackson earned these endorsements because she has established herself as a tough-minded, no-nonsense jurist throughout the more than 4,000 cases she has handled in her 14 years on the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. She is tough on crime, and tough on criminals. According to the Philadelphia Bar Association's independent review committee, Judge Massiah-Jackson is more likely, not less likely than her colleagues on the court to convict defendants. 
For serious crimes, such as robbery, rape, and burglary, her conviction rate is nearly 50 percent higher than the conviction rate of her colleagues. 
Her record on sentencing is right down the middle when compared with other judges on the court. Her rate of departure from Pennsylvania's sentencing guidelines is not measurably different from her colleagues. In fact, her record shows that she is more likely than her colleagues to depart upward from the guidelines, imposing stiffer sentences than the guidelines call for. 
When Judge Massiah-Jackson's full record is considered, it is clear that she is fully qualified to serve on the Federal District Court. She eminently deserved her nomination to the federal court, because of her strong commitment to justice, and her profound knowledge of the law. I am confident that Judge Massiah-Jackson will continue to serve the people of Philadelphia well on the Court of Common Pleas.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to pay tribute today to our outstanding colleague from Kentucky, Wendell Ford, as he reaches an historic milestone and becomes the longest serving Senator in the history of the Commonwealth of Kentucky. 
Our colleague's service to Kentucky, to the Senate, and to the nation has been outstanding through all these years, and it continues to be outstanding today. As our Whip since 1990, he is an essential part of the Senate's leadership team and deserves a great deal of the credit for the legislative achievements of our Party and of the Senate as a whole. 
As a legislator, our colleague has consistently earned high marks for his brilliant service to Kentucky and the country. He has earned the respect of all of us on both sides of the aisle for his skill and warm sense of humor in debate, and for his leadership on a wide range of issues, especially in areas such as aviation, education, telecommunications, the environment, election reform, and the many issues of vital importance to Kentucky and to all of rural America. 
I recall that a Ford Fellow Scholarship Fund was established last year in Kentucky in his honor, and I am sure that in the years ahead, the Ford Fellows will carry on the high standards that our colleague has so consistently set for excellence in education. 
All of us regret that our highly regarded colleague has chosen not to seek re-election to the Senate this fall. It is no accident that he is the longest-serving Senator in the history of his state. The stratospheric victory margins he has compiled in his many election successes during his brilliant career show that his seat in the Senate is secure against any challenge, and are the highest possible tribute to the respect and affection in which he is held in his state. 
That long-standing success is no easy achievement. I'm reminded of the famous lines by Kentucky's Irish poet, James Mulligan: 
The moonlight falls the softest in Kentucky; 
The bluegrass waves the bluest; 
The songbirds are the sweetest; 
The thoroughbreds are the finest; 
The landscape is the grandest-- 
And politics the damnedest in Kentucky. 
I know that the people of Kentucky will miss Senator Ford in the Senate, and so will all of us in this body. We're proud of his leadership and honored by his statesmanship, but most of all, we're grateful for his friendship.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Frist, Senator Bingaman, and Senator Jeffords for their leadership on the bill we are introducing today to reauthorize the health professions and nursing training and education programs--Titles VII and VIII of the Public Health Service Act. This bill is a bipartisan effort to revise and strengthen these education and training programs and achieve a more effective workforce to meet the health needs of the nation. 
The ongoing national debate on health care has focused largely on the problems of access, cost and quality. These issues, however, cannot be addressed without also dealing with the need to train qualified health providers. No insurance policy can assure good health care without good doctors, nurses and other health professionals. No system of quality improvement, no matter how sophisticated, can assure good care for hospital patients if there are not good doctors and nurses at the bedside. Too often, inadequate priority is given to the workforce which staffs our health care system. 
As we know, that system is undergoing rapid and dramatic change. Today, nearly 60 percent of Americans receive their care through managed care arrangements. More and more, health care is moving out of hospitals and into out-patient or community-based settings. Fewer people are being admitted to hospitals and hospital stays are becoming shorter. It is essential for the health workforce to adapt to these changes. New graduates of health professions schools and practicing health providers need the right skills to provide effective patient care. 
In addition to these issues, the health care system continues to face by nationwide shortages of certain health personnel, serious georgraphical imbalances in the types of health professionals, and under-representation of providers from minority and disadvantaged backgrounds. 
Many types of health professionals are in short supply, including geriatricians, pediatric dentists, and allied health, public health, and behavioral and mental health professionals. Shortages of physicians persist in inner-city and rural areas, leaving many Americans unserved or underserved. 
Since 1986, the number of federally designated shortage areas for primary care health professionals has climbed by 40 percent--from 1,944 to 2,597. The Health Resources and Services Administration estimates that over 26 million underserved persons live in these areas and that, at a minimum, 5,200 additional general practitioners are needed to eliminate these shortage areas. 
In addition, most experts agree that there is an imbalance between primary care physicians and specialists. In 1931, about 87 percent of U.S. physicians were practicing primary care, compared to 33 percent in 1996. The Council on Graduate Medical Education recommends that the physician workforce should consist of 50 percent generalists and 50 percent specialists. The persistent current imbalance contributes to problems of access and cost in our health care system. Primary care practitioners are more likely to locate in underserved areas and help underserved populations, and they tend to provide care in a more comprehensive, appropriate, and cost-effective manner than specialists. 
Across the nation, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Native Americans are seriously underrepresented in the health professions workforce. Their underrepresentation has reduced access to care among many of the nation's neediest citizens. African Americans represent approximately 12 percent of the U.S. population, but only 2-3 percent of the nation's health professions workforce. Hispanics make up nine percent of the population but represent only 5 percent of physicians, and 3 percent of dentists and pharmacists. This underrepresentation is of particular concern because studies show that minority health care providers are more likely to locate in underserved communities and provide health services to needy populations. 
The health professions and nursing training and education programs we seek to reauthorize in this legislation are designed to respond to each these concerns. 
The bill reauthorizes programs which provide educational opportunities in the health professions for individuals from minority and disadvantaged backgrounds. This strategy has been effective in increasing the availability and accessibility of health care providers to populations who have difficulty obtaining adeaquate health care, especially those from low-income and minority populations. Historically black colleges and universities have been particularly successful in this effort, training more than 50 percent of the nation's African American physicians, dentists, and pharmacists. Our bill will continue to support these basic efforts. It will also strengthen opportunities for Hispanic-serving institutions and institutions with high rates of enrollment of Native Americans. 
In addition, the bill will provide continued support for primary care practice through ambulatory care training, curriculum improvement, faculty development, data analysis and quality assurance. Among physicians, this support will address the continued imbalance between primary care physicians and specialists. It recognizes the unique gaps general internists, 
general pediatricians, and family physicians fill in meeting the needs of the underserved. In other instances, funding will be used to improve the supply of other disciplines suffering shortages, such as pediatric dentists. 
The bill reauthorizes model community-based, interdisciplinary programs to train individuals for practice in underserved settings, including remote and border areas. These programs encourage active partnerships between community-based programs and medical schools, nursing schools, and other health profession schools in their effort to provide greater educational opportunities to students, faculty, and practitioners in community-based settings to improve the delivery of health care. 
Doctors, nurses, and other health professionals can be trained together in teams in the community to address the needs of the medically underserved. In this way, their training is more in step with what they will encounter in the practice world while meeting critical needs in the community. These programs include the area health education centers, geriatric education centers, the rural interdisciplinary training, and allied health training. 
The bill also recognizes the increase in the elderly population and establishes a new junior geriatric faculty fellowship program. This program will help to address the large shortage in geriatric faculty members. Without an appropriate supply of teachers in geriatrics, we cannot seriously address the issue of the geriatrician shortage. I want to commend Senator Frist and the Administration for working closely with us and with the academic community on this issue. 
Finally, the legislation will provide new flexibility in targeting resources to meet the current and emerging needs of the nursing workforce. The emphasis is on meeting the needs of the underserved. Nurse anesthetists, clinical nurse specialists, nurse practitioners, and certified nurse midwives play a vital role in providing quality care to medically underserved and rural communities, and they deserve our support. 
As the health care system continues to change, so too must the federal programs intended to assure that America has an appropriate health care workforce to staff the health care delivery system. These programs are overdue for consolidation and better targeting. The bill we are introducing will consolidate more than 40 health professions programs into 7 broader authorities more directly focused on key goals. This greater flexibility will enable programs to respond more quickly to emerging workforce issues in our changing health care system. Specific workforce goals will be established and outcomes measured, in order to achieve accountability for the funds invested in these programs. 
The health professions and nursing education programs under the Public Health Service Act are the key mechanisms of the federal government has to meet national priorities for the nation's health care workforce. The bipartisan sponsors of this bill have worked closely with the Administration, the health professions education and practice community, and other groups to achieve these goals responsibly and to maintain adequate resources. We have worked to advance the central goal of these two important titles of the Public Health Service Act--to train a health care workforce that can meet the needs of the American people, and I look forward to the enactment of this necessary legislation.

 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the nation's economy is the best it's been in decades. Under the leadership of President Clinton, business productivity has reached historic highs. Enterprise and entrepreneurship are flourishing, generating an extraordinary expansion, with remarkable efficiencies and job creation. Inflation and unemployment are at record lows. 
In the midst of this extraordinary prosperity, however, millions of Americans go to bed hungry each night. A report yesterday by Second Harvest, the network of food banks, documents that 26 million Americans received food and grocery products through Second Harvest in 1997. 
The report contains conclusions that should shock the conscience of us all. Children and the elderly are over-represented at emergency food outlets. Over a third of the beneficiaries are children, and 16% are senior citizens age 65 and older. Women make up 62% of those served at soup kitchens and food pantries. 47% are white, 32% are African-American, 15% are Latino and 3% are Native American. 
Even more disturbing, the report finds that 39% of all emergency client households have at least one member who is working. Nearly half the employees in those households are working full-time. It is shocking that in America today, so many households with full-time workers are forced to rely on emergency food aid. 86% of households receiving emergency food aid earn less than $15,500 a year. 67% earn less than $10,000 a year. Kim, a single mother who works as a nurse, said `I never thought I'd be in this situation. People think of the single mother and immediately stereotype her. Requiring emergency food assistance in today's blossoming environment is one thing that the public doesn't understand.' 
The reason why so many Americans need emergency food aid is obvious--the current prosperity has passed them by. Their earnings are too low. Wanda, an emergency food client and mother of two, put it this way: `My husband works, but at the end of the month we just run out of money. I wouldn't know what to do if it weren't for the food pantry.' 
Raising the minimum wage is an important step toward solving this problem. Today, full-time minimum wage workers earn $10,712 a year--$2,600 below the poverty level for a family of three. According to the Department of Labor, 60% of minimum wage earners are women; nearly three-fourths are adults; over half work full time. Their families need the money, and they deserve an increase in the minimum wage. If we believe in rewarding work, we have to be willing to pay working families more than a sub-poverty minimum wage. 
The American people understand that you can't raise a family on $5.15 an hour. The 26 million Americans receiving food aid last year understand this fact of life all too well. We must raise the minimum wage, and raise it now. No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise program in ISTEA has given numerous women and minority-owned businesses the opportunity they deserve to compete for federal highway construction contracts. Since it began in 1982 and was expanded to include women in 1987, the face of the construction industry has changed dramatically--we still have far to go, but because of this program, we have come a long way. 
Today, however, we are faced with a choice. Do we continue to move forward or do we turn back, and return to the virtually all-male, all-white construction industry that we had in the 1970s? Members of the Senate must consider this question carefully, because we know what will happen if the program is eliminated. 
In 1978--before implementation of the program--women and minorities received less than 2 percent of all federal contracting dollars. In 1979, the figure was 2.22 percent--and no federal dollars went to women-owned firms--zero. Clearly, America had to do better, and the need to give women and minorities a fair opportunity to bid for contracts led to the implementation and expansion of the program in 1982 and 1987, respectively. 
Because of these state and federal initiatives, women and minority-owned firms made great strides in the construction industry. It wasn't until the Supreme Court's decision in Richmond versus Croson in 1989, that this progress began to slow. The Croson decision required application of the strict scrutiny test to state affirmative action programs, and, as a result, several states eliminated these measures. 
But, contrary to what some have said, the Croson decision was not the death-knell for these state and local programs. Many of these easily met the strict scrutiny test--in Denver and King County, Washington, for example--and other programs were revised to meet the constitutional requirement. 
One of the most important lessons in the wake of the Croson case is the evidence of what happens when these programs are eliminated. There has been a shocking disparity in participation levels by minorities and women in states setting goals under ISTEA for federal dollars, but not setting goals for state contracting dollars. 
In Nebraska, 10.5 percent of federal dollars went to disadvantaged business enterprises because of ISTEA goals--but only 3.6 percent of state dollars went to these firms. 
In Louisiana, 12.4 percent of federal dollars went to such firms because of ISTEA goals, but only 0.4 percent of state dollars went to the same firms. 
In Missouri, 15.1 percent of federal dollars went to such firms, but only 1.7 percent of state dollars did. The trend is the same in every other state that does not have such a program. 
This is not what we want for federal transportation contracts. It makes no sense to destroy women and minority-owned businesses and wipe out the 100,000 jobs that they create. That cannot possibly be the goal of this Republican Senate. 
The disadvantaged business enterprise program is essential for the survival of these firms. Not because they aren't qualified. Not because they can't compete on merit. But, because too many in the construction industry are not willing to give qualified firms a chance if they are owned by women or minorities. 
Ask the women and minorities who are certified for this program. Mary Aguillar-Lancome, president of Coast and Harbor Associates in Boston told me, `If there is a goal, prime contractors will call DBEs; if not, they will not call.' Other firms have made similar comments. Jack Bryant, President of Jack Bryant Associates in Massachusetts told me, `Without goals, most in the construction industry would not make a good faith effort to work with women and minority-owned businesses. The elimination of this program would be disastrous.' 
Of course, the program doesn't just help women and minorities. It extends a helping hand to firms owned by white males, as well. They can be certified to participation if they prove that they have been disadvantaged. Just ask Randy Pech--the owner of the Adarand Construction Firm--because he is currently seeking certification. 
It is preposterous to argue that the Sultan of Brunei would be certified, but that an economically disadvantaged white man would not. That cannot happen, and the new regulations clarify the certification requirements. 
Mr. President, I want to show this chart, which illustrates very clearly what happens when you have the Federal highway program with the DBE Program and no DBE Program for State-funded programs. 
The red indicates the various States that do not have the DBE Program. And you can see what happens in terms of women and also minority construction firms versus those States that are part of the Federal system. The contrast is so dramatic that I think it makes a powerful case. What we are talking about is quality programs--those programs that are going to meet the price competition and also the other competitive forces. 
But this illustrates what the principal problem is. I think it is incorporated in this statement by Elaine Martin, president of the MarCon Company in Nampa, ID.  
Most companies can point to one or two jobs that made it possible for those companies to succeed. My essential job would not have been awarded to me without the DBE program. I was low bidder on a job in 1987 where the owner told the estimator to give the job to a larger male-owned firm that had a higher bid than mine. The estimator told the owner that the job had DBE, and as the low bidder I should be given the opportunity to perform. 
We have instance after instance. 
Dorinda Pounds, President of Midwest Contractors, Inc., in Cedar Falls, IA: 
One of the major reasons that my investors and my banker was willing to take the risk with my new company was that I had the opportunity to become certified as a DBE contractor. Without the DBE program they felt the `good old boy' system would lock me out and would keep me from having a chance to become successful. 
That case has been made hour after hour during the course of this debate. We know what the issue is. We are talking about simple fairness and justice for women and minorities in our country to participate in a program that is being paid for by American taxpayers. The American taxpayers, women and minorities, are contributing the tax dollars that go to this program. All we are saying is they shouldn't be excluded from being able to participate in the program. 
Those who are trying to strike this program are effectively doing that. They may couch that in different kinds of language, but the record is very clear what the bottom line is going to be and what the results are going to be. The case couldn't be any clearer. 
I urge my colleagues to support this program. A vote for this program is a vote for fair opportunity for women and minority-owned construction firms, as well as for many other small businesses around the country. All these business owners ask is a fair chance to compete. We cannot and we must not deny them that opportunity. 
This is one of the most important civil rights votes of this Congress and one of the most important civil rights issues of the 1990s. It is time for the Senate to do the right thing, and stand up for civil rights and equal opportunities for all. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Since the Senator has referred to Rhode Island, I am wondering, as the manager of this legislation dealing with the surface transportation, whether you have complaints from the contractors about the inefficiency or the poor quality of work, or the failure of being on time? Or the fact that here in Rhode Island, when they are using the Federal funds, it is 12.1 percent? 
Generally speaking, I have not, in the course of this debate, heard complaints that the work that is being done with the DBE has 
been not of first-rate quality, on time, and effective work. I am just wondering if the Senator from Rhode Island is receiving a lot of complaints because the DBE Program is in effect in his State?

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Frist for his leadership on the bill we are introducing today, `The Women's Health Research and Prevention Amendments of 1998.' This bill is a bipartisan effort to extend and strengthen several important women's health programs at the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
In recent years, women's health has begun to receive the high priority it deserves. Five years ago government guidelines were finally eliminated that specifically excluded women from many clinical trials. Increasingly, Congress has given higher priority to funds to address breast cancer and other women's health issues. We also established the Office of Women's Health within the Department of Health and Human Services, in order to develop and implement a national agenda for women's health. These successes, however, have revealed that there is much more to be done. 
The bill we are introducing today is an attempt to fill some of the gaps in research and prevention that we have identified in women's health. It is time for Congress to acknowledge that women's health involves a wider range of issues, and that the magnitude of these issues varies greatly with age. Car crashes and unintended injuries are the leading killer of women in their teens and twenties. Cancer is the leading killer of women between the ages of 25 and 64. Heart disease is the leading killer among women over 65. 
The nation's agenda on women's health must also address other key issues that are more common among women but affect men too, such as osteoporosis, depression, and auto-immune diseases, and illnesses that manifest themselves differently in men and women, such as heart disease, substance abuse, AIDS, and violence. 
Our legislation extends important research and prevention activities now being carried out by the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in areas traditionally considered women's health issues, such as breast and ovarian cancer, osteoporosis, and domestic violence. It also calls for greater research efforts on heart attacks, strokes, and other cardiovascular diseases, in recognition of the serious effects of these diseases on women. 
Our bill also provides continued support for academic health centers to conduct research and demonstration projects related to health promotion and disease prevention to improve quality of life, and to curb premature mortality and illness that contribute to excessive health costs. These academic health centers are effective in informing women and their physicians of steps they can take to prevent serious illness and injury, especially in cases involving chronic and debilitating physical illness, such as arthritis and osteoporosis, which put women at high risk for bone fractures. 
In order to enable researchers to monitor health trends among women and to help policymakers make informed decisions on the allocation of resources, it is essential for accurate and timely statistical and epidemiological data to be available. Our bill will provide continued support of the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, which provides valuable data related to overall health status, lifestyle, onset and diagnosis of illness and disability, and use of health care and rehabilitation services. 
It is also important to understand differences between racial and ethnic groups. For example, black women have far higher death rates from heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes than white women. Minority women suffer the most from AIDS. More than half of new female cases of AIDS over the past decade were found among blacks. For other chronic diseases, black women have the highest rates of hypertension, while Native American women have higher rates of asthma and chronic bronchitis. This bill will enable the National Center for Health Statistics to continue its important work on the health of ethnic and racial populations, and improve methods to collect data on these subgroups in order to understand and address their various health needs more effectively. 
Too many health needs of women continue to be neglected by the nation's health care system. The cost of this national neglect, both in dollars and in lives, is staggering. This bill is an excellent starting point for strengthening current programs and pursuing new initiatives to address urgent national priorities in women's health. I look forward to working with my colleagues and with the women's health community to enact the strongest legislation we can to deal with these vital issues.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to continue the debate on the steps needed to achieve the goal of equal opportunity for women and minorities. Clearly, we have made substantial progress toward the goal of equal justice under law, but just as clearly, we still have a long way to go. 
From President Kennedy to President Nixon to President Clinton, there has always been bipartisan recognition in the White House and Congress that the playing field is not level for women and minorities and widespread acceptance of the need to take steps to remedy the effects of persistent discrimination. 
Civil rights is still the unfinished business of America. We have made significant progress toward justice for all and opportunity for all. But, as the church arson epidemic, the Texaco and Mitsubishi scandals, the Good Ol' Boys Round Up, and the brutalizing of a Haitian immigrant by police officers in New York City demonstrate, we are not there yet. 
Incredibly, there are some who believe that discrimination is a thing of the past, and that the playing field is now level for women, for minorities, and for other victims of discrimination. They are wrong. Job discrimination is still a persistent problem for minorities in all aspects of the economy. The glass ceiling still prevents large numbers of women from attaining important job opportunities. 
Nowhere is the deck stacked more heavily against women and minorities than in the construction industry. African American contractors still report arriving at job sites to find signs with racial epithets. One African American contractor was told to leave a home site by a white customer who said, `You didn't tell me you were black and you don't sound black.' In California, a female contractor was told that the reason her asbestos-removal business had declined, even though her work was good, was because `it's back to the good ol' boys club. Haven't you heard affirmative action is out?' 
There is no doubt that if we terminate meaningful programs, like the Disadvantaged Business Program in ISTEA, the clock will be turned back--back to bigotry, back to closed-door deals, back to denial of opportunity. The door that America is steadily opening to women and minorities will be shut once again. 
Proof comes from communities across the Nation. If we terminate a State disadvantaged business program, public contracts awarded to businesses owned by women and minorities decline rapidly. 
In Philadelphia, contracts awarded to women and minorities dropped 97 percent--97 percent--in the first month after the city terminated its disadvantaged business ordinance. 
In Tampa, contracts awarded to black-owned firms dropped 99 percent--when that city ended its goals program. 
In Michigan, minority firms were eliminated as contractors on State highway projects within 6 months after the suspension of the State's disadvantaged business program in 1989. Within 9 months, participation by women-owned businesses had dropped to 1 percent of total awards. 
Can it be that no qualified minority contractor was available for a highway construction contract in Michigan after the State program ended? It defies reason to believe that is true. 
The Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Program and others like it have brought new faces to the table. Many women and minorities have had the opportunity to participate--to show they can excel. An electronics company in Orlando--a steel assembly firm in Illinois--a crane and crane operator supplier in Chicago--all owned by women. This program gave them the opportunity to prove themselves. But if these programs end, they are deeply concerned that the major contractors that called them and the companies that praised their work will disappear--not because they do bad work, or charge more than their competitors, but because they are women. 
Dorinda Pounds, currently president of Midwest Contractors, Inc., an Iowa highway construction business, had trouble getting startup capital. After 9 years in the construction business, she had decided to start her own business and was faced with the task of raising $500,000 for equipment and expenses. She turned to banks and investors, but they initially expressed concern that the male contractors would lock her out and the banks would not recoup their investment. The DBE program certification was indispensable in persuading bankers and investors to take a chance on her new company. 
Three years later, prime contractors ask for her--not because she is a DBE, but because she can get the job done. 
Jennylynne Gragg, president of G and G Signals and Lighting, is another example. After 6 years in her parents' construction business, she became the company's general manager, and was able to increase profitability immediately. Her father, acting on his belief that the construction industry is `no place for a woman,' offered her job to a younger brother with no experience, and Jennylynne decided to prove him wrong. 
Eight years later, she operates a successful contracting business of her own. But it has not been easy. She and her mother--now a business partner --have to struggle to obtain financing. General contractors often solicit their bids with no intention of hiring them. Even when they are the low bidder, general contractors have often used another firm and accepted a higher bid. 
Why would a general contractor accept a higher bid? It doesn't make sense--unless you remember that the traditional business network doesn't include women or minorities. At a Judiciary Committee hearing on this issue, Janet Shutt, who operates an Indiana construction company, said some general contractors would rather lose money than deal with female contractors. 
The Department of Transportation DBE program is changing all that. The program was signed into law by President Reagan in 1983 to assist minority-owned firms. 
It was expanded in 1987 to include women. President Reagan and Congress recognized that it was time to end the pervasive discrimination in the highway construction industry, that positive steps were needed to eliminate years of bias against women and minorities. 
Under the DBE program, the Department of Transportation sets a national goal--10 percent of Federal contracting dollars--for participation by women and minorities. States then set their goals--not quotas or set-asides--based on the availability of DBEs and the kind of work that must be completed. Most States set a goal of 10 percent. But on occasion, States have set goals lower or higher than the national level. States have never been penalized for failing to meet their goal. 
Once States set their goals, contracts are identified for DBE participation. Prime contractors must either meet the goal or show that they have made a good-faith effort to meet it. The new regulations proposed by the Department of Transportation clarify that States must accept valid showings of good-faith efforts, so that the goal will never become a quota. 
The proposed regulations also ensure that only truly disadvantaged businesses can participate in the DBE program. Currently, although women and minorities are presumed to be DBEs, those who are not economically disadvantaged are excluded from the program. The new regulations will ensure the integrity of the program by requiring that women and minorities certify that they are disadvantaged and provide a summary of net worth. The presumption may be challenged at any time by the State or the local certifying agency, the Federal Government, or any third party. 
Contracting firms owned by white males may also participate in the DBE program, and the proposed regulations clarify the existing requirements for certification. In fact, Randy Pech--the owner of the Adarand Construction Company involved in the Supreme Court case--is seeking DBE certification. 
Discrimination by general contractors is a major obstacle faced by women and minorities. But there are many others. A white contractor with a background identical to that of an African American contractor can expect to receive over 50 times as many loan dollars per dollar of equity capital. A study of contractors in Atlanta found that 19 percent of nonminority firms had unlimited bonding capacity--a privilege granted to no minority firm, regardless of size. 
Similarly, an African American owned company in Georgia found that if it sent white employees posing as owners of a white-owned company to purchase supplies, they could receive price quotations two-thirds lower than those quoted to the parent company. 
Discrimination in the form of higher quotations from suppliers is commonplace. A recent survey reported that 56 percent of African American business owners, 30 percent of Latino business owners, and 11 percent of Asian owners had experienced this discrimination. 
Yet, despite the exclusion, the mistreatment, and the prejudice that women and minority businesspeople experience every day--despite the clear and convincing evidence that the DBE program and others like it have given women and minorities a first, fair chance to succeed, there are those who want to eliminate this sensible program. 
Some argue that the DBE program is unconstitutional. But, the Supreme Court's Adarand decision did not strike down the program, nor does it prevent Congress from supporting measures to respond to the pervasive discrimination that still exists in this country. 
The Supreme Court, in reviewing this issue, has said only that Federal race-conscious programs must undergo `strict scrutiny'--they must be narrowly tailored to meet a compelling governmental interest. 
The Court did not say that affirmative action programs are unconstitutional. What the Court did say is that:  
[W]e wish to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is `strict in theory, but fatal in fact.' The unhappy persistence of both the practice and the lingering effects of racial discrimination against minority groups in this country is an unfortunate reality, and government is not disqualified from acting in response to it. 
To ensure that the DBE program passes the strict scrutiny test, the Department of Transportation is currently completing new regulations that give priority to race-neutral measures. The regulations also emphasize that States must award contracts to bidders who document adequate good-faith efforts, even if the bidder doesn't meet the DBE goal. In addition, the regulations clarify DBE certification standards, including the eligibility of white males who prove disadvantage. 
We know that properly administered programs can meet the strict scrutiny test. State and local programs implemented after the Supreme Court's Croson decision prove this point completely. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment offered by Senator McConnell. I support education and outreach efforts to eliminate discrimination. But they are not enough alone to end the discrimination that clearly exists. Congress must remain committed to taking needed steps to guarantee equal opportunity for all Americans. 
Mr. President, I yield back the remaining time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, few aspects of immigration are more important than the naturalization of new Americans. Naturalization goes to the heart of those we welcome to join our country. Unlike those of us who were born in this country, naturalized immigrants are Americans by choice. Naturalization is the occasion when these new citizens embrace our nation, and our nation embraces them. 
Unfortunately, America's immigrant heritage and history are under increasing attack today. Legal immigrants have been unfairly hurt by recent actions to deal with illegal immigration. Voting rights, welfare benefits, and naturalization itself are also under assault. 
It now takes two to four years for immigrants to become naturalized citizens. The backlogs continue to increase. It is time to improve the naturalization process, and deal more responsibly with these important issues. 
Today, Congressman Gephardt and I are introducing the `New American Citizenship Act,' because we believe legal immigrants deserve a fair, efficient and affordable way to become citizens. Our bill builds on the recent reforms by INS to reach out to potential new citizens, help them learn our history and form of government, and ensure that the naturalization process is one in which America can take pride. 
Our bill provides increased services, and requires INS to reduce the naturalization process to six months with no backlogs. We encourage local communities to help in this effort, by disseminating information to community-based organizations on the requirements of citizenship and the contents of the naturalization exam. Under our proposal, INS cannot increase the naturalization fee to more than $150 until they have shown progress in reducing the backlog. 
In addition, we take specific steps to prevent fraud and abuse in the exam. We strengthen the fingerprint process to prevent the mistaken naturalization of unqualified applicants. 
Each naturalization ceremony represents the continuing renewal and revitalization of our country. As Barbara Jordan said,  
We are a nation of immigrants, dedicated to the rule of law. That is our history and our challenge to ourselves. . . . It is literally a matter of who we are as a nation and who we become as a people. E Pluribus Unum. Out of many, one. One people. The American people.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to be a sponsor of the Public School Modernization Act of 1998, introduced today by Senator Moseley-Braun to help communities across the country in their struggle to modernize, repair, and rebuild their school facilities. 
Schools across the nation face serious problems of overcrowding. Antiquated facilities are suffering from physical decay, and are not equipped to handle the needs of modern education. 
Across the country, 14 million children in a third of the nation's schools are learning in substandard buildings. Half the schools have at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition. It will take over $100 billion just to repair existing facilities nationwide. 
Massachusetts is no exception. 41% of our schools across the state report that at least one building needs extensive repair or should be replaced. Three-quarters report serious problems in buildings, such as plumbing or heating defects. 80% have at least one unsatisfactory environmental factor. 
In Boston, many schools cannot keep their heating systems functioning properly. On a given day, 15 to 30 schools complain that their heat is not working. 
The leaking roof at Revere High School is so serious that the new fire system is threatened. School Committee members estimate that fixing the roof will cost an additional $1 million, and they don't know where to get the money. 
It is difficult enough to teach or learn in dilapidated classrooms. But now, because of escalating enrollments, those classrooms are increasingly overcrowded. The nation will need 6,000 new schools in the next few years, just to maintain current class sizes. 
State governments and local communities are working hard to meet these challenges. In Massachusetts, under the School Building Assistance Act, the state will pay 50-90% of the most severe needs. 124 schools now have approved projects, and are on a waiting list for funding. The state share should be $91 million this year, but only $35 million is available. More than 50 other projects are awaiting approval. With that kind of deficit at the state and local level, it is clear that the federal government has a responsibility to act. 
I am pleased that President Clinton has made this issue one of his highest priorities. The legislation we are introducing will allow states and local governments to issue $22 billion in bonds over the next five years for school repairs and construction. Half of the amount will go to state governments, and the other half will go to the 100 cities across the nation with the largest numbers of low-income children, including Boston and Springfield. The bonds will be interest-free for the states and cities--Uncle Sam will pay the interest. 
Under this plan, the state government in Massachusetts can issue $230 million in bonds for construction and renovation of school buildings. The City of Boston can issue an additional $90 million, and the City of Springfield can issue an additional $36 million, so that a total of $356 million in bonds will be available to help Massachusetts schools under this legislation. 
Good teaching and good schools are threatened if school buildings are unsafe and need repairs. President Clinton has made it a top priority to see that America has the best public schools in the world. And my Democratic colleagues and I intend to do all we can to see that we reach that goal. 
Investing in schools is one of the best investments America can possibly make. For schools across America, help is truly on the way--and it can't come a minute too soon.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, President Clinton and Democrats in Congress have made it a top priority to see that America has the best public schools in the world--and we intend to do all we can to see that we reach that goal. 
The nation's students deserve modern schools with world-class teachers. But too many students in too many schools in too many communities across the country fail to achieve that standard. The latest international survey of math and science achievement confirms the urgent need to raise standards of performance for schools, teachers, and students alike. It is shameful that America's twelfth graders ranked among the lowest of the 22 nations participating in this international survey of math and science. 
The challenge is clear. We must do all we can to improve teaching and learning for all students across the nation. That means: 
We must continue to support efforts to raise academic standards. 
We must test students early, so that we know where they need help in time to make that help effective. 
We must provide better training for current and new teachers, so that they are well-prepared to teach to high standards. 
We must reduce class size, to help students obtain the individual attention they need. 
We must provide after-school programs to make constructive alternatives available to students and keep them off the streets, away from drugs, and out of trouble. 
We must provide greater resources to modernize and expand the nation's school buildings to meet the urgent needs of schools for up-to-date facilities. 
I will do all I can to see that the `RESULTS! Act'--`An Act to Revitalize and Empower Schools to Upgrade for Long-Term Success'--is approved by Congress. The bill will help modernize and expand the nation's schools, reduce class size, expand after-school care, improve education technology in schools, and create education opportunity zones in communities across the country. 
A necessary foundation for a successful school is a qualified teacher in every classroom to make sure young children receive the individual attention they need. That's why a pillar of the Democratic agenda is to help bring 100,000 new teachers to schools and reduce class size in the elementary grades. 
Research has shown that students attending small classes in the early grades make more rapid progress than students in larger classes. The benefits are greatest for low-achieving, minority, and low-income children. Smaller classes also enable teachers to identify and work effectively with students who have learning disabilities, and reduce the need for special education in later grades. 
Many states are also considering proposals to reduce class size--but you can't reduce class size without the ability to hire additional qualified teachers to fill the additional classrooms. 
Too many schools are already understaffed. During the next decade, rising student enrollments and massive teacher retirements mean that the nation will need to hire 2 million new teachers. Between 1995 and 1997, student enrollment in Massachusetts rose by 28,000 students, causing a shortage of 1,600 teachers--without including teacher retirements. 
The teacher shortage has forced many school districts to hire uncertified teachers, and ask certified teachers to teach outside their area of expertise. Each year, more than 50,000 under-prepared teachers enter the classroom. One in four new teachers does not fully meet state certification requirements. Twelve percent of new teachers have had no teacher training at all. Students in inner-city schools have only a 50% chance of being taught by a qualified science or math teacher. In Massachusetts, 30% of teachers in high-poverty schools do not even have a minor degree in their field. 
Our proposal will reduce class size in grades K-3 to a nationwide average of 18 by hiring more teachers. Under our proposal, states and school districts will be able to recruit, train and hire 100,000 additional qualified teachers in order to reduce class size and improve teaching and learning in these early grades. In the first year, Massachusetts will receive $22 million to support these efforts. We will also be working through the Higher Education Act to improve teacher training at colleges and universities. 
Our proposal will also help schools meet their urgent needs for construction, modernization, and renovation. Schools across the nation face serious problems. Many are overcrowded. Many others have antiquated facilities suffering from physical decay, with no ability to handle the needs of modern education. Across the country, 14 million children in a third of the nation's schools are learning in substandard buildings. Half the schools have at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition. 
Massachusetts is no exception. 41% of our schools across the state report that 
at least one building needs extensive repair or should be replaced. Three-quarters report serious problems in buildings, such as plumbing or heating defects. Eighty percent have at least one unsatisfactory environmental factor. 
It is difficult enough to teach or learn in dilapidated classrooms. But now, because of escalating enrollments, those classrooms are increasingly overcrowded. The nation will need 6,000 new schools in the next few years, just to maintain current class sizes. 
It will take over $100 billion just to repair existing facilities. Obviously, the federal government cannot do the whole job. But states and communities across the country are working hard to meet these needs, and the federal government should do more to help. 
This year, Revere, Massachusetts passed a $2.2 million bond issue to renovate the roofs on three of its seven schools. After these renovations were completed, a fourth school's roof started to leak. The leak is so serious that the school's new fire system is threatened. School Committee members estimate that fixing the roof will cost an additional $1 million, and they don't know where to get the money. 
Last year, half of Worcester's schools were not equipped with the wiring and infrastructure to handle modern technology. 
Enrollment in Springfield schools has increased by over 1,500 students, or 6 percent, in the last two years, forcing teachers to hold classes in storage rooms, large closets, and in basements. 
Our proposal will authorize states and local governments to issue $22 billion in bonds for school repairs and construction. Part of the amount will go to state governments and part will go to the 100 cities across the nation with the largest numbers of low-income children, including Boston and Springfield. The bonds will be interest-free for the states and cities--Uncle Sam will pay the interest. 
Our legislation also addresses the urgent need to provide effective activities for children of all ages during the many hours each week when they are not in school. 
Each day, 5 million children, many as young as 8 or 9 years old, are left home alone after school. Juvenile delinquent crime peaks in the hours between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. Children unsupervised are more likely to be involved in anti-social activities and destructive patterns of behavior. 
Our goal in this legislation is to encourage communities to develop activities that will engage children and keep them out of trouble. Crime survivors, law enforcement representatives, prosecutors, and educators have all joined together in calling for a substantial federal investment in after-school programs. 
Clearly, such financial assistance is needed in states across the country. Too often, parents cannot afford the thousands of dollars a year required to pay for after-school care, if it exists at all. In Massachusetts, 4,000 eligible children are on waiting lists for after-school care, and tens of thousands more have parents who have given up on getting help. Nationwide, half a million eligible children are on waiting lists for federal child care subsidies. The need for increased opportunities is obvious and this legislation attempts to meet it. 
Our bill will provide $1 billion over the next 5 years for after-school programs, to enable public school districts in partnership with community-based organizations to bring millions more children, including disabled children, into such programs, and make schools into community learning centers as well. 
This proposal will help communities to increase the availability of after-school programs. It will support efforts in Boston to make after-school services available to as many children as possible. Boston's 2-to-6 Initiative will serve an additional 3,000 young people over the next four years, keep school buildings open for city programs and non-profit programs, and challenge private sector leaders to double the number of available after-school jobs to 1,000 over the next two years. 
The proposed expansion of the 21st Century Community Learning Center program will enable schools and communities to create programs that meet their after-school needs--and obtain the extra resources required to make it happen. 
Our bill also proposes to help failing schools implement the reforms that they know will turn them around. Too many schools now struggle with watered-down curricula, low expectations, fewer qualified teachers, and fewer resources than other schools. 
Under the Education Opportunity Zones proposal, these school districts will get the extra resources they need in order to increase achievement, raise standards, end social promotion, upgrade teacher skills, and strengthen ties between the schools, the parents, and the community as a whole. 
The bill also calls for continued investment in education technology, so that cutting-edge technology will be available to as many students as possible. That means we must continue to invest more in computers, software, and high-tech training for teachers, so that every child has the opportunity to use technology as an effective learning tool. 
Investing in students and teachers and schools is one of the best investments America can make. For schools across America, help can't come a minute too soon, and I urge Congress to enact this legislation as expeditiously as possible. The message to schools across the country today is clear--help is finally on the way.

Mr. KENNEDY. 
Mr. President, today Senators Kerry, Reed, Akaka and I are introducing the America After School Act. With this legislation, I hope that we can do more to provide the care and activities that children need when they are not in school. 
Millions of parents today have no choice but to work outside the home. Over 17 million parents need someone to care for their children when the children are not in school. Many are able to find child care through friends or family, local centers, or school-based programs. But over 5 million `latch-key' children have no such arrangements and are left home alone. Our goal in this legislation is to encourage communities to develop activities that will engage our children and keep them off the streets, away from drugs, and out of trouble. 
In many cases, parents know the importance of enrolling their children in after-school programs, but cannot afford to do so. Child care costs thousands of dollars each year and is therefore out of reach for many families. Congress has responded by supporting an array of child care programs over the years, but the funding has not kept pace with the need, especially under The Welfare Reform Act which requires more and more parents each year to enter the workforce. As a result, hundreds of thousands of children are now on waiting lists for child care and after school activities. Help for these families and their children cannot come too soon. 
The entire country benefits when children get the care that they need. Health costs are lower. Parents' productivity at work improves. Education costs decline when children learn to cooperate in group activities, and when they can obtain help with their homework during after-school programs. The massive costs associated with juvenile delinquency, such as injuries to people, damage to property and police, courts, and corrections--are reduced when responsible after-school activities are available. By expanding after-school programs, we literally are investing in children, their future, and the country's future. 
Our legislation significantly expands after-school care, enabling more parents to choose safe, quality programs for their children. We primarily accomplish this goal by increasing the Child Care and Development Block Grants available to states, which subsidize child care for low-income families. Under Title I of this bill, we authorize a $5 billion increase in that program over the next 5 years. This level of investment is necessary to end the waiting lists, and provide after-school care for an estimated 2 million children from low-income working families. 
Communities with high concentrations of poverty and at-risk children will get priority in this funding, so that help will be available where it is needed most. No parent should have to make the cruel choice between pressing needs such as food, heat and shelter. The needs of disabled children are also specifically addressed. 
Our proposal builds on the experience of the Defense Department, which operates the world's largest child care program for members of the armed services. Over the past decade, they have developed a widely acclaimed model program. They have found that child-care quality is most effectively achieved through salary incentives tied to training. We get what we pay for. Child care workers are notoriously underpaid in today's society. Stronger incentives are needed in order to develop and retain a quality child care workforce. Our bill designates 25% of the block-grant increases for indirect services that include salary incentives tied to training for those who provide care. 
In addition, our bill enacts President Clinton's proposal to expand 21st Century Learning Centers which have proved highly successful in using schools as places where members of the community can engage in continuing education, recreation, community building activities and others. This program now only serves 100,000 children nationwide. Our bill contains a five-fold increase in grants by the Department of Education to local public schools. Under this increase, 500,000 more children will be able to participate in school-based programs before and after school. 
This bill also provides $1.25 billion over the next five years to expand grants by the Justice Department for after-school programs to prevent juvenile crime. Public and private agencies may apply for these grants, and awards will be made on a matching basis. Recipients must coordinate their efforts with state or local law enforcement to achieve maximum effectiveness in fighting crime. After-school educational and recreational programs in high crime neighborhoods will receive priority since children in these inner city neighborhoods face the highest risks. 
Hundreds of police chiefs, prosecutors, and crime victims have created an organization called `Fight Crime: Invest in Kids,' dedicated to promoting increased federal investment in after-school programs. A 1995 National League of Cities survey reported that 92% of respondents rank before- and after-school care as one of the most pressing needs for children and families--ahead of crime, welfare reform, education, housing and drug abuse. Over 70% of people recently surveyed by the Children's Defense Fund--Democrats and Republicans, women and men, young and old alike--believe that revenues from tobacco companies should be invested in child care programs. Hundreds of thousands of parents have put their children's names on waiting lists for child care and after school activities. The need is urgent and widespread, and Congress has a responsibility to act. 
The America After School Act, can be effective in meeting these needs and I urge the Senate to approve it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to take this opportunity to congratulate Northeastern University in Massachusetts as it begins its centennial celebration. 
Northeastern University began providing higher education in conjunction with the Boston Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in 1898. Since then, it has been a leader in providing quality higher education to large numbers of students. It currently enrolls 27,000 full-time students and has graduated over 137,000 students over the years. 
Northeastern University is also an impressive leader in the current effort to expand access to higher education. It offers the largest cooperative education plan in the country for students to combine work with college. It has also helped educators in other countries develop cooperative education programs. Thanks to Northeastern's leadership, universities in Africa and Asia now have significant programs in this important field. 
Northeastern also excels in numerous academic fields. It has an outstanding engineering faculty, and excellent engineering centers in electromagnetics, communications, and digital signal processing. With its newly created graduate program in Applied Science and Engineering, Northeastern is poised to engage in breakthrough scientific research. 
Northeastern is also a leader in creating partnerships with community organizations, educators, and businesses to deal with critical issues such as domestic violence and women's health. In 1990, Professor Clare Dalton founded the Domestic Violence Institute which works with community agencies to protect women and children who are victims of domestic violence. Recently, the Institute's initiatives were enhanced by a three-year grant from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for this critically important work. 
Northeastern's first hundred years have been filled with outstanding accomplishments and contributions to our state, our country, and the world. I am sure that in the years ahead, Northeastern will continue this proud tradition of excellence, and I congratulate the university on this auspicious centennial anniversary.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I, too, join in commending Senator Feingold, Senator McCain, Senator Lieberman and the others for their persistence and perseverance in advancing sensible and responsible campaign finance reform to the U.S. Congress, and, hopefully, we will address it in a serious way as they have addressed this issue and do so in the next few days. 
I will speak for a few moments about the underlying bill that is being proposed, and I suggest that this bill really is a sham in terms of proposing to protect the interests of American workers. 
The average American worker earns $12.51 an hour, just over $26,000 a year. These workers want a good retirement, a decent education for their children, safe neighborhoods and quality health care. But how can they compete on these issues in the political process when the fat cats spend far more in one political fundraiser or in one 30-second political ad than the average worker earns in a year? 
We must return election campaigns to the people, in which all voters are equal, no matter what their income, what job they hold or where they live. 
The current system is a scandal, and Democrats are ready to reform it right now. Every Democratic Senator--every single one--supports the McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill. The burden now rests squarely with the Republican Party. It is up to Republicans to decide whether Congress will reform the broken campaign finance laws or continue the unseemly influence of special interests in American politics. 
So far, all the Republican leadership in Congress proposes is more money in politics, not less. They want more money from their special interest friends. They want to silence working families and the labor unions for speaking up on issues they care about. That is what the Republican leadership calls campaign finance reform. 
The Republican proposal purports to help working families by regulating how labor unions pay for their participation in the political process. But for working families, this proposal is grossly unfair. It is the centerpiece of an agenda by big corporations and the right wing of the Republican Party to silence working families, not help them. 
The Republican leadership proposal is not reform but revenge--revenge for the role of the labor movement in the 1996 campaign. It imposes a gag rule on American workers, and it should be defeated. 
The bill is a sham. It does not protect the workers. It is designed to advance an antiworker, antilabor, antiunion agenda. 
It does not protect individual rights, as its sponsor claims. It singles out unions, but does nothing for corporate shareholders or members of other organizations. 
In fact, in the 1996 election, corporations outspent labor unions 11 to 1. Under the Republican proposal, big tobacco can still use corporate treasury funds to oppose using cigarette tax revenues to promote children's health, even if shareholders object. And the National Rifle Association can oppose a ban on cop-killer bullets even if NRA members object. But before labor unions can use union funds to speak up for working families, they would have to obtain written approval from every union member first. 
But it does not stop there. The antiworker Republican proposal before us today is only part of a larger, big business, right wing campaign conspiracy to deny working families a voice in their own Government. Already, proposals virtually identical to this one have been introduced in 19 States as ballot initiatives or as State legislation. The same people who fought the minimum wage and want to abolish labor unions--the same people who lead the charge in the Republican party for tax breaks for the rich--are also part of this coordinated nationwide campaign to block workers and their unions at every turn in Washington and State capitals everywhere. 
A recent editorial in a Nevada paper says it clearly as anyone. Nevada is one of the States where the right wing is pushing these initiatives. And the Reno Gazette journal spoke out against the proposal, saying: 
Beware of GOP Foxes in Labor's House. . . . Its main purpose is not to help workers but to weaken Democrats. . . . This petition is not intended to benefit the common man nearly as much as it is intended to benefit one specific class of politicians. . . . So when someone asks you to sign this Republican petition outside your favorite supermarket or elsewhere, think about what is really going on here. The scent of special interest fills the air like a convention of skunks in the hollow. 
This language applies equally to the Paycheck Protection Act that my Republican friends are advocating in the U.S. Senate. The Republican proposal is phony reform, and it should be opposed. Far from protecting the American worker, it is a prescription for disaster for millions of Americans and their families. I oppose it. My colleagues on this side of the aisle oppose it. I urge every Senator to oppose it. 
Senator McCain and Senator Feingold have proposed sensible reforms to ban soft money and to crack down on campaign adds by outside interest groups that are nothing more than thinly veiled appeals to defeat particular candidates. These are responsible reforms. And I urge my colleagues to support them. 
I thank the Senator for yielding me time.  
Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with the death of Roger Stevens earlier this month, the nation lost one of its greatest leaders in the arts. Roger Stevens was the Founding Chairman and unstoppable visionary for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. Just inside the entrance of the Center is a bust of Roger Stevens with those words inscribed to him. 
Roger Stevens was a real estate magnate who loved the excitement, energy and creativity of American theater. During his lifetime, he produced hundreds of plays and musicals, including many of the nation's all-time favorites such as `West Side Story,' `Les Miserables,' and `Annie.' 
It was Roger Stevens whose efforts and extraordinary ability created Washington's national cultural center which was later named for my brother, President Kennedy. The Kennedy Center today is truly the house that Roger built, and it is a wonderful living memorial to my brother. It presents the finest in the performing arts on its stages, and it is an extraordinary success. Washingtonians and an estimated million visitors to Washington each year enjoy its performances and educational programs. 
In St. Paul's Cathedral in London, there is a tribute to its great architect, Christopher Wren. It says, `If you would see his monument, look around you.' The Kennedy Center is a monument to Roger Stevens' too. 
I know that my brother would be very proud of the Center which bears his name. All of us who value achievement in the arts treasure the Center's continued pursuit of Roger's dream--that Washington will be a great center for the performing arts and that the Kennedy Center will present the best in plays, symphonies, ballets and operas from across the country and around the world. Roger Stevens made it possible for all of us to share in that dream--and the nation owes him a tremendous debt.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the legislative priorities announced today by President Clinton, Vice President Gore, Senator Daschle, and Congressman Gephardt. 
These priorities contain a number of major Democratic initiatives to protect Social Security and to help working families across the country on key issues such as jobs, education, health care, and the environment. And I look forward to their enactment this year. 
One of the pillars of our Democratic agenda is a commitment to raise the minimum wage by 50 cents in each of the next 2 years. Our proposal will increase the minimum wage from its current level of $5.15 an hour to $5.65 an hour on January 1, 1999, to $6.15 an hour on January 1 in the year 2000. In 1996, after a hard-fought battle in the last Congress, we raised the minimum wage by comparable amounts with no adverse effects whatever on the economy. The scare tactics about lost jobs proved to be as false as they are self-serving. 
A recent study by the Economic Policy Institute contains documents that the sky hasn't fallen as a result of the last increase. Raising the minimum wage does not cause job loss for teenagers, adults, men, women, African Americans, Latinos, or anyone else. Twelve million Americans benefited from raising the minimum wage, and they deserve the increase that we are proposing. 
To have the purchasing power it had in 1989, the minimum wage today would have to be $7.33 an hour. That figure is still well above the level that we are proposing. That fact is a measure of how far we have not just fallen short but actually fallen back in giving low-income workers their fair share of our extraordinary economic growth. 
In the past 30 years, the stock market, adjusted for inflation, has gone up by over 100 percent while the purchasing power of the minimum wage has gone down by 30 percent. We know who these minimum wage workers are. Sixty-percent are women. Nearly three-quarters are adults. Half of those who would benefit work full time. Over 80 percent work at least 20 hours a week. They are teacher's aides, child care providers. They are single heads of households with children. They are people who clean office buildings in countless communities across the country working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year. 
Minimum wage workers earn $10,712 a year, $2,600 below the poverty level for a family of three. Low-income workers don't just deserve a wage; they urgently need a raise. Nationwide, soup kitchens, food pantries, and homeless shelters are increasingly 
serving the working poor--not just the unemployed. 
In 1996, according to a recent U.S. Conference of Mayors study, 38 percent of those seeking emergency food aid held jobs, up from 23 percent in 1994. Low-paying jobs are now almost the most frequently cited cause of hunger. Officials in 77 percent of cities cited this factor. 
The American people understand the unfairness of requiring working families to subsist on a subpoverty minimum wage. 
I look forward to the early enactment of the increase we are proposing. Twelve million working Americans deserve a helping hand. 
In good conscience we cannot continue to proclaim and celebrate the Nation's current prosperity while consigning millions who have jobs to live in continuing poverty. No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty in the United States of America. 
The second pillar of the Democratic agenda is the Patient's Bill of Rights on health insurance. 
Few issues are more important to all working families than quality, affordable health care. Every family needs and deserves good medical care when a loved one is ill. Every family that has faithfully paid its premiums to its insurance plan deserves to receive the benefits the plan has promised. The American family knows that this promise is broken too often because unscrupulous insurance companies put profit ahead of patients. 
In movie theaters across the country today audiences erupt in spontaneous cheers when the character portrayed by actress Helen Hunt explodes in frustration over the callous treatment that she and her son received from her managed care plan. The movie `As Good As It Gets' has been nominated for major academy awards. 
But managed care today isn't receiving any awards, and neither is Congress for our lack of needed action to end these flagrant abuses. 
The problems are obvious. Insurance company accountants should not be allowed to practice medicine. It is time to guarantee women the right to see a gynecologist. No breast cancer patient should be forced by health insurance plans to have a drop-by mastectomy when hospital care is needed. No patients with a rare or dangerous disease should be denied the right to be treated by a specialist. No child's health or very life should be at risk because a parent feels forced to drive past the nearest emergency room to a more distant hospital that is the only hospital covered by the group plan. No doctor should be subjected to gag rules, financial incentives, or financial penalties to prohibit or discourage them from giving patients the best medical advice. Reasonable review procedures should be available to anyone denied coverage or treatment by their insurance plan. Patients with an incurable illness should be allowed to participate in clinical trials of new therapies that offer the hope of improvement and cure. 
The Republican leadership has told the special interests to `get off their butts and get out their wallets' to fight any legislation that puts the interests of working families ahead of the interests of unscrupulous insurers. But with the President and the congressional Democrats unified for reform, I am confident that we will prevail and that our Patient's Bill of Rights will be signed into law this year. 
A second health issue that is critical to millions of families is access to health insurance for those too young for Medicare but too hold for affordable private coverage. 
Our Democratic agenda offers these families immediate health and hope. We propose to allow them to buy into Medicare at a price that is far more affordable than the private market offers, if it offers them any insurance at all. 
Three million Americans between the ages of 55 and 65 have no health insurance. The consequences are often tragic. As a group they are in relatively poor health, and their health continues to deteriorate the longer they are uninsured. They have no protection 
against the cost of serious illness. They are often unable to afford the routine care that can prevent minor illnesses from turning into serious disabilities, or even becoming life threatening. The number of uninsured in this group is growing every day. 
Between 1991 and 1995, the proportion of today's workers whose employers promise them benefits if they retire early dropped 12 percent. Barely a third now have such a promise. In recent years too many who have counted on employer commitment have found themselves with only a broken promise and their coverage canceled after they have already retired. 
The plight of older workers who lose their jobs through layoffs or downsizing is equally grim. It is difficult to find a new job at 55 or 60, and it is even harder to a find job that comes with health insurance. 
For these older Americans who are left out and left behind for no fault of their own after decades of hard work, Democrats are offering a helping hand. By allowing these workers to buy affordable coverage through Medicare, our Democratic proposal is a lifeline for millions of these Americans. It provides a bridge to help them through the years before full Medicare eligibility. It is a constructive step towards the day when every American of any age will finally be guaranteed the fundamental right to health care. 
Our proposal places no additional burden on Medicare. It is fully paid for by premiums from the beneficiaries themselves and by savings from fraud and abuse. 
Democrats will fight hard for this commonsense approach to helping older workers and their families. And Congress should respond. 
In addition, on education, President Clinton and the Democrats in Congress have also made it a top priority to see that America has the best public schools in the world. We intend to do all we can to see that we have reached that goal. 
Successful schools need a qualified teacher in every classroom making sure that children get the individual attention they need. That is why another main pillar of the Democratic agenda is to provide 100,000 new teachers for America's public schools. The shortage has forced school districts to hire more than 50,000 uncertified teachers a year, or ask certified teachers to teach outside their area of expertise. One in four new teachers dot not fully meet State certification requirements, and 12 percent of new hires have no teacher training at all. 
In Massachusetts, 30 percent of teachers in high-poverty schools do not even have a minor degree in their field. 
Our Democratic proposal will also encourage State efforts to reduce class size by providing additional teachers needed to fill the smaller classrooms. 
Our proposal will also help schools meet their urgent needs for repair, renovation, modernization, and new construction. 
Investing in schools is one of the best investments America could possibly make. For schools across America, help can't come a minute too soon, and our Democratic proposal provides it. 
On key issues, such as the minimum wage, health care, and education, the Democratic priorities put working families first. 
Our proposals are investments in a better life for all of our families and a better future for the country. Special interests will fight hard to keep these proposals from becoming law. But Democrats in Congress and the President will fight harder because we know that the American people are with us. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to just take a few moments this afternoon to express my very warm appreciation to Senator Conrad for the leadership that he has provided in bringing together a variety of different views and offering on behalf of the families of this country an absolutely superb proposal that is focused on how we are going to reduce smoking for the young people of this country. 
This bill isn't the perfect solution, but I daresay that if this particular legislative proposal was enacted into law it would save the lives of millions of Americans. 
This has been a long process, Mr. President, since the first Surgeon General pointed out the dangers of smoking. This has been a constant effort over many, many years to try and address this issue in a comprehensive and responsible way. 
All of us take our hats off to the work that was done by the attorneys general that resulted in the June 20 settlement. But the legislation Senator Conrad has introduced today is really a very, very comprehensive proposal that, in many respects, may be the most important legislative undertaking that we will have in this Congress. 
Senator Conrad and the other members of the task force should be commended in putting this proposal forward so early in the Congress. We know we have maybe 90 days left in this session, but I daresay that our time could not be more beneficially spent than in the debate and the discussion of this legislation. 
I join with those in hoping that we can get thoughtful consideration of this legislation in the committee on the floor of the Senate. It incorporates the principles that have been identified by the public health community and those who have studied this issue over a long period of time which are most important in reducing smoking: 
No. 1, raising the cost of cigarettes in a substantial way over a short period of time. In addition, the counteradvertising measures are very, very important. Those two measures in tandem can make a dramatic difference in the number of young people who will smoke in the future. 
The strong FDA measures will also make sure the Agency will have the power and the authority to regulate nicotine and the other additives in cigarettes. 
I think the attention that was given in the secondhand smoking proposals and also in recognizing our responsibilities of promoting cigarettes overseas are very thoughtful suggestions in these areas. 
I want to add that I believe it is so important that the revenues that are raised from this proposal will give a substantial boost to programs that affect the children of this country. A very substantial part of the financial resources that are gained when this legislation is enacted will be focused on the children who have been the focus of the tobacco industry for over a long, long period of time. I commend the Senator and the task force for that commitment to the nation's children. 
Secondly, there is an equally strong commitment towards supporting the biomedical research which offers such extraordinary opportunities for breakthroughs, not only in children's diseases but in other medical conditions such as cancer, AIDS, heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer's Disease, and mental illness. 
This legislation can make a major difference in the public health of the nation by reducing youth smoking. It can also make a major difference to the children of this nation in focusing resources to make their lives more hopeful in the future. And it can make a major difference in terms of the biomedical research opportunities at NIH which offer extraordinary hope in finding treatments for some of the nation's most severe medical conditions. 
For all these reasons, this legislation should go forward. As Senator Conrad has pointed out, he welcomes the chance for others to join in strong support of this legislation, but certainly it is the challenge that is laid out here. Others will have views. We hope they will come forward. 
What we have heard so far is a deafening silence. I don't think the American people are going to tolerate a silence in blind opposition to what has been a very thoughtful, a very comprehensive, and a very detailed response to something that is of central importance to every family in this country. 
I commend the Senator from North Dakota for all of his work and indicate a great desire to work closely with him and the others to make sure this legislation becomes law. 
Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. 
Mr. President, the home health benefit available under Medicare plays a significant role in allowing elderly beneficiaries to remain in their homes and in their community. Those who use the home health benefit are among the most vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries. More than 40 percent have incomes below $10,000. One in three live alone, and two-thirds are over age 75. 
In recent years, the cost of the home health benefit has been one of the fastest growing parts of Medicare. While the vast majority of this growth is attributable to a legitimate increase in home health care as patients are moved out of the hospital more quickly, some portion is known to be due to fraud. As a result, Congress enacted provisions on this spending as a part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Unfortunately, it now appears that some of the restrictions will operate in a way that penalizes providers unfairly and jeopardizes their ability to continue to offer these vital services for the elderly. 
In order to address these issues, I am introducing legislation to delay the effective date of one provision, and to change the base year that will be used to calculate future home health payments. Congressman McGovern is introducing similar legislation in the House of Representatives. 
The problem with the current law is especially serious in New England. Home health agencies throughout the region generally provide care for less cost than the national average. For example, the average Medicare payment per home health visit in Massachusetts in 1995 was 19 percent below the national average. These programs are effective. They provide high quality home health care and help people to remain in the community and out of hospitals and nursing homes. And they do so in a cost-efficient manner. Nevertheless, the Home & Health Care Association of Massachusetts estimates that the provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 could result in a loss of 1.5 million home health visits--a 20 percent reduction--this year. Under the Act, Massachusetts and other states that provide high quality care efficiently and at lower rates are at a disadvantage, whereas inefficient providers are permitted to lock in higher rates. 
One of the most questionable effects of the Act requires home health agencies to comply with `per beneficiary caps' before the federal government tells them what the caps are. The bill I am introducing delays the effective date of the caps until October 1, 1998, to allow time for agencies to adjust to forthcoming, essential guidance from the Health Care Financing Administration. 
In addition, this bill moves up the year--from 1994 to 1995--that will be used to calculate payments for 1998 and beyond. This change means that payments will more accurately reflect the type of home care that is currently delivered. 
The problem facing home health patients and agencies is substantial. Congress should address this issue now, before home health agencies that provide needed services are unfairly forced out of business, and before senior citizens are forced to go without necessary care or leave their homes for more expensive hospital care or nursing home care. The provisions of the Balanced Budget Act should be modified to avoid these unfortunate and unnecessary problems.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join as a sponsor of the Economic Development Partnership Act of 1998, which will reauthorize and extend the important work of the Economic Development Administration in the Department of Commerce. 
The Economic Development Administration was established in 1965 to provide grants to help hard-pressed communities in all parts of the country to deal more effectively with conditions of persistent unemployment in economically distressed areas. 
Over the past thirty years, EDA has helped generate new jobs, retain existing jobs, and stimulate industrial and commercial growth in economically distressed areas across the country. By making assistance available to areas suffering high unemployment, low-income levels, or sudden and severe economic emergencies, EDA provides local governments with the resources to revitalize their communities, create jobs, and plan for long-term growth. 
In fulfilling its mission, EDA is guided by the basic principle that distressed communities must be encouraged to plan and implement their own economic development and revitalization strategies. 
I commend Senator Baucus and the Clinton Administration for their leadership on this important legislation, and I look forward to its enactment.

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 2 1/2 minutes. 
Mr. President, as the Senator from California has pointed out, we have someone who doesn't describe our position accurately and then differs with the position. And that is just what has happened here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
First of all, the committee which deals with these issues on public health has not had 1 day, 1 hour, 1 minute of hearings on this legislation. The distinguished Senator, Senator Bond, has said, `Couldn't we sit down and discuss these measures?' All we are saying is that a no vote gives us an opportunity to sit down in the committee and hear from the research organizations and the ethicists to try and draft legislation that is in the interest of the patients of this country. 
We have challenged those who support this legislation to mention one major research or patient group that supports their position. All we hear is about special interest groups that are going to benefit from this program. 
Do we consider the cancer society a special interest group? Do we consider the American Heart Association, the Parkinsons Action Network and the Alzheimers Aid Society special interest groups? If they are special interest groups, we are proud to stand with them. They know what is at risk. And those who support this legislation have not been able to bring to the floor of the U.S. Senate reputable researchers who believe that research towards alleviating human suffering will not be curtailed by this legislation. 
This has been pointed out effectively by the Senator from Florida and the Senator from South Carolina. This is not a partisan issue. We all want to have the best in terms of research for our families, for the American people and for the world. 
We are effectively cutting off opportunities to advance biomedical research if we impose cloture today. Let's give the committees the opportunity for full, open, informed, balanced judgment and then come back to the floor of the U.S. Senate and have a debate on this issue. Don't cut off one of the great opportunities for research in this country by voting for cloture today. I reserve the remainder of our time.

Our position has been embraced by virtually every major research group in this country. This vote isn't about a ban on the cloning of human beings. We have agreed on that principle. This vote is about preserving opportunities for major advances in biomedical research in this country. I hope the Senate will vote `no' on cloture.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President. I rise in strong support of Margaret Morrow to the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. She is well-qualified to serve as a federal judge, and she has already been waiting far too long for the vote she deserves on her nomination. 
Margaret Morrow was nominated in the last Congress in May 1996. Partisan politics prevented action on her nomination before the 1996 election, but even that excuse can't be used to justify the Senate's failure to act on her nomination in all of 1997. 
Margaret Morrow is a partner in a prestigious California law firm, and the first woman to serve as the president of the California Bar Association. She is a well-respected attorney and a role model for women in the legal profession. 
Her nomination has wide support. The National Association of Women Judges calls her `an extraordinary candidate for the federal bench, a true professional, without a personal or political agenda, who would be a trustworthy public servant of the highest caliber.' The National Women's Law Center calls her `a leader and a path blazer among women lawyers.' 
She also has the support of many prominent Republicans, because of her impressive qualifications for the bench. Representative James Rogan says that `she would be the type of judge who would follow the Constitution and the laws of the United States as they were written.' Richard Riordan, the Republican Mayor of Los Angeles has stated that the residents of Los Angeles `would be extraordinarily well-served by her appointment.' Robert Bonner, who headed the Drug Enforcement Administration under President Bush, says that Morrow is `a brilliant person with a first-rate legal mind.' 
I hope we can move ahead today her nomination. But I also want to express my concern over a related issue--the excessive difficulty that women judicial nominees are having in obtaining Senate action or their confirmation. An unacceptable double standard is being applied, and it is long past time it stopped. 
In this Republican Congress, women nominated to the federal courts are four times--four times--more likely than men to be held up by the Republican Senate for more than a year. 
Women nominees may eventually be approved by the Judiciary Committee. But too often their nominations languish mysteriously, and no one will take responsibility for secretly holding up their nominations. 
The distinguished majority leader has rightly noted that the process of confirming judges is time-consuming. The Senate should take care to ensure that only individuals acceptable to both the President and the Senate are confirmed. The President and the Senate do not always agree. But there is no reason the process should take longer for women than it does for men. 
It is time to end the delays and double standards that have marred the Senate's role in the Advice and Consent process. I urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Margaret Morrow and to vote for her confirmation.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know Senator Daschle wants to speak in favor of the nominee, and there are only 7 minutes left. I will take just 2 minutes, and then I hope that those who are opposed to the nominee will take what time they need, and then the time-honored tradition is that those who are in support of the nominee are generally accorded the courtesy of the last response. 
Mr. President, as we approach the vote, I want to point out that the various questions, allegations and charges that have been made to try to disqualify Dr. Satcher have been responded to, and none more eloquently than by our friend and colleague, the chairman of the Health Subcommittee of the Human Resources Committee, Senator Frist. 
I hope that those Members who have some questions in their mind have listened very carefully to those responses, because I think they accurately respond to the various allegations and charges. 
Finally, I just want to say that Dr. Satcher is uniquely well qualified. His life has been a life of service. He was one of 3 out of 70 students who graduated from his high school to go on to college. He graduated magna cum laude from his college. He was at the top of his class at Case Western Reserve University where he pursued a medical degree and a Ph.D. 
Dr. Satcher is a respected family doctor, researcher, teacher, and administrator, affiliated with some of the great universities of this country. He is an individual who has looked out for fairness and decency in the service to families in this country. Dr. Satcher has a unique background and it is due to this background that every single health organization, without exception, has endorsed Dr. Satcher. Every single one of them has endorsed him. The past Secretary of HEW, the very distinguished Dr. Louis Sullivan, has endorsed him as well. 
We are very fortunate to have Dr. Satcher as a nominee. I commend the President and look forward to a vote of cloture so we can get on with the business of getting him in place to serve the American public.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will cast one of the most important votes on health care in this Congress, and perhaps of this decade. That vote will determine whether one of the most promising avenues of research against a host of serious diseases will continue, or whether Congress will act to ban it--and condemn millions of Americans to unnecessary death and disability. 
The vote that will occur is on a cloture motion to take up S. 1601. The authors of S. 1601 say that it is a bill to ban the production of human beings by cloning--an attempt to stop Dr. Seed and other unscrupulous scientists in their tracks. 
But that claim cannot pass the truth in advertising test. S. 1601 goes far beyond a ban on the cloning of human beings, which we all support. This legislation also bans the use of the technology for any purpose, even though the research would be used to create cures for cancer, diabetes, spinal cord injuries, arthritis-damaged joints, birth defects, and a host of tragic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Lou Gehrig's Disease, multiple sclerosis, and many other serious illnesses. It is not necessary to ban all of this important life-saving research in order to achieve our goal of banning the cloning of a human being. 
Every scientist in America understands the threat this legislation poses to critical medical research. 
Every American should understand it, too. A vote against this bill is a vote for medical research. It is a vote for millions of Americans suffering from serious diseases for whom this cutting-edge technology offers hope of new and miraculous cures. 
A vote against this bill is certainly not a vote in favor of cloning human beings. Congress can and should act to ban the cloning of human beings. But we should not pass legislation that goes far beyond what the American people want or what the scientific and medical community says is necessary and appropriate. 
It should also be clear to everyone that there is absolutely no need to act tomorrow to prevent cloning of a human being.

Mr. KENNEDY. Senator Feinstein and I strongly support a ban on the cloning of human beings. We have introduced legislation to accomplish that goal. We hope that it can be reviewed through the normal committee process of hearings and mark-up. Responsible legislation to ban the cloning of human beings can and should be enacted. But S. 1601 is not such legislation. 
It is an attempt to capitalize on public concern to rush through a sweeping and unacceptable ban on a wide array of medical research. 
Every day, the concern about this legislation and the opposition to it grows. 
President Clinton and the Administration strongly support responsible legislation to ban human cloning. The President called for a ban on creation of a human being by cloning in the State of the Union message. If S. 1601 were simply a ban on creation of a human being by cloning, it would receive the Administration's wholehearted support. 
But that is not what S. 1601 does, and that is why the Administration says in its letter: 
The Administration . . . believes S. 1601, as introduced, is too far-reaching because it would prohibit important biomedical research aimed at preventing and treating serious and life-threatening disease. Therefore, the Administration does not support passage of the bill in its current form. 
As the scientific and medical community learns more about this legislation, almost universal opposition is developing. The American Association of Medical Colleges has circulated a letter to other scientific and medical organizations asking that this legislation not go forward. 
The letter is signed by 71 distinguished organizations, from the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, to the Association of American Cancer Institutes to the Parkinson's Action Network--and the list continues to grow. 
The letter states: 
The current opportunities in biomedical research are unparalleled in our nation's history. To ensure that these continue, the scientific and organized medicine communities urge you to oppose legislation that would prohibit the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer due to the grave implications it may have for future advances in biomedical research in human healing. 
The letter goes on to compare S. 1601's attempts to ban not just cloning of human beings but use of the technique itself to the ill-considered attempts to ban recombinant DNA techniques in the early 1970's. They state: 
Like the recombinant DNA debate, the scientific techniques involved in cloning research hold great promise for our ability to treat and manage myriad diseases and disorders--from cancer and heart disease, to Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, to infertility and HIV/AIDS. 
Just yesterday, Alan Holmer, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturer's Association's President sent up a letter to members of the Senate on behalf of our nation's research pharmaceutical industry members urging a `no' vote on cloture on S. 1601. 
He said: 
Pharmaceutical companies and their researchers are not, nor do they support, cloning entire human beings. However, without more deliberation and a meaningful opportunity for comment by the scientific and patient communities, we fear that passage of this bill also will foreclose a promising line of research. 
The research involves stem cells which, unlike most other cells of the human body, retain the ability to renew themselves and to differentiate into specialized cells. Based upon a better understanding of the differentiation process, scientists may be able to take the cell of a patient paralyzed by an accident, induce that cell to return to a primary state, and then coax it to differentiate into the spinal cord nerve cell needed by that patient. Such cells than could be transplanted back into the patient, whose body would not reject those perfect genetic matches. This procedure could help not only victims of traumatic injuries, but also patients suffering from diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, and other dread diseases that cause suffering and death, reduce the quality of life for both patients and their families, and cost our economy hundreds of billions of dollars annually. 
Any hope for such cell-based therapies would be stymied if this avenue of research were foreclosed. 
These are our great research pharmaceutical companies speaking, the companies we depend upon to turn basic research in the laboratory into medical miracles at the patient's bedside. And they are saying, `Stop this bill, because it could destroy our hope to find cures for these dread diseases.'

Mr. KENNEDY. Also yesterday, twenty-seven Nobel prize-winners submitted a letter opposing cloning legislation that would choke off critical medical research. The more the research community understands what the Lott-Bond bill will do, the more alarmed they become. 
An editorial in the New York Times this morning represents a growing sense of concern in newspapers around the country. The editorial is entitled, `A Slapdash Approach to Cloning.' It states: 
Senate Republicans are now rushing to enact a bill that would outlaw cloning a human embryo and, in the process, ban a valuable technique that could potentially cure a wide range of diseases. No wonder a slew of scientific associations and high-tech industry groups are urging more carefully constructed legislation. The sensitive scientific and moral issues involved here require careful handling, not grandstanding by politicians more interested in pandering than in reaching a reasoned solution. 
The editorial concludes: 
When the matter comes up for a floor vote this week, the Senate should postpone action and demand more considered deliberation. It would be a shame if the rush to ban cloning of people ended up crippling biomedical research.

Mr. KENNEDY. A letter from Dr. Gerald R. Fink, the Director of the Whitehead Institute of the American Cancer Society--one of the pre-eminent cancer research institutes in the country--explains very clearly what is at stake. 
Dr. Fink says: 
I am very concerned about efforts to bring the Bond bill to an immediate vote. While I agree that there should be a national ban on human cloning, it is essential that any such law protects areas of critical research that can benefit human health. The Bond bill's generic ban on the use of `human somatic cell transfer technology,' would in fact be quite damaging to medical research progress in the United States. 
The Bond bill would seriously limit our ability to develop new cell-based strategies to fight cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. It would also prevent vital research on the repair of spinal cord injuries and severe burns. 
I urge you to convey to your colleagues that the Bond bill would cause us to lose ground in the battle against deadly and disabling human diseases. 
Surely, what the Senate and the American people do not want to lose ground in the battle against deadly and disabling human diseases. 
More than 120 scientific and medical organizations have expressed opposition to the Lott-Bond bill or concerns about prohibition on legitimate cloning research as the result of ill-conceived or over-broad legislation. 
An immense array of scientific and medical societies and patient groups is opposing S. 1601. They urge us to use caution and not rush ahead without adequate consideration. Supporters of this bill say that it won't impede necessary research. If this is true, where is their support from people who know. I challenge them to cite mainstream scientific or medical organizations supporting their legislation. At the very least, we should not rush ahead without committee hearings, adequate definitions, or even a semblance of careful consideration. The scientific and medical and patients' communities know that such excessive legislation is wrong. 
The substance of this bill is objectionable, and so is the procedure by which it is being considered. To pass this bill tomorrow would be a travesty of the Senate's role as a deliberative body. 
This is one of the most important scientific and ethical issues of the 21st century. 
It was introduced on Tuesday of last week. 
It was put directly on the Senate calendar on Wednesday, with no referral to a committee. 
The Majority Leader tried to bring it to the floor last Thursday and filed an immediate cloture motion when he was unsuccessful. 
The Senate was not in session Friday--and few of our colleagues were present on Monday. 
This legislation has not received one day--not one hour of committee hearings here in the Senate. 
It has not received one minute of committee discussion and markup. 
The telephones in many of our offices are ringing off the hooks from scientists and physicians and patients across the country who are deeply concerned about the impact of this legislation. But he have had no opportunity for their voices to be heard. 
This is an important issue. It warrants Senate consideration. But it does not warrant consideration under this accelerated and indefensible procedure. 
The authors of this legislation know that it cannot stand up to public scrutiny, and they should not be making this extraordinary attempt to rush this legislation through the Senate. 
The Bond bill does not just ban cloning of human beings, it bans vital medical research related to cloning--research which has the potential to find new cures for cancer, diabetes, birth defects and genetic diseases of all kinds, blindness, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, paralysis due to spinal cord injury, arthritis, liver disease, life-threatening burns, and many other illnesses and injuries. 
Here is what the bill says--page 2, line 13, paragraph 301 is entitled, `Prohibition on cloning.' It is the heart of the bill. It states, `It shall be unlawful for any person or entity, public or private, in or affecting interstate commerce, to use human somatic cell nuclear transfer technology.' That is the end of the statement. It does not just ban the technology for use of human cloning. It bans if for any purpose at all. 
That means scientists can't use the technology to try to grow cells to aid men and women dying of leukemia. They can't use it to grow new eye tissue to help those going blind from certain types of cell degeneration. They can't use it to grow new pancreas cells to cure diabetes. They can't use it to regenerate brain tissue to cure those with Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease. They can't use it to grow spinal cord tissue to cure those who have been paralyzed in accidents or by war wounds. 
Congress should ban the production of human being by cloning. But we should not ban scientific research that has so much potential to bring help and hope to millions of citizens. As J. Benjamin Younger, Executive Director of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, has said:  
We must work together to ensure that in our effort to make human cloning illegal, we do not sentence millions of people to needless suffering because research and progress into their illness cannot proceed. 
Let us work together. Let us stop this unnecessarily destructive know-nothing bill. Let us vote against cloture tomorrow and send this bill to committee, where it can receive the careful consideration it deserves. Together, we can develop legislation that will ban the cloning of human beings, without banning needed medical research that can bring the blessings of good health to so many millions of our fellow citizens. 
Mr. President, I am delighted to join in this effort with my friend and colleague and our leader in this whole effort, the Senator from California, Senator Feinstein. 
Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.

But that claim cannot pass the truth in advertising test. S. 1601 isn't a bill to ban a brave new world of mass production of cloned human beings. It is not legislation to stop wealthy individuals from reproducing themselves at will in an unscrupulous and unethical attempt to achieve a kind of immortality. Instead, this legislation bans the actual technology used in human cloning research--the technology that could be used to create cures for cancer, diabetes, spinal cord injuries, arthritis-damaged joints, birth defects, and a host of terrible neurological diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Lou Gehrig's Disease, and multiple sclerosis. 
Every scientist in America understands the threat this legislation poses to critical medical research. Every American should understand it, too. A vote against cloture is a vote for medical research. It is a vote for millions of Americans suffering from dread diseases for whom the technology of cloning offers hope of new and miraculous cures. But it is certainly not a vote in favor of cloning human beings. Congress can and should act to ban cloning of human beings during this session. But it should not act in haste, and it should not pass legislation that goes far beyond what the American people want or what the scientific and medical community understands is necessary and appropriate. 
Senator Feinstein and I understand the importance of a ban on creating human beings by cloning. This is an ethical judgment I believe our society is ready to make. We have introduced legislation of our own that will accomplish this goal. We hope that it can be reviewed through the normal committee process of hearings and mark-up. I have no doubt that responsible legislation to ban the production of human beings by cloning can come through committee and mark-up and be passed into law during this session of Congress. But S. 1601 is not that responsible ban on cloning. It is an attempt to capitalize on public concern to rush through a sweeping and inappropriate ban on critical medical research. 
I have just received the Administration's statement of position on S. 1601. The President has taken the lead in directing a prompt response to the ethical and moral dilemmas created by human cloning. He called for a ban on creation of a human being by cloning in the State of the Union message. If S. 1601 were simply a ban on creation of a human being by cloning, it would receive his wholehearted support. But that is not what S. 1601 does, and that is why the Administration says in its letter, `On June 9, 1997, the President transmitted to Congress legislation making it illegal for anyone to create a human being through cloning. The President believes that using somatic cell nuclear transfer cloning techniques to create a human being is untested, unsafe, and morally unacceptable. 
The Administration, however, believes S. 1601, as introduced, is too far-reaching because it would prohibit important biomedical research aimed at preventing and treating serious and life-threatening diseases. Therefore, the Administration does not support passage of the bill in its current form.'

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as the scientific and medical community learns more about this legislation, almost universal opposition is developing. The American Association of Medical Colleges has circulated a letter to other scientific and medical organizations asking that this legislation not go forward. 
The letter states, 
The current opportunities in biomedical research are unparalleled in our nation's history. To ensure that these continue, the scientific and organized medicine communities urge you to oppose legislation that would prohibit the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer due to the grave implications it may have for future advances in biomedical research in human healing. 
They go on to compare S. 1601's attempts to ban not just cloning of human beings but use of the technique itself to the ill-considered attempts to ban recombinant DNA techniques in the '70's. 
They state, 
Like the recombinant DNA debate, the scientific techniques involved in cloning research hold great promise for our ability to treat and manage myriad diseases and disorders--from cancer and heart disease, to Parkinson's and Alzheimer's, to infertility and HIV/AIDS. 
As of this morning, the letter had been signed by 71 distinguished organizations, from the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, to the Association of American Cancer Institutes to the Parkinson's Action Network--and the list continues to grow. 
A letter from Dr. Gerald R. Fink, the Director of the Whitehead Institute of the American Cancer Society--one of the pre-eminent cancer research institutes in the country--explains very clearly what is at stake. Dr. Fink says, `I am very concerned about efforts to bring the Bond bill to an immediate vote. While I agree that there should be a national ban on human cloning, it is essential that any such law protects areas of critical research that can benefit human health. The Bond bill's generic ban on the use of `human somatic cell transfer technology,' would in fact be quite damaging to medical research progress in the United States. 
`The Bond bill would seriously limit our ability to develop new cell-based strategies to fight cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. It would also prevent vital research on the repair of spinal cord injuries and severe burns. 
`I urge you to convey to your colleagues that the Bond bill would cause us to lose ground in the battle against deadly and disabling human diseases.' 
Is this really what the Senate or the American people want, Mr. President? To lose ground in the battle against deadly and disabling human diseases? I don't believe so. 
More than 120 scientific and medical organizations have expressed opposition to the Lott-Bond bill or concerns about prohibition on legitimate cloning research as the result of ill-conceived or over-broad legislation. 
So you have this immense array of scientific and medical societies and patient groups opposing S. 1601 and urging us to use caution and not to rush ahead without adequate consideration. Our friends who are supporting this bill say that it won't impede necessary research. If this true, where is their support from people who know. 
I ask them to cite even a handful of mainstream scientific or medical organizations supporting rushing their legislation through without committee hearings, adequate definitions, or even a semblance of careful consideration. They can't do it. They can't do it, because the scientific and medical and patients' communities know that what they are doing is wrong. 
As objectionable as the substance of this bill is the procedure by which it is being considered. To grant cloture to this bill tomorrow would be a travesty of the Senate's role as a deliberative body. 
This is one of the most important scientific and ethical issues of the 21st century. 
It was introduced on Tuesday of last week. 
It was put on the calendar on Wednesday. 
The Majority Leader tried to bring it to the floor on Thursday and filed an immediate cloture petition when he was unsuccessful. 
The Senate was not in session Friday--and few of our colleagues are present today. 
This legislation has not received one day of committee hearings. 
It has not received one minute of committee discussion and markup. 
The telephones in my office are ringing off the hook from scientists and physicians and patients from all over the country who are deeply concerned about the impact of this legislation. But they have had no opportunity to have their voices heard. 
Mr. President, this is an important issue. It warrants Senate consideration. But it does not warrant consideration under this accelerated and indefensible procedure. 
The authors of this legislation know that it cannot stand up to public scrutiny. That is the reason for their extraordinary attempt to rush this legislation through. 
The Lott-Bond bill does not just ban cloning of human beings, it bans vital medical research related to cloning--research which has the potential to find new cures for cancer, diabetes, birth defects and genetic diseases of all kinds, blindness, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, paralysis due to spinal cord injury, arthritis, liver disease, life-threatening burns, and many other illnesses and injuries. 
Here is what the bill says--Page 2, line 13, paragraph 301 is entitled, `Prohibition on cloning.' It is the heart of the bill. It states, `It shall be unlawful for any person or entity, public or private, in or affecting interstate commerce, to use human somatic cell nuclear transfer technology.' That is the end of the statement. 
It does not just ban the technology for use in human cloning. It bans it for any purpose at all. 
That means scientists can't use the technology to try to grow cells to aid men and women dying of leukemia. They can't use it to grow new eye tissue to help those going blind from certain types of cell degeneration. They can't use it to grow new pancreas cells to cure diabetes. They can't use it to regenerate brain tissue to help those with Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease. They can't use it to regrow spinal cord tissue to cure those who have been paralyzed in accidents or by war wounds. 
Congress should ban the production of human beings by cloning. But we should not slam on the brakes and stop scientific research that has so much potential to bring help and hope to millions of citizens. As J. Benjamin Younger, Executive Director of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, has said:  
We must work together to ensure that in our effort to make human cloning illegal, we do not sentence millions of people to needless suffering because research and progress into their illness cannot proceed. 
Let us work together. Let us stop this know-nothing and unnecessarily destructive bill. Let us vote against cloture tomorrow and send this bill to Committee where it can receive the careful consideration it deserves. Together, we can develop legislation that will ban the cloning of human beings, without banning needed medical research that can bring the blessings of good health to so many millions of our fellow citizens.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I recently received an impressive letter from Boston Police Commissioner Paul Evans on Boston's current successful experience in reducing crime in the city, especially juvenile crime. Firearms homicides have plummeted, and the overall crime rate has dropped significantly. 
As Commissioner Evans states, `The keys to our effort in Boston have been prevention, intervention and enforcement.' The city's comprehensive approach includes not only law enforcement agencies, but the entire criminal justice system and community and social service agencies as well. As more and more cities become aware of this successful, anti-crime strategy, Boston is becoming a model for the nation on this vital issue. 
His letter goes on to say, `Our strategy relies on focused intervention, with smarter, tougher enforcement targeted at the very small group of hard-core offenders. We work closely with state and federal agencies to disrupt the flow of illegal firearms by mounting coordinated investigations and prosecutions of gun traffickers.' 
As Commissioner Evans emphasizes, the progress in Boston was made `without measures such as housing juvenile detainees and convicts in adult jails and prisons. The focus of policy and dollars should be intervention and prevention at the front end, and not incarceration in adult facilities at the back end.'

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I, first of all, again want to commend the Senate leadership for moving to consideration of the nomination of Dr. Satcher. It is long past time for the Senate to vote on his nomination to be Surgeon General. It is long past time for the country to have a Surgeon General and have an Assistant Secretary for Health. And it is important that we make a judgment, which we will do tomorrow. I believe there will be strong bipartisan support, as there should be, for this really extraordinary, outstanding nominee. 
I listened with interest and read a good part of the debate. Mr. President, the discussion thus far is a very brief sketch of Dr. Satcher's extraordinary achievements. He rose from poverty, obtained his doctorate and medical degree. He has been published in many of the scientific publications. He has been recognized with honorary degrees and various awards over the course of his lifetime. 
He has been endorsed by an overwhelming number of groups and organizations. When you look through the list virtually every medical association--the American Medical Association, the Academy of Pediatrics, the Public Health Physicians--and the list goes on and on; virtually all of the nursing associations; the hospitals; the principal pharmaceutical companies; the major academic centers; the Association of American Medical Colleges; virtually all the children's groups, such as the Children's Defense Fund, the Children's Health Fund; virtually all of the allied health groups, the Cancer Society, the Lung Association, the Public Health Association, the Association for Maternal and Child Health Programs, the National Mental Health Association; all of the disability groups, the March of Dimes, National Multiple Sclerosis--again the list goes on--women's groups, such as the Women's Legal Defense Fund, the Breast Cancer Coalition, the National Black Women's Health Project, the National Asian Women's Health Organization; virtually all the senior groups, the National Council of Senior Citizens; and very strong support from the various religious groups; virtually all of the civil rights groups, law enforcement societies, the other groups; family, violence prevention, and a number of extraordinary individuals. 
I do not agree with all of these organizations on all of their various matters, but the breadth of the type of support that we have here, virtual uniformity, the men and women who have judged him on the basis of his professional life and also about his commitment and caring, it is virtually uniform. And these are the men and women, the organizations, who over a lifetime have been associated with this really extraordinary individual. 
It is interesting. Are all these groups and individuals that support Dr. Satcher out of step with those that have spelled out their reservations about him? I daresay, this is about as mainstream a group of organizations as we would find in our country. Basically, it is a group of organizations that understand the extraordinary life and achievements and accomplishments of a very, very exceptional individual. 
Mr. President, Dr. Satcher's life story is the story of America at its best. He eminently deserves the Senate's overwhelming support and confirmation. 
Dr. Satcher learned his work ethic early. As a young boy in rural Alabama, he often rose before dawn to work on his family's farm before heading off to his segregated school. In addition to helping on the farm, he worked after school and on weekends in the foundry where his father worked for some 55 years. 
His extraordinary ability was evident early. He did so well in high school that he sometimes substituted for the school's chemistry teacher and other teachers when they were ill. 
Dr. Satcher rose above the poverty and racism of his youth to become a national public health leader. His early commitment to his family, his education, and his community reflect the best American values. Today, he is a respected family doctor. He is a respected researcher and educator and public health leader. He is a role model for everyone, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. 
Before becoming the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Satcher was President of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, the Nation's largest private historically black institution for educating physicians, other health care professionals, and medical researchers. 
This is a nominee whose whole life has been committed to making health better for fellow citizens, as an educator, practicing physician, and as a teacher. How fortunate we are to have this nominee. 
Earlier in his career, before he served as president of Meharry, he served as professor and chairman of the Department of Community Medicine and Family Practice at Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta. He served on the faculty of UCLA School of Medicine and the King/Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles, one of the top medical teaching schools in the country. 
For 5 years, Dr. Satcher ably led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the Federal agency responsible for protecting the Nation's health and preventing disease, injury and premature death. 
Dr. Satcher has many accomplishments as director of the CDC. In 1992, under his leadership, CDC developed and implemented the extraordinarily successful childhood immunization initiative. Before the initiative that was developed, only a little more than half of the Nation's children--55 percent--were immunized. Today, it is 78 percent. As a result, vaccine-preventable childhood diseases are now at record lows. He has borne an important responsibility. There are others that should share in those achievements, but Dr. Satcher was there and fighting and in a key position to make a very, very important difference--and he has, and he will. 
Dr. Satcher has also led the CDC efforts to deal more effectively with infectious diseases and food-borne illnesses. We rely heavily on CDC to provide the rapid response needed to combat outbreaks of disease and protect public safety. Under Dr. Satcher, CDC has implemented a strategy against new and re-emerging infectious disease, like tuberculosis, using better surveillance and detection. In response to recent food-poisoning incidents, Dr. Satcher has been instrumental in developing a new early warning system to deal with such illnesses. 
Dr. Satcher has received numerous honors and prizes, including the Watch Grassroots Award for Community Service in 1979, the Human Relations Award of the National Conference of Christians and Jews in 1985, 
Founders' Award of Distinction of the Sickle Cell Disease Research Foundation in 1992 and the Martin Luther King Jr. Drum Major for Justice Award in 1994. He was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences for his leadership skills in 1986; recognized again by the National Academy of Sciences as being one of the outstanding leaders in health policy and for all of his leadership skills brought into the Academy of Sciences. We are fortunate to have this extraordinary human being as a nominee. In 1996, he received the prestigious Dr. Nathan B. Davis Award given to Presidential appointees for outstanding public service to advance the public health. 
More recently, he received the James D. Bruce Memorial Award for distinguished contributions in preventive medicine from the American College of physicians. And the list goes on: the John Stearns Award for Lifetime Achievement in Medicine from the New York Academy of Medicine, and the Surgeon General's Medallion for significant and noteworthy contributions to the health of the Nation. 
Dr. Satcher's broad range of skills and experience and his strong commitment to improving public health make him well qualified to be the country's principal official on health care and policy issue--America's doctors. 
Today, the public is constantly bombarded with reports about new diseases from other parts of the world--from the Ebola virus to dengue fever to Hong Kong flu to mad cow disease. Yet there is no Surgeon General in office to educate the public about these threats and to dispel the widespread concern and fear about them. The public also continues to be confused about rapid changes in the health care system, especially on issues such as access and quality and cost and managed care. We need a Surgeon General who can address these challenges. 
For more than three decades, the Surgeon General has been effective in educating the public about the dangers of smoking. Now we know there are those that don't like that message and take it out on the messenger, and we understand that. 
At his hearing in the Senate Labor Committee, Dr. Satcher said with typical eloquence that he would like to `take the best science in the world and place it firmly within the grasp of all Americans.' That challenge is a big part of the job of the Surgeon General--to translate scientific research into plain talk that the public can use to improve their health. 
Dr. Satcher's nomination has received broad bipartisan support and is endorsed by a large numbers of organizations, including medical societies and all of the various groups I mentioned earlier. Clearly, he has the credentials, the commitment and integrity to serve brilliantly as Surgeon General and as the Assistant Secretary for health. 
Mr. President, some of the critics have raised questions about some of the particular issues, and I will respond to some of those. Some critics of Dr. Satcher have argued that he and CDC want to fund needle exchange programs that will increase the use of illegal drugs in the name of AIDS prevention. It is preposterous to suggest that Dr. Satcher would do anything to advocate the use of illegal drugs. Use of illegal drugs is wrong and is a major public health problem and a major law enforcement problem. The needle exchange is a strategy for preventing the spread of infectious diseases by providing clean needles in exchange for old ones. One to two million Americans inject illegal drugs. Sharing of needles is a leading cause of AIDS transmission. Approximately a third of all AIDS cases are linked to drug use. For women, 66 percent of all AIDS cases are caused by drug use or sex with partners who inject drugs. More than half of the children with AIDS contracted the disease from mothers who are drug users or their sexual partners. 
A report to Congress from Secretary Shalala in February of 1997 concluded that needle exchange can be an effective part of a strategy to prevent HIV and other blood-borne diseases. The GAO, National Academy of Science, National Commission on AIDS, and the 
Congressional Office of Technology Assessment have all concluded that needle exchange is an effective strategy. Despite the scientific and public support for such programs, a congressional ban on Federal funding of the program is in effect unless the Secretary of HHS determines that certain conditions are met. These include a finding that the program is effective in reducing AIDS transmission, and it has not encouraged illegal drug use. 
Dr. Satcher is an eminent scientist. He has recommended to Congress we allow scientific studies to answer the key questions involved with this issue. Dr. Satcher supports Federal funding for research and evaluation of State and local needle exchange programs to assess the effort. That is the extent of his position, to find out what the best in terms of science is going to provide, whether it does make a difference. That sounds to me to be a very reasonable and responsible position to have on that question. 
Some critics have alleged Dr. Satcher, as head of CDC, has been promoting a pro-gun-control agenda. In reality, Dr. Satcher, through CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, is simply carrying out a congressional mandate to collect data relating to all types of injuries that occur outside the workplace, including those caused by motor vehicle accidents, fires, and firearms. 
President Bush established the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control in the hope that just as the Federal highway fatality reporting system helps to reduce unintended death from automobile accidents, better information about other injuries would lead to better education and prevention programs. Recent public service campaigns have focused on such injury prevention strategies, especially children's safety, bicycle safety, seatbelt use, watercraft safety. 
Preventing violence is a public health issue and a criminal justice issue. Thirty-eight thousand Americans were killed with firearms in 1994; 17,800 were homicides, 18,700 were suicides, and 1,300 were caused by unintentional discharge of a firearm. Approximately 100,000 citizens are treated in hospital emergency rooms each year for nonfatal firearm injuries. 
The budget of the Center for Injury Prevention and Control amounts to $49 million a year or 2 percent of the overall CDC budget of $2.5 billion. Of the $49 million, only $7.5 million is spent on research concerning youth violence, and less than 11 percent of that deals with firearm-related violence. 
Even that is enough, listening to the speeches in opposition to Dr. Satcher--a center set up by a Republican President, that has these broad responsibilities, and people are flyspecking that there will be less than $1 million and, therefore, somehow he is going to violate second amendment rights. 
Injuries resulting from violence are preventable. CDC's purpose is to save lives. Firearm injuries have a huge impact on public health. We cannot ignore the issue. Instead of criticizing Dr. Satcher's efforts as a public health leader to address this serious problem, we should condemn the attempts by the National Rifle Association to shut down this important aspect of research into the causes and the prevention of injury. 
Now, critics have also charged that Dr. Satcher, as CDC director, conducted HIV studies on newborns and allowed them to be sent home without informing parents of the HIV status of their children. This survey was part of the Nation's effort to obtain more information on the spread of HIV in various populations. The survey was implemented through State and local health departments with support from CDC. 
In fact, the survey, which was initiated under President Bush, was implemented in 45 States, including the State of Missouri, when Senator Ashcroft was Governor of that State. He signed the papers. And as I understand it, the effort was made to continue at the time when they were going to halt this study.

I don't believe just from personal knowledge that it was, but I will provide the papers during the course of the debate with regard to this particular program which the Senator is familiar with because he has criticized it quite extensively. But it has been represented to me by the Department that this program was put in place while you were Governor. If you tell me it was not, I am willing to accept that, but I have been informed it was. 
I was not aware that you had been critical of it prior to the time that we had Dr. Satcher's nomination--or were critical of it at the time it was in place in Missouri, but all I am saying is you or your Administration signed the paper for these studies which you have been critical of and I want them in the Record.

Mr. KENNEDY. Senator, you will be able to explain it when we put it into the Record. 
This study was stopped by Dr. Satcher for some of the reasons that you are just mentioning at the present time. 
The point I was making here is that I listened to your very eloquent statement and criticism of this kind of a study last week, and then in the preparation for this debate found out, to my surprise, when it was initially proposed that your Administration signed on for it for the State of Missouri. 
Now, I am sure there are other changes, perhaps, that were brought about while you were Governor. That is fine. Whatever explanation you have on it--and maybe you were critical of it at the time that you received it. 
My information from the DHHS is that your Administration signed it and that you never expressed any criticism of it at the time that you were Governor, and that Dr. Satcher eventually halted it. 
I may be wrong in that series of time line, but that, at least, is my understanding.

<TEXT>
Mr. KENNEDY. I am familiar that he came with others on that. I think it is an open question whether he was lobbying for the continuation or not. 
Mr. President, this survey went on, as I mentioned, in 45 States. It began at a time when little was known about the impact of HIV on women and their children. Studies were carried on to check for the presence of antibodies to HIV in newborns. The presence of such antibodies could indicate that a mother has the HIV virus and the child has been exposed to the virus. Approximately 25 percent of the children exposed to HIV by mothers developed HIV infection, too. 
They were carried out by using blood samples left over from other procedures, which otherwise would have been discarded. The samples could not be identified as coming from specific individuals because the identifying information had been removed to protect confidentiality. 
At the time, because AIDS was so poorly understood, CDC decided to survey newborns as a group to learn more about the level of AIDS in particular communities at the time. Science offered no treatment for the newborns. The goal was to obtain information as quickly as possible about the prevalence of HIV in each population so that the resources could be targeted quickly and effectively. The survey adhered to the ethical principles, was approved by the Office of Protection From Research and Risk at NIH, the Institute of Medicine. The Academy of Sciences also agreed with using this well-established approach. No infants known to be HIV positive were sent home without parental notification. The information in the surveys was used by communities for education screening and treatment. 
In 1995, the survey ended when a combination of treatment options for infants with HIV and better ways to monitor HIV trends in women of childbearing age became available in September of 1997. Dr. Satcher recommended that the study be formally terminated, and HHS agreed. 
Some in the scientific community have questioned the surveys. Dr. Satcher's opponents cite the opposition of Dr. Arthur Ammann, the Professor of Pediatrics of the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. These clinical trials are support for their opposition. They ignore the fact that Dr. Ammann has endorsed Dr. Satcher.

Mr. KENNEDY. Dr. Wolfe raised some questions about ethical issues about the studies in Africa, and then we find Members of the Senate using his kind of statements and representations and saying, isn't this horrible, shouldn't we oppose it? And Dr. Wolfe is supporting Dr. Satcher. Then we have these studies and hear Dr. Ammann quoted here about how Dr. Ammann himself was very much involved in interacting with Dr. Satcher. He indicated his full and complete support for the nominee despite his concerns about these surveys. He stated, `I support the nominee.' 
We have heard it said considerable times over the past few days that these issues were never raised in the committee hearings. Dr. Satcher has the credentials, integrity, and commitment to be Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health, and he really is outstanding. 
I mentioned the other day, Mr. President, we have the extraordinary letter of support from Dr. Sullivan, who was the Secretary of HEW, a Republican under the previous administration, who is familiar with these various kinds of issues that are being raised and considered here on the floor of the Senate. He goes into analyzing just about all of them. I urge my colleagues who are having any questions about it, take the time, and I will include it in the Record.

Mr. KENNEDY. Dr. Sullivan goes through the studies and regimens and deals with those in a very responsible way--I would say we could call it an unbiased way. He has been the head of the whole department, HHS, under a Republican administration. He has known this man for a lifetime, and he has heard all of the charges we have heard last week. He discusses them and provides strong support for Dr. Satcher. It is a very, very powerful letter. I won't take the time of the Senate now to go through the letter. It is a very important letter, which I hope our colleagues will consider. 
Now, Mr. President, there are other issues. I would like to briefly address the AZT trials. Some of our colleagues have questioned Dr. Satcher's support for clinical trials of the drug AZT in foreign countries as part of the international public health effort to stop the epidemic of mother-to-infant transmission of the AIDS virus. 
Every day, more than 1,000 babies in developing countries are born infected with HIV. Clinical trials in the United States in 1994 showed that it is possible to reduce mother-to-infant transmission of HIV by administering AZT during pregnancy, labor and delivery. It was obvious, however, that such treatment would not be feasible in developing countries. It is too expensive and requires ongoing therapy, including intravenous administration of AZT, which is not possible in remote areas. It also prohibits breastfeeding, which the various populations that were the most at risk were following. Thus, the standard treatment in the United States termed the `076 Regimen,' was not a feasible option for the developing countries. 
Dr. Satcher could have washed his hands of the whole matter, but he didn't. He felt he could help. A group of international experts convened by the World Health Organization in June 1994 recommended research to develop a simpler, less costly treatment. Responding to the urgent need, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the World Health Organization, and other international experts worked closely with scientists from developing countries to find treatment that is feasible for use in these countries and that can reduce the devastating toll of HIV on their children. 
In cooperation with experts and leaders from countries where the studies were to be conducted and with careful input from ethical committees, it was recommended that placebo-controlled trials offer the best option for a rapid and scientifically valid assessment of alternative treatments to prevent mother-to-infant transmission of HIV. 
The decision to go forward with the trials was carefully made by the countries themselves and by the international medical research community. They did so because it was the only approach that could be expected to produce a sufficiently clear response, in a reasonable time period, to the questions that had to be answered about safety and effectiveness of an alternative treatment in the developing world. 
The point is made that they might have followed a different experimental design or a different regimen and could have gotten the outcomes, perhaps not quite as accurate, but fairly accurate, but it would have taken a good deal longer to receive the outcomes if they had not used a placebo. 
Dr. Satcher has acted entirely ethically and responsibly on this issue. The World Health Organization and the developing countries had urgently requested help from CDC and NIH in designing and conducting these trials. 
Before patients were enrolled in the clinical trials, they were specifically informed of their AIDS status. They were specifically counseled about the risks and benefits of participation, including the fact that they might be in a study group that received a placebo instead of an experimental AZT antivirus drug. I think that is an enormously important responsibility, that full information is available and that those 
who are participating in these various regimens have a full understanding of the risks. There is no indication that they did not. The best we have heard from those opposed to Dr. Satcher is anecdotal kinds of information. But we never heard that prior to the time that we had this opposition on the floor of the Senate to his nomination. 
As a practical matter, the only AZT treatment available to any women in these developing countries is the treatment provided to participants in the study. 
Ethics Committees in both the United States and developing countries conducted continuous, rigorous ethical reviews of the trials. The committees are made up of medical scientists, ethicists, social scientists, members of the clergy, and people with HIV. The role of these committees guaranteed that the trials conform to strict ethical guidelines for biomedical research, including the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical Research involving human subjects. 
Even those within the scientific community who have raised the concerns about these trials, such as Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, have expressed their support for Dr. Satcher's nomination. Dr. Wolfe has said that he thinks Dr. Satcher will `make an excellent Surgeon General.' 
Dr. George Annas and Dr. Michael Grodin of Boston University's School of Public Health have stated, `While it is true that we have expressed concern regarding the U.S.-sponsored trials in Africa, it is also true we strongly support Dr. Satcher's nomination as Surgeon General.' 
These judgments that are made on these ethical issues are complex, and it is very difficult to get virtual uniformity on some of them, particularly when they are at the cutting edge of various kinds of research. We understand that is part of the debate on these issues. 
But to those who have expressed a differing opinion regarding the various studies, even though every effort was made to go through the various regimens to make sure they adhere to ethical standards--and I believe, having gone through this in great detail myself that it certainly meets all of those standards--but the ones that have expressed some reservation by and large are enthusiastic about Dr. Satcher. It isn't that they reached a different conclusion with regard to this but they also respected the process Dr. Satcher followed. 
Again, this was not an issue during the confirmation hearings, not that we should be restricted from talking about it. But it is something that we welcome the opportunity to try to respond to. 
Some colleagues have also questioned Dr. Satcher's views with regard to abortion. Again, this was an issue during Dr. Satcher's confirmation hearing. But some Senators appear eager to use the controversial and unconstitutional Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act to attach his credibility. 
Dr. Satcher believes--as do most Americans--that abortions should be safe, legal and rare. His position reflects 25 years of medical experience and is entirely consistent with Supreme Court decisions. 
In fact, Dr. Satcher supports a ban on most late-term abortions. He believes that `if there are risks for severe health consequences for the mother, then the decision [to have an abortion] should not be made by the government, but by the woman in conjunction with her family and physician.' Dr. Satcher's position on this issue is shared by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Women's Association, the American Nurses Association, and the American Public Health Association. 
Some of our Republican colleagues have raised this issue in an attempt to defeat a supremely qualified nominee. They point out that Dr. Satcher's position on this issue is at odds with the position of the American Medical Association--but what our Republican colleagues don't point out is that the AMA has unequivocally endorsed Dr. Satcher's nomination.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, the Senator from Missouri asserted that the CDC funded an Illinois needle exchange conference `Getting the Point.' The H.H.S. informs us that the CDC did not cosponsor that conference. 
The Center's for Disease Control do not fund `needle exchange conferences.' CDC does make a number of small grants to local organizations to support HIV-AIDS prevention conferences, and awarded approximately $600,000 to 65 projects last year. The conferences can include such topics as community planning; HIV testing; counseling; referral and partnership notification; health education and risk reduction; public information programs; and training and quality insurance programs. The content of the conferences is determined locally, according to the needs of the community. However, CDC reserves the right to review the conference agenda. 
The only documents CDC located that were determined to be at all responsive to Senator Ashcroft's request on needle exchanges were documents related to an HIV conference in Denver, Colorado. After reviewing the agenda, which focused on the transmission of HIV through drug use and included sessions on needle exchange, CDC found it inappropriate for funding. CDC withdrew its award of $4,719 to the conference in October 1997. 
In March of 1996, CDC was incorrectly listed as a cosponsor of a conference held in Atlanta which included sessions on needle exchange. CDC did not fund the conference, which was held at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University, and Dr. Satcher did not participate in it. A CDC scientist participated in the conference to discuss the HIV epidemic among intravenous drug abusers. The scientist was unaware that Dr. Satcher had declined to participate in or sponsor the conference. Following the conference, one of the participating organizations released information listing CDC as a cosponsor. When the error was discovered the organization withdrew the materials. 
Dr. Satcher is opposed to illegal drug use, and would never do anything to encourage the use of illegal drugs. He agrees with the Administration's position. While the studies summarized in Secretary Shalala's February, 1997 report showed that needle exchange programs can be an effective HIV prevention strategy, the Administration has not yet found a similar degree of evidence on the question of whether such programs encourage drug use. Therefore, both tests--as mandated by Congress--have not been met. 
Senator Ashcroft has charged that HHS inappropriately withheld a copy of an intra-departmental transmittal memo when it supplied Senator Ashcroft with information concerning CDC's staff review of a University of California Needle Exchange study. 
The truth is that Senator Ashcroft received everything he requested from HHS less than 24 hours after his request was first sent to HHS by Majority Leader Lott's staff. Senator Ashcroft's request included `The CDC's 1993 and 1994 written reviews of the California Study', which he received with all the other materials. 
The transmittal memo in question, which was prepared subsequent to the CDC staff review as a cover note to a non-CDC official, was supplied to Senator Ashcroft several hours later when HHS realized that his staff was interested in additional material beyond his original request. 
The charge that this transmittal memo was inappropriately withheld is untrue. The memo is an innocuous six sentence cover note to the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health that summarizes the subject of the CDC needle exchange staff review and indicates that it was reviewed for scientific comment by staff of other HHS health agencies. 
If anything, the memo indicates how little Dr. Satcher and other top HHS public health officials were involved in the CDC staff review of the needle exchange study. In the memo, Dr. Satcher states that `Directors of these [public health] agencies have not been asked for final concurrence on the review.' 
It is also important to remember that the CDC review of the University of California needle exchange study was a scientific evaluation prepared by CDC career staff. Most of the work was completed before Dr. Satcher joined CDC on November 15, 1993. And as Dr. Satcher's cover note indicates, it was not intended to represent the views of the leaders of the HHS public health agencies.

Mr. KENNEDY. The subject of that transmittal was a University of California needle exchange study, commissioned in 1992 by the Bush Administration. The goal was to provide a scientific evaluation of local needle exchange programs. 
Senator Ashcroft has requested and received a review of the University of California study prepared by CDC scientific staff. The CDC review was conducted by career CDC scientists and the bulk of the review was done before Dr. David Satcher joined CDC. 
The CDC staff analysis was not intended to reflect scientific consensus within the Department of Health and Human Services, which must include the National Institutes of Health, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the Health Resources and Services Administration and the Food and Drug Administration. 
While scientific review of needle exchange issues continues, HHS has not yet concluded that the conditions set forth by Congress on federal funding of needle exchange programs have been met. 
Dr. Satcher has never advocated taxpayer funded needle exchange programs for drug abusers. He also believes strongly that we should never do anything to advocate the use of illegal drugs. The intravenous use of illegal drugs is wrong. It is a major public health problem as well as a law enforcement concern. 
Dr. Satcher does believe that to realize our goals of effective HIV prevention, it is vital that we identify and evaluate sound public health strategies to address the epidemic of HIV and substance abuse. 
Dr. Satcher, like Secretary Shalala, has recommended to Congress that we allow scientific studies to answer the key questions involved with this issue. 
Dr. Satcher supports the Administration's position as summarized in Secretary Shalala's February 1997 report to Congress that concluded that needle exchange programs `can be an effective component of a comprehensive strategy to prevent HIV and other blood borne infectious diseases in communities that choose to include them.' But, the Department has not yet concluded that the conditions set forth by Congress on federal funding of needle exchange program have been met. Specifically, it has not yet been concluded that needle exchange programs do not encourage drug use, one of the key standards set by Congress. The Department continues to look at the science on this issue. 
The federal government continues to fund the research and evaluation of state and locally funded needle exchange programs in order to increase scientific knowledge concerning their impact, if any, on drug use. But at present, this is, and should be, a local decision. Under current law and policy, local communities remain free to use non-federal funds to support such programs if they choose. 
Madam President, earlier today, the Senator from Missouri and I had a colloquy about surveys of child-bearing women for HIV. 
The surveys began in 1988 and the State of Missouri requested to participate in them from the beginning, including while Senator Ashcroft was Governor, the director of the division of administration signed on behalf of Missouri.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier today, a request was made to consider the cloning legislation that had been introduced by my friend and colleague, Senator Bond. Objection was made to the consideration of that legislation by the Senator from California. 
I want to just indicate to our Members that I think Senator Feinstein was quite right to file that objection. Many of us who are on the Labor Committee believed we would be debating the Satcher nomination this afternoon. It is an enormously important matter that has been delayed too long. We have an outstanding nominee. In fairness, we should be continuing that debate today. The leadership has decided to move on to this cloning legislation. 
I believe that this legislation that is being proposed is one 
of the most important scientific and ethical issues of the 21st century. The legislation itself was introduced 2 days ago. It was put on the calendar 1 day ago. It has not received 1 day of committee hearings. It has not received 1 minute of committee markup. This legislation is a matter of enormous significance and importance to the research communities all across this country and they understand that this legislation does not only impact human cloning. 
As the research community has pointed out, technologies that would be banned under Senator Bond's bill offer the key for reaching resolution of a number of very important diseases: Cancer, diabetes, birth defects, arthritis, organ failure, genetic diseases, severe skin burns, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy, and spinal cord injuries. Stem cells may be the key to reproducing nerve cells, which is not possible today, and other cells that may be used to treat Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Lou Gehrig's disease. The major researchers in every one of these areas oppose strenuously the Bond legislation because they believe that it will provide a significant barrier to meaningful progress in a number of promising research areas. 
I will be delighted to discuss these issues, as Senator Feinstein believes we should, in a timely way so that we can at least have an opportunity to consider these measures in the committee and report those out. 
Therefore, I join Senator Feinstein in objecting to the consideration of cloning legislation at this time. We have introduced legislation of our own on this subject. We hope that the Senate will consider it in due course, and that we can work out an acceptable compromise on this issue to give it the careful action it deserves. A rush to enact bad legislation on this subject would be far worse than passing no legislation at all. Every scientist in America understands that, and the American people should understand it, too. 
Several months ago, the world learned of one of the most astounding developments in modern biology--the cloning of a sheep named Dolly. This incredible scientific achievement awakened widespread concern about the possibility of a brave new world, in which human beings would be made to order and where individuals would seek to achieve a kind of immortality by reproducing themselves. There is widespread agreement among scientists, ethicists, and average Americans that production of human beings by cloning should be prohibited. 
The President reacted rapidly and responsibly to this scientific advance and the unprecedented issues it raised by asking the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to study the issue and make recommendations. The Commission recommended that creation of human beings by cloning should be banned for at least five years, and the Administration has submitted legislation to implement this recommendation. 
The legislation that Senator Feinstein and I have introduced will assure the American public that reproducing human beings by cloning will be prohibited. It follows the President's legislation and the recommendations of the Commission. It makes it illegal to produce human beings by cloning, and establishes strict penalties for those who try to do so. 
If the legislation the Majority Leader is seeking to call up achieved this objective, I believe that it would be passed unanimously by the Senate. Unfortunately, it goes much farther. It does not just ban cloning of human beings, it bans vital medical research related to cloning--research which has the potential to find new cures for cancer, diabetes, birth defects and genetic diseases of all kinds, blindness, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, paralysis due to spinal cord injury, arthritis, liver disease, life-threatening burns, and many other illnesses and injuries. 
All of these various kinds of research have broad support in Congress and the country. A blunderbuss ban on cloning research would seriously interfere with this important and life-saving research, or even halt it altogether. Scientists, physicians and other health professionals, biotechnology companies, pharmaceutical companies, and citizens and patients working with organizations such as the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Parkinson's Action Network, the AIDS Action Council, the American Diabetes Association, and the Candlelighter's Childhood Cancer Foundation understand this. The Senate should understand it, too. 
Let me read from a letter signed by the organizations I have just cited and many others as well and sent to members of Congress on January 26, 1998. The participating organizations said, `We oppose the cloning of a human being. We see no ethical or medical justification for the cloning of a human being and agree . . . that it is unacceptable at this time for anyone in the public or private sector, whether in a research or clinical setting, to create a human child using somatic cell nuclear transfer technology.' 
But they go on to say, `Poorly crafted legislation to ban the cloning of human beings may put at risk biomedical research.' 
They point to a long list of diseases where cloning research could be critical, including cancer, diabetes, allergies, asthma, HIV/AIDS, eye diseases, spinal cord injuries, Guillain-Barre syndrome, Gaucher disease, stroke, cystic fibrosis, kidney cancer, Alzheimer's disease'--the list goes on and on. 
They conclude: `We urge the Congress to proceed with extreme caution and adhere to the ethical standard for physicians, `first 
do no harm.' We believe that there are two distinct issues here, cloning of a human being and the healing that comes from biomedical research. Congress must be sure that any legislation which it considers does no harm to biomedical research which can heal those with deadly and debilitating diseases.' 
These are reasonable tests for legislation in this important area. First, do no harm. Proceed with extreme caution. No one can pretend that the legislation the Majority Leader is seeking to call up meets these tests? 
Proceed with extreme caution! The Majority Leader's legislation was introduced on Tuesday of this week. There has not been a single day of hearings held on it. Not one single day. I doubt that more than a few members of this body have even had the opportunity to read the legislation. 
Many of our offices have been deluged with calls from health organizations, scientific bodies, and individual scientists and physicians who are seriously concerned about the damage this bill may do to fundamental research and to possible discovery of long-sought cures for dread diseases. Within a few days, we will have dozens if not hundreds of distinguished scientific bodies and disease societies expressing their opposition to this bill in its current form. As far as I know, there is not a single major scientific body of any stature that has endorsed this legislation. 
What is the rush? What is the rush? It is not as if, despite the absurd publicity given to Richard Seed, a baby will be cloned tomorrow. To quote again from the letter I cited earlier, `The American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the Biotechnology Industry Organization, and the Federation of American Societies of Experimental Biology have all stated that their members will not seek to clone a human being. These three associations include essentially every researcher or practitioner in the United States who has the scientific capability to clone a human being.' 
It is also important to recognize that the Food and Drug Administration already has broad jurisdiction over human cloning, and would act vigorously to shut down any clinic that operates without FDA approval. Such approval depends on a finding that human cloning is safe and effective. But given the current state of science, no human cloning procedure could possibly be called safe at this time. The FDA approval process is not a permanent ban on human cloning, but it effectively bans the procedure for the near future. 
So we have a situation where the procedure is not yet perfected, where the scientists who are competent to clone a human being say that they will not do it, and where the FDA already has the legal tools and responsibility to prevent it. We do not need to act today--and we should not act today--because this bill goes far beyond the simple prohibition of the creation of a human being by cloning. 
The sponsors of this legislation state that all they want to do is ban cloning of a human being and that they do not want to interrupt important research. But their bill goes far beyond that, and it does not deserve to pass. 
This bill would clearly interfere with medical research that offers hope for a cure of many deadly diseases. A letter I received two days ago from leaders of the Society for Developmental Biology states: `As active researchers in developmental biology, we understand the implications of the Dolly cloning results for basic science and human health.' These techniques are essential for basic research because, as the letter goes on to say, `Many diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases (such as Parkinson's Disease) involve the depletion or destruction of a particular cell type. One of the great hopes in medicine is to learn ways to replace the lost or damaged cells, for example by stimulating the body to regenerate its own missing cells or by growing the cells in culture and providing them to patients. The main obstacle is that most of the needed cell types cannot be grown in culture, nor can their growth be stimulated in any known way. Dolly was grown from the nucleus of an adult cell, proving 
that the genetic material of an adult body cell can be reprogrammed by the egg to restore the genetic potential for specializing into all possible cell types. Basic research on genetic programming will likely lead to novel transplantation therapies for numerous human diseases. In essence, we all carry in our cells a library of all the information needed to build a healthy human, and Dolly proves that the information can be reactivated and used again. What are the implications? For example, instead of diabetes meaning a lifetime of insulin injections accompanied by serious side effects, perhaps we can learn how to cause the reactivation of pancreas development genes and the regeneration of the missing cell types. Such exciting ideas are no longer far-fetched.' 
The key ingredients of this research offer great hope. DNA from an adult cell is placed in an egg cell that has had its own DNA removed. The egg cell then begins to grow and divide under the instructions of the adult cell DNA. The procedure involves what is called `somatic cell nuclear transfer technology.' In the case of Dolly, the technology was used to create a sheep embryo from an adult sheep cell. The embryo was implanted in the womb of the female sheep and ultimately resulted in the birth of a baby sheep named Dolly. 
The legislation that Senator Feinstein and I have introduced makes it illegal to implant a human embryo using this technique in a woman's womb. Without that, no baby, no human being can be created by current cloning technology. This is what Dr. Seed says he is going to do. This is what most ethicists oppose. This is what the American people want banned--and our legislation will do it. 
But the bill proposed by the Majority Leader will go much farther. It will block this new technology in all other cases as well. It will make it impossible to carry out the research that the overwhelming majority of scientists and researchers say is so important. It will make it impossible to use this new technology to grow cells that can be used to cure diabetes or cancer or Alzheimer's disease or spinal cord injury. 
The Majority Leader's bill--page 2, line 13, paragraph 301 is entitled, `Prohibition on cloning.' It is the heart of the bill. It states, `It shall be unlawful for any person or entity, public or private, in or affecting interstate commerce, to use human somatic cell nuclear transfer technology.' That is the end of the statement. It does not just ban the technology for use in human cloning. It bans it for any purpose at all. 
That means scientists can't use the technology to try to grow cells to aid men and women dying of leukemia. They can't use it to grow new eye tissue to help those going blind from certain types of cell degeneration. They can't use it to grow new pancreas cells to cure diabetes. They can't use it to regenerate brain tissue to help those with Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease. They can't use it to regrow spinal cord tissue to cure those who have been paralyzed in accidents or by war wounds. 
Congress should ban the production of human beings by cloning. We should not slam on the brakes and have scientific research that has so much potential to bring help and hope to millions of citizens. As J. Benjamin Younger, Executive Director of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, has said: 
`We must work together to ensure that in our effort to make human cloning illegal, we do not sentence millions of people to needless suffering because research and progress into their illness cannot proceed.' 
Let us work together. Let us stop this know-nothing and unnecessarily destructive bill. Together, we can develop legislation that will ban the cloning of human beings, without banning needed medical research that can bring the blessings of good health to so many millions of our fellow citizens. 
I bet you could take the legislation that we are talking about here, and I bet there aren't three Members of this Senate who have read this legislation. They could not. It was just out yesterday. And most of the Members have been involved in the various other measures. And we are being asked to vote on it. No committee, no explanation, absolutely none that is going to affect very, very important research. 
That is not the way that we are going to try and move on into the next millennium, which is really the millennium of the life sciences. As science, as chemistry and physics have been in our past history, life sciences are going to be the key to the next millennium. And we want to make sure that we are going to meet our responsibilities and our opportunities in a way that is going to bring credit to the kind of research and can help make an enormous difference to families all over this country and really all over the world.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I want to express the appreciation of all of us to the majority leader for scheduling this nomination promptly in this session. I thank the majority leader for scheduling this Satcher nomination, and also for filing the cloture motion. 
We had an opportunity to make the presentation, and the excellent presentation by Senator Frist yesterday, which I thought was just so compelling. There were those who took some issue with the record of Dr. Satcher. But I do believe that at the end of the day yesterday the membership would be convinced of the quality of this extraordinary nominee and the incredible opportunity that all America has for his service when he is confirmed, which I expect will be on Tuesday next. 
So we look forward to the opportunity to vote and to hopefully see Dr. Satcher in that important position. 
In response to questions raised yesterday, I also am including a copy of a letter from Dr. Harold Varmus, Director of the National Institutes of Health, to Senator Ashcroft regarding studies of maternal-to-infant transmission of HIV in developing countries.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to join Senator Byrd and others who were speaking today in support of prompt action on an issue of major importance to the country--the ISTEA reauthorization that will set the country's course for the next six years on transportation policy and investments. 
I noticed the majority leader had indicated that there were some differences about the consideration of that proposal last year. 
But the fact of the matter remains that when I look over what we are involved in outside of the Dr. Satcher nomination, it seems that we certainly would have the opportunity for the consideration of the ISTEA reauthorization. And looking over the anticipated schedule, I would think that we could deal with this, and deal with it appropriately, certainly before the February recess. I don't know what else has been placed on the schedule prior to that time next week. Certainly we would make time for any kind of consideration or resolution on the issues of Iraq. But barring that, it would seem to me that reauthorization could be dealt with by that particular time. 
This debate has major ramifications, not only for the Nation's transportation system, but for the economy and the environment. 
What Congress does with this legislation will, in many ways, define the degree to which communities across the country will be able to take full advantage of the possibilities for economic development and growth in the years ahead. Without a modern, safe and efficient transportation network, America's businesses can't compete as efficiently, America's cities can't be revitalized as effectively, and America's families will lose valuable time in the daily struggle to move from home to work, and carry out all the other responsibilities of daily life. 
This legislation will also have a major impact on the environment, as we debate what direction the law should take. A major goal is to preserve and strengthen the innovative intermodal approach established under the original ISTEA, including special emphasis on public transit, the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program, bikeways and other initiatives that enhance the quality of life in our communities. 
I hope we will be able to build on the original ISTEA law, sustaining its innovative programs and laying the foundation for greater economic growth. To do that, we need to make a substantially larger investment that will address the many urgent transportation needs facing the country, and also facing my own State of Massachusetts that has some very special needs. 
I commend Senator Byrd for his extraordinary leadership on all of these vital infrastructure issues. The amendment he proposed last fall will make a significant difference for all states, enabling us to meet all of the new challenges more effectively. 
I think he makes a compelling case. Let the Senate make its judgments. Let the Senate decide. It is difficult to justify and say we are not going to let the Senate decide because we might have the votes for a particular position, which is at least partly delaying the opportunity to consider the legislation. 
We can't afford to have this important debate drag on into the months ahead. The country's transportation needs are urgent and can't wait. We should take up the ISTEA legislation and complete action on it promptly, to avoid paralysis in critical ongoing work involving transportation construction, public transit operations, traffic safety programs, and other issues that demand attention. 
Mr. President, I may have more to say on this subject. I know that the Senate is anxious to recess in order to hear the full report of the Secretary of State. 
So I will yield at this time and hope that the Senate will follow the leader's motion for adjournment.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to join in commending my friend and colleague, the Senator from Tennessee, Senator Frist, for an excellent presentation. During the consideration of the nominee, he was careful with his questions, probing with his questions, and obviously prepared prior to the time of the nominee's presentation and during the course of the hearings. 
I think today we see the result of some very hard and disciplined and informed judgment based upon his evaluation of this extraordinary nominee for the position of Surgeon General and the Assistant Secretary. I listened with great interest to his very detailed description of the great opportunities for this Nation when we gain the service of Dr. Satcher in that position as Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health. 
I heard with great interest, again, his response to a number of the allegations, quite frankly, misrepresentations that have been made about Dr. Satcher's record. I must say that I find myself in agreement with his understanding of Dr. Satcher's position, and as to his representation to the committee during the course of the nominee's presentation, and in response to various questions. 
I also want to commend the chairman of our committee, Senator Jeffords, for the work that he has done in both scheduling Dr. Satcher for the hearings, for the way that the hearings were conducted, the balance and the fairness which is so much a part of everything that he is associated with, and for his compelling statement as well. 
I am very hopeful that the Senate will have the opportunity to vote on this truly outstanding nominee in the not too distant future. This position has been vacant for a very considerable period of time. We have an outstanding recommendation by the President, a truly outstanding nominee, an outstanding candidate, an outstanding individual on the issues of public health. The position of Surgeon General needs to be addressed if we are going to be responsive to the concerns of our families in this country. We have had, quite frankly, enough delay on this outstanding nominee. It is time to act. 
Mr. President, I commend the leadership for bringing to the floor the nomination of David Satcher to be Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health. Dr. Satcher is extremely well qualified for this position. In fact, his life story is a tribute to the strength and vitality of the American dream. Dr. Satcher was raised on a farm in rural Alabama. He was one of 10 children. His mother was a homemaker and his father was a foundry worker. Neither of his parents finished elementary school, and between them, they never earned more than $10,000 a year. 
The defining moment of Dr. Satcher's extraordinary life may well have occurred when he was a toddler. It was then, at the age of two, that he survived a near fatal attack with whooping cough. Although whooping cough had been a leading cause of death among young children in the United States, it would become much rarer by the time he was born. But the vaccine was not available to Dr. Satcher's family. They were poor African Americans living in the rural South. They had limited access to medical care, and none of the white doctors who practiced in the area would treat black patients. Fortunately, Dr. Satcher's father was able to talk a black physician in the area into making a house call and, against all odds, Dr. Satcher survived this dire illness. Largely as a result of this experience, he decided he wanted to become a doctor. He stated that he wanted to `make the greatest difference for the people who I thought have the greatest need.' 
Mr. President, he repeated that during the course of these hearings. Anyone who was in that room at that time and had an opportunity to listen to Dr. Satcher make that statement and make that commitment would not be on the floor of the Senate now urging rejection of this nominee. His commitment was to make `the greatest difference for the people who I thought had the greatest need.' That was a statement made with extraordinary humility. By someone else, it might have a different ring. But when you were there listening to Dr. Satcher make that statement, you could not help but know that he has been committed to that cause over the course of his extraordinary life, and it has been an extraordinary life. 
Dr. Satcher's parents wanted their children to get the best education they could as black children attending segregated schools in rural Alabama. Dr. Satcher was valedictorian of his high school class. He was one of only three students, out of a class of seventy, who went on to college. 
He attended Morehouse College in Atlanta, which awarded him a full scholarship. He graduated magna cum laude and was elected Phi Beta Kappa. 
I have heard comments on the floor that `the United States is entitled to the best.' Three out of seventy graduated from his high school and he goes on to college with a scholarship and graduates magna cum laude. We have the best, Mr. President. We have the best in this nominee. 
He went on to medical school at Case Western Reserve University, a first-rate, tough medical school. I have had the opportunity to visit that excellent school, and it is one of our best, and it's tough academically, it's vigorous. He was one of only two African American students. He became the first black student to receive a Ph.D. degree and M.D. degree simultaneously. 
He was also elected to Alpha Omega Alpha Honor Society. After finishing his residency at the University of Rochester, Dr. Satcher went to Los Angeles to join the hypertension clinic at the Martin 
Luther King, Jr. General Hospital in Watts. I have had the chance to go to that hospital, and it is right on the firing line, in terms of trying to meet human need. He went on to direct research on Sickle Cell Anemia at the King-Drew Sickle Cell Center there, and he founded and chaired the King-Drew Department of Family Medicine. He opened a free clinic in Watts, in the basement of a Baptist church that he had joined, and he served as its medical director until 1979. 
Mr. President, just keep following along this extraordinary life of commitment to others, and of excellence, in terms of the practice of compassion and reaching out to those who are the hardest pressed. 
From 1974 to 1979, he taught epidemiology at UCLA, one of the top medical schools. Dr. Satcher then returned to Morehouse College to chair the Department of Community Medicine and Family Practice. In 1982, he became president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville and served in that capacity for 10 years, where he is credited for helping to deal effectively with the college's financial problems. 
Whether you are talking about going out into the most difficult areas and opening a free clinic in the bottom of a church and trying to help and assist people, whether you are talking about being in the classrooms at UCLA as an instructor to the brightest minds in our country, whether you are talking about being a college president, he has done it all. He has done it all, Mr. President. But his heart is out there with the underserved people. You can't look at his record, and you can't read about it and listen to him and not understand it. 
Since 1992, Dr. Satcher has ably led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the agency responsible for protecting the Nation's health and preventing disease, injury and premature death. In this capacity he has played a leading role in safeguarding and improving the health of all Americans. 
In 1992, under Dr. Satcher's leadership, CDC developed and implemented a very successful childhood immunization initiative. Before the initiative, only a little more than half of the Nation's children--55 percent--were immunized. Today, the figure is 78 percent, and vaccine-preventable childhood diseases are now at a record low. 
Dr. Satcher would be the first to say: I don't deserve all the credit for this. He would say: I don't even deserve a great deal of the credit, or even a little of the credit. 
But he would tell you that he was out there fighting every step of the way with those who do deserve the credit. He was there, and he deserves great credit for this because he made it a priority. It was in terms of not only the availability and accessibility of vaccines, but it was working to try and overcome the kinds of resistance that exists in so many communities locally across this country that he was able to devise strategies to work this through. I find that in my own State of Massachusetts, in a number of different communities, there is a great hesitancy or resistance to move ahead with immunizations for children, for many different reasons--those individuals that have difficulty with the English language and those that have cultural kinds of problems in moving forward, in terms of vigorous vaccination regimes, the repetitiveness in making sure children are going to keep up to speed in terms of the number of times that we have to go back and get these vaccinations. There is a lot of complexity in terms of making sure that children are going to receive those vaccines. But we have gone from 55 percent to 78 percent on his watch. He deserves credit. 
Dr. Satcher has also led CDC efforts to deal more effectively with the infectious diseases and foodborne illnesses. Our Nation relies on CDC to provide the rapid response needed to combat outbreaks of disease and protect public safety. Under Dr. Satcher, CDC is implementing a strategy against new and re-emerging infectious diseases, like TB, with better surveillance and detection. Many of us thought we had moved past TB, the time of tuberculosis. Yet, we find pockets of it that still exist in many different communities in this country. It is associated so much with the problems of poor housing, poor sanitary conditions, and generally the problems associated with poverty. We have it in many of our communities. We still have it and we can't forget it, and we should not forget it. We need a doctor that understands the response to recent food poisoning incidents. He has been a leader in developing a new early warning system to deal with such illnesses. He has earned many distinguished tributes during his extraordinary career. In 1996, he received the prestigious Nathan B. Davis Award from the American Medical Association for outstanding service in advancing the public health. 
In 1986, he was elected to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences in recognition of his outstanding leadership. 
Dr. Satcher is a respected family doctor. Ask those families out there in the Watts area. Ask the families down in the southern parts of our country in rural communities. I think for any of us that took the time to sit through those hearings and listen to him can understand that he has--I suppose the best description is the `bedside manner.' There are other words that are more eloquent to describe it. But he has it, and anybody that has ever met him and known him, or talked to him, or, I am sure, have been treated by him would understand and respect him. He is a respected scholar that has been elevated to the most prestigious positions in our country, voted on by those of his peers who understand his scholarship, and he is a respected public leader recognized for his service in public health. 
His career has emphasized work in patient care, health policy development and planning, education, research, health professions education, and family medicine. His range of skills and experience, and strong commitment to improving public health make him well qualified to be the country's principal official on health care and health policy issues--America's doctor. America is a healthier nation today, and it is healthier in large part because of Dr. Satcher's leadership. He is an excellent choice to be Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health. The Nation faces significant public health challenges. 
We need a Surgeon General who can speak with candor, and advise the nation on smoking, AIDS, teenage pregnancy, the link between diet and disease, and other major health concerns. In the 1940s, Surgeon General Thomas Parran used blunt talk to warn the public about venereal disease. In 1964, Surgeon General Luther Terry first alerted the public to the dangers of smoking and the link between smoking and lung cancer. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop used his position to raise awareness about AIDS and other major health issues. People listen when the Surgeon General speaks. Dr. Satcher is well-qualified to follow in this distinguished tradition. 
Dr. Satcher's nomination has broad bipartisan support. He's been endorsed by a large number of health groups, including the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, and a wide range of academic health centers and public health organizations. I look forward to working closely with him in the future, and I urge the Senate to give him the overwhelming vote of support he deserves. 
Mr. President, I have about 10 or 15 more minutes. But I see my friend and colleague from Maryland. I would like to be able to conclude my remarks after the Senator from Maryland.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, some of my colleagues have questioned Dr. Satcher's support for clinical trials of the drug AZT in foreign countries as part of the all-out international public effort to halt the mushrooming epidemic of mother-to-infant transmission of the AIDS virus. Every day more than 1,000 babies in developing countries are born infected with HIV. Clinical trials in the United States in 1994 showed that it is possible to reduce the mother-to-infant transmission of HIV by administering AZT during pregnancy, labor and delivery. However, it is recognized that such treatment would not be feasible in developing countries. 
Senator Frist talked about this briefly in his presentation. It is too expensive, and it requires ongoing therapy which is not possible in remote areas. It also prohibits breast feeding. For these reasons a group of international experts convened by the World Health Organization in June 1994 recommended that research be carried out to develop a simpler, less costly treatment. The idea was to make it affordable in terms of the limited resources for African countries and also that would be culturally suitable in terms of the breast feeding and in terms of the amount of times that individuals would have to come back for treatment. The idea was to tailor the regime to the existing cultural, economic and social regimes which exist in areas of the world where we have high concentrations of HIV but recognizing that one of the very encouraging areas with regard to HIV is trying to intercept the passage of the HIV into newborn children. 
Recognizing the possibilities for trying to reduce the communication of HIV to these infants, the challenge was, can we develop an alternative regime that would prevent the babies of those infected with HIV from contracting this disease, and do it in a way which is affordable, culturally acceptable, and effective? So, responding to this urgent need, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the World Health Organization and other international experts worked closely with scientists from developing countries to develop a treatment that is usable in these countries and can reduce the devastating toll of HIV on their children. 
Dr. Satcher has acted entirely ethically and responsibly on this issue. The World Health Organization and the developing countries urgently requested the CDC and NIH to provide assistance in designing and conducting these trials, in cooperation with the research communities in the host countries. 
In a letter to NIH dated May 8, 1997, Edward K. Mbidded, chairman of the AIDS research committee of the Uganda Cancer Institute wrote:  
These are Ugandan studies conducted by Ugandan investigators on Ugandans. Due to lack of resources, we have been sponsored by organizations like yours. We are grateful that you have been able to do so. There is a mix-up on issues here, which needs to be clarified. It is not NIH conducting the studies in Uganda, but Uganda's doing the study on their people for the good of their people. 
Dr. David Ho, the director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York City and Time's 1996 Man of the Year, has stated: 
These clinical trials were created for Africans by Africans with the good of their people in mind and with their informed consent. The studies were designed to be responsive to local needs through the constraints of each study site. African scientists have argued that it is not in their best interests to include a complicated and costly AZT regime for the sake of comparison, for such a regime is not only unaffordable but logistically indefensible. 
Before patients were enrolled in the clinical trials, they were specifically informed of their AIDS status and counseled about the risks and benefits of participation, including the fact they might be in a study group that received a placebo instead of an AZT anti-virus drug. 
This is the critical issue or one of the very major issues that obviously distinguish it from the Tuskegee study where there was no informed consent. At the time when the study started with the African Americans, blacks in this country, in the South, primarily in Alabama, those who participated in the venereal disease studies were never told that there was a cure. They were never informed that there was medical information that could make these individuals healthy. They were maintained, effectively, by the U.S. Public Health Service, in their stage of sickness. And some of them even died. 
This whole issue of informed consent was a matter of very considerable debate and discussion here in the U.S. Senate in the early 1970's. I had the opportunity of chairing the hearings during that period of time. After those series of incidents, we required informed consent. Every Member of this body and everyone who is listening to this knows that every time they go into a doctor's office and they sign that little sheet, `informed consent'--they never did that before 1975. That was as a result of Senate hearings. Any tie-in with Tuskegee is a distortion and misrepresentation and a disservice and inaccurate. 
In Tuskegee there was no ethical review. In these studies there was an ethical review. There was no oversight of those kinds of studies. In this study there is an oversight. There was no counseling about the transmissibility. In this study there was. No informed consent. In this case--yes. It is entirely different. 
Now, as a practical matter, the only AZT treatment--to come back to the proposal again that was approved for the African countries--as a practical matter the only AZT treatment available to any women in these developing countries is the treatment provided to participants in the study. There was no other kind of treatment. The HIV-infected women in these countries do not have access to AZT because, as has been pointed out, it costs too much. 
Ethics Committees in both the United States and the developing countries conducted continuous, rigorous ethical reviews of the trials. The committees were made up of medical scientists, ethicists, social scientists, members of the clergy, and people with HIV. The role of these committees guaranteed that the trials would conform to strict ethical guidelines for biomedical research, including the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Guidelines for Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects. 
The AMA president-elect, Dr. Nancy Dickey, has stated that these studies are `scientifically well founded' and `in the long run will provide serious answers and are not the kind of superficial, unethical research that the critics are trying to make them out to be.' 
Dr. Neil Halsey, the Professor and Director of the Division of Disease Control of the Department of International Health at Johns Hopkins University; Dr. Andrea Ruff, Associate Professor at Johns Hopkins, wrote to Secretary Shalala on October 24, 1997 stating: 
`. . . we strongly believe that these trials are ethical and essential for identifying effective, practical regimes that could be implemented in most developing countries.' 
Even those within the scientific community who have raised concerns about these trials, such as Dr. Sidney Wolfe, the director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group, have expressed their support for Dr. Satcher.

<TEXT>
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I know that there are others that choose to speak. So I will not take long. 
Just in a brief response, we have on the one hand the life of Dr. Satcher when we talk about ethics. And if there is any real kind of a question about his judgment and his failing a duty in terms of ethics, I think we ought to take a look at what the facts are and also take a look at what kind of life he has led in terms of the service of the underserved in his professional life, and the work that he has done. And you will see, this extraordinary light that shines brightly in terms of working for the disadvantaged and those that are left out and left behind, those that do not have good health and medical services, and those that are the sickest and neediest in our society. 
To try to take a situation here about informed consent when we have those that have been involved in the programs themselves who describe the various ways that they went about informing potential subjects to be involved in these trials--particularly with the statements of the in-country personnel and to try to use anecdotal information based upon the conversations with one or two of those people that are involved in the trials--as being somehow a reflection of the failure of Dr. Satcher to reach a high ethical standard is a pretty far stretch. 
Madam President, I listened with great interest to my friend from Missouri talk about the Helsinki accords, and about the importance of making available the known, effective treatment, that we shouldn't have various kinds of research being conducted if we are denying known effective treatment to these individuals. Well, understand the regimen are talking about when we are talking about known effective treatment because it was the judgment of the medical professions that if we took the known effective treatment that is used here in the United States that there was serious doubt as to whether it would be effective. That is why the lower dose regimen is being tested in developing countries. 
What do I mean? By using the known effective treatment that is used here in the United States that is referred to by the Senator from Missouri, you have to stop breast feeding. You can't use that regimen and continue to breast feed. It was the judgment of the Centers for Disease Control that if you used the 076 regimen you might also be exposing these subjects to other health risks, such as high levels of drug toxicity due to their entirely different diet. It must be recognized that the 076 regimen is not known to be an effective regimen for populations in developing countries. 
It was known at the Centers for Disease Control if you are going to use the 076 treatment the standard in the United States, you have to have 100 milligrams of AZT five times. You have to have treatment for 12 weeks of pregnancy and you need to receive intravenous AZT during labor and pregnancy. In order to do this, you have to have a sufficient health infrastructure, one which is going to bring these various infected individuals and bring them back to the center frequently. This infrastructure just is not available. 
Senator, get real; the regimen that is effective in the United States, the majority of the scientists at the Centers for Disease Control do not believe it could be effective over there. So when you say, they have no effective treatment, we have this treatment here in the United States of America and we are denying those people that effective treatment and it is violating all those ethical considerations, I have to disagree. Understand what is happening in these situations. Understand the these regimens. These developing countries just do not have the infrastructure. You cannot get them to stop breast feeding so they have to follow a different regime, one that permits them to breast feed, one that doesn't require them to come to a clinic on a frequent basis, one that says they do not have to have the elaborate infrastructure that is necessary under the 076 regimen. 
The idea to put out on the floor that Dr. Satcher is not qualified, not qualified to be Surgeon General because of this kind of a situation is the most extraordinary stretch in terms of misrepresentation and failure to understand what these trials are really about. I am just amazed as we get further and further into it how weak that case is. 
The Senators who are opposed to Dr. Satcher better do a lot better tonight and tomorrow in their opposition than they have done today. I have listened to these arguments, and I can't believe any one of our colleagues who has been following them can believe that there is very much to it. Take this man whose total life has been committed to his fellow human beings, and try and do the acrobatics and gymnastics and trapeze work in terms of misinterpreting these kinds of studies to show that he is basically flawed in terms of his ethical standards, my goodness, Madam President, give us a break. Give us a break. 
So, Madam President, I will have more to say on some of these other questions, on the other misrepresentations. There were a series of others. I will just mention in addition one further area that has been raised during the consideration here earlier in the afternoon. Critics have also charged that Dr. Satcher at CDC supported HIV studies on newborns that allowed them to be sent home without telling their parents of their HIV status. 
This survey was part of an effort to obtain a better idea of how HIV was spreading in different populations. 
It was implemented by State and local health departments across the country with support from CDC. The survey began at a time when little was known about the impact of HIV on women and their children. 
The studies were designed to check for the presence of antibodies to HIV infection in newborns. The presence of such antibodies would indicate that the mother is infected with HIV and that her child has been exposed to the virus. Approximately 25 percent of children exposed to HIV develop HIV infection, too. 
That is the point I made in the debate earlier in the afternoon. That is why this whole area of study is so important and so exciting, and the consequences so important, because this is an area in medical research that offers some really important potential breakthroughs for babies whose mothers are infected. 
The studies were carried out using blood samples that were left over from other routine purposes and that otherwise would have been discarded. The samples were not identified as coming from specific individuals. At the time, AIDS was not well understood. CDC was surveying newborns as a group to learn more about the 
incidence of the disease in particular communities. No treatment was available for newborns at that time--none. This was in 1988. 
This study was part of a responsible scientific effort to learn more about the prevalence of HIV, so that resources could be targeted quickly and effectively. The survey followed strict ethical principles and was approved by the Office for Protection from Research Risks at NIH. A task force of ethicists, lawyers, civil liberties advocates, gay rights proponents, and public health officials met at the Hastings Center, a bioethics think tank, to consider the issue. No objection was raised to these studies. 
The Hastings Center is one of the important resources in this country in terms of bioethical issues. They have a number of very thoughtful teachers and scholars who have testified before our committees over the years. And they have been included in this review of this particular project. A 1988 review of the issue by a Canadian work group also gave its approval to the studies. So did the World Health Organization's Global Program on AIDS. 
The Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences reviewed the survey and approved it as a well- established approach to public health surveys. 
Here you have it. You have the NIH Office for Protection from Research, you have the Hastings Center, which is one of the leading bioethic think tanks in this country, approving it. No objection was raised. The Canadian group also reviewed the work and so did the World Health Organization's Global Program on AIDS. The Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences reviewed the survey and approved it as a well-established approach to public health surveys. All of these bodies have approved these surveys. 
The information in the surveys was used by communities for education, screening, and treatment. 
The surveys ended in 1995, when new treatments for infants exposed to HIV and other ways to monitor HIV population trends in women of childbearing age became available. 
In September of 1997, Dr. Satcher recommended the study be formally terminated, and HHS agreed. So Dr. Satcher terminated it. It was going on when he became the head of the Centers for Disease Control, but he terminated the survey. CDC continues to work with States to identify ways to monitor trends of HIV in women of childbearing age. 
Now, Madam President, I was in the Senate during this period of time. It was in 1988 that we had the first initiatives on pediatric AIDS. My good friend from Ohio, Senator Howard Metzenbaum, on the Health and Human Resources Committee--and I will include the exact references tomorrow in the Record--was the one who offered the first amendment. It was $10 million to try to help and assist in the area of pediatric AIDS. It was a brand-new challenge in public health. And these studies have been referred to as something we would not subscribe to today, but at a time when we were attempting to find out the nature of the threat in terms of mothers and the extent of the challenge for communities and States in our Nation, these surveys were considered and reviewed and approved. 
To try to use today's standard for an earlier period of time when we virtually knew nothing about how to deal with pediatric AIDS--and there was enormous resistance in this body to doing anything about it then, enormous resistance to get into it at all. People forget all of that. Why get involved in this kind of disease research? We went through all of that. We eventually had the work with the Ryan White bill and several other breakthroughs that were important that moved us into a direction which respected the science rather than the ideology of the time. But during this period of time, and I remember very clearly, it was extremely difficult. We were trying to find out more as a nation and as a people about the prevalence of this disease within the population, and so this kind of survey took place. It is easy to flyspeck it now in terms of how surprising it is that any such study could possibly take place today. And it is always useful and valuable to be a Monday morning quarterback. The studies that were done then 
had been reviewed in terms of their ethical considerations. Maybe some agree, some differ. We could all certainly find criticisms of it knowing what we know today, but that isn't the question. 
The fact is this issue was actually started under a Republican administration and ended by Dr. Satcher. 
Now, it is nice to come out here and say, well, he should have ended it earlier and therefore he is not qualified. If that is your argument, so be it. But it is not, nor should it be, an argument that is elevated to a serious reason for having any second thoughts about this outstanding nominee. 
Finally, I just say, Madam President, as I started out today, we have an extraordinary doctor who has been willing to take on the responsibilities of Surgeon General and tend to our nation's public health concerns. These are tough issues. They deal with the most difficult kinds of problems that we can possibly imagine. We understand that. And Dr. Satcher deserves great credit for being willing to stand up and say I want to continue to serve, as he has his whole life. 
We are very fortunate to have such a person willing to stand up, and we are fortunate to have the President nominate him. I am going to be proud to vote in support of him, and I am confident we will have an overwhelming majority of the Senate to do so. 
As I said, I have been proud to respond to the questions that have come up today and look forward to further debate and discussion on this outstanding nominee. Hopefully, we will get the opportunity of having a chance to approve him. 
I yield the floor.  
Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

I want to just mention at this time and I will read part of an excellent letter that was made available to us. It was written to our friend and colleague, Senator Ashcroft, from the Morehouse School of Medicine.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in another letter from Dr. Sullivan to Senator Lott that was made available to all the membership, he said: 
I enthusiastically support the nomination of David Satcher, M.D., for the positions of Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health of the Department of Health and Human Services. 
In light of the recent debate about issues regarding his nomination, I wish to communicate with you my experience with, and opinion of, David Satcher. I have known David for over twenty-five years, and I can state unequivocally that he is a physician. . .of [extraordinary] integrity, conviction, and commitment. As Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary of Health, I know that David has no intention of using those positions to promote issues related to abortion or any other political agenda. He has worked throughout his career to focus on health issues that unite Americans--not divide them. 
And the letter goes on. 
Both of these letters are from a very, very distinguished leader of the Department under President Bush and someone who has made, in his own way, an extraordinary contribution to public health and to health policy generally. Someone who has known Dr. Satcher for a long period of time should have a very important influence, I would think, and weight with our colleagues. 
I just mention, finally, Mr. President--and I am sorry my friend from Missouri is not here, Senator Ashcroft. He talked about the State surveys that were taken, and he was highly critical of the State surveys. 
It has been brought to my attention that the surveys went into effect in 1988, and then were concluded in 1995. Dr. Satcher came to the Centers for Disease Control--started under a Republican administration. But it is interesting that Senator Ashcroft was Governor of Missouri during this period of time, and he signed on for these various State surveys, and supported them. 
It just has to have somewhat of a ring here today as we are considering these surveys and as the point is being raised about how effective or how wise these surveys will be, that the person who is raising this and the most critical is someone who was a Governor of a State that actually endorsed and signed the applications. I do not think it is necessary, but we will have those available for the Record tomorrow. 
I think this is just, again, interesting. If these are the best cases that can be made against someone who has such a distinguished record, such a powerful life record in terms of the public interest and service, then we should be about the business of moving ahead and supporting this nomination. 
We look forward to the further debate. I am puzzled about where those are that have the serious reservations. We have been out here ready to debate this record. We look forward to debating it. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support this legislation. I disagreed with President Reagan on many issues, but I believe this proposal is an appropriate honor for a distinguished former President. I also support it because of the many personal kindnesses that President Reagan and his family have shown to the Kennedy family over the years.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, several months ago, the world learned of one of the most astounding developments in modern biology: the cloning of a sheep named Dolly. This extraordinary scientific achievement awakened widespread concern about the possibility of a brave new world, where human beings would be cloned and where individuals would seek to achieve a kind of immortality by reproducing themselves. There is widespread agreement among scientists, ethicists, and ordinary Americans that production of human beings by cloning should be prohibited, at least until the possibilities and pitfalls of this scientific procedure are better understood. 
The President reacted rapidly to this scientific advance and the unprecedented issues it raised by asking the National Bioethics Advisory Commission to study the issue and make recommendations. The Commission recommended that creation of human beings by cloning should be banned for several years, and the Administration has submitted legislation to implement this recommendation. 
The legislation that Senator Feinstein and I are introducing today will assure the American public that reproducing human beings by cloning will be prohibited. It largely follows the President's legislation and the Recommendations of the Commission. It makes it illegal to produce human beings by cloning and establishes strict penalties for those who try to do so. In addition, it prohibits anyone from beginning the cloning process in this country and carrying out the implantation step in another country. 
But just as important as what the bill does is what it does not do. It does not seek to use public concern about cloning to establish a back door ban on research into human development. 
A prohibition that goes too far could outlaw needed research on the prevention, treatment, and cure of cancer. 
It could outlaw needed research on fertility, to help birth defects, and hereditary diseases. 
It could outlaw needed research on the cure of spinal cord injuries. 
All of these various kinds of research have broad support in Congress and the country. Yet a blunderbuss ban on human development research could easily interfere with this important and life-saving research, or even halt it altogether. 
In addition, the FDA has jurisdiction over human cloning and will act vigorously to shut down any clinic that operates without FDA approval. The FDA must find that human cloning is safe and effective. Given the current state of the science, the DFA would almost certainly decide that a human cloning procedure is not safe at the current time. The FDA approval process is not a permanent ban on human cloning, but it effectively bans the procedures for the near future. 
The American Medical Association and over forty national medical organizations and research groups have voiced support for the kind of research that is urgently needed to continue the progress we are making against a wide range of diseases. Benjamin Younger, the Executive Director of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, has said, `We must work together to ensure that in our effort to make human cloning illegal we do not sentence millions of people to needless suffering because research and progress into their illness cannot proceed.' 
The legislation we are introducing today will do what the American people want--ban the production of human beings by cloning. It strikes the proper balance between assuring that human beings will not be reproduced through cloning and allowing needed research to continue. I hope that Congress will act promptly to enact this legislation.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I strongly support the nominations of Carlos Moreno and Christine Miller to serve as federal judges. 
Judge Moreno is superbly qualified to serve as a federal judge in the Central District of California. He is a graduate of Yale University, Harvard Business School, and Stanford Law School. Currently, he is a judge on the Los Angeles Superior Court. As a member of that court's Trial Delay Reduction Committee he was instrumental in establishing and enforcing policies that successfully reduced trial backlogs in Los Angeles County. At a time when lengthy backlogs are also plaguing the federal courts, Judge Moreno's experience will be an important asset for California's Central District Court. 
Judge Miller is also well qualified to continue her service on the United States Court of Federal Claims. She has served on that court for the past fifteen years, and President Clinton's nomination of her for a second fifteen-year term is a tribute to her ability and leadership. 
I also want to take this opportunity to express my concern that the Senate has still not had a chance to vote on the nomination of Margaret Morrow to the federal district court for the Central District of California. Ms. Morrow was first nominated in May 1996. She was approved by the Judiciary Committee in June last year, and it is long past time for the Senate to vote on her nomination. 
On average, it is taking twice as long for Senate Republicans to confirm President Clinton's nominees as it took for Democrats to act on President Bush's nominations. But I am especially concerned about the Republicans' record of subjecting women who are nominated for federal judgeships to far greater delays than men. 
Women nominated to the federal courts are four times--four times--more likely than men to be held up by the Republican Senate for more than a year. 
Last year, the Senate confirmed 30 men, but only 6 women. And, by confirming only 36 judges, the Senate condemned many of our nation's busiest courts to even lengthier delays in processing their civil cases. 
There is no question that Margaret Morrow possesses the necessary qualifications to be confirmed. She is a Harvard-educated attorney and a partner in a prestigious California law firm. She is the first woman to serve as the president of the California Bar Association. She is a well-respected attorney and a role model for women in the legal profession. 
Yet action on her nomination has been delayed--like nine other nominees who have been waiting for more than 18 months--because the Republicans are playing politics and preventing needed judicial positions from being filled. 
When even a Republican Chief Justice criticizes the Republican Congress for refusing to move more quickly to confirm judges, you know something's wrong. The Chief Justice is deeply concerned about the large number of judicial vacancies on the federal courts. There are too few judges to handle the workload. 
The bottleneck in the Senate is jeopardizing the court system and undermining the quality of justice. Fewer than half of President Clinton's nominees have been confirmed. 
We owe it to Americans across the country to give these nominees a vote. If our Republican colleagues don't like them, vote against them. But give them a vote. 
The distinguished majority leader has rightly noted that the process of confirming judges is time-consuming. The Senate should take care to ensure that only individuals acceptable to both the President and the Senate are confirmed. The President and the Senate do not always agree. But it should not take longer to consider women than it does to consider men. 
Some Republicans claim they have slowed the confirmation process to protect the federal courts from `judicial activism.' But this argument is a smokescreen. If President Clinton is actually nominating judicial activists, then why is it that these nominees are approved overwhelmingly when the Senate is finally allowed to vote on them? The closest vote that we have had on any nominee in this Congress was the 76 to 30 vote in favor of Ann Aiken last week. 
The claim that Clinton judges are activist judges is a transparent ruse being used to slow down the confirmation process. The reason is obvious. The Republican majority in Congress is doing all it can to prevent a Democratic President from naming judges to the federal courts. The courts are suffering, and so is the nation. 
In some areas of the country, people have to wait years to have their cases even heard in court. And then they have to wait years more for overburdened judges to find time to issue their decisions. Families, workers, small businesses, women and minorities have traditionally looked to the courts to resolve disputes. The lack of federal judges makes the swift resolution of their cases impossible. 
The number of cases filed in the federal appeals courts has grown by 11 percent over the last six years. The average time between filing and disposition has also increased. Courts with long-standing vacancies are in even worse shape. 
In California's Central District Court, the Court to which both Carlos Moreno and Margaret Morrow have been nominated, the caseload has grown by 15 percent since 1994. The time people have to wait for their civil cases to be resolved has increased by 11 percent. In that district, over 300 pending civil cases are more than three years old. 
Across the country, real people are being hurt. In the Central District of Illinois, a disabled Vietnam veteran who was fired after enduring harassment from his co-workers has been waiting over three and a half years for a resolution to his case. 
In the Southern District of Texas, 4,000 victims of a student loan fraud are waiting for the outcome of a class action suit that has been pending for almost eight years. 
In the District Court of South Carolina, there is still no decision in a suit filed more than six years ago against the state's apportionment laws. The outcome of this case will affect hundreds of thousands of citizens. It goes to the heart of whether the basic constitutional principle of `one person, one vote' is being fairly applied. The last communication the lead plaintiff received from the Court was in June of last year. 
In the Southern District of Florida, Julio Vasquez--a U.S. citizen migrant worker--broke his leg in 1989 in a boarding house provided by his employer. To this day, nearly nine years later, Mr. Vasquez has never received sufficient medical attention, and his injury affects his ability to work. He is still waiting for the judge's ruling in his case. 
These are typical victims of the vacancy crisis in the federal courts. They are hard-working Americans injured on the job--citizens seeking to exercise their right to vote--students trying to get an education--disabled veterans searching for justice. 
I commend my colleagues for bringing two distinguished nominees to a vote today. I hope with this new year we will see a new day in moving ahead to fill the vacancies in our courts and end these unconscionable delays.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, two years ago last November, Israel lost its beloved Prime Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, and the world lost a great peacemaker. My son Patrick and I had the sad honor of traveling to Israel for the funeral. Like millions of people around the world, we admired his leadership and the power of his vision of reconciliation between Israel and the Arab world. 
On November 13, friends and admirers of Prime Minister Rabin gathered in Boston for a memorial service to commemorate his life and pay tribute to his leadership in putting Israel on the path to peace. His Eminence Bernard Cardinal Law, Israel's renowned poet Yehuda Amichai, and Israel's Consul General Itzhak Levanon gave voice to the grief of the world. As we work to carry on the work of peace in the Middle East, the guiding presence of Prime Minister Rabin is deeply missed.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was proud to be a sponsor of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1992, and I am proud to support the current reauthorization. I commend Senator Jeffords, Senator DeWine, and Senator Wellstone for their leadership in expediting our consideration of this important legislation. And I commend all the staff members for their skillful work in making this a successful bipartisan consensus bill. I especially thank Senator Tom Harkin for his leadership and continued commitment to individuals with disabilities in this country. 
The Rehabilitation Amendments of 1992 developed the foundation for a rehabilitation system which recognizes competence and choice, and which gives individuals with disabilities the services and support they need to live, work and participate as fully as possible in their communities. For millions of individuals with disabilities, vocational rehabilitation has meant the difference between dependence and independence, between lost potential and productive careers. 
Most important, the vocational rehabilitation in this country provides the necessary skills and support to keep the promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act--so that all individuals with disabilities, especially those with significant disabilities, will have the opportunity to achieve their full potential and be part of the mainstream of American life. 
The bill being introduced today builds on the gains of the past two decades, by strengthening employment possibilities, encouraging self-employment, providing better outreach to underserved populations, and streamlining the role of the government. This bill also establishes a stronger linkage between vocational rehabilitation and the larger statewide job training system. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to enact this important legislation, so that the talents, strengths, competence and interests of all individuals with disabilities will be recognized, enhanced, and fairly rewarded in communities and workplaces across the nation.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was unable to make my comments earlier involving the consideration and approval of the various judges. I would like to address the Senate for a few moments on this particular issue and, most importantly, to express the strong support for the three nominations that have just been confirmed by the Senate. 
Judge Silverman has served with distinction for the past three years on the federal district court in Arizona and will be an impressive member of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Richard Story, has served as a state court judge for many years, and will do an excellent job on the United States District Court in Northern Georgia. 
I am particularly pleased that at long last the Senate is allowed to consider the nomination of Judge Ann Aiken. She is an outstanding choice for the federal district court in Oregon. For the past decade, she has served with distinction as a state court judge--first on the district court and, for the past five years on the circuit court. She is widely respected in Oregon for her service to her community. She received the Woman of Achievement award in 1993 from the Oregon Commission for Women. The U.S. Department of Justice honored her in 1994 for her leadership in helping victims of crime. 
But despite her impressive qualifications, her nomination has been stonewalled by Republicans in the Senate for more than two years. 
On the average, it is taking twice as long for Senate Republicans to confirm President Clinton's nominees as it took for Democrats to act on President Bush's nominations to the federal courts. 
For women, the problem is especially serious. Women nominated to federal judgeships are being subjected to greater delays by Senate Republicans than men. 
So far in this Republican Congress, women nominated to our federal courts are four times--four times--more likely than men to be held up by the Republican Senate for more than a year. 
Last year, the Senate confirmed 30 men, but only 6 women. So only 17 percent of the nominees that the Republican leadership brought before the Senate were women--half as many as President Clinton nominated. 
The country is paying a heavy price for this obstruction. Citizens can't get their day in court, because the Republican Senate is playing politics with the courts and preventing needed judicial positions from being filled. 
When even a Republican Chief Justice criticizes the Republican Congress, you know something's wrong. 
Chief Justice Rehnquist issued his annual year-end report on the State of the Judiciary last month, and he sharply criticized the Republican Senate for refusing to move more quickly to confirm judges. 
The Chief Justice is deeply concerned about the high number of judicial vacancies on the federal courts. There are too few judges to handle the workload. 
The Republican bottleneck in the Senate is jeopardizing the court system and undermining the quality of justice. Of the 77 judicial nominations pending last year, only 36 were confirmed--less than half. Eleven have been awaiting action for over 18 months. 
That's a scandal. Nominees deserve a vote. If our Republican colleagues don't like them, vote against them. But don't just sit on them--that's obstruction of justice. 
Free and full debate over judicial nominations is healthy. The Constitution is clear that only individuals acceptable to both the President and the Senate should be confirmed. The President and the Senate do not always agree. But we should resolve these disagreements by voting on these nominees--yes or no. As Chief Justice Rehnquist said in his annual report, `The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time it should vote' up or down. 
Some Republicans claim they are protecting the federal courts from `judicial activism.' But this argument is a smokescreen. If President Clinton is actually nominating judicial activists, then why is it that these nominees are approved almost unanimously when the Senate is finally allowed to vote on them? 
Eric Clay's nomination to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals was held up in the Senate for more than 15 months. He was finally confirmed--unanimously--by voice vote. 
Joseph Battalion--President Clinton's nominee to the District Court of Nebraska--was held up for 17 months. Then he, too, finally passed the Senate on a voice vote. 
Other nominees were confirmed by overwhelming votes, but only after long delays. Katherine Sweeney Hayden was confirmed to the District Court in New Jersey by a vote of 97-0. Ronald L. Gilman's nomination to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and Janet C. Hall's nomination to the District Court of Connecticut were each confirmed by a vote of 98-1. 
The closest vote we have had on any of President Clinton's judicial nominees was 76 to 23 in favor of confirmation. 
Clearly, the Republicans' claim that Clinton judges are activist judges is a transparent smokescreen being used to slow down the confirmation process. The reason is obvious. The Republican majority in Congress is doing all it can to prevent a Democratic President from naming judges to the federal courts. The courts are suffering and so is the nation. 
In some areas of the country, people have to wait years to have their cases even heard in court. And then they have to wait years more for overburdened judges to find time to reach their decisions. Families, workers, small businesses, women and minorities have traditionally looked to the courts to resolve disputes. The lack of federal judges makes the swift resolution of their cases impossible. 
The number of cases filed in the federal appeals courts has grown by 11 percent over the last six years. The average time between filing and disposition has also increased. Courts with long-standing vacancies are in even worse shape. 
In the District Court in Oregon, the court to which Ann Aiken has been nominated, the number of case filings has risen by nearly a third since 1990. 
Another nominee, Margaret Morrow has been nominated to the federal district court in Los Angeles, and I hope we will consider her nomination next week. Since 1994, the caseload in that court has grown by 15 percent. The time people have to wait for their civil cases to be resolved has increased by 11 percent. In that district, over 300 pending civil cases are more than three years old. 
Real people are being hurt. Consider the case of Rudy Boerseker, a 40-year-old mine worker in Illinois who was injured by poor maintenance of equipment. The facts of the case made clear that the accident resulted from the mining company's negligence. Yet Mr. Boerseker was finally forced to accept a settlement for less than half of what he would probably have received if the case had gone to trial. 
He agreed to an unfair settlement, because he could not afford to wait the three or four years it would take for the case to be decided. 
In the Southern District of Texas, 4,000 victims of a student loan scam are waiting for the outcome of a class action suit that has been pending for almost eight years. 
In South Carolina, there is still no decision in a suit filed more than six years ago against the state's apportionment laws. The outcome of this case will affect hundreds of thousands of citizens. It goes to the heart of whether the basic constitutional principle of `one person, one vote' is being fairly applied. 
In Southern Florida, Julio Vasquez--a U.S. citizen migrant worker--broke his leg in 1989 in a boarding house provided by his employer. To this day, nearly nine years later, Mr. Vasquez has never received sufficient medical attention, and his injury affects his ability to work. He is still waiting for the judge's ruling in his case. 
In the District Court of Oregon, a five-million dollar judgment in favor a family business in a patent dispute with a Fortune 500 firm was tied up for more than a year because of the delays caused by two vacancies on the court. 
These examples are typical victims of the vacancy crisis in the federal courts. 
They are hard-working Americans injured on the job--citizens seeking to exercise their right to vote--students trying to get an education--small businesses denied their rights by large corporations. 
It is time to end these delays and end these industries. It's a new year, and a new session, and I hope very much that our colleagues will turn over a new leaf and end these unreasonable, unacceptable, and unconscionable delays.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Wellstone, Mikulski, Moseley-Braun, Kerry, Torricelli, Boxer, and myself, I am introducing the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 1998, a bill to raise the minimum wage in three annual increases of 50 cents each in the next three years, to bring the minimum wage from its current level of $5.15 an hour today to $6.65 an hour on September 1 in the year 2000. Congressmen Bonior and Gephardt are introducing identical legislation in the House of Representatives. 
After the third year, the legislation calls for the minimum wage to be indexed, so that it will rise automatically as the cost of living increases. Working Americans should not have to depend on the whim of Congress each election year to determine whether they are paid a fair minimum wage. 
In 1996, after a hard-fought battle in the last Congress, we raised the minimum wage, and the economy continued to grow. The scare tactics about lost jobs proved to be as false as they are self-serving. A recent study by the Economic Policy Institute documents that `the sky hasn't fallen' as a result of the last increase. 
Raising the minimum wage does not cause job loss for teenagers, adults, men, women, African-Americans, Latinos, or anyone else. Certainly, the 12 million Americans who would benefit from this legislation deserve the increase. 
We know who these workers are. Sixty percent are women. Nearly three-quarters are adults. Half of those who would benefit from this bill work full-time. Over 80 percent of them work at least 20 hours a week. They are teachers' aides and child care providers. They are single heads of households with children. They are people who clean office buildings in countless communities across the country. Working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, minimum wage workers earn $10,712 a year--$2,600 below the poverty level for a family of three. 
No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty. In good conscience, we cannot continue to proclaim or celebrate the Nation's current prosperity while consigning millions who have jobs to live in continuing poverty. 
The value of the minimum wage still lags far behind inflation. To have the purchasing power that it had in 1968, the minimum wage today would have to be $7.33 an hour instead of the current level of $5.15 an hour. That fact is a measure of how far we have not just fallen short, but actually fallen back, in giving low-income workers their fair share of our extraordinary economic growth. 
In the past 30 years, the stock market, adjusted for inflation, has gone up by 115 percent, while the purchasing power of the minimum wage has gone down by 30 percent. Lavish end-of-the-year bonuses were recently distributed on Wall Street--but not to the working families on Main Street, who actually created the wealth in the first place. 
Americans understand that those on the bottom rungs of the economic ladder deserve a raise. Seventy-six percent of those surveyed in the January 21 ABC-Washington Post poll said they supported increasing the minimum wage. 
Seventy-seven percent of those surveyed by Peter Hart Research earlier this month specifically supported a three-year, $1.50 increase. 
The American people understand the unfairness of requiring working families to subsist on a sub-poverty minimum wage. Across the country, soup kitchens, food pantries and homeless shelters are increasingly serving the working poor, not just the unemployed. In 1996, according to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, 38 percent of those seeking emergency food aid held jobs --up from 23 percent in 1994. Low-paying jobs are the most frequently cited cause of hunger. Officials in 67 percent of the cities cited this factor. 
I look forward to the early enactment of this legislation. Twelve million working Americans deserve a helping hand. No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty. 
Mr. President, we have had the opportunity, since the minimum wage was increased in the last two years, to test the validity of 
the principal argument in opposition to this bill. We will hear this claim again this year on the floor of the U.S. Senate, and that is, that this adds to the problems of inflation. Yet, we have had virtually no inflation over these last 18 months. 
We will also hear that raising the minimum wage will cause the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs. I can already hear the same tired, old arguments we have heard every time this body has debated an increase in the minimum wage--an estimate that we will lose anywhere from 200,000 to 300,000 to 400,000 jobs. Those were the statements made the last time we debated this issue on the floor of the Senate. And our good Republican friends in the House of Representatives said there was absolutely no way that their body was going to consider an increase in the minimum wage, and there was strong opposition over here among the Republican leadership in the Senate even to giving us an opportunity to vote on this measure. It was only after lengthy efforts that we were able actually to gain a vote and to develop bipartisan support for the minimum wage. Ultimately, the Senate of the United States and the House of Representatives responded after we added significant tax reductions for businesses to the legislation. 
Mr. President, if we do not take action now to increase the minimum wage, then the progress we made in the last two years is gradually going to deteriorate. Even with a three-year increase of 50 cents, 50 cents, and 50 cents, by the third year the about 40 cents of the value of that $1.50 would have dissipated because of inflation. We are talking about working families who are trying to make it in this country, who have played an important role in this whole economic expansion. But those at the bottom rungs of the economic ladder have not gotten their fair share of the extraordinary prosperity that we are experiencing under President Clinton's leadership. 
So I don't understand why there is such opposition to the very modest increases that we are talking about, that even if implemented will hardly permit workers to provide for their families and be out of poverty. As a result of the 1996 welfare reform legislation, many, many more people were thrown into poverty. In many instances, they are not going to get the health care or the day care that they need, depending on a particular State's rules in this regard. But there will be millions of Americans who will be out there in the job market without the health care for their children that Medicaid would have provided or child care coverage that welfare benefits would have provided. 
What we are asking is that at least we pay them a livable wage. I don't think a single parent, with $10,000 or $12,000, is going to have the kind of child care that any of us would understand or respect. Yesterday, I was in Dorchester, Massachusetts, meeting with parents about an after school program, which has been in effect for a number of years. It's going to be expanded. The mayor of Boston calls it the 2-to-6 program, and is trying to make available, in all parts of Boston, after-school programs for children. It is a very ambitious program. We have seen our Republican Governor indicate that he is supporting the after-school program. I listened to the parents who were out there, who talked about what happens after their children are 12 years old. The State of Massachusetts has a program that provides modest support for this kind of program for children up to 12 years old, but cuts it off there. Parents with tears in their eyes were saying, `We work hard trying to provide for our families, and we just can't make it. Our children are going home and staying in an empty house in the afternoon.' They pray that they are not going to get themselves in trouble, that the worst thing that will happen to them is they will just watch television. It might cost those parents $5 or $10 a week, maybe $20 a month to be able to have an after-school program. I expect that any single mom getting an increase in the minimum wage wouldn't think that much of a problem. That is happening in many communities in this country.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we will have a chance to debate this issue. It is not one that should take a great deal of time to review. We have been through this debate time and time again. It hasn't got the complexities of many of the proposals the President will be talking about tonight. It is basic and fundamental. Every Member of this body has addressed this issue and voted on it one way or the other. It is going to be really a reflection of our values. 
Finally, Mr. President, by not increasing the minimum wage, we leave many workers so poor that they are eligible for government assistance programs, such as food stamps. These programs are being paid for by other workers' taxes. In effect, these employees are subsidizing the businesses that aren't paying a fair wage. I think that is wrong. 
We will have a chance to review the latest economic information available. We have to address that issue. We understand it. Some of us believe that Americans who work hard and play by the rules ought to be able to get a livable wage as a matter of principle. To achieve that goal, we have to address the impact on inflation and job loss. We will make that argument and we will make it with a great deal of enthusiasm. Two articles from the Wall Street Journal show that the increase in the minimum wage did not cause job loss or increase inflation. I will include those articles in the Record at the appropriate place following my remarks. Here was the newspaper that opposed it hammer and tong the last time we had the increase. 
I do not suggest that they are going to editorialize in favor of it this time. But, nonetheless, the various studies have shown that there is no evidence that modest increases in the minimum wage would harm the economy or cause job loss. 
Mr. President, I don't know what will be in the President's State of the Union speech tonight. There are some reports that he will indicate support for an increase in the minimum wage. And if he does I hope that our Chambers will show support for that proposal because I know it will make all the difference in the world for millions of Americans and their families. Increasing the minimum wage will allow them to look to the future with a greater sense of hope. 
Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Absolutely, Senator. We will vote on this issue, and the earlier the better as far as I am concerned, so that minimum wage earners can continue the progress that they have made during the last 2 years. We will vote on this measure. I think that those who are opposed to it will give the Senate the opportunity to vote on it--at least I certainly hope they will. But the Senator is quite correct. We will vote on it one way or the other, and I think we take to heart that Congressman Gephardt, Congressman Bonior and others have an identical bill. They are strongly committed. As Senators remember, there is a more complicated rule process over in the House of Representatives. But there is no reason in the world that we in the Senate cannot have an opportunity to vote on that measure and attach it to legislation and send it over to the House. We will do that and continue to do it until we are successful.

Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. It is interesting that studies from this month show even greater support for the increase than we saw when we began this debate in the last Congress. Most Americans understand that we have had this extraordinary prosperity for millions of Americans over the period of the last 6 years. Most Americans understand that it has been working families who have made a difference. Those families include minimum wage earners--teachers' aides, who work in classrooms; health care aides, who work in nursing homes; and people who clean office buildings in communities across the country. Those men and women work hard, and they take pride in their work. Many of them have children, and we all know how hard it is to try to raise a family on $5.15 an hour. All those workers ask is to be treated fairly. 
One of the most startling developments in the last few years is the number of working families who are using soup kitchens, food pantries and homeless shelters in cities across the country. The U.S. Conference of Mayors released a study showing that in 1996, 38% of those seeking emergency food aid are working--not unemployed. This is up from 23% in 1994. And, officials in two-thirds of the cities cited low wages as a primary reason for hunger. I don't know whether the Senator has this problem in rural communities in his region of the Nation. But in urban areas, almost 40 percent of those seeking emergency food aid are working, and they still can't make it. 
All we are saying is that if you are working you shouldn't have to go to a soup kitchen. When you are working, you shouldn't have to bring your children to a soup kitchen in order to be fed. The minimum wage is designed to prevent such problems. It has been a part of the fabric of our society since the late 1930's, and it has been something which has had bipartisan support in the past. We are hopeful that it will have bipartisan support this time. Ultimately we will have it. But it had bipartisan support under President Bush, and President Nixon supported the increase as well. And Republicans in this body have supported it, too. 
Many of our colleagues are constantly talking about the 
importance of rewarding work in our society. But when you have people who are able-bodied, who want to work, and who have jobs--there is something wrong if they can't make it on their own. There is something wrong if we do not try to address that problem.

Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator makes a good point because the organizations, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, the National Restaurant Association and others are out there already trying to discourage people from supporting this program. We will have a chance to deal with their arguments when we see what has actually happened in terms of the expansion of the restaurant industry and employment among restaurant workers. The Senator is no less interested in expanded employment or adequate income for restaurant workers than I am, and they still have done better with our modest increases in the past, and they will in the future. 
I want to ask if the Senator will agree with me on one other proposition. We will hear during the debate that at least a quarter of these are teenagers who are making the minimum wage. In my State, tuition at the University of Massachusetts in Boston costs $4297. These students are still 18 and 19 years old. They are teenagers, and many of them are working. These students need the money.

Mr. KENNEDY. Many of their parents never went to college. These are teenagers. These students are trying to earn enough to buy their books and maybe attend an athletic event once in a while or be able to pay in order to rent athletic equipment. These students--and yes, they are teenagers--are working long and hard, and they deserve the increase, too.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this chart here illustrates very clearly the purchasing power of the minimum wage since 1959. All of these figures are in 1997 dollars, adjusted for inflation. In 1968 the real value of the minimum wage was $7.33. In 1995 it was down to $4.32 an hour. In the 1996 legislation, we added two additional steps. On September 1, 1997, the second step took effect, raising the minimum wage's value to $5.15 an hour. If we do nothing, by the year 2000, it will be $4.66 an hour. Our legislation proposes that it go up to $6.18, in three steps. Again, this is the what the minimum wage will buy in 1997 dollars, if our legislation becomes law. Even that increase will leave minimum wage earners below where they were in the 1960s and 1970s. The legislation is a very modest step forward, and I believe that working families have earned it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Specter and Senator Wyden in introducing the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1998. Last Monday, President Clinton convened a historic White House Conference on Hate Crimes. This conference brought together community leaders, law enforcement officials, religious and academic leaders, parents, and victims for a national dialogue on how to reduce hate violence in our society. 
I commend President Clinton for his leadership on this important issue. Few crimes tear at the fabric of society more than hate crimes. They injure the immediate victims, but they also injure the entire community--and sometimes the entire nation. So it is entirely appropriate to use the full power of the federal government to punish them. 
This bill is the product of careful consultation with the Department of Justice, constitutional scholars, law enforcement officials, and many organizations with a long and distinguished history of involvement in combating hate crimes, including the Anti-Defamation League, the National Organization of Women Legal Defense Fund, the Human Rights Campaign, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, and the American Psychological Association. President Clinton strongly supports the bill, and we look forward to working closely with the administration to ensure its passage. 
Hate crimes are on the rise throughout America. The Federal Bureau of Investigation documented 8,000 hate crimes in 1995, a 33-percent increase over 1994. The 8,000 documented hate crimes actually understate the true number of hate crimes, because reporting is voluntary and not all law enforcement agencies report such crimes. 
The National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium recently released its 1997 Audit of anti-Asian violence. Their report documented a 17-percent increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans. The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force documented a 6-percent increase in hate violence against gay, lesbian, and bisexual citizens in 1996. Eighty-two percent of hate crimes based on religion in 1995 were anti-Semitic. 
Gender motivated violence occurs at alarming rates. The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights recently issued a report on hate crimes which correctly noted that `society is beginning to realize that many assaults against women are not `random' acts of violence but are actually bias-related crimes.' 
The rising incidence of hate crimes is simply intolerable. Yet, our current Federal laws are inadequate to deal with this violent bigotry. The Justice Department is forced to fight the battle against hate crimes with one hand tied behind its back. 
There are two principal gaps in existing law that prevent federal prosecutors from adequately responding to hate crimes. First, the principal federal hate crimes law, 18 United States Code 245, contains anachronistic and onerous jurisdictional requirements that frequently make it impossible for federal officials to prosecute flagrant acts of racial or religious violence. Second, federal hate crimes law do not cover gay bashing, gender-motivated violence, or hate crimes against the disabled. 
Our bill closes these gaps in existing law, and gives prosecutors the tools they need to fight bigots who seek to divide the nation through violence. Our bill expands the federal government's ability to punish racial violence by removing the unnecessary jurisdictional requirements from existing law. In addition, the bill gives federal prosecutors new authority to prosecute violence against women, against the disabled, and against gays and lesbians. 
The bill also provides additional resources to hire the necessary law enforcement personnel to assist in the investigation and prosecution of hate crimes. The bill also provides additional resources for programs specifically targeted at preventing hate crimes. 
Finally, the bill addresses the growing problem of adults who recruit juveniles to committee hate crimes. In Montgomery County, Tennessee, a white supremacist founded a hate group known as the `Aryan Faction,' and recruited new members by going into local high schools. The group then embarded on a violent spree of firebombings and arsons before being apprehended. Hate crimes disproportionately involve juveniles, and the bill directs the Sentencing Commission to study this problem and determine appropriate additional sentencing enhancements for adults who recruit juveniles to commit hate crimes. 
The structure of this bill is modeled after the Church Arson Prevention Act, the bipartisan bill enacted by the Senate unanimously last year in response to the epidemic of church arson crimes. Combating hate crimes has always been a bipartisan issue in the Senate. The Hate Crimes Statistics Act has overwhelming bipartisan support, and it was extended last year by a unanimous vote. The Hate Crimes Sentencing Enhancement Act was enacted in 1994 by a 92-4 vote in the Senate. 
The bill we are introducing today is the next step in our bipartisan effort to combat hate violence. This bill is an essential part of the battle against bigotry, and I urge the Senate to give high priority when Congress returns to session in January.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege for me to take this opportunity to commend Henri Termeer of Massachusetts on receiving the Governor's New American Appreciation Award from Governor Weld earlier this year. 
Henri Termeer is well known to many of us in Congress. He is the chief executive officer and president of Genzyme Corp., the largest biotechnology company in Massachusetts and the fourth largest in the world. When Henri joined Genzyme in 1983, the company had only 35 employees. Under his leadership, Genzyme has grown to over 3,500 employees, including 2,100 in Massachusetts. 
Henri was born in the Netherlands and grew up expecting that he would eventually join his father's shoe business. As a young man, he worked in the shoe industry in England, intending to gain training and experience there before returning to work for his father. When he left England, however, he decided to come to America instead of returning to the Netherlands. 
After earning a masters degree in business administration at the University of Virginia, Henri joined a pharmaceutical company and spent the next 10 years working in Germany and the United States in various management positions. He left that company in 1983 to become president of Genzyme Corp. and later became the company's chief executive officer as well. 
In working with Henri Termeer over the years, I have come to know him as an impressive businessman and as an outstanding leader for the biotechnology industry. He is highly respected in the industry for his knowledge, vision, and commitment, and he has won numerous awards from his peers. As a member of Governor Weld's Council on Economic Growth and Technology and chairman of the Subcommittee on Biotechnology and Pharmaceutical Development, Henri's leadership was responsible for the adoption of a number of broad initiatives that have made Massachusetts an excellent business environment for the biotechnology industry. At the present time, biotechnology is a $1.7 billion industry in Massachusetts that employs over 17,000 people. 
Henri was selected to receive the Governor's New American Appreciation Award for his charitable and community activities as well as his business leadership. Among his most important civic accomplishments are his efforts to expand learning opportunities for mentally challenged children, to improve science education for minority students, and to train workers displaced from other industries for new careers in biotechnology. 
I congratulate Henri Termeer on this well-deserved award. His success in this country is a brilliant new chapter in America's distinguished immigrant heritage and history. He is a modern symbol that the American Dream is alive and well in our own day and generation. The United States needs more New Americans like Henri Termeer.

 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, December 6 marks the 50th birthday of one of the Nation's finest labor leaders. Gary Sauter has been a member of the United Food and Commercial Workers and its predecessor, the Retail Clerks International Association, for over 30 years, and he has done an outstanding job. 
Gary comes from a hard-working union family. His father and mother were both members of the Retail Clerks Union in Baltimore. In fact, they became engaged after a labor dispute. 
Following in their footsteps, Gary joined the Retail Clerks in 1965, as a cashier for Safeway Stores while he was attending the Baltimore College of Commerce. The union quickly recognized his ability and, in 1969, Gary became a department store organizer. He worked effectively to organize workers at the Hoschschilds Kohn department store in Baltimore, and went on to become regional coordinator for the Retail Clerks' Southeastern Division. 
Later, Gary became organizing director for Local 400 of the Retail Clerks in Landover, MD. In large part because of Gary's efforts, the local grew to one of the largest and most effective local unions in the Washington, DC area. 
In 1988, after the Retail Clerks merged with the Amalgamated Meat Cutters to form the United Food and Commercial Workers' Union, Gary joined the new international as special assistant to the president. He continued to be a leader and, in 1994, was elected international vice president of the union. Later that year he was chosen to serve as director of the union's Legislative and Political Affairs Department, a position he holds today. 
Throughout his distinguished career Gary has done a brilliant job for the workers he represents. He has never lost sight of the importance of their needs, and he has worked skillfully and tirelessly to improve the wages and working conditions of all Americans. 
It is an honor to pay tribute to this impressive leader. I extend my best wishes to Gary, his wife Pat, and his children, Christopher and Amy, on this auspicious milestone. Well done, Gary, and keep up the great work.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as we conclude this session of Congress, I would like to take a moment to recognize a valued adviser, an extraordinary public servant, and an able advocate for high quality education and job training for all our citizens, Bill Spring of Boston. 
Tragically, Bill was severely injured in an accident 2 weeks ago as he was walking home from work and he remains unconscious today. We are all very optimistic that Bill will regain good health. Our hearts go out to his wife Micho and his children. I want them to know how proud we are to have Bill as a friend and colleague. Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult time. 
Many of us in the Senate know Bill and worked with him during his years as a staff member of the Senate Labor Committee or as a senior adviser to President Carter. He has also served as a professor at Harvard and at Boston University, as a vice president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, as a member of the Boston School Committee, and in many other valuable positions. In each capacity, Bill has always brought a brilliant intellect, an unyielding commitment to the principles of fairness and opportunity, an extraordinary creativity, and an unfailing ability to find a way forward, even in the most difficult times. 
His leadership on education and job training has been outstanding. His understanding of the basic issues and his tireless pursuit of better policies and programs to improve the quality and quantity of opportunities for all Americans have made an immense contribution to public policy and to the lives of tens of thousands of individuals and their families. 
In the policy arena, Bill Spring has been a leader in every significant debate and legislative achievement by Congress on employment and job training for over three decades. His judgment, his evaluation of alternatives, and his understanding of the needs of the people who need our help the most have been indispensable to the bipartisan progress we have made. 
He has devoted special attention and energy to the serious problems of poor and minority youth. From the unprecedented youth employment and training program of the Carter administration to the current Out-of-School Youth Initiative in the pending work force development legislation, unanimously reported to the Senate last month, Bill Spring's guidance and direction have been superb. 
In Boston and Massachusetts, Bill has had a key role in all the progress we have made in meeting the employment and training needs of workers and the needs of students for quality education and effective links between their learning and the work force. 
The nationally renowned Boston Compact could not have been achieved without Bill Spring's design, support, and direction. The compact has become the most successful effort in the country to keep young men and women in school and assist their transition from school to their future careers. Thousands of youths in Boston now have different and better lives because of Bill's creativity and energy. 
The new and successful relationship between the Boston Police Department, juvenile justice system, and the Boston school system is another of Bill Spring's major achievements. The success that Boston has achieved in reducing juvenile crime, including the elimination of juvenile murder for over 2 years, is an extraordinary tribute to his insight and leadership. 
We wish him a speedy and full recovery, and a quick return to his leadership on all these vital issues.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have waited a very considerable time for this moment this afternoon in the U.S. Senate as well as action in the House of Representatives and, hopefully, the President's signature in the next few days on a matter of very significant importance to the issues of quality health for the American people. 
It has been a very considerable process that we have followed over a number of years to get to this point. 
I congratulate the chairman of our committee, Senator Jeffords, for his leadership all along this long and difficult passage, because I think without his perseverance, without his knowledge and awareness and his strong commitment on this issue, we would not have this important legislation available for the Senate and for the American people. 
Mr. President, one could wonder why it has taken so much time. But we have a natural tension between bringing new innovation and creativity and breakthroughs in the areas of pharmaceutical drugs and medical devices to the market and, on the other hand, protecting the public by approving only safe and efficacious products. We have well-intentioned, brilliant medical researchers in our country who are absolutely convinced that their particular product can provide life-saving opportunities for our fellow citizens, members of our families, who are suffering extraordinary illness. And we have brilliant researchers at FDA that examine scientific information and clinical studies and believe that a very significant potential danger is out there for those who might use a particular pharmaceutical or medical device. Achieving a balance between these two concerns is a difficult task. 
The one who has really balanced these conflicting views has been our chairman, Senator Jeffords, working diligently with other members of the committee, Democrats as well as Republicans, over a long period of time. 
I am convinced that as a result of this legislation the health of the American people will be enhanced through faster availability to pharmaceutical drugs and medical devices while maintaining important protections for the American people. I join in supporting this landmark FDA conference report. 
This is a very important piece of legislation. I think in many respects this will be one of the most important pieces of legislation of this year, and possibly of this Congress. 
Mr. President, I want to commend Chairman Bliley, John Dingell, as well as Chairman Bilirakis, Sherrod Brown and other members of the House committee for their bipartisan work. We had a good conference where Members were knowledgeable and very committed in terms of finding common ground. I believe as a result of this conference we have an even stronger bill than was passed earlier. 
In addition, I commend the Patients' Coalition and Public Citizen, who worked to assure that the needs of patients were fully and fairly considered in the legislation. I appreciate the assistance of the Massachusetts biotechnology and medical device industries, who provided me with valuable insight into these complex issues and their concerns. 
I also commend Secretary Shalala, the dedicated men and women at the FDA, and the Clinton administration for their skillful and impressive role in developing so many aspects of these needed reforms. 
The most important part of the bill is the extension of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act [PDUFA] which was originally enacted in 1992. PDUFA is one of the most important FDA reform measures ever enacted. It provides funds for FDA to hire hundreds of new reviewers who, in turn, are able to expedite the review and approval of pharmaceutical products. A critical element of PDUFA's success was the establishment of measurable performance targets, which was negotiated between the industry and the FDA. 
Under the PDUFA provisions in this bill, in addition to moving products through the regulatory process more quickly, the FDA and industry will also establish a cooperative working relationship and shorten drug and device development times, which now represent the most significant delay in bringing new products to market. 
In addition, the bill includes a number of other constructive provisions to enhance cooperation between industry and the FDA to improve regulatory procedures. 
I am particularly gratified that the bill includes broader use of fast-track drug approval. The streamlined accessibility procedure now available primarily to cancer or AIDS will be available for drug treatments for patients with all life-threatening diseases. 
The bill provides for expanded access to drugs still under investigation for patients who have no other alternatives. The compromise combines protections for patients with expanded access to new investigational therapies, without exposing patients to unreasonable risks. 
The bill includes a new program to provide access for patients to information about clinical trials for serious or life-threatening diseases. 
It provides incentives for research on pediatric applications of approved drugs and for development of new antibiotics to deal with emerging, drug-resistant strains of disease. 
It requires companies to give patients advance notification of discontinuance of important products. And in that connection, I am disappointed that we were not able to address the issue of assuring that asthma patients and others will not be put at risk by any abrupt discontinuance of inhalers containing CFCs. I have been informed by FDA that no notice of proposed rulemaking will be issued before this summer, which will give Congress plenty of time to return to this question, if necessary. 
Mr. President, the current legislation is an improvement over the bill approved by the Labor Committee earlier this year--that bill included a number of provisions that as originally proposed 
could have jeopardized public health. 
The original bill provided a pilot program for third-party review under which private third parties, certified by the Food and Drug Administration but selected and paid by the manufacturer, would have reviewed the safety and effectiveness of medical devices to determine whether or not they could be sold. 
The original proposal would have included many of the most complex and risky devices, such as digital mammography machines, and a host of other devices to detect and treat cancer and other dread diseases. 
Under the final bill, these devices may not be included in the pilot program. 
The original bill required the Food and Drug Administration to approve devices for marketing even if the Food and Drug Administration knew defects in the manufacturing process would make the devices unsafe or ineffective. The final legislation eliminates this requirement. 
The original bill would have prevented the Food and Drug Administration from looking behind the label proposed by a device manufacturer seeking approval of a product, even if the product was false or misleading. The final legislation assures that the Food and Drug Administration will be able to require full and complete information for physicians and consumers on any potential use of the device, not just the one claimed on the label submitted with the application for approval. 
And the final legislation preserves the State authority to regulate cosmetics, an area of significant potential hazard to consumers. 
The legislation includes an important compromise on information on off-label use of drugs. This compromise will allow companies to circulate reputable journal articles about off-label use of drugs but will ultimately enhance the public health and safety because the FDA will be given the opportunity to review, comment on, and approve articles which the companies will circulate. The compromise also requires companies to undertake studies on the safety of their drugs for the specific off-label use and submit applications to the FDA for approval of their drugs for these uses within 3 years. Currently, too many off-label uses of drugs have never been reviewed for safety and effectiveness. 
The bill assures the Food and Drug Administration will continue to conduct appropriate environmental impact statements, rather than be exempted from the standards that apply to every other governmental agency. 
The compromise included in the bill assures the Nutrition Labeling Act is not undercut or weakened, and any health claims by food manufacturers have to be substantiated. 
The legislation maintains existing standards for approval of supplemental use of drugs while streamlining the process by which they can be approved. 
In summary, the current legislation is a vast improvement over the bill approved by our committee earlier this year. As a result of extensive discussion since then, including the 3 weeks of debate in the full Senate and our subsequent negotiations with the House, I believe every one of these problem issues has been resolved satisfactorily. 
The bill we enact will get safe and effective products to market while assuring the Food and Drug Administration will have the tools it needs for public health. It is a landmark achievement. I urge all of my colleagues to support it.

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 5 minutes. 
Mr. President, I just want to review once again, very briefly, the principal provisions in the legislation which I think are enormously constructive and positive. 
First of all, building on the PDUFA record, this provision that we have enacted expands the existing program by setting additional performance targets. It puts special emphasis on expanding early cooperation and FDA and the industry, which will reduce the development time, so that the drug development process, not just the regulatory review process, can be expedited. That is very important. 
There are many other positive achievements in the legislation. I am particularly gratified, as I mentioned earlier, with the broader use of the fast-track approval. The streamlined accessibility procedure now available primarily to patients with cancer or AIDS will also be available for drug treatments for patients with any other life-threatening diseases. This bill also provides for expanded access to drugs still under investigation for patience who have no other alternatives. The compromise combines protections for patients with expanded access to new investigational therapies, without exposing patients to unreasonable risks. 
The bill includes a new program to provide access for patients to information about clinical trials for serious or life-threatening diseases. 
It provides incentives for research on pediatric applications of approved drugs and for development of new antibiotic to deal with emerging, drug-resistant strains of diseases. 
It requires companies to give patients advance notification of discontinuance of important products. And in that connection, I am disappointed that we were not able to address the issue of assuring that asthma patients and others will not be put at risk by any abrupt discontinuance of inhalers containing CFC's. I have been informed by FDA that no notice of proposed rulemaking will be issued before this summer, which will give Congress plenty of time to return to this question, if necessary. 
The bill includes many measures that will reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens and appropriately clarify its authority. 
These provisions, as well as others, are extremely constructive and will be enormously helpful to the American consumer. 
Mr. President, I would like to mention some of the staff who have been a crucial part of this whole process. Those members of our staff on the Labor Committee: Nick Littlefield, David Nexon, Diane Robertson, Debbie Kochevar, Pearl O'Rourke, Jim Manley, Leslie Kux, and Carrie Coberly. 
Bonnie Hogue with Senator Reed, Sabrina Corlette and Peter Reinecke with Senator Harkin, Jeanne Ireland with Senator Dodd, Deborah Walker with Senator Bingaman, Anne Grady with Senator Murray, Linda DeGoutis with Senator Wellstone, Lynne Lawrence with Senator Mikulski, and Anne Marie Murphy with Senator Durbin. 
With the Republicans are the following staff: 
Jay Hawkins, Sean Donohue, and Mark Powden, with Senator Jeffords; Vince Ventimiglia with Senator Coats; Kimberly Spaulding with Senator Gregg; Sue Ramthun with Senator Frist; and Saira Sultan with Senator DeWine. 
Also, the House staff were instrumental in the success of this conference: 
Kay Holcombe, as Senator Hatch has indicated, worked with us when she worked with Senator Hatch on the committee years ago and was very constructive during this process. Howard Cohen, Rodger Currie and Eric Berger also with the Commerce Committee, and Paul Kim on Congressman Waxman's staff. 
And I thank the FDA staff: Bill Schultz, Peggy Dotzel, and Diane Thompson. 
I thank them all very much for all of their help and their involvement.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this appropriations bill contains immigration provisions to provide much-needed protection from deportation for Central American refugee families and an opportunity for permanent residence in the United States under our immigration laws. 
This legislation is an important step, and I commend Senator Mack and Senator Graham for their extraordinary work and leadership in helping these refugee families and for bringing this issue before the Senate. 
I deeply regret, however, that these provisions don't go far enough. Last year, Congress changed the rules and broke the faith with thousands of refugee families from Central America and Haiti who fled civil war, death squads, and oppression. They found safe haven in America, and they have contributed significantly to the United States and to communities across the country. 
They were allowed to remain in the United States under bipartisan immigration rules established by President Reagan, affirmed by President Bush, and reaffirmed by President Clinton. 
But last year, the Republican Congress withdrew the welcome mat. Now, these deserving families who have suffered so much are suddenly faced with deportation. They had been promised their day in court, but that day has been unfairly denied. 
This legislation is a frank admission by the Senate that last year's immigration law treated these families unfairly, and that something must be done to correct this grave injustice. 
But instead of correcting the injustice for all refugees, Republicans now propose to pick and choose among their favorite Latino groups, and deny any relief to Haitian refugees at all. 
Republicans want a blanket amnesty for Nicaraguans and Cubans, but far less for Salvadorans and Guatemalans who also faced oppression and civil war. 
They also provide protection from deportation for Eastern European refugees, but nothing for those who fled for their lives from Haiti 
The Republican proposal is unjust and shamefully discriminatory. These refugee groups faced similar circumstances and have a similar history. First the Reagan administration, then the Bush administration, and then the Clinton 
administration assured them that they could apply to remain permanently in the United States under our immigration laws. Under those laws at that time, if they have lived here for at least 7 years and are of good moral character, and if a return to Central America or Haiti will be an unusual hardship, they are allowed to remain. 
Last year's immigration law eliminated this opportunity for these families by changing the standard for humanitarian relief. It said the families had to live here for 10 years, not just 7, to qualify to remain. It created a much higher standard for proving that their removal from the United States would pose a great hardship to the family. It limited the number of persons who could get relief from deportation to only 4,000 per year. All other families would be deported, even if they otherwise qualified for relief under this program. 
Americans across the political spectrum have called on Congress to ensure that the rules are not changed unfairly for these families. President Clinton has urged Congress to give them the day in court they have been promised for the past decade. 
They include people such as Zulema, who fled to Miami in 1986 to escape civil war. Her husband and four children are all legal permanent residents of the United States. They have their green cards. Two of the children are now serving in the U.S. Army and have been stationed in Bosnia. But Zulema still does not have her green card and faces deportation. 
Her family escaped war and persecution. They rebuilt their lives in America. Her children have put their lives on the line in Bosnia in service of their adopted country. It is unfair to suddenly change the rules and deport their mother. 
Roberto, age 6, was abandoned by his parents in El Salvador during that country's tragic civil war. He came to the United States and was raised here by his aunt, who is an American citizen. Today, he is 18 years old and a freshman at Middlebury College in Vermont. He is an honors student planning a career in medicine. His only memories of El Salvador are of the war. He does not even know if his parents are still alive. Roberto, too, faces deportation. 
These are the kinds of persons we are talking about. They have played by the 
rules laid down by both Republican and Democratic administrations. They have obeyed the law. They have made worthwhile contributions to our communities. In fact, the assistant manager of Dade County in Florida estimates that Dade County would lose $1 billion in revenue if these families are forced to leave. 
But while offering assistance to Central American refugee families, the provisions of this amendment contain troublesome inequities that cannot be ignored. 
The Republican bill provides for case-by-case consideration of the applications of refugees from El Salvador or Guatemala. Under current INS practices, less than half of those eligible to apply are expected to get their green cards. But refugees from Nicaragua and Cuba get a blanket amnesty. 
Refugees from all four countries fled violent civil wars, death squads, rogue militias, and violations of their basic rights. Their families suffered persecution and death threats. Once here, they followed the rules laid out by our Government. But now, one group gets green cards--no questions asked--while the other is considered only on a case-by-case basis. 
I am also concerned that this legislation does not also help refugees from Haiti. In the Bush administration--and again in the Clinton administration--Haitian refugees, like Central Americans, were granted temporary haven in America from the rampant persecution and violence in Haiti. Many Haitians risked their lives by opposing the forces of oppression in their country and standing up for democracy and freedom. Yet, this amendment does nothing for these deserving families. They deserve their day in court, too. 
Congress should act on behalf of these Haitian families too, and I hope we will do so before the session ends. 
Once again, I commend Senator Mack and Senator Graham for their leadership on this important issue. 
I regret, however, that the Republican leadership did not see fit to allow us to offer amendments to ensure equal treatment for all Central American and Haitian refugees.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the D.C. voucher bill because it is unacceptable and unconstitutional. 
We all want to help the children of the District of Columbia get a good education. But this voucher provision is not the way to do it. Public funds should be used for public schools, not to pay for a small number of students to attend private and religious schools. 
Earlier this week, the House of Representatives soundly defeated a similar bill. It was Congress' first vote on a free-standing private school voucher bill. It's clear that private school vouchers are not the panacea that voucher proponents would like them to be. Americans do not want vouchers--they want to improve public education, not undermine it. 
President Clinton is a strong leader on education. In fact, President Clinton is the education President. He is leading the battle for education reform. The country is proud of his leadership, and our Republican colleagues don't know what to do. 
They keep shooting themselves in the foot in their repeated attempts to devise a Republican alternative that will satisfy their right wing hostility to public education and still have the support of the American people. It can't be done. First they tried to abolish the U.S. Department of Education. Then they tried to make deep cuts in funds for public schools. They even shut down the Government when they couldn't get their way. Now they are trying the same trick through the back door, using public funds to subsidize private schools. It won't work, and they shouldn't try. 
It is clear that President Clinton will veto the D.C. voucher bill, and he is right to veto it. 
The current debate involves schools in the District of Columbia. But the use of Federal funds for private schools is a national issue that Congress has addressed and rejected many times before. And so have many States. 
Now, voucher proponents are attempting to make the D.C. public schools a guinea pig for a scheme that voters in D.C. have soundly rejected, and so have voters across the country. 
Recent voucher proposals in Washington, Colorado, and California lost by over 2-to-1 margins. In 1981, D.C. voters defeated a voucher initiative by a ratio of 8 to 1, and the concept has never been brought up on the ballot again because it has so 
little support. Clearly, Congress should not impose on the District of Columbia what the people of D.C. and voters across the country reject. 
Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton, and D.C. parents, ministers, and other local leaders have made it clear that they do not want vouchers in the District of Columbia. Members of Congress who can't get to first base with this issue in their own States should not turn around and impose it on the people of the District. 
Vouchers would undermine D.C. school reforms already underway. Last year, Congress created a Control Board and all but eliminated the locally elected school board. This bill would create yet another bureaucracy in the form of a federally appointed corporation to run the voucher program. Six of the seven corporation members would be nominated by the Federal Government, and those nominations are controlled by the Republican Congress. Only one representative of D.C. would serve on the corporation. This is precisely the kind of Federal takeover of a local school system that Republican Senators oppose for any other community in America. 
Public funds should not go to private schools when District of Columbia public schools have urgent needs of their own. Roof repairs still need to be made; 65 percent of the schools have faulty plumbing; 41 percent of the schools don't have enough power outlets and electrical wiring to accommodate computers and other needed technology; 66 percent of the schools have inadequate heating, ventilation, and air conditioning. Funding these repairs should be our top priority, not conducting a foolish ideological experiment on school vouchers. 
Another serious problem with private school vouchers is the exclusionary policies of private schools. Scarce Federal dollars should not go to schools that can exclude children. There is no requirement in the bill that schools receiving vouchers must accept minority students, or students with limited English proficiency, or students with disabilities, or homeless students, or students with discipline problems. 
Public schools are open to all children. Public schools don't have the luxury of closing their doors to students who pose difficult challenges. 
Voucher proponents argue that vouchers increase choice for parents. But choice for parents is a mirage. Private schools apply different rules than public schools. Unlike public schools, which must accept all children, private schools can decide whether to accept a child or not. The real choice goes to the schools, not the parents. The better the private school, the more selective it is, and the more students are turned away. In Cleveland, nearly half of the public school students who received vouchers could not find a private school that would accept them. 
Vouchers will not help the overwhelming majority of children who need help. The 
current voucher scheme will, at most, enable 2,000 D.C. children to attend private schools, out of the 78,000 children who attend D.C. public schools. This proposal would provide vouchers for 3 percent of D.C. children--and do nothing for the other 97 percent. This is no way to spend federal dollars. We should invest in strategies that help all children, not just a few. 
As I have said before, instead of supporting local efforts to revitalize the schools, voucher proponents are attempting to make the D.C. public schools a guinea pig for an ideological experiment in education that voters in D.C. have soundly rejected, and that voters across the country have soundly rejected too. Our Republican colleagues have clearly been unable to generate any significant support for vouchers in their own States. It is a travesty of responsible action for them to attempt to foist their discredited idea on the long-suffering people and long-suffering public schools of the District of Columbia. If vouchers are a bad idea for the public schools in all 50 States, they are a bad idea for the public schools of the District of Columbia too. 
Many of us in Congress favor D.C. home rule. Many of us in Congress believe that the people of the District of Columbia should be entitled to have voting representation in the Senate and the House, like the people in every State. It is an embarrassment to our democracy that the most powerful democracy on Earth denies the most basic right of any democracy--the right to vote--to the citizens of the Nation's Capital. 
D.C. is not a test tube for misguided Republican ideological experiments on education. Above all, D.C. is not a slave plantation. Republicans in Congress should stop acting like plantation masters, and start treating the people of D.C. with the respect they deserve. 
General Becton, local leaders, and D.C. parents are working hard to improve all D.C. public schools for all children. Congress should give them its support, not undermine them. 
Another serious objection to this voucher scheme is its unconstitutionality. The vast majority of private schools that charge tuition less than the $3,200 available for a voucher are religious schools. Providing vouchers to religious schools violates the establishment clause of the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution. It's a Federal subsidy for sectarian schools. In many States, voucher schemes would violate the State constitution, too. 
Last January, a Wisconsin lower court held that the expansion of the Milwaukee voucher program to include religious schools was unconstitutional and violated the Wisconsin Constitution. The court stated that `We do not object to the existence of parochial schools or that they attempt to spread their beliefs through their schools. 
They just cannot do it with State tax dollars.' 
Last August, the Wisconsin State Court of Appeals affirmed that decision, holding that the expansion of the State voucher program to include religious schools was unconstitutional under the Wisconsin Constitution. 
Last May, an Ohio appellate court reversed a trial court's decision to allow public money to be paid to religious schools. The appeals court held that the voucher program violated the principle of separation of church and state under both the United States Constitution and the Ohio Constitution. The court ruled that the voucher program `steers aid to sectarian schools, resulting in what amounts to a direct government subsidy.' 
Last June, a Vermont State Superior Court held that the use of vouchers to pay tuition at private religious schools violates both the U.S. Constitution and the Vermont Constitution. 
As these cases demonstrate, the courts are clear that vouchers for religious schools are unconstitutional, and Congress should abide by their rulings. 
Last month, in a keynote address to the Conference of the Council of Great City Schools, Coretta Scott King said,  
I don't have a lot of sympathy with those who would further diminish the resources available to urban public schools with a voucher system . . . The debate over vouchers takes the focus away from where it really needs to be--on how we can increase funding and resources, so that every public school can provide the best possible education for all students. 
Coretta King is right. Instead of subsidizing private schools, we need to support ways to improve and reform the public schools--not in a few schools, but in all schools; not for a few students, but for all students. 
Subsidies for a few children at the expense of the many divides communities. The federal government should help bring communities together, not divide them. We should make investments that help all children in all neighborhood schools to get a good, safe education. I oppose the D.C. voucher bill as unwise, unacceptable, and unconstitutional. 
Private school vouchers are not the answer to the problems facing the nation's schools. It is a mistake and a misuse of tax dollars to send children to private schools at public expense.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Graham, Senator Mack, Senator Abraham, and Senator Moseley-Braun in introducing legislation providing permanent residence to Haitian refugees. 
The Senate has now adopted legislation to enable Nicaraguan and Cuban refugees to remain permanently in the United States as immigrants, and to enable Salvadorans and Guatemalans to seek similar relief on a case-by-case basis. 
Haitian refugees deserve no less. 
These families fled violence, torture, murder and other atrocities in Haiti. The Bush administration and the Clinton administration found that the vast majority of these refugees fled from Haiti because of a legitimate fear of persecution. 
These deserving Haitian refugees have resettled in many different States. They brought with them an unparalleled love of freedom, and a strong commitment to our democracy. They honor the opportunity that America offers. 
They were welcomed by churches and neighborhood groups, who have helped them rebuild their lives in communities across America. Today, they are contributing and valued members of our society. 
Immigration relief for Haitian refugees should have been included in the legislation to assist the refugees from Central America. 
President Clinton wrote to Speaker Gingrich to emphasize the importance of comparable relief for Haitian refugee families at a time when Congress was acting on relief for other refugees. Haitian refugees deserve the same immigration opportunities that the Republican leadership is proposing for refugees from Central America. 
But the Republican leadership in Congress said no. They even rejected our efforts at least to provide immediate relief from deportation for Haitian families. 
While the Republicans said no to these refugees, I understand that the Clinton administration will be taking steps to assure these Haitian families that they will be protected from deportation while Congress considers legislation in the coming months to allow the families to seek permanent residence here. 
And I commend Senator Moseley-Braun for her extraordinary leadership in working with the administration to achieve this important result, as well as Representative Carrie Meek for her tireless efforts for Haitian refugees. 
The legislation we are introducing will provide the fair relief that is greatly needed. It is a matter of simple justice. 
It should be adopted as soon as possible and I regret it was not part of the measure enacted today.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Specter and Senator Harkin for giving education the high priority it deserves in the fiscal year 1998 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations conference report, and I give it my strong support. 
We all know the serious challenges we face in improving public education and increasing access to college. Enrollments in elementary and secondary schools have reached an all-time high of 52 million children this year, and will continue to rise in the years ahead. Forty percent of fourth graders score below the basic level in reading, and fewer than 30 percent score in the advanced category. Yet our modern economy and the country's future depend more and more heavily on well-trained people. 
This bill increases funding for Federal education programs by $3.4 billion over last year to help provide young children with a good education and help more qualified students go to college. 
The bill provides a $1.5 billion increase in Pell grants to help an additional 210,000 young people attend college, and increases the maximum Pell grant from $2,700 to $3,000. 
The bill increases funding for title I by $200 million to help disadvantaged students get the extra help they need to improve their math and reading skills. 
The Education Technology Literacy Challenge Fund is more than doubled, from $200 million to $425 million. The technology innovation challenge grants receive $106 million, an increase of $49 million, to help teachers learn to use technology effectively and help schoolchildren prepare for the 21st century. The highly successful Star Schools Program will receive $34 million to continue to provide educational services to remote and underserved areas. 
The bill also increases Head Start funding by $375 million, including $279 million for the Early Head Start Program, to help more preschool children reach school ready to learn. 
Special education receives $775 million more than last year to help more children with disabilities get a good, appropriate education. 
The bill also contains a compromise on the issue of testing. Despite the efforts of many parents, schools, and communities to improve education, too many schools in communities across the country are educating in the dark. They have no way to compare the performance of their students with students in other schools in other communities in other parts of the country. We know that by every current indicator, the performance of American elementary and secondary school students falls far short of the performance of students in many other countries. We have to do better, and knowing where schools and students now stand is an essential part of helping them do better. 
This bill addresses these issues by including a fair compromise on President Clinton's proposal for voluntary national tests based on widely recognized national standards, so that parents, communities, and schools will have a better guide for improving local education. The voluntary national tests will be designed to test fourth grade reading and eighth grade 
math--two basic subjects at two critical times in students' academic development. 
Parents want to know how well their children are doing and how well their schools are doing, compared to other students and schools across the Nation. 
Voluntary national tests are an effective way to support local school reform, and I commend the conferees for their decision to move forward on these tests. 
This bill takes another step forward in higher education, too, by creating the Emergency Student Loan Consolidation Act. I commend Senator Jeffords for his leadership in continuing to make paying for college easier for more students. 
The Emergency Student Loan Consolidation Act reflects Congress's concern for students who have been unable to consolidate their loans in the direct loan program due to problems with the Department of Education's contractor. The act responds by opening up consolidation under the bank loan program to students who have direct loans. It does so without undermining the Department of Education's ability to pay for the administration of the loan programs. 
The act contains important nondiscrimination provisions that will help prevent lenders from choosing to allow consolidation of loans only for the most profitable borrowers. We will have an opportunity to do more on nondiscrimination during the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, but this bill is a good step toward making loans truly available to all students. 
The act also makes an important adjustment in the needs analysis calculation, so that needy students will benefit more effectively from the President's new education tax credits. Students who benefit from the HOPE tax credit and the life-long learning tax credit should not be penalized in their eligibility for future Federal financial aid. This change will help approximately 70,000 needy students, and it is an important part of this act. 
In addition to these advances in education, I also commend Senators Specter and Harkin for including increased funding for important health, energy, and biomedical research programs. 
This year's spending bill provides more funds for the Ryan White AIDS Program and the Community and Migrant Health Program. 
It provides $1.1 billion in fiscal year 1999 for LIHEAP, which will enable this program to serve thousands of additional senior citizens, the disabled, and working families by providing them with heating and cooling assistance. 
And it provides an increase of $907 million over last year for the National Institutes of Health. These investments in biomedical research hold great promise for the Nation to cure or prevent illnesses, and can also be an important factor in finding a long-term solution to the fiscal problems facing Medicare. 
One of the few major problems with the conference report is that it retains the ban on using any Labor Department funds in the bill to oversee the forthcoming Teamsters election. That election is a rerun of the 1996 election conducted under government supervision as part of the important ongoing effort to free the Teamsters from domination by organized crime. The 1996 election was cancelled because of fundraising improprieties by both sides driving the election campaign. A Federal court has ordered a rerun of the election, and Labor Department funds should be available to supervise it. 
The conference report is also disappointing in its funding of the National Labor Relations Board, which is frozen at last year's level. This result will require the agency to lay off 50 employees, and will hamper its ability to process its pending cases. There is no justification for Congress to disrupt the Nation's industrial relations in this way. 
There are many worthwhile provisions in this bill, and I intend to support it. But I hope that in action early next year, we can reconsider these unwise provisions and achieve a more satisfactory resolution.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the long impasse over the membership of the National Labor Relations Board is finally broken. For the first time since August 1995, the Board will have a full complement of five confirmed members. As a result, the Board will have additional resources to handle the many important cases on its docket. There will be greater certainly in industrial relations, which is good for labor, good for management, and good for the country. 
The nominees to be confirmed represent a balanced and fair package. The two Republican nominees, Peter Huertgen of Miami and J. Robert Bram III of Charlottesville, VA, are distinguished management lawyers, with many years of experience in Federal court in the NLRB litigation, and I know they will make a significant contribution as members of that Board. 
There are also two Democratic nominees, Wilma Liebman and Sarah Fox, both of Washington, DC. Ms. Liebman has served as Deputy Director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service since 1994, and she has done an outstanding job. She helped to resolve dozens of disputes between labor and management, and worked effectively to administer the operations of the FMCS. Ms. Liebman also has extensive experience representing labor unions and their members. She brings a wealth of knowledge of labor-management relations to this position. and I am confident she will serve with great distinction on the Board. 
I am particularly pleased that the Senate will finally confirm the nomination of Sarah Fox, who is well known to many of us in the Senate. From 1990 until January 1996, she served as counsel on the Labor Committee staff, and she did an extraordinary job on issues of vital importance to working families, especially in areas such as job safety and health, pension rights, fair wages, and reform of job training programs and the Davis-Bacon Act. She worked well with Senators on both sides of the aisle, and has been serving as a recess appointee on the Board. I have great respect to Sarah's ability an commitment to public service, and I'm delighted by her confirmation.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I give my strong support to the bill being introduced today by Senator Moseley-Braun to provide up to $1 billion a year for improving America's school facilities. 
Good education begins with good places to learn. We can't expect children to learn, when school roofs are crumbling, pipes are leaking, and boilers are failing. Adequate school facilities are essential to prepare children for the 21st century. It's preposterous to pretend that we can prepare students for the 21st century in dilapidated 19th century classrooms. 
We can no longer ignore this national crisis. We need to develop effective public-private partnerships to address these needs. Senator Moseley-Braun's bill provides that opportunity. 
Schools across the country are facing enormous problems with crumbling facilities. 14 million children in one-third of the nation's schools are now learning in substandard school buildings. Over half of all schools report at least one major building in disrepair, with cracked foundations, leaking roofs, or other major problems. 
This bill can be a major start toward repairing the nation's crumbling schools, by encouraging business and government to work together. It offers tax credits to developers and builders to cover costs of school improvements. Each state will receive funds based on the number of school-age children in the state who are eligible for federal education assistance. The states will have the flexibility to award the tax credits to developers in school districts with the greatest need. The credits will be taken against the developer's income, like other business tax credits. 
I urge my colleagues to support Senator Moseley-Braun's bill to help local communities rebuild America's crumbling schools. I look forward to continuing to work with her to make sure that Congress does its part to help address this national need.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, I am joining Senators Lautenberg, Durbin, Reed, and Kerry to introduce the Healthy and Smokefree Children Act, which is a comprehensive tobacco control initiative. Congress has an historic opportunity in the next session to protect current and future generations from nicotine addiction and early death caused by tobacco. 
We know the enormous adverse health consequences of youth smoking. Each day, three thousand children begin smoking. A thousand of them will die prematurely from tobacco-induced illnesses. Ninety percent of current adult smokers began to smoke before they reached the age of 18. 
Our primary goal is to reduce youth smoking and help children. Our legislation will raise the price of cigarettes by $1.50 a pack over three years. A substantial portion of the revenues raised by the increase will be used to fund major new initiatives in biomedical research, child health, and child development. 
The legislation will affirm the authority of the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco products. It also provides for strongly worded warning labels on packs of cigarettes, for a large-scale anti-tobacco advertising campaign, new restrictions on youth access to tobacco products, new protections against secondhand smoke, and transitional assistance to farmers. 
Public health experts tell us that the most effective way to reduce youth smoking is by a significant increase in the price of cigarettes. Teenagers have less money to spend on tobacco products than adults, and those who are not yet addicted will be less likely to spend their dollars on smoking. In fact, price increases are three times more likely to deter youth from smoking than adults. 
The 65 cent increase in the Attorneys' General settlement is not enough to do the job. If the national goal is to dramatically reduce teenage smoking, a price increase of at least $1.50 a pack will be needed. Even with a price increase of that magnitude, cigarettes in America will still cost less than the current price in many European countries. 
It would be irresponsible to wait another decade while we test the impact of lesser measures on youth smoking. Too many children are becoming addicted to tobacco each day. The most effective way to reduce youth smoking is a substantial price increase, and we should do it now. 
The $1.50 increase will enable us to provide approximately $20 billion per year to be divided equally between medical research and child development investments. Under our proposal, half of these additional funds will be used for an unprecedented expansion of biomedial research to solve the scientific mysteries of the most severe diseases and medical conditions. We stand on the threshold of extraordinary medical breakthroughts against cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's Disease, AIDS, diabetes, mental illness, and many other conditions. The benefits of greater research will save millions of lives and improve the quality of life for countless more. 
The other half of the new funds will be directed to child health and child development. The brain research conducted in recent years has demonstrated the critical importance of the first three years of life to a child's learning potential. Additional resources will enable us to build on that foundation of knowledge, and implement it in ways that will enrich the lives of the next generation of children. By expanding Head Start to reach the large number of eligible pre-school children who are not now being served, and by improving the quality and availability of child care for working families, we can give far more children a better foundation on which to build their lives. 
In addition, under our proposal, the key public health provisions in the Attorneys General agreement will be implemented, and smokers seeking to stop will be able to obtain help in overcoming their addiction. States will receive compensation from the tobacco industry for their Medicaid costs attributable to smoking, and will not have to reimburse the federal government for the federal share of the Medicaid costs recovered. These funds will be available to the states to address the unmet needs of children. 
A strong FDA with broad authority to regulate tobacco is also essential. Our legislation affirms FDA's finding that nicotine is an addictive drug and that cigarettes are a drug delivery device. The scope of regulation will include manufacturing, marketing, advertising, and distributing tobacco products. The FDA will be freed from the numerous procedural roadblocks which the tobacco industry has placed in its path. 
This legislation will substantially reduce smoking in America, enhance medical research, and help millions of children reach their full potential. Congress has a unique opportunity. We own it to America's children and America's future to act now.

 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the recent dispute between the Federal Maritime Commission and Japanese cargo vessel owners over the operation of Japan's docks has given Congress and the country a new lesson in the important role of United States longshore workers. Day in and day out, away from the limelight, they work long hours under back-breaking conditions. In so many ways, these hard-working men and women symbolize the American work ethic. A recent article in the Wall Street Journal compared the productivity of American longshore workers favorably with that of their Japanese counterparts. The article noted that `American dockworkers will unload 24 hours a day, taking 30% less time for about half the price.' The recent trade dispute has helped these workers obtain the recognition they deserve for their invaluable work in keeping commerce moving at our nation's ports. 
According to recent figures, 1.7 tons of cargo a year are handled by longshore workers in the United States, with a value of nearly $900 billion. 
As the Senate debates important questions of international trade and fair competition, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to these skillful, tireless, and courageous workers who do so much to support the Nation's economy and our trade with other countries. U.S. longshore workers across the Nation deserve America's gratitude--they have certainly earned it.

 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to express my concern at the delay in the vote on the nomination of David Satcher to be Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health. I understand that some Senators have placed holds on the nomination. 
Dr. Satcher is an excellent choice for these positions. He is a respected family doctor, respected scholar, and respected public health leader. For the past 4 years, he has ably led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the agency responsible for protecting the Nation's health and preventing disease, injury, and premature death. 
In 1992, under Dr. Satcher's leadership, CDC developed and implemented a very successful childhood immunization initiative. Before the initiative, only a little more than half the Nation's children--55 percent--were immunized. Today, the figure is 78 percent, and vaccine-preventable childhood diseases are now at record lows. 
Dr. Satcher has also led CDC efforts to deal more effectively with infectious diseases and food-borne illnesses. We rely heavily on CDC to provide the rapid response needed to combat outbreaks of disease and protect public safety. Under Dr. Satcher, CDC is implementing a new strategy against infectious diseases and a new early warning system to deal with food-borne illnesses. 
Prior to his appointment to CDC, Dr. Satcher was president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, the Nation's largest private historically black institution for educating health care professionals and biomedical researchers. He previously served as professor and chairman of the Department of Community Medicine and Family Practice at the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta. He also has been a faculty member at the UCLA School of Medicine and the King/Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles, and interim dean of the Drew Postgraduate Medical School. 
Dr. Satcher's range of skills and experience and his strong commitment to improving public health make him extremely well qualified to be the country's principal official on health care and health policy issues--America's Doctor. He's an excellent choice to be Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health. 
Dr. Satcher's nomination has received broad bipartisan support. He's been endorsed by a large number of health provider groups, including the American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, numerous academic health centers, and public health organizations. 
Despite these endorsements, a few detractors have emerged and I want to take a few moments to address their concerns. 
Some colleagues have questioned Dr. Satcher's views on abortion. This was not an issue at his confirmation hearing, but some Senators are using the controversial and unconstitutional `Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act' to attack his credibility. 
Dr. Satcher believes--as do most Americans--that abortions should be safe, legal, and rare. His position reflects 25 years of medical experience and is consistent with Supreme Court decisions. 
In fact, Dr. Satcher supports a ban on late-term abortions. But he shares President Clinton's view that `if there are risks for severe health consequences for the mother, then the decision [to have an abortion] should not be made by the government, but by the woman in conjunction with her family and physician.' 
Dr. Satcher's position on this issue is shared by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Women's Association, the American Nurses Association, and the American Public Health Association. 
Some in the Republican leadership have raised this issue in an attempt to defeat an outstanding nominee. Instead of resolving the late-term abortion issue months ago, they would rather play politics with Dr. Satcher's nomination and the lives and health of American women. 
The nation faces significant public health challenges. Our national infant mortality rate is at a record low, but it is still higher than that of many countries. Despite recent declines in the teenage birth rate, the U.S rate is still the highest in the industrial world. 
Similarly, in the case of childhood immunization, the rate nationwide may be the highest ever, but in many communities, less than half of 2-year-olds are adequately immunized. 
The country needs a medical leader whom people can trust to advise them on their health care. For over two years, the Office of Surgeon General has been vacant. It is irresponsible to put partisanship ahead of public health and safety. 
Dr. Satcher is an excellent choice to be the Nation's Doctor. I look forward to working closely with him, and I urge the Senate to move expeditiously to approve this nomination, so that we can deal more effectively with the country's important health challenges. I am confident that Dr. Satcher will serve America well. He deserves to be confirmed now, before this session of Congress ends.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the promise of new biomedical research is boundless. As impressive as the progress of the past has been, it pales in comparison to future opportunities. We stand on the threshold of stunning advances in medicine. Supporting biomedical research is among the wisest possible investments we can make in our Nation's future. 
Support for clinical research is central to biomedical research. Clinical research is essential for the advancement of scientific knowledge and the development of cures and improvement treatments of disease. Tremendous advances in basic biological research are opening doors to new insights into all aspects of medicine. As a result, there are extraordinary opportunities for cutting-edge clinical research to translate breakthroughs in the laboratory to the bedsides of patients. 
Improvements in patient care and diagnosis and prevention of disease depend upon clinical research that brings basic research discoveries to the bedside. In addition, the results of clinical research are incorporated by industry and developed into new drugs, vaccines, and health care products. These developments strengthen the economy and create jobs. 
Advances in biomedical research may also prove to be the most effective way to reduce the country's health care costs in the long run. As our Nation's demographics change and the baby boomers move toward retirement, financing Medicare has become an increasing concern. A Duke University study released earlier this year suggests that a small improvement in the disability rate of older Americans can bring large cost savings for Medicare. Investment in medical research will result in healthier older Americans and lower costs to Medicare. 
Despite these clear benefits, clinical research is in crisis. The resources dedicated to such research, particularly at the NIH, have fallen to a level that places the United States at a serious international disadvantage. 
Studies by the Institute of Medicine, the National Research Council, the National Academy of Sciences, and the National Institutes of Health have highlighted significant problems in the Nation's clinical research efforts. A 1994 report by the Institute of Medicine, for example, characterized the current level of training and support for health research professionals as `fragmented, frequently undervalued and potentially underfunded.' 
The legislation we are introducing today seeks to enhance support of clinical research by addressing the issues that 
have caused this crisis in clinical research. 
First, it will implement the longstanding recommendations regarding the merit review process for clinical research proposals at NIH. 
Second, it will provide greater support for general clinical research centers. 
Third, it will create new opportunities to pursue clinical research. A Clinical Research Career Enhancement Award will enable a clinical researcher to pursue research projects with a mentor prior to independent pursuit of research. For more established researchers, the Innovative Medical Science Award will provide funds to apply basic scientific discoveries to medical treatment. Both awards will generate the protected time which is so valuable to physician-scientists. 
Fourth, the bill provides support for individuals seeking advanced degrees in clinical investigation. 
Fifth, it expands the Loan Repayment Program for clinical researchers to encourage the recruitment of new investigators. 
A solid infrastructure is essential to any research program. In clinical research, that infrastructure is provided by the general clinical research centers at academic health centers throughout the country. Support for these centers was once largely provided by academic health centers. Today, academic health centers provide approximately $1 billion annually from clinical revenues to support clinical research. However, academic health centers are confronted with heavy competition from nonteaching institutions and are increasingly obligated to emphasize patient care over research to minimize costs. In the face of these changes, clinical researchers have become more dependent on NIH for infrastructure support. 
In spite of the expanding need, NIH support for the general clinical research centers has barely kept up with inflation. The centers are consistently funded at 75 percent of the funding level recommended by the NIH's own Advisory Council. This level is not adequate for the backbone of the Nation's clinical research efforts. Clearly we need to do more. 
The number of physicians choosing careers in clinical investigation is in serious decline. Between 1985 and 1997, the number of physicians increased by 34 percent, while the number of physicians pursuing research decreased by 37 percent. Fewer young physicians are choosing careers in research, and we need to reverse that decline. 
Student debt is a major barrier to pursuing clinical research. Young physicians graduate from medical school with an average debt burden of $80,000. Limited financial opportunity in clinical research has caused many young physicians to choose more lucrative medical practice. NIH has acknowledged this problem and has established a loan repayment subsidy to encourage the recruitment of clinical researchers to NIH. Our legislation expands the current program. 
Many of today's young clinical investigators are unfamiliar with research methodology. Dr. Harold Varmus, the Director of NIH, has articulated the need for individuals seeking careers in clinical research to have access to clinical research-specific training programs after they graduate from medical school. The NIH already supports a postgraduate training for those pursuing basic research. This legislation will support a comparable program for clinical investigators. 
Clinical researchers at academic health centers are also increasingly urged to turn their attention away from research to generate greater revenues. This loss of protected time has a significant adverse impact on their ability to compete for NIH research grants. This problem is particularly difficult for young researchers still seeking mentored research experience during the early years of clinical investigation. The NIH currently has awards to provide mentored career development experiences for basic scientists. Our legislation creates career development awards to help meet this need. 
Less than a third of all NIH grantees are physicians. Only a fraction of them receive awards for clinical investigation. The funding gap for clinical research is most severe in the earliest phases of clinical investigation, where basic scientific discoveries are tested on a small scale in studies involving few patients. Industry will not support such research in non-product-oriented studies and often regard such efforts as too speculative. The medical science awards in our bill will ensure funding for these important research initiatives. 
The need for reform of the peer review system has been documented by studies by the Institute of Medicine and an outside review committee of the NIH Division of Research Grants, which is responsible for the peer review process. So far, their recommendations have not been implemented, and the bias against clinical research persists. Our legislation will implement these recommendations and provide effective evaluation of clinical research proposals. 
The funds authorized by our legislation to support clinical research do not target specific diseases. The funds would go to peer-reviewed proposals to translate basic scientific discoveries into treatment and prevention of disease. Without such legislation, clinical research will continue to decline to a point where advances in medicine will no longer come from this country but from abroad.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last week the First Lady visited Dublin and Belfast. When the President and the First Lady visited those cities 2 years ago, they received a warm welcome from the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and Mrs. Clinton was warmly received on her return visit last week. 
During her visit, she emphasized the President's commitment to peace in Northern Ireland. All friends of Ireland in the United States are grateful for the continuing interest and involvement of the President and the First Lady in this issue, which is of such great importance to so many Americans. 
In Dublin on October 30, Mrs. Clinton spoke warmly of her previous visit in 1995 and the continuing strong commitment of the United States to the peace process. 
At the University of Ulster in Belfast on October 31, Mrs. Clinton delivered a lecture named in honor and in memory of Joyce McCartan, a courageous woman of peace whom the First Lady had met during her visit 2 years ago, and who had inspired many other women in Northern Ireland to take up the cause of reconciliation.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support free trade between the United States and other countries. I have supported fast-track authority in the past, and I wish I could still do so. 
But this fast-track bill is grossly one-sided and unfair. It goes the extra mile to protect intellectual property rights and other rights of business. Yet it puts major roadblocks in front of any effort to protect the rights of workers. 
The bill lists 15 so-called principal negotiating objectives. Negotiators are directed to pursue these matters vigorously in trade talks with other nations. One of the objectives urges negotiators to seek strict enforcement of laws protecting copyrights, patents, and intellectual property. The bill even directs negotiators to seek criminal penalties for violations of intellectual property rights. 
But the bill is silent about any corresponding effort to promote workers' rights. Negotiators are forbidden to encourage other countries to improve worker protections. Any provisions designed to strengthen labor protections or improve another country's enforcement of its labor protections cannot be given fast-track treatment. 
No previous fast-track bill took such a one-sided and discriminatory approach. For example, the 1988 fast-track law included a specific objective to `promote worker rights,' and this was an important part of the legislation. 
The present bill is unprecedented. It's fast-track for business and no track for labor, and that isn't fair. 
We should not make it impossible to use other countries' desire for access to U.S. markets to urge improvements in working conditions. Leaders in other countries often say their door is open to such initiatives. But this bill actually prevents our negotiators from taking advantage of such opportunities. It prevents the United States from using the incentive of access to our markets to persuade a country to improve working conditions for its employees, even in cases where the issue is prison labor or child labor. There is nothing fair about that. 
The bill also prohibits fast-track consideration of any provision that would modify U.S. labor or environmental standards. Any agreement that seeks to create internationally-recognized worker rights--such as a ban on child labor or prison labor--could not be considered under fast-track procedures, because it would restrict the power of the United States to refuse unilaterally to modify our own laws in these areas. There is nothing fair about that. 
The bill denies our negotiators the power to push for improvements in another country's labor protections. And it denies our negotiators the power to push for improvements on a multi-national basis as well. Under this legislation, there could be no effort to improve worker protections in any forum. There is nothing fair about that. 
Congress should not handcuff our ability to negotiate improvements in agreements setting basic labor standards that apply to specific nations or to all nations. Instead, we should use the trend toward globalization of markets to raise the level of employee protections around the world. 
We tried to accomplish this goal in the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993. The labor and environmental side agreements that accompanied NAFTA were designed to strengthen labor standards and establish a forum for resolving disputes. 
Many have criticized the effectiveness of these side agreements, and with good reason. In 1994, Mexican workers who tried to organize a union at a Sony Corp. plant in Nuevo Laredo were fired, and some were beaten. This brutality violated Mexican law, and the NAFTA enforcement authorities found that the Mexican Government had failed to comply with its obligations under the labor side agreement. But none of the employees was rehired, and no fines were assessed against either the Mexican Government or the company. The side agreements were not enforced. 
Weak as they are, side agreements like these are barred from consideration under the present bill. Such side agreements could not be given fast-track treatment. They would be subject to full debate and amendment in both houses of Congress. 
But under this defective fast-track bill, an agreement making it a crime to infringe a copyright would be given fast-track treatment, and rushed through Congress with limited debate and without amendment. 
This double standard is unacceptable. Trade affects goods and business profits, but it affects workers' lives and health as well. We can't deny the linkage. Yet this bill treats property rights far better than it does labor and environmental protections. Surely the life or health of a working man or woman deserves at least equal priority. 
It's also true that NAFTA has failed to live up to our hopes. The Labor Department has certified that 127,000 American workers lost their jobs as a direct result of trade with Mexico and Canada under NAFTA. Some experts say the number may be as much as four times higher. 
The administration has announced that it will seek hundreds of millions of dollars more for trade adjustment assistance to help workers dislocated by foreign trade. When American firms move their American plants to foreign countries in search of higher profits through cheaper labor, the American workers left behind pay a heavy price. 
Trade adjustment assistance can help, but to many workers, it is little more than funeral expenses. It's obviously not enough to offset the anti-worker, antilabor bias of this discriminatory fast-track bill. 
The five measures the administration announced earlier this week, through the World Trade Organization and the World Bank, are another small step in the right direction on labor issues. But again, four studies and a promise don't fix the problems with this bill. 
I urge the Senate to reject this unfair approach. This bill puts the rights of business on a pedestal, and leaves the rights of workers in the gutter. That kind of discrimination is unacceptable. No worker should be treated with less dignity than a compact disk. I oppose this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to defeat it.  
Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the Coverdell bill because it uses regressive tax policy to subsidize vouchers for private schools. It does not give any real financial help to low-income, working- and middle-class families, and it does not help children in the nation's classrooms. What it does is undermine public schools and provide yet another tax giveaway for the wealthy. 
Public education is one of the great successes of American democracy. It makes no sense for Congress to undermine it. This bill turns its back on the Nation's long-standing support of public schools and earmarks tax dollars for private schools. This bill is a fundamental step in the wrong direction for education and for the Nation's children. 
Senator Coverdell's proposal would spend $2.5 billion over the next 5 years on subsidies to help wealthy people pay the private school expenses they already pay, and do nothing to help children in public schools get a better education. 
It is important to strengthen our national investment in education. We should invest more in improving public schools by fixing leaky roofs and crumbling buildings, by recruiting and preparing excellent teachers, and by taking many other steps. 
If we have $2.5 billion more to spend on elementary and secondary education, we should spend it to deal with these problems. We should not invest in bad education policy and bad tax policy. We should support teachers and rebuild schools--not build tax shelters for the wealthy. 
Proponents of the bill claim that it deserves our support because the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that almost 75 percent of funds will go to public school students. 
But they're distorting the facts. According to the Department of Treasury, 70 percent of the benefit of the bill would go to those families in the highest income brackets. An October 28, 1997, Joint Tax Committee memorandum states that 83 percent of families with children in private schools would use this account, but only 28 percent of families with children in public schools would make use of it. It is a sham to pretend that the bill is not providing a subsidy for private schools. The overwhelming majority of the benefits go to high-income families who are already sending their children to private school, and does nothing to improve public education. 
In fact, the Joint Tax Committee memorandum clearly confirms this basic point that the bill disproportionately benefits families who send their children to private schools. As the committee memorandum states, `The dollar benefit to returns with children in public schools is assumed to be significantly lower than that attributable to returns with children in private schools.' 
Proponents of the bill claim that 70 percent of the benefits from the Coverdell accounts would go to families that earn under $70,000 a year. 
But again, they're distorting the facts. The facts are that the majority of the benefits under the proposal go to upper income families. Only about 10 percent of taxpayers have incomes between $70,000 and the capped income levels. Therefore, 30% of the benefits would go to just 10 percent of the taxpayers. In addition, the majority of the benefits for families who earn under $70,000 a year go to those earning between $55,000 and $70,000 a year. 
Other families will get almost no tax break from this legislation. Families earning less than $50,000 a year will get a tax cut of $2.50 a year from this legislation--$2.50. You can't even buy a good box of crayons for that amount. Families in the lowest income brackets--those making less than $17,000 a year--will get a tax cut of all of $1--$1. But, a family earning over $93,000 will get $97. 
Proponents also claim that these IRA's do not use public money. The money invested in the accounts, whether by individuals, their employer, or their labor union is their own money, not public funds. 
But the loss to the Treasury is clear. This proposal will cost the Treasury $2.5 billion in the first 5 years. It is nonsense to pretend that these funds are not a Federal subsidy to private schools. 
Scarce tax dollars should be targeted to public schools, which don't have the luxury of closing their doors to students who pose special challenges, such as children with disabilities, limited English-proficient children, or homeless students. Private schools can decide whether to accept a child or not. The real choice under this bill goes to the schools, not the parents. We should not use public tax dollars to support schools that select some children and reject others. 
We all want children to get the best possible education. We should be doing more--much more--to support efforts to improve local public schools. We should oppose any plan that would undermine those efforts. 
This bill is simply private school vouchers under another name. It is wrong for Congress to subsidize private schools. We should improve our public schools--not abandon them.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this bill exempts adopted immigrant children ages 10 and under from the battery of immunizations they would normally have to receive before being allowed to enter the United States. 
I share Senator Abraham's disappointment that this bill does not go further. The immunization requirement which has caused so many problems for all immigrants, including the parents of adopted immigrant children, was passed as a part of last year's immigration bill. This provision requires all immigrants to receive the entire series of vaccinations recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices before they are allowed to enter the United States. During the debate of the immigration bill, significant concerns were raised that this requirement would lead to many unintended results, such as forged immunization records, unavailability of vaccines, and inadequate health care if the immigrant had an adverse reaction to a vaccine. 
As a result of these concerns, the Senate passed a modified immunization provision, requiring immigrants to obtain most of their immunizations after they entered the United States, where vaccines and health care are available and adequate. Unfortunately, the Senate provisions were dropped in the conference on the final bill. Our concerns were borne out, and the bill we are about to pass deals with part of the problems caused by the overseas immunization requirement. I had hoped we could pass a bill that exempted all immigrant children, not just adopted immigrant children, from this requirement. However, the adoptive parents are legitimately concerned about their children's health, and they deserve this relief. I urge my colleagues to approve this legislation.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Sheila Widnall, the Secretary of the Air Force, who is leaving office at the end of this month to return to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as a professor of aeronautics and astronautics. In 1993, Secretary Widnall became the first woman to serve as a service Secretary when she assumed her present position as the Secretary of the Air Force, and she has done an outstanding job. 
During her distinguished tenure, Secretary Widnall has led the Air Force through a critical period of post-cold-war consolidation and adjustment. Congress and the country are proud of her achievements. She directed a modernization program to shape the future of the Air Force and incorporate space technology into military operations. She led the Department's remarkable success in overhauling its business practices, including major initiatives in acquisition reform, outsourcing, and privatization to increase efficiency and make maximum use of scarce funds. She has also taken the lead in strengthening the Nation's role in space, by working effectively with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Reconnaissance Office, and the private space sector. 
Above all, Secretary Widnall has done her best to care for Air Force members and their families. Her emphasis on equal opportunity and her skillful and tireless pursuit of quality of life issues kept morale high during a period of significant and far-reaching change. 
Secretary Widnall brought an outstanding background to her current position. Her accomplishments include many years as a professor of aeronautics and astronautics and also as associate provost at MIT. She has earned international recognition for her work in fluid dynamics, and has had extensive service on numerous boards, panels, and committees in government, industry, and the academic world. 
In her years as Secretary, Sheila Widnall has set a high standard of leadership and service to the Nation. I know I am joined by my colleagues in Congress and a grateful Nation in thanking her for her dedication and distinguished service to our country, and I wish her well in the years to come.

Mr. KENNEDY. In June, the President nominated Nancy-Ann Min DeParle to be Administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration [HCFA]. When confirmed as the Head of HCFA, Ms. DeParle will be responsible for running Medicare, Medicaid, and the new children's health program, and provide valuable direction for other important health insurance initiatives. More than 70 million Americans--senior citizens, children, persons with disabilities and others--depend on these programs for lifesaving health care. Leaving this critically important agency without a leader during this challenging time is irresponsible and indefensible, and I urge the Senate to move quickly to confirm her nomination. 
It is especially offensive that a Senator is holding this nomination hostage in order to extract a concession from the President on an HCFA-related issue. We all want things from HCFA, and those issues should be resolved as part of the legislative process, not by denying this important Federal agency the leadership it needs. 
At this moment, a large number of Medicaid waivers are pending from States that want flexibility to go beyond the current rules. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of decisions must be made regarding implementation of the Medicare provisions in the Balanced Budget Act--including the establishment of important new preventive benefits. This historic legislation also included the largest health insurance expansion since the creation of Medicare and Medicaid. It provides health insurance to uninsured children in working families who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to purchase private health insurance. We all worked hard for this program. All 50 States will be submitting their plans for this coverage in the coming months and HCFA needs to take action. 
Ms. DeParle is extremely well-qualified to lead HCFA. She served from 1993 to 1997 as the Associate Director for Health and Personnel at the Office of Management and Budget. In this capacity, she guided the development and implementation of budget and policy matters for all Federal health programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. In addition to other accomplishments, she has extensive experience running a state-level cabinet agency. From 1987 to 1989, she administered a 6,000-employee agency as commissioner of human services in Tennessee. 
No significant objection to her nomination was raised at the Finance Committee hearing in September. She was approved unanimously by the committee on September 11, and she has been waiting since that day for the full Senate to act. It is long past time for the Senate to act.

 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the Coverdell bill because it uses regressive tax policy to subsidize vouchers for private schools. It does not give any real financial help to low-income, working and middle-class families, and it does not help children in the nation's classrooms. What it does is provide yet another tax give-away for the wealthy. 
Public education is one of the great successes of American democracy. It makes no sense for Congress to undermine it. This bill turns its back on the nation's long-standing support of public schools and earmarks tax dollars for private schools. This is a fundamental step in the wrong direction for education and for the nation's children. 
Proponents of the bill argue that assistance is available for families to send their children to any school, public or private. But that argument is false. The fact is that public schools do not charge tuition. Therefore, the 90% of the nation's children who attend public schools do not need help in paying tuition. Even worse, the people helped most by this proposal are families in high income brackets--and these families can already afford to send their children to private school. 
The nation's children deserve good public schools, safe public schools, well-trained teachers, and a good education. Private school vouchers disguised as IRAs will undermine all of those essential goals by undermining the public schools, not helping them. 
We all want the nation's children to get the best possible education. We should be doing more--much more--to support efforts to improve local schools. We should oppose any plan that would undermine those efforts. 
Scarce tax dollars should be targeted to public schools. They don't have the luxury of closing their doors to students who pose special challenges, such as children with disabilities, limited English-proficient children, or homeless students. Vouchers will not help children who need help the most. 
Proponents of the bill argue that vouchers increase choice for parents. But parental choice is a mirage. Private schools apply different rules than public schools. Public schools must accept all children. Private schools can decide whether to accept a child or not. The real choice goes to the schools, not the parents. The better the private school, the more parents and students are turned away. 
In fact, many private schools require children to take rigorous achievement tests, at the parents' expense, as a basis for admission to the private schools. Lengthy interviews and complex selection processes are often mandatory. Private schools impose many barriers to admission. Few parents can even get to the schoolhouse door to find out if it is open to their child. For the vast majority of families with children in public schools, the so-called `school choice' offered by the voucher scheme is a hollow choice. 
Public schools must take all children, and build a program to meet each of their needs. Private schools only take children who fit the guidelines of their existing programs. We should not use public tax dollars to support schools that select some children, and reject others. 
Senator Coverdell's proposal would spend 2.5 billion dollars over the next five years on subsidies to help wealthy people pay the private school expenses they already pay, and do nothing to help children in public schools get a better education. 
It is important to continue the national investment in children and their future. We should invest more in improving public schools by fixing leaky roofs and crumbling buildings, by recruiting and preparing excellent teachers, and by taking many other steps. We should not invest in bad education policy and bad tax policy. 
We know that at the current time, 14 million children in one-third of the nation's schools are learning in substandard facilities. Over half of all schools report at least one major building in disrepair, with cracked foundations, or leaking roofs, or other major problems. If we have 2.5 billion more dollars to spend on elementary and secondary education, we should spend it to deal with these problems. 
During the next decade, because of rising student enrollments and rising teacher retirements, the nation will need over 2 million new teachers. Yet today, more than 50,000 underprepared teachers enter the classroom every year. Students in inner-city schools have only a 50% chance of being taught by a qualified science or math teacher. We should support teachers and rebuild our schools--not build tax shelters for the wealthy. 
It is clear that this proposal disproportionately benefits wealthy families. The majority of the tax benefits would go to families in high income brackets. These families can already afford to send their children to private school. 
Working families and low-income families do not have enough assets and savings to participate in this IRA scheme. This regressive bill does not help working families struggling to pay day to day expenses during their children's school years. 
The majority of families will get almost no tax break from this legislation. 70 percent of the benefit goes to families in the top 20 percent of the income bracket. Families earning less than $50,000 a year will get a tax cut of $2.50 from this legislation--$2.50. You can't even buy a good box of crayons for that amount. Families in the lowest income brackets--those making less than $17,000 a year--will get a tax cut of all of $1--$1. But, a family earning over $100,000 will get $97. 
Even many families who can save enough to be able to participate in this IRA scheme will receive little benefit. IRAs work best when the investment is long-term. But in this scheme, money will be taken out each year of a child's education. Only the wealthiest families will be able to take advantage of this tax-free savings account. 
In addition, `qualified expenses' are defined so broadly in this bill, that parents could justify almost any expense even remotely connected to the costs of elementary and secondary education, creating a large loophole for people to spend funds in ways not intended. 
In order to guard against fraud and abuse, the IRS would have to take on more tax audits of families that establish these accounts. The IRS will have to ask what school a child attends, what expenses the parents actually incurred, and whether the accounts were properly set up and used. 
This bill is bad tax policy and bad education policy. It does not improve public education for the 90 percent of children who go to public schools. It is a waste of scarce tax dollars. 
Education reform should help education, not undermine it. Students need to master the basics, meet high standards, and be taught by well-trained teachers. We need to hold schools accountable for results, and create safe buildings and learning environments. 
This bill is simply private school vouchers under another name. It is wrong for Congress to subsidize private schools. We should improve our public schools--not abandon them.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to introduce the Paul E. Tsongas Fellowship Act. This bill commemorates an outstanding leader and former colleague in the Senate who was an impressive and dedicated advocate of technology and environmental protection. Congressman Joe Kennedy is the sponsor of a companion bill in the House of Representatives. 
As a Senator, Paul Tsongas worked skillfully to guarantee that technology and environmental concerns are at the forefront of our country's priorities. He was an extraordinary leader who understood the importance of addressing the serious energy and environmental challenges we face at home and around the world. Today, we honor his commitment to these important priorities by proposing a national fellowship program to support graduate students in science and engineering. 
As a nation, we need to do more to encourage the best students to pursue graduate studies in these basic fields, which are so essential to a strong future for the Nation. As much as 50 percent of economic growth is attributed to technological innovation. The Paul E. Tsongas Fellowship will support the modern pioneers who will keep the Nation at the cutting edge of the technology revolution. 
The fellowship is modeled on the successful Office of Naval Research Graduate Fellowship Program, which over the past 15 years has provided fellowships to 592 graduate students in 11 disciplines, and has made significant contributions to research. The Tsongas fellowships in science and engineering can make a comparable contribution in these fields. They will enhance our efforts to improve educational opportunity for students, and strengthen our country's economy by investing wisely in the future. 
The Tsongas fellowships will be a living memorial to one of the outstanding Senators of our time, and I hope that Congress will act quickly on this important legislation.

Mr. KENNEDY. I'd like to join Senator Jeffords in submitting the Senate resolution declaring the last Friday in April National Child Care Professional's Day. 
Child care is a vital part of the fabric of the daily lives of millions of America families. The majority of children today have working parents who must find some way of ensuring that their children are safe and well-cared for during working hours. 
Millions of children of all income levels are cared for by someone other than their parents. Each day, approximately 13 million children spend some or all of their day in some type of child care. 
Research demonstrates that the quality of these settings makes a significant difference in children's health, safety and early learning. Yet far too many children are being cared for in poor quality settings that jeopardize their safety and development. 
We know how to do it better, and it is long past time to start doing it. A sensible action plan includes better staff training, requiring basic health and safety protections, monitoring programs, informing parents, and improving staff salaries. 
Today, Senator Jeffords, Senator Dodd, Senator Roberts, and I are submitting a bipartisan Senate resolution to designate the last Friday in April every year as National Child Care Professional's Day, starting next April--April 24, 1998. 
Child Care professionals are indispensable to the future of the Nation's children. Children deserve the best we can provide. Parents deserve the peace of mind that comes with knowledge that their children are in safe, healthy surroundings that encourage, not undermine their development. 
Quality child care is essential for healthy child growth and healthy child development. By honoring child care providers and the child care profession in this way, Congress will be taking a significant step toward giving them the stronger support and the greater encouragement and the higher priority they deserve.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a few months ago, the American Immigration Lawyers Association held an essay contest entitled `Celebrate America' for children in grades four through seven. The children were asked to write on the subject, `Why I Am Glad America Is a Nation of Immigrants.' Hundreds of children entered the contest, and I congratulate all the participants. 
The winner of the contest was Veronica Curran, a fifth grader in St. Mark's School in Shoreline, WA, who wrote about her family's extraordinary immigrant history--she and each of her brothers and sister were adopted from different countries. Eric Eves of Goulds, FL, Crystal Kohistani of Plymouth, MN, and Joseph Opromollo of Morris Plains, NJ, wrote other top essays. All of the essays reflect pride in America's immigrant heritage, and emphasize the benefits of immigration for the United States.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the American Medical Association recently honored Massachusetts State Senator Mark Montigny of New Bedford with its 1997 Nathan Davis Award. This honor is a well-deserved tribute to Senator Montigny for his outstanding commitment to public service and his leadership in health care. 
The award was established by the AMA in 1989 to honor elected and career officials at the Federal, State and local levels for their leadership in advancing public health. Mark Montigny's role on these vital issues in the Massachusetts legislature has helped our State to make impressive progress in improving the quality and affordability of health care for all citizens. 
In July 1996, one of Senator Montigny's principal legislative initiatives was enacted into law, to provide health insurance for the 160,000 children in Massachusetts without such insurance. His initiative also launched a pilot prescription drug subsidy program for senior citizens. 
These initiatives are financed by a 25 cent increase in the State cigarette tax. The linkage between the cigarette tax and children's health insurance in Senator Montigny's bill was one of the principal models for the national children's health insurance legislation enacted by Congress as part of the balanced budget agreement this year. 
New Bedford and Massachusetts are proud of Mark Montigny's leadership on these issues. I congratulate him on the AMA's award, and I look forward to working closely with him in the years ahead.

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 7 minutes, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, Americans from all walks of life know that we need tough new laws that limit the role of money in election campaigns in American political life. They are fed up with a campaign process driven by the soaring costs of television commercials. They are fed up with incumbents and challengers who spend more time raising money from special interests instead of serving the public interest. 
Americans want true campaign finance reform, and today is a test of whether the Republican leadership in the Senate is listening. Will we get a chance to enact campaign finance reform, or will the Republican leadership in the Senate continue to block reform or even withdraw the bill entirely? 
Instead of reform and accountability in Government, Republicans wants to silence the voices of America's working families. Instead of adopting real limits on campaign spending, Republicans want to sweep the American worker under the rug. 
In the world according to the Republicans, there would be more and more money for their campaigns and less and less for those who speak up for better jobs, better health care for our children, and a better retirement for our seniors. 
So far in this debate, instead of limiting the amount of money in politics, Republicans prescribe an overdose of money for elections in which their friends in big corporations and their lobbyists and special interests can write more checks and bigger checks to the Republican Party. 
Republicans in the Senate have decided that they would rather kill the patient with a poison pill than cure the disease. They say that unless the bill silences the voice of labor unions and American workers in the political process, they will kill campaign finance reform. They want to increase the power of large corporations and squash even the limited power that American workers have today. Republicans want to handcuff labor unions in the battle for a living wage and fair retirement benefits, for safety and health conditions in the workplace. 
In short, Republicans want to impose a gag rule on American workers but let their friends in big corporations, the National Rifle Association, and other well-heeled special interests buy a controlling interest in the Government. 
The Lott amendment is a killer amendment, because it unfairly punishes working Americans and their unions for participating in the 1996 elections. The Lott amendment bars unions from collecting dues from any workers--including those who voluntarily join a union--unless those workers sign a permission slip for their union dues to be spent for political purposes. 
When the amendment seeks to block labor union contributions for political purposes, the restriction is not limited to campaign ads or lobbying. Instead, it includes union newsletters, nonpartisan voter registration drives, and get-out-the-vote efforts. The scope is vast, and the goal is obvious--to deny working Americans those basic rights of our democracy. 
We have heard much in recent days about the importance of the first amendment. Many on the other side of the aisle wrap themselves in the banner of free speech when they oppose the McCain-Feingold bill. They claim that the first amendment requires that more money be pumped into the political process. 
That is Alice-in-Wonderland, looking-glass logic, and everyone knows it. 
I couldn't disagree more, and so does the majority of the American people. Americans want campaign finance reform, and they want it now. 
Strangely, those who claim that the first amendment demands more money in politics are silent about the Lott amendment's effect on free speech. Working Americans and their unions have first amendment rights to freedom of speech and association. Political activity is critical for workers to protect the legislative gains they have made in the past 70 years. Workers can and should speak out to strengthen safety and health laws, and protect American jobs against exploitative foreign competition. 
And what better way to address these and other basic concerns than by banding together in their unions? The labor movement is the most effective voice for working Americans in the political process, and we all know it. 
But the Lott amendment silences this voice. It imposes onerous prior consent requirements on unions, and forces unions to set up burdensome bureaucracies to meet its terms. The amendment's supporters know this would cripple unions' ability to participate in politics. Yet those supporters say nothing about the denial of workers' freedom to speak or associate. Many Republicans apparently care nothing for the first amendment when it comes to American workers. 
How hypocritical can you get? 
Well, I believe that the first amendment applies to employees as well as executives. Unions have at least as much right to speak as corporations. Nothing in the first amendment says `except if you are a union member.' 
Unfortunately, it seems that many of my colleagues on the other side disagree. 
They want to continue the torrent of campaign ads and political contributions from the big tobacco companies and other large corporations, the National Rifle Association and other special interests. The Lott amendment does nothing to affect the free flow of money from those groups, whether their members agree or not. Where is the concern for corporate shareholders who do not want their money going toward political causes? What about dues-paying members of the National Rifle Association who may not agree with all the political stands their organization takes? I don't hear Republicans expressing concerns about them. 
Instead, under the Lott amendment it is only workers who are silenced while big corporation and other special interests are unaffected. 
The current campaign finance laws, inadequate as they are, at least apply evenhandedly to political spending by both business and labor. The Lott amendment violates fundamental principles of parity by imposing new restrictions on workers and labor unions. 
This isn't reform; it is revenge. It is a blatant attempt to punish working Americans for their role in the 1996 elections and an equally blatant attempt to increase the role of big business in the next election. 
These workers were pointing out the importance of fairness to working Americans to increase the minimum wage, working families that were pointing out the wrong priorities that were being pressed by the Republican leadership in cutting back essential education programs. They were pointing out the recommendations by the Republican majority to cut back on the Medicare Program and to use those cuts for tax breaks for wealthy individuals, and the programs that were recommended and passed in the House and Senate to open up pension funds for corporate raiders--all of these items were put out on the American agenda, and in instance after instance the American people rejected the Republicans' proposal and reelected a Democratic President. 
We must move beyond this partisan assault on American workers and enact real campaign financing reform. We should heed the call of former Presidents Carter and Ford as they wrote on Sunday:  
We must demonstrate that a government of the people, by the people and for the people is not a thing of the past. We must redouble our efforts to assure voters that public policy is determined by the checks on their ballots rather than the checks from powerful interests. 
If President Ford and President Carter can agree, if Vice President Mondale and former Senator Kassebaum can agree, then surely this Senate can reach agreement, too. 
I urge my colleagues to defeat the Lott amendment and support the meaningful reforms of the McCain-Feingold legislation. I yield the floor. 
Mr. REED addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, few if any issues before the Senate this year are more important than campaign finance reform. 
Americans from all walks of life are fed up with the current campaign financing system and its excessive reliance on unlimited contributions that make conflict of interest a way of life. They are fed up with a campaign process driven by the high cost of television commercials. They are fed up with candidates who spend more time raising money from special interests instead of serving the public interest. 
And who can blame them? 
In recent years, the amount of money spent in Presidential campaigns has doubled every 4 years. Senate and House races now cost millions of dollars. Election campaigns have become more and more negative, with misleading TV spots that traffic in half-truths or outright falsehoods. And corrupting and corroding it all are the massive abusers of the current loophole-ridden campaign financing laws. 
The constant hunt for campaign dollars demeans our electoral process and undermines the very foundation of our country. We have the best political system that money can buy, and it's a disgrace to everything our democracy stands for. 
The time for change is now. We must take elections off the auction block. We must limit campaign spending. We must return the election process to the people, in which every voter is equal, no matter what their income, or what job they hold, or where they live. 
Democrats understand this. Democrats in the Senate are unanimously committed to campaign finance reform that limits campaign spending. All 45 Democrats in the U.S. Senate have pledged their support for the bipartisan McCain-Feingold bill. President Clinton, too, has clearly stated his unequivocal support for this important legislation. He has taken the extraordinary step of announcing his intention to use his authority under the U.S. Constitution to require Congress to meet in special session if it fails to take up this urgently needed reform. 
But where are the Republicans? 
Have they united behind a proposal--any proposal? 
Are they willing to join with Democrats to clean up the cesspool, and limit the amount of money and the power of money in American elections? 
Sadly, the answer is `no.' 
The Republican prescription for these flagrant abuses is more money in politics, not less. They prescribe an even larger overdose of money for elections, in which their friends in big businesses and their lobbyists and special interests can write more checks and fatter checks to the Republican Party. 
Their recipe for campaign finance reform is to tilt the balance even more unfairly against American workers. They want to increase the power of large corporations, and squash even the limited power that American workers have today. Republicans want to handcuff labor unions in the battle for a living wage, for decent health care for working families, and a secure retirement for the elderly. They want to silence union support for candidates who stand up and speak out on those basic issues. 
In short, Republicans want to impose a gag rule on American workers. 
The Republican antiworker scheme is a poison pill for campaign finance reform, and the Republicans admit it. The majority leader, Senator Lott, told the Washington Times that his amendment would kill the bill because Democrats would mount a filibuster. He said, `I've set it up where they're going to be doing the filibustering.' 
Columnist Robert Novak agrees. Writing about the Republican amendment to impose a gag rule on workers, he says its `primary purpose in Congress is not to win Republican supporters for campaign reform but to lose Democratic supporters . . . . Republicans are divided between the many who bash labor to kill reform and the few who appease labor to save reform.' 
The Lott amendment is a killer amendment, because it unfairly punishes working Americans and their unions for participating in the elections. The Lott amendment bars unions from collecting dues from any workers--even members who voluntarily join the union and participate in setting its goals--unless those workers sign an authorization form to allow part of their union dues to be spent for political purposes. 
This isn't reform--it's revenge. It's a blatant attempt to punish working Americans for their role in the 1996 elections--and an equally blatant attempt to silence working Americans in future elections. 
Republicans intend this procedure to cripple any union's ability to participate in elections. They know that imposing such a requirement on any organization would have the same result. Yet, they don't propose it for the National Rifle Association or the big tobacco companies or the American Farm Bureau or the Chamber of Commerce. They don't ask corporations to get permission slips from their shareholders before the corporation can spend funds for political purposes. The Lott amendment should be called The Rampant Republican Hypocrisy Act of 1997. How hypocritical can they get? 
The real measure of whether Republicans are serious about campaign finance reform is whether they will support honest limits on campaign spending. 
The McCain-Feingold bill that all 45 Senate Democrats support will ban so-called soft money--the millions of dollars in campaign funds that today are virtually unregulated. This immense loophole in our current campaign laws allows contributions worth hundreds of thousands of dollars to be made to political parties. The parties then spend the money to help elect candidates for Federal office. While the amount of money that an individual voter can give to a candidate is limited to $1,000 per campaign, candidates for Federal office can receive millions through the back door using this soft money loophole. 
Clearly, any legislation worth the name reform must ban this shameful practice. 
In addition, the McCain-Feingold bill limits the ability of outside groups to run ads supporting specific candidates. This practice has become another source of soft money for Federal candidates. If you don't have enough money in your own campaign to pay for your ads, then get a friendly outside group to support them. 
The McCain-Feingold bill says that organizations are free to run ads on genuine issues. That's free speech, and it's protected under the Constitution. But if an outside group runs an ad supporting a specific candidate, then the cost of that ad should be counted as part of the candidate's campaign, and should be subject to the Federal election laws. 
The McCain-Feingold bill also increases disclosure requirements for campaigns, so that the public will be able to see much more clearly the sources and the amounts of all contributions that any candidates accept. 
It is time for Congress to stop talking about reform and start acting to make it happen. This bill is not a perfect bill. All Senators can find some provision in it that they do not like. But the McCain-Feingold bill is an honest reform and the best hope to end the most flagrant abuses under the current system. I urge Democrats and Republicans alike to support this bill and send it on to President Clinton, so that we can clean up the current mess and restore the voters' shattered confidence in our democracy. 
It is time to take our campaigns away from the special interests and give them back to the people. It is time to make our democracy worthy of its name.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to speak for just a few moments about a very special provision that is now before the Senate, which we will vote on next week, and that is the amendment which has been proposed by Senator Mack, Senator Graham, and myself, which is pending on the D.C. appropriations bill. Without this amendment, thousands of Central American refugee families who fled death squads and persecution in their native lands and found safe haven in the United States would be forced to return to their countries. Republican and Democratic administrations alike promised them repeatedly that they will get their day in court to make their claims to remain in the United States. 
Last year's immigration law, however, turned its back on that commitment and treated these families unfairly. This legislation reinstates that promise and guarantees these families the day in court they deserve--that's all, just the day in court they deserve to be able to make their case, which they were promised at the time they came to the United States, by Republican and Democratic administrations. That particular guarantee was eliminated in the bill last year. It is the attempt by Senator Mack and Senator Graham and myself to maintain that commitment to these families. 
Virtually all of these families fled to the United States in the 1980's from El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. Many were targeted by death squads and faced persecution at the hands of rogue militias. They came to America to seek safety and freedom for themselves and their children. The Reagan administration, the Bush administration, and the Clinton administration assured them that they could apply to remain permanently in the United States under our immigration laws. They were promised that if they have lived here for at least 7 years and are of good moral character, and if a return to Central America would be an unusual hardship, they would be allowed to remain. They have to meet those particular requirements and if they don't meet those requirements, then they are unable to remain in the United States. Last year's immigration law violated that commitment. 
President Clinton has promised to find a fair and reasonable solution for these families, and the administration will use its authority to help as many of them as possible. But Congress must do its part by enacting this corrective legislation. 
Earlier in the course of today's debate, our colleague from Texas, Senator Gramm, talked at some length about this particular amendment and about the situation in which these refugees find themselves. I would like to just clarify and respond to some of the comments that were made earlier in the day. 
The first comment was this legislation reverses our immigration laws enacted just last year. The answer is the law was changed on these families retroactively, we took steps, gave guarantees, and then took action. These families had very little to do with it, and now the law was changed. They played by the rules laid out by President Reagan, President Bush, and the Clinton administration. They were promised their day in court. But last year's law went back on that promise. All we are trying to do is to make sure they are given their day in court. 
Then the comment was made that this should go through the Immigration Subcommittee, not on an appropriations bill. Our chairman, Senator Abraham, spoke in support of this amendment. He is the chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, and I am the ranking member. We are in strong support of this particular proposal, as I believe the members of the committee are. 
The further point that was made by Senator Gramm was we need to stop illegal immigration, that this is an amnesty. Mr. President, it is an insult to these hard-working refugees, and their families who have suffered so much pain and hardship and who relied in good faith on the solemn promise they were given to call them illegal aliens or call what we are doing an amnesty. Virtually all of these families are already known to the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service. They are not illegal aliens working underground. These are families who applied to come to the United States under INS programs, and they are here on a variety of temporary immigration categories. They have acted in accord with what our Government told them to do. 
Not all these families will qualify to remain here under the terms of this amendment. They still must meet certain standards that existed in the law before the law was changed and applied retroactively. The Immigration Service estimates that less than half of those who qualify to apply to remain in this country will be approved. These families are law-abiding, tax-paying members of communities in all parts of America. In many, many cases, they have children who were born in this country and who are U.S. citizens by birth. They deserve to be treated fairly. 
I just want to take a few moments to talk about who these people are. Zulema Balladares came to the United States from Nicaragua in 1986. If she is deported, she will be leaving her husband and four children who are lawful, permanent residents here in the United States. The Balladares have strong ties to the United States. They own their home, and two of their children serve in the U.S. Army, both served in Bosnia. Their children's ages range from 13 to 21 and have all resided in Miami for the past 10 years, the majority of the children's lives. 
Justina Jiron entered the United States 12 years ago along with other family members. She has two U.S. citizen children. Her youngest, a baby, has a need for surgery and ongoing medical treatment as a result of a birth defect. Thankfully, she has health insurance to cover the expenses. However, unfortunately, if she is deported back to Nicaragua, her baby will not be able to obtain the needed medical treatment, because it is not available there. Since this lack of surgery and care is life threatening to the child, the deportation of Ms. Jiron will result in sending a U.S. citizen to death. 
Enrique Sequeira, now 21 years old, came to the United States from Nicaragua at the age of 13 in 1988. He has been an outstanding student in the United States and has received numerous academic awards. In addition to excelling academically, Mr. Sequeira is a member of the Junior ROTC and has been involved extensively in community work in Miami. He was granted suspension of deportation November 1996, but the INS appealed that decision based on the Immigration Reform Law of 1996. If the INS appeal is granted, Mr. Sequeira faces disrupting his bright future and returning to a country he has not lived in since he was a young teenager. 
Leonte Martinez is extensively involved in community service helping underprivileged youths of all nationalities in several church-sponsored programs. He owns his own home and earns $38,000 a year with medical benefits for his entire family. He has been in the United States since 1986. He is married to a lawful permanent resident, has three children, two of them U.S. citizens. His mother-in-law, a lawful permanent resident, resides with his family. Mr. Martinez was granted suspension of deportation in January 1997. According to the immigration judge, his was the best case she had ever heard. Apparently it was not strong enough, because INS is appealing in order to be able to deport him. 
Finally, Roberto Bautista came to the United States 10 years ago from El Salvador. His wife and two children have been in the United States for 12 years. They are a typical upstanding American family. He and his wife hold down two jobs, pay their taxes, have no criminal histories, have health insurance, and have never been on public assistance. Their daughter graduated from the University of Miami and is presently employed by a graphic artist for a newspaper. Their son is an honors student at Georgia Tech, studying engineering, and was awarded the Silver Knight award by the Miami Herald for his outstanding volunteer service. 
These individuals are entitled to have administrative process to make a judgment as to their ability to remain here in the United States or whether deportation would serve as a particular hardship. 
That is all we are attempting to do, under the Mack and Graham amendment. We ought to have enough respect for individuals and individual rights and liberties to treat fairly these families that were subject to extraordinary persecution in their own countries during a time of civil war, where many of these individuals were working and supportive of U.S. efforts to try to build a better country and democratic institutions. Because of the fear of terror, the death squads and others that were loose in the land, they came to the United States and have played by the rules. They were given certain assurances that, if they played by the rules, worked hard and supported their families, they would not be summarily dismissed, they would have a judgment that would be made to see whether they had participated in this country and made an important contribution to the life and well-being of this country. 
I have given you a few examples, and there are scores of other examples, where people are giving back to the United States something for all that has been given to them. 
I think this is a matter that should be favorably considered. 
I am very hopeful that we will have the opportunity to vote on this. I believe we have overwhelming bipartisan support. I think I see a colleague from Pennsylvania, who is a cosponsor of this measure as well. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 10 minutes. 
Mr. President, I oppose the voucher amendment to the District of Columbia appropriations bill. Students in the District of Columbia deserve good public schools, safe public schools, well-trained teachers and a decent education. Vouchers will undermine all of these essential goals by undermining the public schools, not helping them. 
Vouchers will simply subsidize private school tuition for 3 percent of the students in the public schools and leave the other 97 percent of the students even worse off. Public funds should be used for public school reforms that help all students, not to pay for a few public school students to attend private and religious schools. Our goal is to improve public schools, not encourage families to abandon them. 
We all want the children of the District of Columbia to get the best possible education. We should be doing more, much more, to support efforts to improve the local schools in the District. We should oppose any plan that would undermine these efforts. 
A year ago, as part of an overall effort to deal more effectively with the serious financial and other challenges facing the District of Columbia, Gen. Julius Becton was appointed to improve the D.C. schools. General Becton asked for $87 million to make the critical repairs necessary to ensure that all schools would be ready to open for the 1997-98 school year on time, yet only $50 million was appropriated by Congress to repair the schools. Requests for additional funding were initially denied and were only made available by Congress at the last minute. So Congress bears part of the responsibility for the continuing problems of the D.C. schools, including the festering problems that led to the embarrassing delayed opening of the schools this fall. 
This voucher amendment would further undermine General Becton's efforts just as he is making headway in repairing D.C. schools, increasing security and developing effective ways to improve the schools and help all students reach academic standards. 
In addition, the voucher system would impose yet another bureaucracy, another federally appointed board on the District of Columbia to use Federal funds to implement the voucher system. The nominations of six of the seven board members would be controlled by Republican leaders of Congress. Only one representative of the District of Columbia would serve on the corporation. 
Instead of supporting local efforts to revitalize the schools, the voucher proponents are attempting to make D.C. public schools a guinea pig for an ideological experiment in education that voters in the District of Columbia have soundly rejected and that voters across the country have soundly rejected, too. Our Republican colleagues have clearly been unable to generate any significant support for vouchers in their own States, and it is a travesty of responsible action for them to attempt to foist their discredited idea on the long-suffering people and long-suffering public schools of the District of Columbia. If vouchers are a bad idea for the public schools in 50 States, they are a bad idea for the public schools of the District of Columbia, too. 
Many of us in Congress favor D.C. home rule and many of us in Congress believe that the people of the District of Columbia should be entitled to have voting representation in the Senate and the House, like the people in every State. It is an embarrassment to our democracy that the most powerful democracy on Earth denies the 
most basic right of any democracy--the right to vote--to the citizens of the Nation's Capital. 
The District of Columbia is not a test tube for misguided Republican ideological experiments on education. Above all, the District of Columbia is not a slave plantation. Republicans in Congress should start treating the people of the District of Columbia with the respect that they deserve. 
General Becton, local leaders, and D.C. parents are working hard to improve all D.C. public schools for all children. Congress should give them its support, not undermine them. 
We have here, Mr. President, the examples of some of the activities that are taking place in the Walker Jones Elementary School in Northwest Washington working with the Laboratory for Student Success, using Community for Learning, a research-based reform model, and it is working. The concept is called whole school reform. With increased and more intensive teacher training, in proven methods and materials geared toward better student learning, student test scores have improved. After 6 months in the program, the school raised its ranking in the District on reading scores from 99th in 1996 to 36th in 1997. In math, the school climbed from 81st in the District to 18th. It is working. These kinds of investments are working in this particular school. 
The John Tyler Elementary School in Southeast Washington uses the Comer School Development Model Program to restructure school management, curriculum, and teacher training. Teachers focus on reading and math instruction as well as hands-on learning in science and math. All of the students in the Tyler School, of whom 95 percent come from low-income families, are benefiting from the reforms. Academic achievement is going up. It is improving. 
Spingarn High School in Northeast Washington has extended the day because they felt that school safety was a first priority. The school is a safe haven for students, and the academic standards are going up. 
The District of Columbia has created the so-called Saturday academies for students who read below grade level. The Saturday curriculum reinforces the weekly instruction and benefits from a reduced student-teacher ratio, and the results show that it is working. 
These are examples of what is taking place in the District of Columbia, working for all students. They should be encouraged. They should be expanded. They should be given the resources to be able to implement those programs. 
Mr. President, $7 million would provide afterschool programs for every school in the District of Columbia. That would benefit all students, not just a very small group. 
Scarce education funds should be targeted to public schools. They do not have the luxury of closing their doors to students who pose challenges, such as children with disabilities, limited English-proficient children, or homeless students. Vouchers will not help children who need the most help. 
Voucher proponents argue that vouchers increase choice for parents. But parental choice is a mirage. Private schools apply different rules than public schools. Public schools must accept all children. Private schools can decide whether to accept a child or not. The real choice goes to the schools, not the parents. The better the private school, the more parents and students are turned away. 
In fact, many private schools require children to take rigorous achievement tests, at the parents' expense, as a basic for admission to the private schools. Lengthy interviews and complex selection processes are often mandatory. Private schools impose many barriers to admission. Few parents can even get to the schoolhouse door to find out if it is open to their child. For the vast majority of families with children in public schools, the so-called school choice offered by the voucher scheme is a hollow choice. 
Public schools must take all children, and build a program to meet each of their needs. Private schools only take children who fit the guidelines of their existing programs. We should not use public tax dollars to support schools that choose some children, and reject others. 
There are also serious constitutional objections to the voucher scheme. The vast majority of private schools that charge tuition below $3,200 are religious schools. Providing vouchers to sectarian schools violates the establishment clause of the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution. In many States voucher schemes would violate the State constitution, too. Courts in Wisconsin, Ohio, and Vermont have all reached decisions this year upholding the ruling that the use of public funds to pay for vouchers for religious schools is unconstitutional. 
If voucher proponents genuinely wanted to help the children of the District of Columbia obtain a good education, they would use the $7 million in this amendment to support reform efforts to improve the public schools. Money is not the only answer to school reform, but it is a principal part of the answer. Public schools in States across the country are starved for funds, and so are the D.C. public schools. 
We saw an example just this morning. The Ballou Senior High School here in the District was forced to close due to a leaky roof caused by the weekend rainstorms. Students were sent to Douglass Junior High School, one of the buildings closed by the District. Again, the students of the D.C. schools suffered because of poor facilities. Seven million dollars would begin the critical repairs to the 80 buildings that did not get new roofs this year, to make sure that this will not happen to other schools. 
We know what works in school reform. Steps are available with proven records of success to improve teaching and instruction, reduce crowded classrooms, and bring schools into the world of modern technology--let alone repairing crumbling schools facilities and making classrooms, corridors, and playgrounds safe for children trying their best to learn in conditions that no private schools would tolerate. 
Too often, with good reason, children in too many public schools in too many communities across the country feel left out and left behind. Vouchers will only make that problem worse. Three percent of the students would be helped by enabling them to attend private schools, while 97 percent of the students are left even farther behind. 
Supporting a few children at the expense of all the others is a serious mistake. We don't have to abandon the public schools in order to help. We should make investments that help all children in the D.C. schools to obtain a safer and better education. I hope my colleagues will reject this amendment. 
Again, we should not impose on the District of Columbia what voters in other States don't want. In the last year, voters in Colorado, Washington, and California have rejected the vouchers. In the past 10 years, State legislatures in 16 States have voted this down. Even the Texas legislature rejected even the vouchers this year, and we should as well. 
I reserve the remainder of our time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Seven years ago, 53 percent of the D.C. teachers were not certified. Last year that number had dropped to 33 percent. In 1997, all new teachers are going to be certified and existing teachers who are here must be certified by January, 1998, or risk dismissal. Is that the kind of reform that you are talking about, a comprehensive solution, rather than helping just a few children? Programs that enhance the training and bring teachers up to speed so they have world class standards and world class certification, to be able to work with all children? Is that the kind of thing that the Senator from California is talking about?

Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield further? Under General Becton's new initiatives, students in grade 3 and 8 have to have the basic reading skills before advancing to a higher grade. This requirement reflects the commitment of the District of Columbia to ensure all children master basic reading skills. That has been the new program. 
Do I understand that if we had $7 million to try to implement those kinds of programs to work with kids, particularly those that may have more difficulty working through and enhancing their academic achievement, we would see all of the students in that class moving along together in enhancing their reading capabilities, which is key to all learning in the future? Those are the kind of investments that the Senator thinks would make sense for all the students, I imagine?

Mr. KENNEDY. It is a privilege to join Senator Mack and Senator Graham in offering this amendment on behalf of Central American refugees. The amendment we propose today closely parellels S. 1076 the Immigration Reform Transition Act of 1997 proposed by President Clinton, which we introduced on July 28. 
Without this legislation, thousands of Central American refugee families who fled death squads and persecution in their native lands and found safe haven in the United States would be forced to return. Republican and Democratic administrations alike promised them repeatedly that they will get their day in court to make their claims to remain in the United States. 
Last year's immigration law, however, turned its back on that commitment and treated these families unfairly. This legislation reinstates that promise and guarantees these families the day in court they deserve. 
Virtually all of these families fled to the United States in the 1980's from El Salvador, Nicaragua, or Guatemala. Many were targeted by death squads and faced persecution at the hands of rogue militias. They came to America to seek safety and freedom for themselves and their children. 
The Reagan administration, the Bush Administration, and the Clinton administration assured them that they could apply to remain permanently in the United States under our immigration laws. They were promised that if they have lived here for at least 7 years and are of good moral character, and if a return to Central America will be an unusual hardship, they would be allowed to remain. Last year's immigration law violated that commitment. 
President Clinton has promised to find a fair and reasonable solution for these families, and the administration will use its authority to help as many of them as possible. But Congress must do its part too, by enacting this corrective legislation. 
Some are opposing this legislation as an amnesty for illegal aliens. That charge is false. It is an insult to these hard-working refugees, and their families who have suffered so much pain and hardship and who relied in good faith on the solemn promise they were given. 
Virtually all of these families are already known to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. They are not illegal aliens working underground. These families have applied to come to the United States under INS programs, and they are here on a variety of temporary immigration categories. They have acted in accord with what our Government told them to do. 
Not all of these families will qualify to remain here under the terms of this amendment. They still must meet certain standards that existed in the law, before last year's immigration law was enacted and applied retroactively. The Immigration Service estimates that less than half of those who qualify to apply to remain in this country will be approved. 
These families are law-abiding, tax-paying members of communities in all parts of America. In many many cases, they have children who were born in this country and who are U.S. citizens by birth. They deserve to be treated fairly, and I urge the Senate to support the amendment.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, next week David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionist Party in Northern Ireland, will begin a visit to the United States where he will meet with many of us on both sides of the aisle in Congress who are deeply committed to helping achieve a lasting peace in Northern Ireland. There is perhaps no one better placed to make that happen than Mr. Trimble, who leads Northern Ireland's largest party. 
Mr. Trimble is to be commended for bringing his party into the current talks, which now include Sinn Fein as a result of the restoration of the IRA cease-fire in July. Those talks are ably chaired by our former Senate colleague, George Mitchell. 
Mr. Trimble and his party faced many difficulties in deciding to participate in talks which include Sinn Fein. There is a long history of distrust by both sides in Northern Ireland, and the fears and concerns of unionists cannot be dismissed. Mr. Trimble spent the month of August consulting with many people and concluded that his constituents want his party to participate in the talks as the best hope for achieving a peaceful settlement.

 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this opportunity to pay tribute to an outstanding leader in the American labor movement. All of us who know and admire George Murphy are proud of his lifetime of commitment to improving the lives of working communities across America, and are saddened by his retirement as general counsel of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union. 
In a very real sense, George has lived the American dream. He was born and raised in Washington, DC. His father, William, served as a police officer here. His mother, Rose, was a dedicated school teacher. George's parents instilled in him the commitment to excellence and service that have made him one of the finest and most respected labor attorneys in the country. 
Throughout his 31 years of service, he has demonstrated extraordinary dedication to the ideals and principles of the labor movement that have led to so many achievements for union members and for millions of other workers across the country whose lives are better today because of George Murphy. 
George's impressive leadership for the benefit of all working men and women and their families will be long remembered. I extend my warmest wishes and congratulations to George on his retirement. His outstanding service is an inspiration to us all.

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself such time as I may need. 
Mr. President, I oppose the voucher amendment to the District of Columbia appropriations bill. Although we all want to help the District's children get a good education, this is not the way to do it. Public funds should be used for public schools, not to pay for students to attend private and religious schools. 
The current debate involves the schools in the District of Columbia. The use of Federal funds for private schools is a national issue that Congress has addressed and rejected many times before, and so have many States. Now the voucher proponents are attempting to make the D.C. public schools a guinea pig for a scheme that voters in the District of Columbia have soundly rejected, and so have voters across the country. 
The recent voucher proposals in the States of Washington and Colorado and California lost by over 2 to 1 margins, and in 1981 voters defeated a voucher initiative by a ratio of 8 to 1 here in the District. The concept has never been brought up on the ballot again because it has so little support. So clearly Congress should not impose on the District of Columbia what the people of the District of Columbia and voters across the country reject. 
D.C. parents and ministers and local leaders have made it clear that they do not want vouchers. Last week, a group of ministers from the District of Columbia publicly announced their opposition to vouchers. Rev. Eart Trent, Jr., of the Florida Avenue Baptist Church, said, `We want nothing to do with vouchers. It is going to harm a majority of our schools.' Representative Eleanor Holmes Norton opposes vouchers for the District. 
The question is, who wants these vouchers? The Republicans in Congress cannot get to first base with this issue in their own States and want to impose it on the people of the District of Columbia. 
Vouchers would erode local control in the District of Columbia and undermine D.C. school reforms already underway. Last year, Congress created a control board and all but eliminated the locally elected school board. 
This bill would create another bureaucracy in the form of a federally appointed corporation to use Federal funds to run the voucher program. Six out of the seven corporation members would be nominated by the Federal Government, and those nominations are controlled by the Republican leaders of Congress. Only one representative of D.C. would serve on the corporation. 
I understand Senator Boxer did an excellent job earlier in the debate of going through the administrative process and machinery that would be set up and the weaknesses of that particular recommendation or inclusion in the amendment. 
Congress created the D.C. control board less than a year ago. The board appointed as chief executive officer of the schools Gen. Julius Becton, Jr., with Congress' endorsement. His mission is to improve the public schools. Now this bill would pull the rug out from under him. 
I noted, Mr. President, that in an earlier debate one of our colleagues who is supporting the amendment was talking about the $500 million that is coming from taxpayers all over the country. That money is coming from the taxpayers here in the District of Columbia. 
I haven't looked at the D.C. population recently, but generally it is larger than six or seven of our States. They pay in taxes, but they do not have representation in the House, with all respect to Eleanor Holmes Norton. They are not reflected in the Senate of the United States. They are not given the full representation that they should have even in the District. 
So General Becton, Mr. President, local leaders and D.C. parents are working hard to improve all D.C. public schools for all 
children. We should support them, not undermine them. The public funds should not go to private schools when D.C. public schools have such urgent needs. The opening of D.C. public schools for the 1997-1998 academic year was delayed because in 67 percent of the schools the roofs were crumbling. They were able to repair the most severe problems and open up the schools this week, but much more needs to be done. 
In addition to completing the roof repairs, 65 percent of them have faulty plumbing; 41 percent of the schools do not have enough power outlets and electric wiring to accommodate computers and other needed technology; and 66 percent of the schools have inadequate heating, ventilation and air conditioning. Funding these repairs should be our top priority, not conducting a foolish ideological experiment on school vouchers. 
Another serious problem with the private school voucher is the exclusionary policy of the private schools. Scarce Federal dollars should not go to schools that can exclude children. There is no requirement in the bill that schools receiving vouchers accept students with limited English proficiency, students with disabilities, homeless students or students with disciplinary problems. 
Scarce funds should be targeted to public schools which do not have the luxury of closing their doors to students who pose such challenges. As District of Columbia parent Alieze Stallworth says, `A lot of people think the poor kids will be able to go to the best private schools. They are fooling themselves.' 
The voucher proponents argue that vouchers increase the choice for parents. But parental choice is a mirage. Private schools apply different rules than public schools, and unlike the public schools, which must accept all children, the private schools decide whether to accept a child or not. The real choice goes to the schools, not the parents. The better the private school, the more parents and students are turned away. In Cleveland, nearly half of the public school students who received the vouchers could not find a private school that would accept them. 
Vouchers will not help most children who need help. This voucher scheme will send 2,000 children to private and parochial schools, but of the 78,000 children who attend D.C. public schools, 50,000 of the children, or 65 percent, come from low-income families. Thus, this proposal would provide vouchers for 3 percent of D.C.'s children and do nothing for the other 97 percent. 
Again, a point that has been well made by my friend and colleague from California, Senator Boxer. 
This is no way to spend Federal dollars. We should invest in strategies that help all children, not just a few. 
Another serious objection to this voucher scheme is its unconstitutionality. A vast majority of private schools that charge tuition below $3,200 are religious schools. Providing vouchers to religious schools is unconstitutional. It violates the establishment clause of the first amendment of the U.S. Constitution by providing a Federal subsidy for sectarian schools. In many States, the voucher schemes would violate the State constitution, too. 
In January 1997, a Wisconsin trial court held that the expansion of the Milwaukee voucher program to include religious schools was unconstitutional and violated the Wisconsin constitution. The court stated, `We do not object to the existence of parochial schools or that they attempt to spread their beliefs through the schools. They just cannot do it with State dollars.' 
On August 22, the Wisconsin State Court of Appeals affirmed by a 2 to 1 vote that the expansion of the State voucher program to include religious schools was unconstitutional under the Wisconsin constitution. 
On May 1, 1997, the Ohio Tenth Appellate Court unanimously reversed the trial court's decision to allow public money to be paid to religious schools. The appellate court held that the voucher program violated the separation of church and state under both the United States and Ohio Constitutions. And the court ruled 
that the voucher program `steers aid to sectarian schools, resulting in what amounts to a direct Government subsidy.' 
On June 27, 1997, a Vermont State superior court held that the use of vouchers to pay tuition at private religious schools violates both the U.S. and Vermont constitutions. The courts are clear on the unconstitutionality of vouchers for religious schools, and Congress should abide by their rules, too. 
These are all judgments that have been made within the last year under State constitutions and the Federal Constitution in terms of how this particular proposal would be unconstitutional. 
Instead of subsidizing private schools, we need to support ways to improve and reform the public schools. That is the basic point, Mr. President. Instead of subsidizing private schools, we need to support ways to improve and reform the public schools--not in a few schools but in all schools, not for a few students but for all students. That is the challenge. 
Supporting a few children at the expense of the many divides communities. The Federal Government should help rebuild communities, not undermine them. We should make investments that help all children in all the neighborhood schools to get a good, safe education. I think that is the heart of the argument against this amendment. 
So far, Mr. President, in this debate, we have been focusing on this particular chart. Hopefully, we as a body could agree that we do not want to abandon our public schools; we do not want to undermine the communities. As we mentioned, this particular proposal only funds a few at the expense of many--about 3 percent of the total students. It gives scarce Federal dollars to schools that can exclude children. Unlike the public school system, private schools can exclude children. The choice is not made by the parents or the children; it is made by the schools. And we have given examples of how that is being done. We ignore the voter will. When vouchers were put to a vote here in the District of Columbia, they were rejected 8 to 1. The issue has not come up on the ballot again since then. All the public commentary by religious and other elected officials reflects that same position even today. And vouchers raise the constitutional problems which have been addressed, Mr. President, not just academically but in several States which have tried to adopt similar kinds of programs. 
Many of us feel that the use of vouchers to subsidize parents who send their children to private schools is a serious mistake because it is a statement that encourages parents to abandon the public schools, not to work to improve them. 
Vouchers are a bad idea for school reform, but they are far from the only idea, and what I want to do, Mr. President, is review briefly a number of the ideas that have been working here in the District of Columbia to improve the academic achievement of many students. These ideas serve as an alternative to the unwise proposal to provide vouchers. 
There are many worthwhile ideas for reform that deserve broad support in Congress. I have listened to the debate, and people are just throwing up their hands and saying, `We have problems in these schools. Let's just try vouchers,' rather than being serious and looking at what is being attempted in many of these schools and what results they are achieving, evaluating where this additional money could go to benefit the most children. That is the test, I would think, that this voucher amendment fails. 
So we know what works, Mr. President, in school reform. We know what teachers need to do to do their jobs well. We need higher standards, better trained teachers, up-to-date classrooms, safe facilities. These are commonsense, doable solutions, and we ought to be doing much more to implement them. 
For example, Milwaukee taxpayers have spent $7 million on the voucher program. The program shows no academic gains for the 1,600 students involved. But for that same amount they could have put what they call a Success For All Program in place, which has a solid track record of helping poor children learn more. And it would have benefited every elementary school in that city. 
Instead of spending $7 million in the District of Columbia on a private school subsidy that has no proven track record of improving academic achievement and could help at most 2,000 children, we should investigate the strategies that work for all children. The conclusion is obvious. We should choose the 100-percent solution, not the 3-percent solution. 
Some D.C. schools have already restructured their facilities, improved teacher training, extended the school day, and enhanced family-centered learning. And they are getting results. We should make sure that every school and community has the resources to put into practice what works, so that no child is left out or left behind. 
There are serious problems in the Nation's public schools--especially in urban areas. We can do much more to turn troubled schools around, and undertake a wide range of proven reforms to create and sustain safe and high-performing schools. There are no panaceas to improve schools and improve student learning. There is no blank check. That is why we need to use our limited resources wisely, to get the most benefit for our tax dollars. 
Improving student performance starts with a focus on the basics--safety, discipline, high standards, and parent involvement. Sustained improvement must be based on what works, and what is supported by parents, educators, and the larger community. Research shows that student achievement can best be improved by supporting a comprehensive set of district-level and school-level reforms. General Becton's plan supports these reforms, and we should too. 
I refer up here to restructuring the whole school. Let me just develop that. 
Greater school autonomy, when coupled with performance accountability, can contribute to conditions that make better learning possible. School leaders and teachers can exercise greater control over their school and have a greater sense of personal responsibility for its success. If teachers are to act as professionals and not as robots, they need to be given responsibility for making professional decisions regarding classroom practice and school policy. Holding students to higher standards requires that adults accept higher responsibility for improving student performance. 
The Walker Jones Elementary School in northwest Washington is working with the Laboratory for Student Success using Community for Learning, a research-based reform model--and it's working. The concept is called whole school reform. With increased and more intensive teacher training in proven methods and materials geared toward better student learning, student test scores have improved. After 6 months in the program, the school raised its ranking in the District on reading scores from 99th in 1996, to 36th in 1997. In math, the school climbed from 81st in the District to 18th--dramatic, significant academic achievement and performance. 
Another result of this reform will be increased accountability throughout the D.C. school system, with better performance measures and clear incentives and consequences for administrators, teachers, and students. Evaluations of teachers and principals will be tied to achievement, and schools that fail to demonstrate improvement will be put on probation. 
The principles of Success for All have now been introduced into 475 schools in 31 States. Evaluations show that students in this program tend to perform about 3 months ahead of control students by the end of first grade and by more than a year ahead by the end of fifth grade. 
What we are finding out in 475 schools across the country is that the impact that this approach is having in improving academic performance is not just on one or two children in a class, but on all the children. This is the kind of thing we should give attention to and give support to. 
A second basic principle of school reform involves organizing schools around a clearer focus on educational excellence for all students, and an academic orientation that challenges all students to master basic and advanced skills in reading, math, and other core subjects. 
The voucher program flunks this test. Five years of evaluations by Prof. John F. Witte of the University of Wisconsin-Madison show no achievement difference between voucher students and comparable Milwaukee public school students. 
By contrast, in the D.C. public schools, under a new promotion policy beginning this school year, students in grades three and eight must have at least basic reading skills before advancing to a higher grade. This requirement reflects a new commitment by the District to ensure that all children master their basic studies. The District has mandated a 90 minute literacy period for direct instruction each day and suggested additional silent reading times each day. That is giving emphasis, giving priority in local schools to the area that is basic to learning any other possible subject matter, and that is reading. With all respect to computer--reading. 
In addition to mastering basic skills, children need to be challenged with a rigorous curriculum. One of the most effective choices that parents and students can make is to choose to take more challenging academic courses. 
It works. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that public school reform efforts that include high standards and rigorous courses can improve achievement for the majority of students in the public schools. States and local communities that have set more challenging standards are seeing substantial gains in student achievement. 
New York City's College preparatory initiative, mandating more rigorous science and mathematics courses, has resulted in the best-prepared class to enter the City University of New York since 1970. Elementary schools in the city are showing a 4-year rise in test scores. The number of Hispanic and black students who pass the science test more than doubled between 1993 and 1994. There are the result. The whole class is moving up. The whole entry class for the City College of New York is moving up in academic achievement, based on this particular New York College preparatory initiative. 
A great deal of attention has been paid this fall to the problem of roof repairs in the D.C. public schools. Far less attention has been paid to the fact that beginning this fall all public schools in the District will have new content and higher performance standards to define what every child in expected to learn and do. D.C. public schools are committed to helping all children meet these standards. 
The second point is foster world-class instruction. In addition, in order for students' performance to improve, teachers must be able to teach to higher standards. They must know the content of the curriculum and the best teaching methods for helping students to learn in genuinely challenging courses. 
Teachers today, however, are not getting the training they need. One of the best programs we have, the Eisenhower Math-Science Training Program--a hands-on program to upgrade the skills of teachers in our high schools--has just been block granted under the Gorton amendment, just been wiped off the books. We don't know what they are going to do with that money when it is distributed all over the country, but we know what a difference that funding makes to every one of those math and science teachers in every one of those communities that have benefited from this valuable teacher training program. 
Math and science students in inner-city schools have only a 50-percent chance of being taught by a teacher qualified to teach these subjects. 
Seven years ago, 53 percent of D.C. teachers were not certified. By last year, the number had dropped to 33 percent. In 1997, all new teachers are certified, and existing teachers must be certified by January 1998 or risk dismissal. 
Extending the school day can also be effective. In addition to helping in education, it can also help to create safe havens for students in unsafe neighborhoods. 
A recent report by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention shows that while violent youth crime is rising rapidly, children are safer in schools than anywhere else. To create a safer, more disciplined, and drug-free environment for children, we need to place more emphasis on hours spent outside school. After school programs that keep children off the street are a powerful and constructive answer to the serious problems of delinquency that plague so many communities. I would say even with regard to unwanted teenage pregnancies, the Centers for Disease Control's study shows that about 65 or 70 percent of these incidents take place in the after-school hours. 
This step can work effectively even in individual schools. At the Spingarn School in northeast Washington, the principal made student safety the first priority. Mr. President, 740 students attend the after-school day program and 500 students attend the night program. The school was a safe haven for students. 
Drug and violence prevention programs also keep students focused on learning. Students who break school rules are not dumped on the street where they are likely to become perpetrators or victims of violence. Instead, they are placed in separate programs in the school where their education is not interrupted. 
We also know that the more time children spend learning, the more they will learn. Programs that extend the school day or the school week can enhance academic achievement. The District of Columbia has created so-called Saturday academies for students who read below grade level. The Saturday curriculum reinforces the weekday instruction, and benefits from a reduced student-teacher ratio. 
I can remember when those Saturday programs were first suggested and the uniform impression was: Why bother with it? People won't show up. Parents won't bother. They would rather take the children, if they are not working, to do something else. 
That is just hogwash. When those classrooms opened, on Saturday especially, parents made sure their children took advantage of it. And that has been the case overwhelmingly. 
In the programs that developed with the Saturday curriculum, we have seen a much better student-teacher ratio and we have seen extremely important progress made. 
Schools in Massachusetts are benefiting from these ideas. The Timilty Middle School in Roxbury, MA was long known for its low test scores and high rates for suspending students. Project Promise was established, including an extended school day program to increase the amount of time that students spend in class. School attendance rose, math and reading skills improved, and suspension rates dropped significantly. As a result, the Timilty Middle School was recently cited as an exemplary school by the U.S. Department of Education. It was a dramatic change in the turning around of that school. 
Finally, school reform must include greater family involvement. Thirty years of research shows that family involvement in children's learning is a critical link in achieving a high quality education and safe, disciplined learning for every student. Schools can reach out to parents and community members. Together they can develop a shared commitment to excellence for all students, and work in partnership to reach their goals. Family-centered services can be provided that include literacy training for parents, and teaching parents how to help their children with their homework. When teachers and parents work closely together, children can learn more effectively. 
The Nalle School in the District of Columbia and the Freddie Mack Foundation are working together to create the District's first full service community school to address the wide range of family needs. Working with service organizations, parents and educators, and community leaders, the school is becoming a major hub of community activity, bringing the parents in, finding out what needs the parents have, and providing them with the instruments to help and assist the children move to higher academic achievement and accomplishment. And it is working. It is working if schools and communities have the resources. 
Can we have a chance to go through each of these different proposals at greater length at another time? 
I know others want to speak to this, and we have limited time this afternoon, but we will have a chance to go through this in greater detail, I am sure, at some time, Mr. President. 
If schools and communities have the resources to choose effective ways, such as these, to ensure all children have an opportunity to reach higher academic standards, schools will be able to offer real alternatives to students and parents while maintaining the kind of accountability that is fundamental to ensure a good education. 
Congress can be part of these efforts, too. Instead of debating divisive ideological schemes like vouchers, that undermine the public schools and ignore 97 percent of the children, we can invest in what works and make school reform work for 100 percent of the children in the District of Columbia and in every community. 
Good education begins with decent places to learn. Yet, too many of our public schools across the Nation are falling apart, and that is wrong. 
I have a chart that reflects exactly what the situation is for the District of Columbia. D.C. schools have more hazardous conditions than the national average. This chart shows that District of Columbia schools' exterior walls and windows fail to meet the minimum standards in terms of safety and quality. 
Roof conditions are also much worse than the national average, although this number has improved somewhat because of the action that has taken place in the past 2 to 3 weeks. 
Heating and ventilation systems in D.C. schools have twice the problems that we have for the national average. 
Plumbing, twice the problems. 
Electric lighting, twice the problems that they have. 
Life-safety codes, two and a half, three times the problems that they have. 
Power for technology, again, well behind the curve, Mr. President. 
So these problems are severe in the District schools. Sixty-seven percent of the public schools have crumbling roofs--although as I mentioned, there has been some change in the recent weeks--but only 27 percent of the schools across the country suffer from the problem. 
I daresay, if you want to look at the national standards, they are not all that great. In Boston, there are a number of schools in the wintertime, anywhere from 15 to 18 schools, that do not open because of various heating problems every day. 
The situation in Boston has improved somewhat under Mayor Menino and Tom Payzant. But go to the older towns of New Bedford, Fall River, Lowell, Lawrence, Holyoke, Springfield, North Adams, and many of the other smaller communities also on the north shore, and you find problems similar to those of the D.C. schools. 
So the national average is not a very positive test. Senator Moseley-Braun has been the leader in the U.S. Senate in recognizing that unless facilities are suitable for learning purposes, we disadvantage children to such an extraordinary degree. Not just because there are no textbooks available or because it is colder in the wintertime, but the point that she has made, and I think so powerfully and effectively, is what it does to a child who goes into a classroom that is in such a state of deterioration. We say education is important. People in the communities say education is important. The children every single day go into these dilapidated conditions where they are not able to get the school books they need, where the roofs are leaking, windows won't close, where they don't have adequate heating, where they don't have the electrical outlets for computers. Mr. President, what kind of message is it sending to those children when we are out there putting increasing demands on those children? That is something for which I think we as a society pay a very heavy price. But that is another issue for another time. 
The point is, we tried to mention the places the $7 million could be used that would enhance the academic achievement and accomplishments of a great number of the students. 
The school facilities, as I mentioned, across the country are in poor condition. It is a national problem. Water damage from an old boiler has caused so much wall deterioration in one D.C. junior high school that the entire wing has been condemned. Leaking roofs have been causing ceilings to crumble on teachers' and students' desks. Fire doors are warped shut. Some schools are sweltering in hot weather because they lack air-conditioning. Others are so poorly insulated that students must wear coats indoors in the winter. 
According to D.C. public schools, $87 million was needed to make the critical repairs necessary to ensure all schools would be ready to open for the 1997-98 period. Yet, only $50 million was appropriated to repair the schools. Requests for additional funding were initially denied by Congress and only made available at the last minute. So Congress deserves part of the responsibility for the crisis that was caused by the recent 3-week delay in the opening of the schools. 
Isn't that wonderful? Here we are trying to tell the District of Columbia what they ought to do with scarce resources, and we were late in putting the money up so they could open in the first place, disadvantaging all of those children. Mr. President, we do not have a good enough record to dictate to the District of Columbia on education or on most other items. 
D.C. schools need much more repair. Any funding that we invest should be spent on improving the public schools for students. We should not be diverting the Federal dollars to pay subsidies for the private schools when public schools have such pressing, urgent needs. It is preposterous to pretend that we can prepare for the 21st century in dilapidated 19th century classrooms. 
Improving educational opportunities for all children deserves the highest priority at every level of Government and in every community across the Nation. Educating our youth is one of our Nation's most important responsibilities. If we fail to make sound investments in education, few other investments will make much difference for our country and its role in the world in the years ahead. 
In meeting the educational needs of children, we must allocate scarce resources wisely. We know what works. We must make sure that every child has access to it. We should not give public funds to schools that can exclude children. We should invest in public schools so that all children have the opportunity for a good education. We should rebuild communities, not divide them. Communities across the country are working hard to improve their public schools, and Congress should help them to do more as well, not make their current troubles worse. We should create improved conditions in all schools for all children, and we should start with safe buildings, decent roofs, good plumbing, and classrooms equipped for the 21st century of learning. 
Mr. President, what could we do with the $7 million? We can improve the infrastructure with that $7 million. It could buy 368 new boilers for D.C. schools. There are 157 schools, and at least with regard to trying to make sure that they have hot water and heating systems, we could do much for the D.C. schools. 
We could rewire 65 schools that don't have the capacity to accommodate computers and multimedia equipment. We have in the budget about $300 million a year for new technology, technology grants to try to help assist local communities with new computers. Why don't we go ahead and wire some of the schools so at least they will be able to participate in these new kinds of technologies? Why don't we train the teachers to be able to use those technologies in a way that can integrate computers into the curriculum and give these children an opportunity so that they are going to be able to compete in the future? We could rewire 65 schools. 
We could upgrade the plumbing in 102 schools with substandard facilities. We see the problem here, the challenge. We have double the problems in just basic fundamental plumbing in the 
schools. We could upgrade the plumbing in over 100 of those schools so that we can make some difference, again in terms of infrastructure. That $7 million can do a lot for infrastructure. 
What could $7 million do to support other programs that are demonstrating enhanced academic achievement? The few that I mentioned--and at another opportunity, I will go into more detail on some others--$1 million would buy 66,000 new hard-cover books for the D.C. school libraries. That is very important. If you look at what is available in those D.C. libraries and compare them to libraries in schools all over the country, you will find them dramatically shortchanged. We have a real opportunity to make a difference in the libraries of schools all over the District, and we could have an important impact in making sure that each student is going to have the textbooks which they require in the classroom. They don't have those today. 
Here we are talking about spending $7 million to give vouchers to 2,000 students when the other students who are left back in the classroom don't even have the textbooks to be able to follow what is going on in the classroom. Maybe we will hear other testimony, I am sure we will, about the miracles of vouchers in improving academic achievement for students, but I haven't heard any convincing arguments made in the course of this debate. To the contrary; we can take additional time and demonstrate where the various reviews have failed. 
Mr. President, $1 million would fully fund after-school programs in 25 schools; $7 million would fund after-school programs in every one of the District of Columbia schools and benefit every child--every child--not just 3 percent; every child. 
In any fair evaluation about what is happening in these after-school programs, we must note what a difference these programs have meant, when we tie them in to academic help and assistance, in advancing students' academic achievements and accomplishments and in improving interest in school and attendance rates. The programs are reducing absenteeism and keeping children safe and secure and beginning to challenge and open up new opportunities of learning for children. You would be able to do this with the $7 million for every school in the District of Columbia. But, no, we are going to take 3 percent of those children and give them a voucher with which they may or may not be able to get into some school, not which their parents are going to be able to get them into, or not that the child is going to be able to get into, but the school is going to make that judgment and decision. 
Mr. President, $3.5 million would link 58 more schools to research, improving designs and improving day-to-day instructions. Those are the other kinds of programs that I referred to earlier in my comments. 
I certainly hope that this amendment will not be accepted. We too often around here look for easy answers to tough, complicated problems. Recently, if we find out we have a problem, more often than not we propose a constitutional amendment to deal with it. We have more constitutional amendments pending in the Judiciary Committee in this Congress than in the history of the country. We have gotten to where we think if we just pass a constitutional amendment, all of these problems are going to be resolved. 
We are not going to be able to deal with all of the problems that all of us understand are out there in the public school system on the cheap. It is going to be tough, difficult work. Money in and of itself is not the only answer. 
In many instances, you can probably get a much better and higher grade education with the amount of resources that are being expended. We understand that. We know that. But, nonetheless, what we are talking about here with this particular amendment is a reflection of our priorities--of our priorities. 
How are we going to spend that $7 million? Are we going to prioritize 3 percent of those children with a program that I believe is unconstitutional? And perhaps those that defend it are going to be able to make a case to respond to what is happening up in Wisconsin and what has happened in Vermont and other States that have struck down vouchers over the last year--maybe they will be able to sustain it. Perhaps they will be able to make the case with those 3 percent of children going to these private schools, that they are demonstrating what a breakthrough kind of academic brilliance that they are able to achieve and accomplish, and we are going to find the whole country is going to be shaken by this experience and we are going to do something dramatic about it. 
The fact is, Mr. President, those that have demonstrated over the course of their lives--some with more success than others--know that this is hard, tough work, that it is a combination of elements. 
Children are not going to learn if there is disruption in those classrooms, if the classrooms are not safe. Children are not going to learn if they go to school hungry during the course of the day. Children are not going to learn if they do not have the textbooks. Children are not going to learn if they have an inadequately trained teacher. Children are not going to learn if they know that their walls are crumbling down and they do not have light. 
Just like the children are not going to learn if they have hearing problems or if they have vision problems or if they have some asthmatic problems--they are sick. 
One of the benefits that we have taken care of, hopefully, in the recent action here, is to try and make sure that children are going to get the preventative health care so that when they go in there at least they are going to be healthy children when they go to those classrooms. 
We know some of the things that inhibit children from learning. We do not know all the things that enhance their academic achievement, but we know some. And we know some of the ones that have a proven record, demonstrable record, with solid results. 
The question that the Senate is going to have to ask is, are we going to try this kind of a program here for $7 million when we can invest that $7 million in some of the programs here in the District, replicating the ones here in the districts that the parents want, that the teachers know have been successful, that have been carefully evaluated, that will benefit the greatest number of children? Or are we going to reach down from Olympus and say, `OK, we here in the Senate are deciding for you, even though you don't want it. We're going to experiment here. We can't pass this kind of legislation back in our own States where it's been defeated at times that it has gone before the electorate, but we're going to try it on you here. We have $7 million. And in spite of the fact that your religious leaders, your business leaders, your elected leaders do not want that, and want it invested in these other programs, that's too bad. That's too bad on this. We're just going to say, `You're going to have to have it because we want to experiment with it.' We want to try and find some silver bullet to solve this problem'? 
I hope, Mr. President, that this amendment is not accepted. 
Mr. President, how much time is left?

Mr. KENNEDY. Touche. 
I mention to my friend from Idaho before he leaves, we acknowledge the previous failure that he had outlined here very eloquently this afternoon when we established the control board. The D.C. school chief executive officer, General Becton, has had 10 months to enact changes. In that short time, they have consolidated and closed 12 school buildings, hired only certified teachers, established annual testing for all students, and set standards for teachers and principals. 
They have only been in effect for 10 months and here we already are changing and interfering with their priority. I think for the reasons that the Senator has pointed out--there has been this dramatic change in terms of the leadership, those that are trying to provide new leadership, and here we are in the Congress trying to second-guess.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I also join in expressing great appreciation to the Senator from Maryland in terms of the FDA reform. 
She speaks very eloquently, passionately, and emotionally about the family's personal experience with the breakthroughs of modern medicine and what it can mean to those afflicted by the scourge of so many of these diseases. 
I must say I join with Senator Jeffords in saying that no one on the committee has been as tireless in pursuit of FDA reform as the Senator from Maryland. As a tireless advocate for FDA, she has 
brought great knowledge and understanding to achieve the goals that she has outlined here and I think all of us pay tribute to her. 
I want to thank her, as well, for commenting positively on the work of the people at the agency. There are many individuals at FDA who could, at the drop of a hat, go to the private sector and other areas and be better off financially. But who, because of their commitment to the public, are trying to do a job they believe in and are willing to serve the public.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are moving on in the consideration of FDA reform. I would like to review where we are, where we have come from, and where I believe we ought to go on this important issue that is intimately tied to the public health and safety of the American people. 
I would just like to remind our colleagues and others about the importance of this agency. We will be debating about section 404 of the FDA legislation that is before us. It might sound like a small, narrow provision in a complicated piece of legislation, but its implications are profound in terms of potential impacts on the health and safety of millions of American people. 
Senator Reed, myself, and others have attempted to make the case that we are unnecessarily risking the health of the American people. We are doing this because we are effectively permitting false and misleading information to be placed on the labels of medical devices that are submitted to the FDA for review. We are doing this and at the same time, tying the hands of the FDA to look behind those labels and into the real purpose of the medical device. We are creating a loophole that will allow companies to submit their products under a protocol they know will allow for quick approval, but whose clear intention is to market the device for uses that are different from those they listed when they went through the approval process. 
Over the last few days, we have reviewed the most prominent example of this issue when we talked about the biopsy needle of U.S. Surgical Co. We discussed how they were able to get approval for the device by telling FDA that it was substantially equivalent to a device they already had on the market. But, in reality, the biopsy needle that was on the market excised an amount of tissue that was less than the size of the lead in a pencil, and the new device they submitted to FDA removes a piece of tumor that is 50 times larger than would be removed with the existing needle biopsy device. 
It is quite clear from the evidence that we are able to advance on the floor of the Senate, both the correspondence we received from doctors about marketing practices and a promotional videotape, that this device was being promoted for an entirely different purpose than the one U.S. Surgical listed on the label it submitted to FDA. Due to this maneuvering, we did not have the proper kind of safety information available to the principal agency of Government that is charged with protecting the safety and health of the American people. 
I cannot understand why we, by way of this legislation, are denying that Federal agency the opportunity to adequately protect the American people. And it isn't just me, 35 other Members of the Senate, more than a third of the Senate, indicated a similar position with their votes yesterday. Virtually all of the consumer groups are with us as well. 
I have illustrated on this chart some of the organizations that are working to protect patients, that listen to patients, and that understand the need of patients, and that stand with us on this issue. They are virtually unanimous in their concern about this particular provision. 
I have in my hand articles about the FDA which have been published over the period of the last 2 days. This is an agency that is on the cutting edge of many health-related issues. It is charged with many different responsibilities that have enormous impacts on the lives and well-being of American people. 
Here we have on September 22 a major article: `Doctors want approval to inject themselves with live virus'--HIV. This will be a decision the group will seek approval. From whom? From the FDA. 
Here is another--`FDA sets rules on supplemental labels.' The FDA published final rules yesterday aimed at making * * * manufacturers put more information on labels. 
Why are they doing that? To protect the American public. They have responsibilities for that. 
FDA acts to get more women in drug studies. That is very appropriate and very important to do. 
FDA moved [yesterday] to force drug companies to stop excluding young women from studies of promising new medicines out of fear they will get pregnant, curbing the research. 
And, again: 
FDA told the drug companies to include women in all stages of drug tests. 
Then it goes on about the importance of having women represented in drug trials so we can understand how they will affect women. That can't be learned from studying the effects on men because of the metabolic and other differences between men and women. 
Here is another example of FDA looking out after public health issues, and the impact of pharmaceuticals on our population. 
On September 23 here is the long story in the New York Times.  
Thirty-seven years later, a second chance for thalidomide. Officials at the agency announced today they intend to approve thalidomide for use in leprosy patients, as long as the New Jersey . . . company seeking market approval adheres to conditions, including elaborate restrictions intended to keep the drugs away from women who might be pregnant. 
Here is the FDA looking after what? Looking after a possible cure for leprosy and making sure that women who are expecting are protected from thalidomide. 
What is the role of the agency? Looking after the women and children--looking at trying to find some cure for leprosy. 
What is another role of the FDA? Trying to make sure that all members of our population are included in the review of various pharmaceuticals. 
Here is a story on E. coli bacteria. We remember the stories across the country a little over a year ago and the dangers that were posed in terms of the health of the American people. This has 
no direct connection with the issue surrounding FDA reform except that it, too, comes against a background of years of determination, --the `meat industry and anti-regulatory forces to block long overdue improvements in the way the Government monitors the meat safety.' 
Here is an example of an editorial advising us to be cautious in our rush to regulatory reform. Let's not override safety. 
That is what this editorial is about--the same message we are delivering today--in our rush to reach these thoughtful and important reforms, let's not override safety. 
This editorial involved a different issue--E. coli and meat products. It may be E. coli today, but it may be an unsafe medical device tomorrow. 
Again, on the 23d, FDA. The approval of thalidomide, lawsuits filed against the fen/phen, and many other articles. The FDA published a rule on the 23d--from the Washington Post: 
Final rules aimed at making supplemental manufacturers put more information on the labels. The rules restrict the use of the term `high potency,' requiring products such as vitamins, minerals, herbs, and amino acids to be labeled as dietary supplements and labeled also to provide information about serving size. 
What is the agency doing in each of these cases that made the newspapers over the past few days? Protecting the American public. In each and every example that we have cited FDA is trying to protect the American public on a wide variety of issues. 
We are talking today about doing the same thing with regard to medical devices, protecting the public from false and misleading labels. That is the issue. It is not the only issue, but the Senator from Massachusetts, the Senator from Rhode Island, for the patient advocacy and consumer groups, it's the primary issue. There hasn't been a single patient advocacy group that has been advanced by those that are opposed to our position here during the course of this debate. Not one. Why? Because they cannot find any. Why? Because this provision is a direct threat to the health and safety of the American consumers. And virtually every group that has studied it, that has reviewed it, understands that. 
That is where we are. We want to let the American people know the importance of the FDA. Let them know how it is out there trying to provide protection for the American people. That is what we believe should be the case on the provisions that we have been discussing here, with section 404. 
Because of the Senate vote yesterday tabling the Reed amendment, the FDA reform bill still includes the provision that seriously threatens the public health--the provision that must be removed before this legislation becomes law. This provision encourages device manufacturers to lie to the FDA and forces FDA to approve medical devices that have not been adequately tested to assure that they are safe and effective. Weeks ago, the Secretary of HHS identified this provision as one that would lead her to recommend a veto if it were not removed. Despite what some of my colleagues say, this is not a new issue. The Secretary identified it last June, identified it again in July, and identified it again in September as one of the administration's principal concerns. 
It is virtually the only technological issue that remains to be resolved on this bill. Every major public health and consumer organization that has taken a position on this provision strongly opposes it. 
While the Reed amendment was defeated yesterday, I anticipate the bill itself will be adopted by the Senate today. This is not the end of the story. There are many procedural steps that must be taken before the bill becomes law, including action by the House, reconciliation of the bills passed by the House and Senate, and the signature of the President. There will be many more opportunities for debate before this bill can even go to conference. I believe that in the end the public interest will prevail. 
I intend to discuss this provision during the course of 
today's debate on the bill. I would like to begin by reviewing the reasons we embarked on an FDA reform bill in the first place and how much we have been able to improve the original bill. 
As I mentioned earlier, there are few more important agencies of the Federal Government than the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA is responsible for assuring that the Nation's food supply is pure and healthy. The FDA provides a guarantee that the drugs and devices we rely on to cure or treat diseases are safe and effective. It wasn't always that way. Medical device legislation was adopted in the mid-1970's. 
If it does its job well, the FDA can speed medical miracles from the lab bench to the patient's bedside. And if the agency does its job poorly, it can expose millions of Americans to unsafe or ineffective medical products and jeopardize the safety of our food. 
The record of the FDA in moving these various medical devices through the process and moving them from the manufacturer onto the market is improving. We have seen significant and dramatic improvement over the period of the last 3 years. In the premarket notification process known as 510(k), which about 95 percent of all the medical devices come through, the median review times have dropped from 199 days to 93 to 85 days, meeting the standard of 95 percent of all of those submitted. That is extraordinary progress. And for the more complicated, newer devices, the breakthrough kinds of devices, which account for only 5 percent of submissions, review times have been reduced to about 40 percent of the time between 1993 and 1996. 
This is the record. That is why there is within the medical device industry, general support for the steps taken by the agency. 
Here is the Medical Device and Diagnostic Industry magazine of this year. 
With improvements in FDA product review performance, despite a more challenging domestic market, device companies are more optimistic than ever. Company executives report a substantial improvement in FDA performance, particularly in 510(k) product approval times. 
This is the Medical Device and Diagnostic Industry magazine commenting on the performance of the FDA in terms of its approval ratings. 
This year's survey of medical device manufacturers marks the highest business climate ratings ever. 
Here we have the industry magazine talking about how effective the FDA is in moving these devices through the process expeditiously. And now, even with this information, we are undermining the ability of that agency to provide adequate protections for public health and safety.

Mr. KENNEDY. If the agency was not doing a good job, if we were seeing these bureaucratic delays denying patients products, at least there would be an arguable position. But what we are talking about here is the industry's own assessment about the effectiveness of the agency. They are pointing out how hopeful and optimistic they are about the recent performance of the agency in quickly approving devices. 
Not only have they made progress in moving them expeditiously, but now a number of the medical manufacturers want to diminish the existing power of the FDA to assure proper safety. The American people must ask why. We do not have the kind of problems that we had years ago with the Dalkon shield and the Shiley heart valve. We do not have the kinds of problems that we had with earlier medical device tragedies. What we have now is an excellent record of safety and effectiveness with devices, and it is against that background we find some in the medical device industry want to make it even more profitable for themselves, and to do so at the risk of the public. 
Continuing along with the survey:  
The overall results of the survey indicate widespread satisfaction with the medical device business climate. A substantial majority of the survey respondents characterized business conditions for the device industry as good to excellent. One important cause of this year's improved outlook is perceived improvement in relationships with the FDA. The declining complaints about the agency mirror the increase in positive business outlooks. Much of this improvement is no doubt due to the dramatic decrease in the last 2 years of 510(k) product approval times which the FDA has made a lead focus of its internal reforms. 
Ray Larkin, President and CEO, Nelcor, Purett & Bennett, Pleasanton, CA, underlines the extent of the improvement of the FDA: `As critical as I may have been a year ago, I think they have made significant improvements in the product approval and the compliance side. The whole regulatory environment is improving.' 
This is what industry itself is saying about the FDA. This is not just those of us who are opposed to this particular provision. This is the industry itself. How many times have we heard, `If it is not broke, why fix it.' And here we have the wide approval by the regulated industry itself. And yet some here in this body want to deride this progress and put the American public at risk by denying the agency the ability to review important information about safety and effectiveness when the information on the label is false and misleading. 
And here is Medical Economics of this year. 
The demand for devices has created a worldwide market of $120 billion including $50 billion in the U.S. 
That's growing by 8 percent annually. 
A healthy industry, thank goodness, because I think all of us know the importance of these medical devices when they are safe and effective. But we have to make sure they are safe and effective. We do not want to compromise the current superb safety record. 
An extensive study was conducted by the Medical Device Diagnostic Industry magazine this year that showed that the executive rating of device industry business is at an all-time high--58 percent favorable, 11 percent unfavorable. `Expectations of the medical device business conditions.' The best that it has been in any time in recent years. All the measures indicating that the medical device industry is doing well, that the public is being served, safety is being addressed. 
Even with regulatory protections for safety, the speed with which these devices are being approved has been improved, nonetheless we are being asked to alter those conditions. We are being asked to handcuff the FDA from being able to look at that medical device that may meet the safety standard substantial equivalence but it clearly intended to be used and marketed for another purpose. A purpose for which safety and effectiveness data have not been gathered or evaluated. 
Let's get back to the fundamentals. The main purpose of the FDA reform bill was to reauthorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 known as PDUFA. PDUFA is one of the most effective regulatory reform programs ever enacted. Under PDUFA, the pharmaceutical industry pays the user fees that cover part of the cost of FDA's drug approval and regulatory functions. And with these additional resources the FDA has been able to hire additional personnel so that drugs can be reviewed more promptly. As important as these additional resources were, equally important were the specific performance targets for speedier drug review negotiated between the industry and the FDA as part of the PDUFA agreement. 
This is where the industry, working with the agency, said, well, if we give support for this and it becomes law and they get the additional resources to hire the personnel, can we reach these target timeframes for approval, and the agency agreed to that. And we had extraordinary accountability. We found a 90 to 95 percent compliance with those goals. The industry establishing the support for the PDUFA fee resulted in important and dramatic progress made. The combination of performance targets, additional resources, and the leadership of Dr. Kessler, the former FDA Commissioner, has created a regulatory revolution at the FDA. 
Listening to some of the speeches we have heard during the course of this debate, you would think the FDA was a regulatory dinosaur mired in the past, cumbersome and bureaucratic, imposing unnecessary and costly regulatory burdens on industry and denying patients speedy access to lifesaving drugs. 
That is a myth that those who want to destroy the FDA in the interest of an extreme ideological agenda or in the interest of higher profits and at the expense of the patients, would love you to believe. It is not true. The FDA's regulatory record is the envy of the world, and it sets the gold standard for protection of patient health and safety. 
Over the last few years, in partnership with Congress and the administration, the FDA has responded to growing criticisms of delays in approving new products by taking impressive steps to improve its performance. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 was one of the most effective regulatory reform programs ever enacted. The bill established a new partnership between the industry and the agency. The industry agreed to provide the additional resources. The agency agreed to a measurable performance standard to speed the review of products, and every goal set by the legislation has not only been met but been exceeded. 
So today the FDA is unequaled in the world for its record in getting new drugs to market quickly, without sacrificing patient protection. In fact, last year average review times in the United States were twice as fast as in Europe. Fifteen new drugs were approved in both the European Union and the United States. In 80 percent of the cases, the United States approved the new drugs either first or at the same time as the European Union. More companies chose the United States for the introduction of breakthrough drugs than any other country. 
That is the current record. In addition to speeding the review times, the FDA has taken far-reaching steps to reduce unnecessary burdens on industry and modernize its regulatory processes. More needs to be done, but these steps have added up to a quiet revolution in the way FDA fulfills its critical mission. When the prescription drug user fee was originally passed, the device industry refused to agree to the user fees that would give the FDA additional resources and performance standards that have contributed so much to the agency's outstanding record on drugs and biologics. But even in the device area, the recent FDA achievements have been impressive. 
I think it is fair to say that following passage of PDUFA, the primary priority of the FDA was to implement that commitment and contract with the pharmaceutical industry. And I do think that the agency gave that a higher priority than it did moving ahead in 
terms of the medical devices. 
I think that is probably a fair criticism. But once PDUFA had been effectuated, the priorities shifted to the medical device industry. 
I remember the debate on PDUFA quite clearly. I welcomed the opportunity to join with my colleague, Senator Hatch, and others in the adoption of PDUFA, and I remember the efforts we made in the area of the medical device industry to do exactly the same thing. But we were unable to get the device industry to agree to that. I think it is unfortunate. Any fair evaluation in terms of the FDA in looking over the period of the time since the passage of the PDUFA, the changes in the way that the agency worked in advancing and accelerating the consideration of pharmaceuticals and biologics would understand that they get the priority. It has been only in recent years that the device industry has received attention, with the results which I mentioned just a few moments ago. 
The so-called 510(k) application devices, which are approved on the basis of substantial equivalence to a device already on the market, account for 95 percent of the device submissions. The FDA has virtually eliminated its backlog. Last year it reviewed 94 percent of these devices within the statutory timeframe compared to 40 percent just 4 years ago--dramatic improvement. And we haven't compromised safety in the process. Why are we now attempting to undermine the health and the safety of the American public? Why are we risking it? 
Mr. President, even in the area of class III devices, which is where most problems remain, the FDA has improved its performance substantially. According to a study by the GAO, median review times dropped 60 percent between 1991 and 1996. A recent survey of device industry executives reported that the business climate for the industry is the best in a 5-year history of the survey. The sponsor of the survey attributes the favorable response in large measure to the improvements at FDA and concludes:  
The agency has not only reduced the product approval delays that slowed new product introductions, but, perhaps more importantly, has also greatly reduced both executives' and investors' uncertainty about the timeliness of future product introductions. 
That is the conclusion of the General Accounting Office. That is not the conclusion of those of us who are trying to say look, the system is working, the devices that are getting into the FDA are being approved in record time, they are getting out to benefit the people and we have a solid safety record. 
We are being asked here to walk away from that safety record. We are being asked here, for the first time since we passed serious medical device legislation 25 years ago, to take steps backward in the area of protecting the American public. 
In a recent FDA report, the agency sets new targets for even quicker review of the class III devices while still giving assurances that we are going to continue to protect the public. The agency is doing a good job now. It will be doing an even better job in the future. There is no justification for weakening the FDA power to protect the public--not based on the myth that it is denying patients prompt access to needed new products. 
If you listened to this debate for the past days, the other side's description of the FDA may have been accurate 5 years ago or 10 years ago, but does not reflect where the FDA is today. And that is not just my opinion, but it is what we hear from the General Accounting Office, and what we have the industry itself saying. 
The most important aspect of this bill is the reauthorization of PDUFA. The new PDUFA program was negotiated between the FDA and the industry. It expands existing programs by setting additional performance standards and puts special emphasis on expanding early cooperation between the FDA and industry so the drug development process, not just the regulatory process, can be stepped up. The agency has been creative in anticipating the possibility of major new drug breakthroughs. They have been working with the industry in new ways to help shape and formulate the way the industry effects its application so it can be approved in more expeditious manner. This is because we are not just interested in drug approvals but also development times. 
We had a long debate about how we were going to reduce the number of days: 180, 360, 120, or 90 days--for the approval on these various issues. That was taking our eye off the ball. What is important is development time. In our own review of FDA, what makes the most difference reducing total approval time is reducing development time. The agency has been doing really excellent work. In addition to PDUFA, there are a number of other provisions changing the way the agency does business, particularly in the area of medical devices. As originally introduced, the bill included many extreme provisions that posed significant threats to public health. It was important that these provisions be modified before the legislation could be allowed to move forward. I compliment Senator Jeffords and the other members of the committee, Republicans and Democrats alike, on their willingness to compromise on these unacceptable proposals over the months we worked on the bill. I would like to review a number of these provisions for the Members of the Senate so they understand the changes this legislation makes and the pitfalls that have been avoided. These compromises must not be undone as the bill moves further through the legislative process. I am proud the progress that has been made. We have reached constructive compromises on more than 20 items. 
I have here the letter that was sent to the chairman by the Secretary of Health and Human Services in June, June 11, as the committee was considering the FDA reform. In this, the Secretary mentions, `Unfortunately, the Chairman's substitute to S. 830, also includes a number of provisions which as drafted do not reflect consensus and about which I have very significant concerns.'

Mr. KENNEDY. They are listed here. There are 20 items, major concerns about the cumulative aspect of the regulatory burdens, the various kinds of advisory committees, the advisory committees and the regulatory burdens that would have added to the complexity, and even the process of considering new drugs. The basic concerns the administration had on features of the third-party review, the approval standard for some of the drug and biologic devices, limits that were put on the FDA to evaluate some of the clinical outcomes for devices, and the lower approval standards that were included in some radio-pharmaceuticals. 
They had some concerns about the health claims for foods and expanded access to investigational therapies, which allow drug or devices companies to sell investigational products for any serious disease without FDA approval and without appropriate protections for clinical investigators. The device modification allowed the companies to make manufacturing changes that affected devices' safety and effectiveness without ever notifying the FDA; the health economic claims that would allow industry to discuss health economic claims given to managed care organizations under a low evidentiary standard and without FDA review. 
There was pediatric labeling, and the whole question on the humanitarian use of devices and collaborative determinations. There were also some concerns about off-label use of drugs, drug compounding. 
If you look at the improvements in the bill and the compromises worked out here, 19 of the 20 have been worked out to the satisfaction of HHS and the FDA. There may be some groups that do not feel that certain provisions are worked out adequately. But I am prepared to defend those compromises. There is only one that remains. That is the provision that we are addressing here. Whether we are going to permit false and misleading labeling on a particular product and deny the FDA the right to look behind that label in order to protect the safety of the families of America. There were 19 accepted, only one remains--but it is an important one. 
Why is it, if we are able to work out 19 of the 20, can't work out this one? The Senator from Rhode Island offered an excellent amendment yesterday saying, `OK, we will go along with the existing language that is in the bill. But we will also add the language that nothing in the label will be false and misleading.' False and misleading; that was defeated. Those Member who voted against it, I expect, will have to explain to their constituents why they would resist an amendment that said we should not permit the medical manufacturer to submit something false and misleading. 
Members are saying that this has been a long process that has taken a good deal of time. This measure was considered in the last Congress and now again in this Congress. We could have acted on these measures. We could have acted before June 11 and not dealt with any of the outstanding health and safety issues. But the fact of the matter is, we took the time, we listened to the arguments of the FDA and the Department of Health and Human Services, the people who are charged with protecting the American people. We worked out the 19 of the 20. Everyone gave a little, took a little, but 19 of those 20 have been worked out. Not this particular provision. It took time to work out those compromises. I think the time spent was well worth it. This is a much better bill than would have come out of that committee or on the floor in June or July or August, or even the early part of September. 
What were those steps that we took? First of all, we preserved the States' oversight of the safety of cosmetics. This compromise assures that the States will be able to continue to regulate the safety of cosmetics. The Gregg proposal in the underlying bill would have barred the States from any regulation whatsoever of cosmetics, even though the FDA has neither the authority nor the staff to regulate these products. The compromise allowed the States to continue their regulation unless a specific inconsistent regulation has been issued by the FDA in a particular area. 
We went through that debate. We found the examples, particularly with regard to the State of California, how they were able to protect their consumers. In some cases there were carcinogens in the products and the manufacturing company changed the formula and were able to get right back out there and produce the product and have record sales. 
The toluene that was in lipstick, which is related to another carcinogen that was related to some birth defects with children was altered and changed. 
We have had important studies that have been done up in Seattle, WA, at the University of Washington and other medical centers, about some of the potential dangers of use of talcum powder on small infants and its relationship to ovarian cancer. 
These were studies, scientific studies that were done by the States, that are directly related to protecting health and safety. The FDA does not provide for that kind of protection. Nonetheless, there was an effort to preempt States from protecting health and safety. We were able to defeat that. I think that was important. I believe the consumers in those States think so. 
Second, the safeguard for off-label use of drugs. This important compromise will allow companies to circulate reputable journal articles about off-label use of drugs but will ultimately enhance the public's health and safety because the FDA will be given the opportunity to review, comment on, and approve articles which the companies circulate. The compromise also requires the companies to undertake studies on the safety of their drugs for the specific off-label use and submit applications to the FDA for approval for their drugs for these uses within 3 years. That was not in the legislation prior to this compromise. 
We saw the steps that were taken to meet the safety standards. 
Currently, companies are circulating articles without reviewing them for off-label use, without seeking review or approval by the FDA, and without conducting the studies which would lead to an ultimate FDA approval or disapproval of the drug. 
We wanted to make sure that the companies were going to conduct the safety standards for the use of those particular drugs. We were able to work that out. Again, to protect the American public. 
Expanding access to drugs for patients and fast track approval. The fast track approval--this is one of the most important new initiatives in the legislation--will provide the same streamlined availability for drug treatments for patients with any life-threatening disease now available to patients with cancer or AIDS. It is a major breakthrough for patients who have life-threatening diseases. 
We were moving through the measures in the bill and pointing out in June of last year that the Secretary of HHS identified 20 major areas that we ought to review and work through in trying to accommodate some of the health and safety concerns. 
Effectively, we have resolved 19 of those. The only unresolved matter, according to the letter from the HHS, is the provision on section 404. 
What I was trying to do is to point out a number of these areas where we have made important progress and to mention the safety provisions that had been worked out and included in a bipartisan way. 
I was mentioning the expanded access to drugs for patients on the fast-track approval. We have had more than 17 different pharmaceuticals or drugs that have been identified for fast-track procedure. We are taking what has been the practice of the FDA and actually demonstrating by legislation, the importance of this particular procedure. We are trying to make the progress available to all those that have life-threatening diseases by giving authority to those researchers who believe the opportunities for fast-tracking these various pharmaceuticals will benefit the American public. 
That has been successful for AIDS and cancer, and now we are encouraging its use for other life-threatenting conditions. 
We have also expanded access for drugs under investigation for patients who have no other alternative. So an individual who might not otherwise qualify for various clinical trial protocols can get access to a drug if they have no other alternative. If this is the last gasp, the last hope that they will be able to have access to some of the modalities that might not have been particularly identified for this particular illness or sickness but their medical professionals believe they should have access, and we are moving in that direction. I think that gives a degree of hope to many of those who really wonder if they have any hope at all in trying to get some of the modern kinds of breakthrough drugs 
We have accepted the Snowe-Feinstein piece of legislation that will give individuals who have a particular life-threatening illness or sickness the opportunity to tap into the NIH database to find out what clinical trials are taking place. 
This is a very, very important additional provision, and I commend our Senators who are not on the committee but who have been interested and involved in this. That is very, very important. 
Mr. President, another area that we reviewed is the streamlining of the FDA procedures. The concern initially was in the areas of contracting out of various functions of the FDA. We talk about not only timeliness but also about the importance of preserving quality. We have to make sure that we are not only interested in timeliness, but we are also concerned about the quality. 
We have also, in this streamlining of the FDA procedures, worked out how we were going to try to review third-party review. That was worked out in a way which I think has virtual broad support. It permits 70 percent of all the devices that would be eligible to be reviewed. But in the areas that are the very significant higher level of class II--a limited number of class II and class III will remain outside of that particular protocol so that we will have a chance to review the results of the research that will be done. We have accelerated the time for that review, so the information will come back in quicker and we will be able to evaluate the results of that particular process.  
Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.

<TEXT>
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 20 minutes. 
Mr. President, I will just review quickly the work that was done by the committee. 
As I outlined earlier, there were 20 major proposals that were made by the Secretary in June. We have addressed 19 of those. The one remaining proposal we have not addressed is the one that brought about the Reed-Kennedy amendment which was defeated yesterday, and the one which virtually all of the consumer groups feel ought to be altered and changed before we get to final resolution and passage of this legislation. 
I reviewed some of the other provisions and the changes that were made as a result of bipartisan efforts, which I think are important and significant improvements, and also provide additional kinds of protection. 
I mentioned the fast tracking of the various products, and the ability of individuals who do not have expanded access to drugs still under investigation for patients who have no alternatives, the inclusions of the Snowe-Feinstein bill that will help to expand opportunities by using the NIH database, and some of the streamlining of the FDA procedures. 
I will mention just a final few. 
One concerned the improved consultation between manufacturers and the FDA. Prior to this provision, if there were any changes being implemented by manufacturers with these medical devices, they had to be cleared. 
We have changed that so that manufacturers can make adjustments and changes that are not going to affect issues of safety in order to make their production more efficient. But we also have some protections for safety included in there. 
The environmental issues. The original bill would have eliminated all the environmental impact statements from FDA applications. I didn't think that was what we were doing when we were extending PDUFA. We made adjustments and changes on that to ensure that those environmental impact statements will be preserved. 
The strengthening of the safety protections of the various medical devices. FDA will still require device manufacturers to file supplemental applications when they are making changes that affect safety and effectiveness of the devices, but we have made efforts to streamline that provision. 
The tracking of various devices after approval. Under the initial bill, there was a termination of tracking of medical devices. We had a good debate on this. I thought the Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] made a strong case for continuing postmarketing surveillance of medical devices. We have now compromised and said that we permit the FDA to make the judgment. We have found that a principal reason for postmarketing surveillance was a safety factor, a belief that if you track the various medical devices and are able to get information that shows that those medical devices may pose a danger to the people, you should be able to notify others who might have used a similar kind of device to give those individuals protections as well. 
Initially it was thought that by having that kind of review, you could advance these medical devices because you are going to have a pretty good evaluation of those medical devices as they affect people by having tracking mechanisms rather than just attempting to evaluate safety and effectiveness prior to the time that the medical devices are actually utilized. So it was an attempt to speed up the process that the tracking provisions were put into effect initially. Now they are enormously important because if we find out that people do have adverse impacts from these medical devices--and we have tracking mechanisms--we can protect not only those individuals but also others who might have the same kind of device implanted in them. 
We worked out a compromise, and I think the public interest is protected. It would not have been if we had not worked it out. 
The tightening of the process for FDA approval of medical devices. We have 180 days for these devices. What we are saying is at the end of 100 days the FDA indicates the deficiencies in those devices but still has 180 days to be able to make a final judgment. But it does give an earlier indication to the medical device manufacturer about the potential problems that they are going to face. 
Recordkeeping by distributors of devices. In the initial bill, they wiped out all of that information. So if there was an adverse impact from the medical device, the distributors would not have collected the information and the FDA would not know about it. What we have done is maintained that the distributors have to keep the information which they have with regard to adverse impacts from devices. They do not have to report it to the FDA, but they have to keep it. And then if there is some kind of indication about adverse impact, the FDA will be able to pursue it. It saves a good deal of paperwork. And, it still adequately protects the public. 
We have made many changes in a bipartisan effort to improve and strengthen the bill. We have safety standards for drugs to ensure that the alternative use of a drug is going to meet high safety standards. That is an improvement. 
Health care economic information. When pharmaceuticals are given or sold to health care organizations, there is going to be complete information given in terms of alternative treatments for individuals, and this is a very important element. 
Health claims for food products. In the initial proposal, this legislation which was to extend the PDUFA to ensure faster 
consideration of pharmaceutical drugs, was effectively going to eliminate any FDA rule on health claims for food products. There was an example where the industry was leaning on us again in order to undermine the kind of information that would be given to consumers on these various food products, the health claims. 
I was around here in the late 1980's when we passed the legislation with regard to food labeling to make sure that the consumer was going to have the right information as to the health assets a particular food might provide, and our committee wanted to effectively eliminate those advances. We were able to maintain them. I think that was important. Those are some of the items. And in each and every instance, the public health was enhanced, with the exception of one--404. There is the record. I could have taken more time and gone into greater detail. And there can be no review of any of those 19 that would bring one to a different conclusion except for the one that we are talking about here. That is the only one that was brought out in the June 11 letter by the Secretary of HHS that said you have to address it because of the compelling need to protect the public. 
That is the one that every consumer group has said, why don't you address that the way you did the other 19? You worked out bipartisan agreements on all of the other 19 proposals and enhanced the public protection. Why can't you do it on this one? 
Well, we have been unable to. But we still hear from some of our colleagues about what a long process this has been, that we could have passed this in June, you would not have passed it without those health protections. I think that we protected the public with the one exception--and that stands out. 
We have gone over the FDA's impact on the lives of the consumers of this country. How in so many different ways it impacts and affects our lives and how they have taken action in each and every one of those circumstances to protect the public health. I have gone through in detail about how the medical device industry is prospering. They have a more positive attitude than they have ever had. 
Now what they are going to do is restrict the protection of the public health with this particular provision, and it is wrong. The issue is clear. Will medical devices be approved on the basis of false and misleading labels? All we needed was to add the words `false and misleading`' to the bill. This bill would have gone through unanimously. But we were defeated on the amendment that would have prohibited false or misleading labels. When our colleagues go back home and they are asked in their town halls, why were you for permitting medical device companies to submit false information? I hope they have a good answer, because I cannot think of one, not when the industry is making the progress it is making and is having record sales, and safety is still being protected. 
Will dangerous medical devices that have not been tested for safety and effectiveness be foisted on the American people? 
Will unscrupulous companies like U.S. Surgical Corp. be rewarded for deceiving the FDA? 
Will there be a higher value placed on the profits of the powerful than the health of the American people? 
Section 404 of the FDA bill requires the FDA to approve a medical device based on the use identified on the label submitted by the manufacturer, even if that label is false or misleading. It prevents the FDA from requiring the manufacturers show that their product is safe and effective for the purpose for which it will be really used as opposed to the purpose falsely claimed on the label. It stands 20 years of progress toward safer and more effective medical devices on its head. 
Nothing better shows the need for the Reed-Kennedy amendment than the recent history on the Advanced Breast Biopsy Instrumentation system device developed and marketed by the U.S. Surgical Corp. This attempt to mislead the FDA and foist an untested machine on women with breast cancer shows why it is critical that section 404 not be passed in its current form.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, U.S. Surgical's public response to this sorry record of profiteering at public expense is a disgraceful attempt to avoid responsibility for its unacceptable behavior. It claimed it had not produced the video--even though the video carries the company log and it is impossible to watch it without it being clear that the company paid for it, produced it, and wrote the script. 
It claimed that it had not distributed the video, even though there is no reason to produce a promotional video except to distribute it, and even though Dr. Morrow has written that the video was delivered to her office by a company representative trying to convince her to buy the U.S. Surgical machine. And, according to the Associated press, a company spokesman said that `the label * * * makes clear that the biopsy divice is `to be used only for diagnostic breast biopsy and is not a therapeutic device.' But as the history of this machine makes clear, that clear disclaimer is only on the label because the FDA stepped in and stopped the company from its illegal promotional efforts. 
If section 404 is passed in its current form, the FDA will be handcuffed in its efforts to protect the public against untested and potentially harmful--even fatal--devices. Under current law, the FDA is able to require that the company develop data to show that the new device was safe and effective for removing tumors--the real use intended by the company, not the false and misleading use submitted on their proposed label. When the FDA made a mistake and inappropriately cleared the device, it had the authority to go back to the company and warn that it would revoke their approval unless adequate warnings were placed on the label and necessary clinical testing was performed. 
But under section 404 of the FDA reform bill, the FDA would be forced to approve the new device without such evidence. Unscrupulous companies will not only be allowed but encouraged to submit misleading labels, because they will gain a competitive advantage over companies that play by the rules. 
American women do not want to die from breast cancer because companies are allowed to sell devices that may be unsafe and ineffective. No Senator would want their own wife or mother or daughter to be subjected to such an untested device, solely because a greedy company wanted higher profits. 
Supporters of this measure claim that FDA will still have the power to require that dangerous devices be shown to be safe and effective before they are sold. They point to the language of the statute that says a device approved as substantially equivalent must meet two tests. First, it must have the same intended use as the predecessor device. Second, `the information submitted that the device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device contains information, including clinical information if deemed necessary by the Secretary, that demonstrates that the device is safe and effective as a legally marketed device, and does not raise different questions of safety and efficacy that the predicate product.' 
What their argument ignores is the first part of the test--the intended use test. Today, the FDA can look at the device and say, from the technical characteristics of the product, that it is obvious that it has been redesigned so that it is primarily for a different use than the older device. But under the amendment, they would be barred from doing this. They would be forced to accept the manufacturer's word as to the intended use of the device--even if that label were false and misleading, even if the manufacturer was lying. That is what happened with U.S. Surgical and the biopsy machine that was really designed to treat breast cancer. Under the current law, FDA could require that U.S. Surgical show their device was safe and effective for treating breast cancer. Under the amendment, they could not. 
This is not just my opinion. It is the reason that the administration has singled out this provision as possible grounds for a veto. It is the reason it is opposed by a broad coalition of consumer and public health groups. It is obvious that the only reason that the proponents of this provision are not willing to compromise is that they want to hamstring the FDA for the benefit of the industry. How else can they possible justify requiring FDA to evaluate a device based on a false and misleading label. 
If allowed to stand, this provision will give unscrupulous companies a license to lie to the FDA. It will penalize ethical companies who are truthful and do the necessary testing to prove that their products are safe and effective. 
Most of all, it will put the health of America people at risk so that a greedy few may profit. 
The issue goes far beyond products to excise breast cancer. If applies to lasers to treat prostate disease, stents to place in carotid arteries, imaging systems to detect breast cancer, and a host of other treatment for dread diseases. 
A few days ago, the public was made aware of the tragedy that resulted from the use of diet drugs in ways that had not been approved by the FDA as safe and effective. This so-called off-label use of fenphen may well have caused serious and irreversible heart damage in tens of thousands of women who thought the drugs were safe. 
The legislation before us would actually encourage the use of off-label, unapproved uses of medical devices. It can fairly be called the fen-phen device provision. 
It is shocking that this shameful provision has been so cavalierly included in this bill. It is incomprehensible that reputable device manufactures are not prepared to support a compromise that allows the FDA to look behind labels that are false or misleading. 
Medical devices can heal, but they can also main and kill. The history of medical devices is full of stories of unnecessary death and suffering. 
But thanks to the authority the FDA now has, there are also many stories of lives saved by the vigilance of the FDA. What is incomprehensive about the bill before us is that it would take backward--in the direction of less protection of public health rather than more. The whole history of device regulation has been to provide the public greater protections. 
Two decades ago, the Dalkon shield disaster led to the passage of a law giving the FDA greater authority over medical devices. At the time, this birth control device went on the market, the FDA has no authority to require manufacturers to show that devices are safe and effective before they are sold. In 1974, an FDA advisory committee recommended that the Dalkon shield be taken off the market--after almost 3 million women had used it. 
The device was found to cause septic abortions and pelvic inflammatory disease. Hundreds of women had become sterile, and many required hysterectomies. According to the manufacturer's own estimates, 90,000 women in the United States alone were injured. The manufacturer, A.H. Robbins, refused to halt distribution of the device, even though the FDA requested it, while the issue was reviewed by the advisory committee. 
The Shiley heart valve disaster was so serious that it led to the enactment of further legislation. This mechanical heart valve was approved in 1979. It was developed by the Shiley Co. the Shiley Co. was subsequently sold to Pfizer, which continued marketing the value. It was taken off the market in 1986 because of its high-breakage rate. 
By that time, as many as 30,000 of these devices had been implanted in heart patients in the United States. One hundred and ninety-five valves broke and 130 patients died. Thousands of other patients who had the defective valves in their hearts had to make an impossible choice--between undergoing a new operation to remove the device, or living with the knowledge that they had a dangerous device in their heart that could rupture and kill them at any moment. Depositions taken from company employees indicated that cracks in defective valves may have been concealed from customers. 
Before the defective valve was withdrawn, the manufacturer had tried to introduce a new version with a 70 degree tilt instead of the 60 degree tilt approved by the FDA. 
The increased tilt was intended to improve blood flow and reduce the risk of clotting. The FDA's review found that the greater tilt increased the likelihood of metal fatigue and valve breakage, and the new version was not approved for use in the United States. Four thousand of the new devices were implanted in Europe. The failure rate was six times higher than for the earlier valve--causing at least 150 deaths. 
In another example of a human and public health tragedy involving a medical device, the firm Telectronics marketed a pacemaker wire for use in the heart. 
Twenty-five thousand of these pacemakers were marketed, beginning in 1994, before it was discovered that the wire could break, cause damage to the wall of the heart, or even destroy the aorta. 
Another device disaster is toxic shock syndrome from superabsorbent tampons. Most women would not think that a tampon could kill them or a change as minor as increasing the absorbency of the material used could have life-threatening consequences. About 5 percent of toxic shock syndrome cases are fatal. As a result of this problem FDA began requiring testing of the absorbency of all types of tampons. Women deserve protection. FDA should be strengthened, not crippled. 
The case of artificial jaw joints--referred to as TMJ devices--are another tragedy that devastated tens of thousands of patients, mostly women. These devices were implanted to assist patients with arthritic degeneration of the jaw joint, most with relatively mild discomfort. But the impact of the new joints, sold by a company called Vitek, was catastrophic. The new joints often disintegrated, leaving the victims disfigured and in constant, severe pain. To make matters worse, Vitek refused to notify surgeons of the problems with the joints, and FDA had to get a court order to stop distribution of the product. Similar problems were experienced with Dow Corning silicone jaw implants. 
In yet another example, the FDA was able to block a device that involved a plastic lens implanted in the eye to treat nearsightedness. The device was widely marketed in France, but the FDA refused to approve it for use in the United States. Long-term use of the device was later shown to cause damage to the cornea, with possible blindness. 
The angioplasty catheter marketed by the Bard Corp. turned out to be a dangerous device that the company sold with a reckless disregard for both the law and public health. The device was modified several times by the corporation without telling the FDA in advance, as required by the law. The company was prosecuted and pleaded guilty to 391 counts in the indictment, including mail fraud and lying to the Government. 
Thirty-three cases of breakage occurred in a 2-month period, leading to serious cardiac damage, emergency coronary bypass surgery, and even death. 
Devices as simple as patient restraints used in nursing homes and hospitals have been implicated in 231 injuries, including 128 deaths. 
The list goes on and on. 
These tragedies resulted in expanded powers for the FDA to protect the public against dangerous devices and greater vigilance on the part of the agency. But this bill steps backward by forcing the FDA to try to protect the public with one hand tied behind its back. 
This bill actually forces the FDA to approve devices based on false and misleading labels. 
Under the provision, the FDA cannot look behind the manufacturer's proposed use to demand appropriate safety and effectiveness data, even if it is obvious that the device has been designed for an altogether different use than the manufacturer claims. I have already discussed the dangers of a breast cancer biopsy needle that would have been used to treat breast cancer without adequate evidence that it was effective. There are many other examples of the kind of dangerous devices that could be foisted on the American public, if the provision of the bill allowing false and misleading labels is allowed to stand. 
Surgical lasers are increasingly used for general cutting, in place of traditional instruments such as scalpels. In a recent case, a manufacturer called Trimedyne adapted the laser in a way that indicated it was clearly intended for prostate surgery. But it submitted an application to the FDA saying that the laser was only intended for general cutting. The label was clearly false, and the FDA was able to require adequate safety data before the product was allowed on the market. But under this bill, the FDA would be forced to approve the product, without requiring evidence that the device is safe and effective for prostate surgery. 
Prostate surgery is a very common procedure affecting tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of older men. 
Failed surgery can result in permanent incontinence and other devastating side effects. Do we really want surgical tools to be used to treat this common illness that may not be safe and effective? If this legislation passes unchanged, that is exactly the risk that large numbers of patients needing prostate surgery could face. 
A further example involves digital mammography, an imaging technology that is becoming an alternative to conventional film mammography. The new device is approved for better diagnostic imaging of a potentially cancerous lump in the breast that has already been detected. But it is not known whether the new machine can be used effectively in screening for breast cancer when there are no symptoms. 
Under this bill, if a manufacturer seeks approval for a digital mammography machine that is clearly designed for breast cancer screening, not just for diagnosis, the FDA would be prohibited from requiring data to show that the machine is effective for screening. Does the Senate really want to support legislation that could result in women dying needlessly from undetected breast cancer? That is what this device provision could cause. 
Another example involves the large number of patients who have suffered serious fractures and who benefit from orthopedic implants that help the broken bones to heal. In some cases, these implants are designed to be removed after the healing is complete. In other cases, to avoid further surgery or to strengthen the bone, the implants are left in place. 
Under this legislation, a manufacturer of plates and screws approved for short-term use could modify them in a way that clearly shows they are intended for long-term use. The FDA would be prohibited by this bill from looking behind the false and deceptive label and requiring the manufacturer to show that the device will not degenerate or weaken the bone during long-term use. 
Pedicle screws are a clear example of just such behavior by manufacturers. Originally designed to hold long bones in place after a fracture, they were modified by the manufacturer so that they could be used to make the spine more rigid, with the goal of reducing painful back problems. But the many manufacturers of these screws did not present safety and effectiveness data to the FDA for this new use. 
The result: the screws sometimes broke and sometimes caused spinal fractures. Reoperation rates ranged from 14 to 52 percent--and patients suffered permanent pain and disability. This is exactly the kind of unethical behavior by manufacturers that this bill encourages. 
Other examples in the way that this provision could allow unsafe and ineffective devices abound. A stent designed to open the bile duct for gallstones could be modified in a way that clearly was designed to make it a treatment for blockages of the carotid artery. Without adequate testing, it could put patients at risk of stroke or death. But under this bill, the FDA would be prohibited from looking behind the label to the actual intended use of the device. 
Still another example involves contact lenses, which can be approved for either short- or long-term wear. Extended wear contact lenses can be left in the eye overnight, and sometimes are worn for weeks. Under this bill, a manufacturer could take contact lenses approved for short-term wear, and modify them in a way clearly intended for long-term wear. The FDA would have to approve the modified lenses based on the false and misleading label for short-term use. Unsuspecting patients could suffer corneal ulcers and even blindness. 
The vast majority of medical device manufacturers meet high-ethical standards. Most devices are fully tested and evaluated by the FDA before they are marketed. 
But as many examples make clear, if the FDA does not have adequate authority to protect innocent patients, the result can be unnecessary death and injury to patients across the country. There is no justification--none whatever--for Congress to force the FDA to approve devices with false or misleading labels. And there is certainly no justification for giving a competitive advantage to unscrupulous companies who will exploit this gaping loophole in the law. 
Companies that hope to benefit by weakening the FDA are powerful and profitable. They believe they have the votes to push this disgraceful provision through the U.S. Senate. Today, they probably do have the votes. 
But if the American people truly understand what is at stake, I do not believe they will permit this dangerous provision to become law. When the vote comes on Tuesday, we will see how many Senators are willing to stand with the American people--and how many are willing to vote in favor of false and misleading labeling. 
The legislation we are considering has many constructive elements. But it does not deserve to go forward unless this disgraceful provision is removed. False or misleading labels should have no place in approval of medical devices. Unscrupulous manufacturers do not deserve a free ride at the expense of public health. 
I intend to continue to fight to modify this provision so that public health can be protected, and I believe that we will ultimately be able to reach a compromise that will not sacrifice the public interest to the profits of greedy manufacturers. We have been successful in assuring that every other objectionable provision of this bill has been modified so that the public health is protected. This provision must be changed as well. 
Here are some significant advances in the FDA bill and compromises worked out on S. 830 since the committee markup on June 18. 
First, preserving State oversight of safety of cosmetics. This compromise assured that the States will be able to continue to regulate the safety of cosmetic products. The Gregg proposal in the underlying bill would have barred States from any regulation whatsoever of cosmetics, even though the FDA has neither the authority nor the staff to regulate these products. The compromise allows States to continue their regulation unless a specific inconsistent regulation has been issued by the FDA in a particular area. 
Second, safeguards for off-label use of drugs. This important compromise will allow companies to circulate reputable journal articles about off-label use of drugs but will ultimately enhance the public health and safety because the FDA will be given the opportunity to review, comment on, and approve articles which the companies will circulate. The compromise also requires companies to undertake studies on the safety of their drugs for the specific off-label use and submit applications to the FDA for approval of their drugs for these uses within 3 years. Currently, companies are circulating articles without reviewing them for off-label use without seeking review or approval by the FDA and are also never conducting the studies which would lead to ultimate FDA approval or disapproval of the drug. 
Third, expanding access to drugs for patients and fast track approval: 
Fast track approval. This is one of the most important new initiatives in the legislation. Fast track approval will provide the same streamlined availability for drug treatments for patients with any life-threatening disease now available only to patients with cancer or AIDS. 
Expanded access to drugs still under investigation for patients who have no other alternatives. The compromise combines protections for patients with expanded access to new investigational therapies, without exposing patients to unreasonable risks. 
Providing access for patients to information about clinical trials for serious or life-threatening diseases. This compromise will assure that patients suffering from serious or life-threatening diseases will have available to them information about ongoing clinical trials relating to these diseases. 
Fourth, streamlining FDA procedures. In order to expedite some product reviews, the compromise authorizes the Secretary to contract out to third-party reviewers when it will improve timeliness, but not when it will reduce quality. For medical devices, the compromise establishes in law an already existing pilot program for reviewing devices by outside third parties. The compromise limits the review only to low-risk class I devices and specifically excludes higher risk devices that are life-sustaining or if the device was not shown to be appropriate could cause substantial impairment to human health. The FDA will not have to expend resources on unnecessary reports which may be duplicative of other reports already required to be filed by the agency. 
Fifth, improved consultation between manufacturers and FDA. The compromise increases the requirements on the FDA to consult with device manufacturers and specifically to work toward achieving agreement on what set of data needs to be provided by the device manufacturer before approval can be granted. In addition, the device manufacturers are required to supply progress reports to the FDA, and in particular, report significant deficiencies in the device which have developed during the review period. 
Sixth, environmental issues. The original bill would have eliminated environmental impact statements from FDA applications. The compromise ensures that the bill does not undermine environmental protections provided by the Environmental Protection Act. 
Seventh, strengthening safety protections of medical devices: 
Safety and effectiveness of devices. The FDA will still require device manufacturers to file supplemental applications when they are making changes to their manufacturing procedures which may affect the safety and effectiveness of the devices. 
Tracking of devices after approval. The compromise ensures that FDA can require surveillance of products after they have been approved for as long as needed to protect the public health. 
Tightening up the process for FDA approval of medical devices. The FDA will now be required to accept the classification made by the manufacturer unless questions are raised within a specific period of time. The compromise also tightens up timeframes within which the FDA must make a final decision on a device application. 
Recordkeeping by distributors of devices. The compromise requires limited recordkeeping by device distributors so that patients using devices will be readily identifiable if there is a health problem. 
Eighth, other issues: 
Safety standards for drugs. Supplemental applications for drug approvals need to meet the same safety standards as the original application. 
Health care economic information. Only valid and supportable health economic claims may be made by drug manufacturers. 
Health claims for food products. This compromise assures that the Nutrition Labeling Act is not undercut or weakened, and that any health claims by food manufacturers have to be substantiated. 
Mr. President, we want to be able to give the FDA the authority, when it is clearly indicated as a result of the technological changes in that medical device that an alternative use is intended, to look in behind the proposal and examine the safety data that would indicate that device is going to be safe, for the American public to be protected. 
That is the issue. We have had too many medical device tragedies in this country. It has not been that long ago, whether it is the Dalkon shield or the Shiley heart valve, or even the adjustments in absorption level in tampons that produced toxic shock and resulted in the deaths of women--there have been too many medical device tragedies. We have been able to avoid them in recent times. The industry is doing well. We are having new breakthrough technologies. 
We have reviewed 19 of the 20 key elements that have been raised by those who have been most concerned about the safety and security of the American people. We have addressed them and advanced the public's interest in protecting the health of the American people with the exception of this provision. 
It would be wrong and a major mistake to permit this legislation to be passed without making that change. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. KENNEDY. First, I want to commend my colleagues and their staffs for their efforts in the difficult task of drawing the line between drug manufacturing and pharmacy compounding. Ordinary pharmacy compounding has been traditionally regulated by the States, but drug manufacturing, even when conducted by State-licensed pharmacists, is regulated under Federal law. Under current law, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act specifically exempts from the inspection and registration provisions of the act pharmacies that compound drugs for sale in the regular course of dispensing or selling drugs at retail. However, FDA and the courts that have addressed the matter interpret the act as not providing any general exemption from the new drug, adulteration, and misbranding provisions for drugs compounded by pharmacists. It is my understanding that section 809 of S. 830 would bring the legal status of compounding in line with FDA's longstanding enforcement policy of regulating only drug manufacturing, not ordinary pharmacy compounding. This legislation would, as I understand it, exempt drugs compounded in pharmacies from the new drug, and certain other, provisions of the act, but the exemption would not create a loophole that would allow unregulated drug manufacturing to occur under the guise of pharmacy compounding.

Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the distinguished Senator from Arkansas for describing the reasons why this section is so important to patients and to the health professions. I want to especially commend his staff for working with mine to develop this legislation that exempts from Federal law the activities that are appropriately regulated by the States. 
It is my understanding that some of the conditions are intended to ensure that the volume of compounding does not approach that ordinarily associated with drug manufacturing. Other conditions appear to be intended to ensure that the compounded drugs that qualify for the exemption have appropriate assurances of quality and safety since these compounded drugs would not be subject to the more comprehensive regulatory requirements that apply to manufactured drug products.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
Just a short while ago, we heard some comments on the floor about how this whole process has taken a long period of time. It has taken a period of time. But I think one can see from any fair review of the history of the legislation that very substantial progress has been made in making this a better bill. As I pointed out earlier in the debate, of the 20 major health safety issues identified by the administration, 19 have been addressed, not only in our committee markup, but also in the negotiations that we had prior to the time of the legislation coming to the floor. There is the one remaining item, which deals with safety and medical devices. It is extremely important. We have given focus to this issue because it deserves the focus that we have given it. 
Mr. President, I have in my hand the statement of the administration policy. It indicates that it has two major concerns with the bill. One is the technical provision with regard to the budget agreement and how they are going to allocate to PDUFA, which is a technical issue. But the other issue mentioned by the administration is this particular provision: 
First, section 404 of the bill would lower the review standard for marketing approval by precluding the FDA from reviewing medical devices for uses other than those for which the manufacturer says they are intended. 
The administration indicates, as they did in the letter in September, as they did in June, that this particular provision is dangerous in terms of the consumers in this country. 
We have reviewed, over the course of the debate, the dangerous situations that have been the result of medical device disasters. We are committed to avoiding that kind of disaster in the future. We have a good safety record at the present time, but we are endangering that record with section 404. We noted that virtually every consumer group supports changing section 404. It is enormously important. It goes to the fundamental question of providing FDA with the power and authority to pursue the protections of the American health in the area of medical devices.

I want to express my sincere appreciation to the chairman of the committee, Senator Jeffords, who has been a chairman's chair. He is strong in his belief. He is a fighter for the things that he champions. He has been willing to accommodate differing views. He protects his strong posture and positions on his own views, and I respect that. I thank the other Members of this body for their courtesy during the course of what I know has been a continuing discussion and debate on a very important measure. I thank all of our Members for their courtesy and consideration as we move toward a vote on this legislation. I thank my chairman.

If I could, I will just take a moment of the Senate's time, but I think it is important to mention on our side David Nexon and Diane Robertson, who worked so closely with us; Jim Manly, Debbie Kochevar, Meg Archdeacon, Burt Cowgill, Susan Hammersten, Jonathan Halperin, and Danielle Drissel, Carrie Coberly and Addy Schmidt; Bonnie Hogue on Senator Reed's staff and Deborah Walker on Senator Bingaman's staff; Sabrina Corlette with Senator Harkin and Anne-Marie Murphy with Senator Durbin. 
I would like to believe the staffs have been helpful to all of us and don't work so much in a partisan way as in a common spirit, to try to advance the common interests. That has been, certainly, true on this legislation. 
I thank all of those, and the majority staff as well, for all of their courtesies and for their cooperation. I think the record ought to show the dedication of, really, an outstanding group of men and women who have really served the Senate very, very well. I thank the chairman.

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 8 minutes. 
Mr. President, my good friend from Rhode Island has put his finger on exactly the problem and the issue. Now, I listened to our friend, Senator Frist, who believes that the FDA doesn't really have a problem if the information is going to be false and misleading, that the FDA has the authority to look behind the label itself and find out if that information is false and misleading. 
If that is the case, we do not have a problem. We can accept an amendment that would restate what he has just said, or we can drop this whole provision. 
It is interesting to listen to those who are opposed to the Reed amendment say, well, look, the FDA can do this and that and protect the public, while at the same time they are emasculating the very safety valve with this new provision--restricting the FDA in its ability to judge on the issues of substantial equivalence. 
Now, Mr. President, before we move to the vote, I want to 
reiterate where we are so that those who have been listening to the debate for these last few minutes understand where we are. 
We are talking about the preeminent issue identified by the administration's principal spokesperson charged with protecting American health. This has been identified as the one provision in the whole legislation that is of central concern to the public health of the American people. They mentioned the issues of cosmetics; they mentioned the fact that this eliminates environmental impact statements; they mentioned technical issues dealing with PDUFA; but there was only one public health issue that the Secretary of HHS has recognized, and it is this particular provision which Senator Reed has tried to address. 
It is of such importance that the Secretary of HHS indicated that if that provision remains unchanged, she would recommend that the President not sign the legislation. And it is not just the Senators from Rhode Island and Massachusetts who are concerned about this provision. Every single consumer group is concerned about it as well. All of the groups that speak for patient rights, all of the groups that are concerned about women's health issues, all of the various consumer groups--I have listed them before--all of them say that we ought to support the Reed amendment, if we are truly interested in protecting the American consumer. We have, over the last few days, talked about why this is so important. 
Those who are opposed to this amendment keep repeating their assertions that the FDA has the authority to protect the public. That is hogwash. They may believe it. I have yet to see a Member of the Senate who is opposed to our amendment take out this legislation and thumb through it and point to the specific language that states the FDA will have authority to protect the public if this amendment is not carried by the Senate of the United States. 
They have not done it because they cannot do it. They cannot point to a provision in here that says, `OK, if we defeat the Reed amendment, FDA will still have the authority.' They have these assertions on the floor of the U.S. Senate. But they have not pointed to specific language in this legislation, and that is what counts. They cannot point to it because it is not there. 
We are talking, as the Senator from Rhode Island has pointed out, about medical devices submitted to the FDA for approval, which a company would say is `substantially equivalent' to an existing device. But which, in reality, is a device which has significant technological changes in its design and in fact, is designed for another use. However, when the new device is submitted for approval, the label will still maintain that the device will be used for the same purposes as the original device. That is what is happening. That is the danger and that is what the Reed amendment is attempting to prevent. 
We have discussed the example of this that is currently unfolding. The biopsy needle that was supposed to be substantially equivalent to a biopsy needle the size of your pencil lead but which actually removes an amount of material the size of a hot dog. This device is used to take the place of surgery for women, but it is untested and untried for that purpose. We don't know if it's safe. The company hasn't submitted evidence as to whether it is safe. But we know that this device developed by U.S. Surgical was not designed for the narrow biopsy; it was designed for another purpose. It takes out 50 times the amount of material necessary for a biopsy. 
We know what it was designed for, we have the promotion tape. We have the statements from doctors saying they were being solicited to use it for surgery, not biopsy. 
You can claim that these are low-risk devices. You can claim that is really just a technical issue, that its not important. But we know that is not the case. We are talking about anesthesia machines which are used for major surgeries. We want those to be able to perform the way they should and to meet safety and efficacy standards. We are talking about fetal cardiac monitors. We want to make sure that children who need that kind of monitoring have a device that will be safe and do the job. What mother wants to discover that her child is using a fetal cardiac monitoring system that has been approved for some other use and here the hospital or clinic is using it for a different purpose without knowing that it is safe and effective for that use? 
The list goes on. We have had the situation where surgical lasers are being submitted as general cutting tools when it is clear that the intention is to use them for surgeries for prostate cancer and no information about how safe or effective they are for that purpose has been submitted to the FDA. Why are we risking the health of the American people over this issue? What is the benefit? 
I have cited examples where we have been called on in this body to make decisions about whether we are going to use a limited amount of money to feed the elderly people--how much will we use in congregate sites? How much will we use for home delivery? If you use more in home delivery, you will be able to feed fewer people. It's a painful issue, and whatever we do some are going to benefit, some are going to lose. We can understand men and women of good judgment differing on that issue. 
But not on this issue. What is the balance? The balance is that the protections of American consumers are weakened in the area of medical devices--significantly weakened for the first time in 25 years. And the profits of the medical device industry go up. And they have a competitive advantage over the other companies who do the right thing and conduct the tests to provide health and safety information on their devices. 
Why are we doing that? What is the rush? Why aren't we hearing from the other side that, `We have 10 consumers' groups 
that believe we can get the information much more rapidly and their health needs will be advanced and we don't need the Reed amendment.' Where are those statements, why haven't we heard them. Because they are not there. 
We have to decide whether we are going to retain, for the Food and Drug Administration, the ability to deal with labeling. The ability to look beyond the label when they find it to be false and misleading. That is a pretty high standard. FDA has to find it false and misleading. Only then can they look to safety. Some of us wish it was a lower standard, but that is the standard we have here, false and misleading. 
We have given examples, ads have been used to promote medical devices for other purposes. That is happening now. We have also spelled out the human tragedies that occurred when medical devices malfunctioned, when we did not have all the necessary information to assess safety. 
Are we going to deny the principal health agency charged with protecting the American public, the authority to ask for more data if they find that the label on a medical device is false and misleading. Are we going to say your hands are cuffed?

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we are making substantial progress on the FDA bill, and I applaud that progress. We have worked out a number of key issues on a bipartisan basis since the committee markup in June. We have worked out the issues on fast tracking some innovative opportunities for dealing with the special challenges we are facing. We built on the fast tracking that we have done on AIDS drugs, and we are trying to do more in the areas of cancer and Alzheimer's, following what has been an important initiative at FDA for getting drugs out faster. We have even worked out differences on the off-label uses of various pharmaceuticals and devices and what information and studies will be required in terms of safety and efficacy. We have worked out the early consultation between device manufacturers and the FDA. 
We have been working toward reducing the total development time. A key element in our negotiations has been going upstream and working with the pharmaceutical companies, as well as the manufacturers, in shaping and formulating their applications so that they will move more rapidly through the approval process. Many of these initiatives were worked out by Dr. Kessler. We have put them into legislation under the leadership of Senator Jeffords and others on the committee. We have settled the issues of cosmetics, after good debate and discussion. We have also worked our third-party review pilot programs and timeframes for some of the drug approvals. Each one of these issues was worked out in a way that protects the public health. 
This process continues now with further debate today and tomorrow on what I, and others with me, consider to be the most significant threat to the public health remaining in the bill. These other areas that are complex and difficult, where a wide variety of different positions had divided the committee in a significant way. We have been able to make important and significant progress in ways that advance public health. I believe that we have advanced the interest in the public health. This final issue remains and has been identified by the President of the United States and the Secretary of HHS as being the No. 1 public health risk within this legislation. We had a good debate on that issue earlier today and a real engagement of the differing ideas. I find that we were able to make important progress. The Members realize and recognize what is really at stake. We were unable to win the majority of the Members, but we have a substantial group of Members who are likewise concerned about the public health issues. 
We have heard from the various consumer groups and they are the ones that will benefit the most from breakthrough devices. If you read through their concern and opposition to the provision in the legislation and their strong support for the Reed amendment, you understand why we are so concerned about this particular provision. 
The House is in the process of taking up legislation dealing with the same subject matter, although they have reached a stalemate with regard to the extension on PDUFA. PDUFA, which I certainly support, provides the additional resources for the FDA to get the kind of trained disciplined personnel that represents the top of our research technology to work very effectively in the evaluation of these various products. 
As the prime sponsor of that proposal here in the Senate, with my friend and colleague, Orrin Hatch, we are clearly strongly in support of PDUFA. We tried to take similar action with regard to the medical device industry, but we were unable to do that. But we were able to accomplish it with the pharmaceutical industry, and it is necessary to have this extension. 
The House will take up the FDA. We will continue to work with the administration, and with the leaders of the Energy and Commerce Committees in the House to make sure the compromises reached in the Senate are retained or improved. We will work to make sure that the medical device issue that we have been debating on the Senate floor is fixed. 
We believe that the Food and Drug Administration should not be faced with a situation where a device is submitted with a label that contains false and misleading information that would effectively deny FDA an opportunity to review the device on its real uses. And deny them the authority to require the medical device company to provide information relevant to the safety of that medical device. 
There is nothing that we have heard that changes my very view that the interests of the American consumer and the American public are best protected by strengthening the lead agency for safety--the Food and Drug Administration. The agency to which all Americans turn when they find that there is tampering with pharmaceuticals, or they are concerned about the importation of pesticides on grapes from Chile, or they are concerned about drugs and medical devices. We saw that across the country this last week with the fen/phen tragedy. 
Now we are being asked to reduce the protections for the American people by prohibiting this lead agency, with all its expertise, from protecting the public when it comes to medical devices. We are handcuffing them from being able to reach out and protect the American public when a medical device is falsely labeled. That is a serious error on our part. 
A great deal of discussion has taken place in the committee and out here on the floor of the U.S. Senate as to the FDA's ability to approve medical devices in a timely manner. We heard it expressed this morning. We heard. `Just look how bad the FDA really is.' We have to accept this provision because it is going to make such a difference to the patients that need these medical devices. 
Let us look at what the record has been with regard to the FDA. 
If you go through the GAO study on the FDA and its approval record, the progress that has been made in the recent time is truly remarkable. I have it here. This shows the review times that have been decreasing, starting in 1994, continuing 1995, and 1996. This is the General Accounting Office. 
The premarket notification 501, the median FDA review time for notification as judged to be equivalent devices already on the market has dropped consistently from 199 days to 95 days in 1996. Look at that difference between 1993 and 1996. The time reduced from 199 days to more than half for the medical devices that are the substantial equivalent. 
Here is the premarket approvals. Those take longer than the 
premarket notifications because the FDA reviews the substantial amount of evidence to determine if the devices are safe and effective. The median time for PMA has dropped from 766 days in 1993 to 280 days in 1996. Again, a 40 percent reduction of the time--a dramatic improvement in the most complicated medical devices that are new; to convince the FDA with the range of different new technologies that are coming and that are being implanted in people. We have reduced that time for clearance on the newest devices that have to be tested carefully and evaluated in terms of their safety. We have dropped the time by about 35 or 40 percent. Approval times have been reduced and we still have the best safety record. We are seeing dramatic improvement in approval time for the most complicated medical devices, and we are seeing dramatic improvement in approval times for the kinds of medical devices that are substantially equivalent. And we still have a strong safety record. But that isn't enough for the medical device industry. They are refusing to support an amendment which would permit the FDA to look at the safety features of medical devices that ought to be looked at. 
It would be an entirely different matter if these improvements had not been made. At least you would have an argument to say you needed dramatic changes in the approval process. But the time it takes for the newest kinds of medical devices are improving dramatically. 
We heard on the floor of the Senate, `Well, we have to be able to get these devices out there because all of us are aware of how fast those devices are being approved in Europe. If we do not accept this provision, all our medical device companies are going to go abroad. We are going to lose jobs. This is an issue of jobs. We will take a chance with the health of the American people on this so we can keep our industry here and protect our public.' 
Well, let's look at the facts on this one. We have just had the GAO report of June 1997 showing the remarkable progress that is being made in terms of approving these devices while still doing comprehensive examinations of the complex safety issues. They can evaluate the new kinds of safety information provided by the medical device industry, and do it in a timely way, and protect the public. That is what Senator Reed and myself believe should be done with regard to this provision. 
Madam President, this is a May 12, 1997 document by the World Medical Device Diagnostic News. 
This is April 21, 1997. 
I will include the relevant parts in the Record. But I am reading now:  
France calls on EU to tighten device controls. In a letter to the European Council of Ministers, the French government has called for tighter controls over high-risk medical devices. The government is particularly concerned about implantable devices and other products that fall into the high-risk categories, class 3, class 2. 
The letter which was sent to other EU member states has not been released publicly. It forms part of the French campaign of ever-increasing intensity for more stringent relations on medical devices. France is also questioning the validity of the European approach to the regulation of products that pose a high risk to health. 
Then in another section talking again about the European Union, industry experts speculate the French might argue on the basis of the results and the question of medical device directors being unable to cope with the high-risk products. 
These are storm warnings with regard to the use of high-risk products--storm warnings from our European friends about what is happening over there with their medical device industry. Then we heard here, `Well, those may be high risk but we are only looking at low risk devices.' Low risk? The list of the products that are being suggested as low risk: Ventilators, fetal cardiac monitors, imaging devices, MRI ultrasound, x-ray. Who wants to take chances about whether the ultrasound that an expectant mother is having is 
going to do the job or not? We think that is a low risk? We don't think that mother ought to be able to get satisfactory information about the adequacy of the protection and the soundness of x rays and CAT scans and ultrasound and MRI's, imaging devices. Low risk? Anesthesia machines. Low risk? We have the storm warnings about what is happening in our own country. 
Here is the February Business Outlook for the Medical Device Link. Here is their cover story February 1997:  
With the improvements in FDA product review performance, despite an ever more challenging domestic market, device company executives are more optimistic than ever. 
They talk about the FDA being cited by many as the leading source of their pessimism. 
While nearly as many blamed the disconcerting restructuring of health care providers, two years later--that is now. This is going back to 1994 and 1995. 
`* * * two years later device company executives report a substantial improvement in FDA's performance, particularly in the 510(k) product approval times. 
This is the medical device industry document. It continues. 
In fact, this year's survey conducted last October marks the highest business climate ratings ever in the 5-year history of the survey. 
The highest degree of approval rating ever in the 5-year history. 
It is going well, my friends. We do not have a Shiley Heart Valve tragedy today. We don't have a Dalkon Shield tragedy today. It is working in terms of protecting the public. But the industry is demanding changes in providing the protection. Why? This is what the industry is saying about the FDA. `The impact of FDA's internal reforms and review time is more significant than might appear. The agency has not only reduced the approval delays that slowed newer products but, perhaps more importantly, has greatly reduced uncertainty as to the timeliness of future product introductions.' 
I will include the appropriate amount of this. I will not take up the whole record, although it is a fairly short document. 
It continues along: Respondents' rating of the current business climate for the medical device. Here are the results. A substantial majority of medical device executives said, medical device industry, good or excellent. 
Then it has executive ratings of device industry business climate, 1993 to 1997: 58 percent good or excellent. Last year it was 58 to 11. Find me an agency of Government where those who are being covered by the regulators are saying 58 percent approval, 11 percent disapproval. An examination of this review shows that it was down just in 1995, 37 to 23--37 percent approval, 23 percent disapproval. Now that disapproval has gone from 23 to 12 to 11 in 1997 and the 37 is up to 58 in 2 years. This is the reflection of those who are involved in medical device businesses. 
`Expectation of respondents for business conditions in the medical device and diagnostic industry,' again, going up, enormously favorable. 
`One important cause of this year's improved outlook is the clearly perceived improvement in relations with the FDA. As shown in figure 5'--that will be in the Record--`the decline in complaints about the agency mirrors the increase in positive business outlooks.' 
You could not get a greater endorsement. You could not find better support for an agency that is being regulated. You could not see a more dramatic improvement in how that agency has been dealing with those that it is required to police. And all while still protecting the public health, all being done to protect the public health. As the Secretary of HHS and the President of the United States said, of all the different provisions, this is the one that puts the public health at risk. All against a background of a device industry that is saying things have never been better. 
Several committee members have expressed concerns that the FDA will try to think of every possible off-label use for a device and harass the industry to death. There is no justification for that attitude. It is good rhetoric, but it just defies any kind of understanding about what is happening in the medical device industry today. The medical device manufacturers and personnel find that their relationship with the FDA is improving significantly in terms of how they are being treated, the times that are involved, the way that the agency has been considering various applications like the ones we have been talking about. The public health is being protected, but we are being asked to change it. 
How many times around here do you hear, `If it is not broke, why fix it?' Well, this is the attempt to try to fix something that is not broke. And we are not talking about widgets here. We are talking about real health implications to the American public. 
Why should we take a chance on people's health when those medical devices are being carefully tailored and designed technologically to do something that is different than is on the label? It just defies me. That is the issue. 
So, as we go on through this survey report, talking about international markets: `Just as outlooks on business are influenced by market segments, so, too, they are affected by geographical markets. In fact, large companies have a clear advantage over small ones in entering foreign markets. Of the companies surveyed, 91 percent were selling to the United States, just over half were doing business in Europe and Canada, while 36 
to 40 percent were in Latin America. Of the largest companies surveyed within the various'--$50 million in annual revenues, 90 percent or more were involved in the survey and they show here when asked what markets offered them the best prospects in 1997, more respondents, 80 percent, named the United States than any other market. This are the medical device companies from Central and South America talking about what they believe the greatest opportunity for market expansion is in the United States, and they are going to have to meet the strict requirements that are being put out by the FDA. They think, even going through those requirements for safety and ensuring the public is going to be protected, that there is this dramatic opportunity for growth. 
And it just continues. If we go through the Medical Economics magazine of this year, January, it talks about the enormous explosion of the various devices, talking of the demand for devices to treat arteriosclerosis, enlarged prostates, infertility and many others creates a worldwide market of $120 billion, including about $50 billion in the United States. That's growing by 8 percent annually. Feeding this demand are technologies that offer new ways to treat disease, allow doctors to treat illness more quickly, effectively and safely. The coronary stint, for example, created a submarket that exploded from $220 million globally to more than $1 billion in 1996. Sales of this device are growing 30 to 40 percent. 
I used that as one of the examples here the other day. This is a $1 billion industry. We are talking about the power of this industry to put pressure on Congress, with this kind of economic power, that pressure is dramatic. To resist that kind of pressure when it is contrary to the protection of the public health I think is enormously important. 
What we are saying is simple and fundamental. That is, the proposal that is being advanced here will permit the medical device industry to submit various medical devices to the FDA and the FDA will be limited to examining only the uses listed on the label of the medical devices. If it is substantially equivalent to a medical device that's been approved, all the company has to be able to show is that it has the same kind of safety protections that the earlier device had, even though--even though--it is the intention of the medical device manufacturer to use that medical device for an entirely different purpose and market it for an entirely different purpose, the FDA is prohibited from examining the safety features. 
Maybe those safety features are such that they will significantly improve the health and well-being of the person that is using the medical device, but we ought to make sure at least that the agency has the information that would justify that utilization. All this is happening against a background which demonstrates that the medical device industry is happier with the FDA than at any time in the history of the 20 years, 23 years, of medical device legislation. Happier that there has been a dramatic improvement in approval timeframes, important improvement in terms of safety. We are taking that excellent record and risking it with this particular provision. It does not make sense. 
This makes absolutely no sense at all. We strongly believe that this provision has to be altered or changed. We have missed the opportunity to do that on this particular legislation, but we will have further opportunities to do so in the near future. 
It is amazing to me, as we went through consideration and as we were able to make progress on so many other items while advancing public health, but the medical device industry does not want to deal with this one. They felt they had the votes. They had them this afternoon. But this is a long road. It is a long road, the completion of this whole process, and we are going to fight every step of the way. We have seen a variety of different options that would attend the kind of concerns that the medical device industry has put expressed, which we and the FDA and the administration were prepared to deal with, but the device industry is unprepared and unwilling to do so. 
So if they are unwilling, we are unwilling at least to roll over. There are a variety of different procedures which we will have to resort to in order to make sure that this threat to the public health of the American people does not go forward over the objections of those who are in the best position and do represent the patients and the consumers. 
By accepting this change in the protections available to the American public at this time, we are not saying that the health of the American people is going to be advanced. If this particular provision remains unchanged, a provision which effectively handcuffs the FDA, it is the bottom line of the medical device companies that will be enhanced. And ethical companies and the protection of the American people will suffer. 
That makes absolutely no sense. It is basically and fundamentally wrong, and we will continue the battle ahead.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to introduce President Clinton's proposal for the reauthorization of title V of the Higher Education Act. The goal of this important legislation is to improve the quality of teacher preparation programs and to bring more qualified teachers into America's classrooms, particularly in the areas of highest need. 
Investing in teachers is an investment in the Nation's children and its future. The Nation is clearly committed to the highest quality training for our doctors, engineers, and attorneys, both in their initial training and in subsequent professional development opportunities. President Clinton is right to ask us to make that same commitment to the training of teachers who are charged with educating the Nation's most precious resource--our children. Not since the Teacher Corps initiatives of the 1970's has the Federal Government given such high priority to teaching and teachers. Through inaction, the Nation has tacitly condoned low standards in too many schools, particularly in urban and rural areas. Through inaction, we have left too many of these schools understaffed and unsupported. We must recognize the urgency of this situation and act now. 
In other initiatives, we are already asking teachers to ensure that children meet high standards, but we are not asking whether teachers are ready to meet this challenge. Because of the shortage of teachers, many educators are forced to teach subjects outside their certification area. This shortage is especially serious in communities with high concentrations of students from low-income families. Annually, more than 50,000 underprepared teachers enter the classroom. One in four new teachers do not fully meet State certification requirements, and 12 percent of new hires have had not teacher training at all. Students in inner-city schools have only a 50-percent chance of being taught by a qualified science or math teacher. In Massachusetts, 30 percent of teachers in high-poverty schools do not even have a minor degree in their field. 
This gap is unacceptable. Teachers must have a strong knowledge base in their subject area, so that they can motivate young learners and teach strong basic skills. Teachers must be comfortable with topics, so that they encourage extended thinking and questioning on issues. Teachers must also have opportunities to improve their own skills, learn how to integrate technology, and employ strategies that encourage all students to achieve. 
Clearly, we must invest in better teacher preparation, do all we can to ensure that all of our schools are fully staffed with qualified teachers. We must attract the best and the brightest new teachers to adequately prepare students to compete in the global marketplace. During the next decade, because of rising student enrollment and massive teacher retirement, the Nation will need over 2 million new teachers. But teacher preparation programs are currently producing between 100,000 and 150,000 new teachers a year, leaving the system with an annual deficit of at least 50,000 teachers, particularly in underserved, high-poverty schools. 
The Federal Government, through the Eisenhower Professional Development Program, already invests in upgrading the skills of current teachers, but the investment is far from sufficient. In addition, we must invest in the front end of teacher training, to ensure that the Nation's children are taught by highly qualified, well informed teachers. The President's proposal will help improve teacher preparation and bring well-qualified teachers into more classrooms. 
The legislation addresses these issues by encouraging strong partnerships among institutions of higher education with exemplary teacher preparation programs, other institutions that want to improve their programs, and the school districts that they serve. The program would be authorized at $67 million for fiscal year 1999. A Lighthouse Partnership Program will identify lead institutions from the variety of successful teacher preparation programs that now exist. These programs provide aspiring teachers with the newest information about the best classroom practices, and give them the concrete clinical experiences they need to develop the skills to help students achieve high standards. 
State and local education agencies, community colleges, and other professional groups will participate as partner institutions. The lead institutions will demonstrate their strength in cutting-edge, clinically based teacher preparation and course content. They must also demonstrate that they are committed to strong ongoing cooperation with school districts that serve needy families in rural and urban America. 
A second major part of the President's proposal focuses on recruiting the best and the brightest teachers to serve in needy school districts. It supports partnerships between teacher preparation institutions and local education agencies that provide scholarships and other assistance to students who complete teacher preparation programs and agree to teach in targeted underserved areas for at least 3 years. 
President Clinton's proposal is far-reaching, and it discusses broad bipartisan support. The United States is in urgent need of creating and maintaining a stronger supply of world-class teachers. These wise investments will provide high-quality opportunities today to the teachers who will be teaching the Nation's children tomorrow. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to enact this major teacher recruitment and training proposal.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to just respond briefly to some of the points that have been made and then to get into the substance of the argument. I want to reiterate the importance of this particular provision. There are those who are trying to dismiss it as a relatively unimportant part of this legislation, and saying that we really didn't bring this issue to the attention of the committee until the final hours, therefore, we could not have been serious about it. Of course, this is completely untrue. 
I won't take the time to put in the Record the agenda for June 17 where this was listed in `items under discussion' on section 4 of the labeling claims. This was exactly the matter that was brought up in the markup in June. It was identified by the Secretary of HHS in the June 11 letter to the committee. It was repeated on September 5. Secretary Shalala identified the very few items that she would recommend that the President veto this legislation about. She listed the environmental issue, the elimination of the environmental impact statement. Another one was a technical amendment dealing with PDUFA. A third item was the cosmetic provisions. But this is the provision that was identified by the principal protector of the American people's health as the most important provision in terms of adverse effects to public health, this provision. Let's understand that right from the beginning. 
I know that my colleagues say, well, there are only a couple of Members of this body that are really concerned about this particular provision. Well, it is interesting that, time in and time out, the No. 1 person in the administration that has the principal responsibilities for protecting the American health has said this is it, this is the provision. With all due respect to those who say this is a low-risk issue that doesn't matter, that this is a technical question and we should just get through this business and get on with the vote, these arguments should be disregarded, 
because this is an enormously important issue. It was raised during the course of the markup back in June, and identified by the Secretary of HHS during the course of the summer. Many people were briefed by the Secretary indicating her priorities and this was right out there. It is in the papers submitted by her in September as being the primary technical concern in regard to safety for the American people. That might not make a difference to some Senators but it ought to make a difference to the American people. And it is not just the Secretary who is concerned about this provision. We have virtually every single group of health professionals charged with protecting the consumers' interests have expressed concern about this issue--the President of the United States, the Secretary of HHS, the Consumer Federation, the National Women's Health Network, the National Order for Rare Disorders. Who are these groups and individuals? They are the very people that benefit from innovations in medical devices. They are the people whose lives are enhanced. They are ones who are saying, `No, don't do this. Support the Reed amendment.' 
I am glad to listen to my colleagues. I am interested in the number of people employed by these companies. I am interested in what a great job a company does. I am interested in the opinion of some of our colleagues who say, `Well, this really isn't such an important measure because there are only a few people out there who oppose it.' 
Go down the list of the organizations that are out there protecting the people that will benefit most from progress in these areas, and they say, `Don't do this. Support the Reed amendment.' Do they make the judgment that this is not important just because it deals only with class II devices--the relatively low risk devices. There has been the suggestion here on the floor of the Senate that these are virtually low-risk devices. 
These are some of the devices: Ventilators. Low-risk? Who has not been in the hospital with a member of their family and hasn't understood the importance of making sure that ventilators are going to perform as they are labeled? 
You have digital mammography with possibilities of missing tumors in women with breast cancer. We want to make sure that these devices are going to be safe and do what they are represented and designed to do--not just what is listed on the label. 
You have the fetal cardiac monitors that monitor infants. 
I saw them working yesterday in Springfield at the Bay State Fetal Center in one of the greatest neonatal centers in this country. 
Do you want to take a chance on fetal cardiac monitors? Or on surgical lasers? 
The list goes on--these are class II devices, low risk. We are not talking about tongue depressors. We are not talking about bedpans. We are talking about the kinds of items where we need to make sure they are going to be safe and effective. That is why these organizations whose job it is to protect the public are concerned. 
With all respect to my colleague and friend from Connecticut, who I heard state three times that these products, which have not been approved for safety and effectiveness for the uses for which they are being advertised, are not being mislabeled. And that we shouldn't dispute or cast aspersions on the good, legitimate name of the U.S. Surgical Corp. 
Mr. President, I have right here the letter from Dr. Monica Morrow, professor of surgery at Northwestern University School of Law, dated September 22.  
Dear Senator Kennedy: 
I am writing you to express my feelings regarding the importance of the FDA's mandate to evaluate behind the scene use of devices and drugs. The need for such evaluation is clearly exemplified by the marketing strategy of U.S. Surgical's breast biopsy device. This device was approved as a diagnostic instrument. However, the company video clearly depicts the use of the device for definitive breast cancer therapy with no clinical trial using the accepted technology for comparing cancer treatments that have been conducted to evaluate this claim, and without such trials the device could potentially pose a significant risk to patients. 
In addition, other claims regarding approved cosmetic outcome and patient acceptance are similarly unsubstantiated. The indication for use of the devices and drugs should be determined by appropriate clinical and scientific data, and not by their appeal as a marketing gimmick. This video was dropped off at my office by a company representative as part of an effort to interest me in purchasing the company equipment. 
I have it right here. For people who doubt it, take a minute and watch the video. Read the letter. Call Dr. Morrow. 
It is being marketed out there today. This is what we are talking about. That is the issue. When colleagues get up and say, `Well, it has not been, and it won't be, and that is wrong if it is?' I say, `It is being done.' And that is exactly the problem that we are attempting to address. 
Mr. President, this is an enormously significant and important health issue. This body has taken many actions on medical devices since the mid-1970's to enhance public health the protections since the mid-1970's that enhanced protections for public health. This provision which will create a loophole through which unscrupulous manufacturers of a medical device will be able to drive a truck is the exception to that commendable history. This provision will make a mockery of the substantial equivalence requirement, and will allow irresponsible companies to go out, as this company has, and advertise and represent a particular product for a purpose and use that differs from the one they put on the label. 
Mr. President, it was interesting that some of our colleagues addressing the Reed amendment pointed out that there are two ways of approving the medical device. Only about 5 percent medical devices use this particular provision, the premarket approval. That provision says, `In making the determination whether to approve or deny * * * the Secretary shall rely on the conditions of use included in the proposed labeling as the basis for determining whether or not there is a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, if the proposed labeling is neither false nor misleading. In determining whether or not such labeling is false or misleading, the Secretary shall fairly evaluate all the material facts pertinent to the proposed labeling.' 
Mr. President, I daresay that there is probably a less compelling reason to use the proposed labeling as `neither false nor misleading' in this provision because you are going to have such a survey in an oversight for new materials as it is in the other provision. 
What the proposal that is before us now, the one that is for 95 percent of all devices, says is, `* * * the determination of the Secretary under this subsection * * * with respect to the intended use shall be based on the intended use included in the proposed labeling.' 
I would like to point out to those that have suggested here on the floor that the intended use is a subjective decision to be made by the FDA, that isn't what the legislation says. It says, `* * * the determination of the Secretary under this * * * section with respect to the' * * * device `* * * shall be based on the intended use included in the * * * labeling.' 
Who makes up the labeling? The manufacturer has the labeling `submitted a report under this section.' 
The only thing the amendment of Senator Reed is proposing is that the FDA be restricted to looking solely at the labeled use only in instances where `* * * the proposed labeling is neither false nor misleading.' 
How can anyone be opposed to that? 
We have just seen the example of the approval of a biopsy needle for one particular purpose--taking the biopsy. Then we find that this similar machine is represented as being for the 
purpose of biopsies, here it is in their advertisement--the latest technique in minimally evasive breast biopsy. This device takes 50 times the amount of material as the other one. Here it is being advertised in Canada. Here it is being advertised in the United States--not for use in biopsies but to remove the tumor itself. And there is no information available to the Food and Drug Administration about how good or safe the device is for that use. Maybe it does work. We are not here to say it doesn't work. We just want the company to have to provide the information that says it does work. If that is what you are going to use it for, why should the Food and Drug Administration, which has the responsibility of protecting Americans, be limited by the language of this particular legislation that says you can only look at what is on the label? When, at the same time, they have letters from doctors and they have videotapes that show it is being used for an entirely different purpose. 
That is the issue. The Reed amendment says, OK, we are willing to only look at the use on the label, but let's just make sure that we are not going to encourage false and misleading labeling. 
Is the Senate of the United States going to say to the FDA that if even if they know that the labeling is false and misleading that they should be prevented from protecting the American public? 
That is what you are going to do if you do not accept the Reed amendment. That is what this debate is about. It is as simple as that. 
Here we have this extraordinary example, where you have a biopsy machine that is supposed to take a biopsy about the size of the lead in that pencil versus something that takes 50 times the amount and the purposes for it is intended to be used are quite different, as mentioned here in the letter which says, `I am expressing my feelings * * * the importance of the FDA mandate.' 
`The video was dropped off at my office' with the interest of purchasing the equipment. 
When the FDA became aware that the company was promoting the device for this unauthorized purpose, it also became aware that it had made a mistake in clearing a device that was clearly designed for a purpose not stated on the labeling--tumor removal for clinical testing. The FDA then acted to require the company to include a strong label that the device was only to be used for tissue sampling; not tumor excision. 
I cannot imagine why the company failed to give the full information on that. But, nonetheless, that is what is happening. 
Mr. President, I listened with interest to many of our colleagues talking about how there really are no dangers in terms of medical devices, that my examples are not really what this issue is all about. They are mistaken. 
We are committed to ensuring that these kinds of circumstances will not occur in the future. That is why we are out here. We don't have to go through another incidence similar to the Dalkon shield where 18 women died from a perforated uterus and 2,700 women suffered miscarriages. We don't want to go through another episode like the Shiley heart valve one where a change in the angle of the valve would have changed the way the device interacted with the heart raised questions as to its safety. The FDA discovered this and refused to let it go to market in the United States. But the modified device was marketed in Europe and 15 times the number of people died using the new device over the earlier one. With all respect to those who say how much better the system is in other countries--15 times the deaths. And the whole toxic shock issue that we raised and its impact on American women. 
What we are pointing out is that there are dangers that can take place in our country, that affect our people, when you start fiddling around with safety and effectiveness and medical devices. 
That is the issue. 
There are those who say, `Look. We have a little loophole. But it really isn't quite the same as it is with some of these other terrible kinds of situations.' 
We have given the illustration of the kinds of challenges that are out there today. 
There are the laser technologies, 
cutting tissue laser technologies, where you have submitted to the FDA a laser that, everyone who has really looked at it agrees, is going to be used for prostate surgery. But there is virtually no information as to the safety and effectiveness of that particular medical device for that use--none. That is what happens. 
There are the various digital mammography devices that may be very good for obtaining diagnostic information and evaluating a particular tumor but may be questionable for screening purposes. Questionable as to there effectiveness in allowing women to know whether they are going to have the first indications of a small tumor. Don't we want to be sure that this isn't what it is going to be used for? Don't we know what they are out there marketing this for and how well it performs? 
We have just seen in the period of the last 5 days, the example of the terrible events concerning the off-label use of the drug fen/phen--and the health hazards and challenges faced by the people who have used it. 
Are we here today saying we don't want to include language in this bill that will allow the FDA to be able to look at safety of medical devices if they find the labeling is false and misleading? We have offered five different compromises to work this out. It is the No. 1 concern of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the No. 1 concern by the FDA. I have listened here in the Chamber, to those who oppose this amendment who say the FDA has all the authority in the world to protect the public. I have quotes here from Senators who have said, in effect, that we should not be bothered by this because the FDA has all the power it needs and that this is really not a problem. 
I was tempted to take the language of their quotes and offer it as an amendment because their description of the FDA is not what the law is and will be if this legislation is passed. We would have taken the kinds of protections that were implied by their quotes. Where they say, look, they have the real right to go behind if they think there is some kind of question in terms of safety. 
The FDA would not have that authority under this bill as written. But if it is your understanding and that is what you want, let's take an amendment and ensure that they do. 
But we do not have that opportunity. We are faced with the real possibility for a situation where the FDA does not believe it has the power and the authority to protect the American consumer. The FDA does not believe it has authority. If they know that the predominant use is going to be other than that which is listed on the label and which could provide a substantial threat to the American people, the FDA will not have the power or the authority to protect the American public. 
Members of Congress can come out here and say, `Oh, yes, they do.' I have listened to that argument. `Oh, I don't know why everyone is getting so worked up about it. You know, they really do have the authority.' 
They do not have it. The FDA itself states they do not. They have testified they do not. The President does not believe it. The Secretary of HHS does not believe it. The consumer groups do not believe it. National Women's Health Network does not believe it, the Consumer Federation, the Patients Coalition. 
We have had this discussion and debate for a number of days. We believe we are finally getting through. But where are all the consumer calls saying, `Look, let's go with what is proposed in the legislation. We have read the record. We have looked at the law. We believe the FDA is out there and can protect the American public. I don't know what everybody is getting worked up about.' 
But we aren't getting those calls because virtually every consumer group that has looked at this issue, has discovered that the language in the bill will not provide adequate protection for consumers. 
National Women's Health Network: `Women need the FDA to act as a safety sieve screening out drugs and devices that are hazardous and defective. If 404 is enacted, a device manufacturer 
could label its product for a very simple use. The FDA would be limited to ask for safety and effectiveness for that use only.' 
The groups understand this issue, and they are concerned. `Even if it were clear from the device's technical characteristics that it might be used for other more riskier purposes.' 
That is the biopsy needle. You have a needle that is 50 times larger than is necessary for a biopsy and you have the clear evidence from doctors, both in this country and abroad, who have seen the videotape that the company is out there marketing it for a different use. We have it right here--a slick promotion for this particular issue. All we are saying is if the FDA is able to show that the labeling is false and misleading, they can look at safety.

I say that that is a promotional document. I would suggest the Senator watch it before he represents that it is not. It has the U.S. Surgical logo on it. We have the doctors who claim this is the case. The FDA has been going after U.S. Surgical. 
That is another issue. It is an important issue. FDA ought to be concerned about it, and they are. But that doesn't get away from what the FDA may not be able to do sometime in the future. They won't be able to do it in the future, because all the FDA will have the power to do is look at what is on the label.

Mr. KENNEDY. That is just the part I am going to mention. 
Let me quote some extracts because that is the issue that is before us--the extracts of the promotion. This is the promotion that some do not think is being promoted by U.S. Surgical, even though its logo is on it, even though doctors have said it is being distributed by company representatives. 
This is the quote: 
U.S. Surgical is entering a new millennium in breast surgery by combining advanced stereotactic technology with minimal invasive surgery. 
Not biopsy, surgery. 
Unlike needle biopsies where small samples of the lesion are removed for pathological analysis, U.S. Surgical removes the entire specimen. 
That sounds like an operation to me. 
If the specimen proves to be cancerous but pathology reports the entire margin is clear, its up to the clinical judgment of the surgeon to decide to remove the additional tissue, or if the procedure can be considered complete. 
Translated, if you use this device and you take out the tumor, then it is the doctor who removes the tumor who makes the judgment whether he has to do any other surgery. That is not a biopsy needle. It continues.

Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is not correct. The FDA is out there looking into this, and it doesn't do much good to try to cloud up the issue as to what the purported purpose of this particular medical device is. 
Here is what is in the ad. I say again, I wish the Senator would look at the ad, rather than just reading the U.S. Surgical statements on it. This is what their ad says: 
Minimal invasive breast surgery. A new standard of patient care offered only by United States Surgical Corporation. 
That is what the ad says. It doesn't say minimal invasive biopsy; it says breast surgery. 
Maybe that is a new way of doing it. Maybe that is the best way that has ever been devised for protecting American women in terms of breast tumors. But the FDA does not have one sentence of proof or evidence from U.S. Surgical that provides data on the safety and effectiveness on this method of removing a tumor that 
other medical devices should provide. They have the biopsy needle. It is effectively the size of this pencil. They want one that is 50 times larger. You don't have to have a lot of sense to know what this is all about. 
Maybe U.S. Surgical convinced the Senator from Connecticut. But the documents and their promotional materials indicate what they are about, and that is to provide for removal of tumors from American women, one out of seven, who have breast cancer. And doctors who see, `Approved by the FDA,' then tell their patient this has been approved by the FDA, that it must be safe, and so they undergo tumor removal with this device. These women are entitled to adequate protection, to know whether that device was safe in removing that tumor. They do not know that today. 
And that is just the tip of the iceberg. You know about all the other kinds of medical devices that can fall within this category. We have mentioned some, like the mammography screening machines that may misdiagnose breast cancer. All this amendment says is, you cannot, if you are a medical device company, submit false and misleading information. I can say it another way, `Do you want false and misleading information on the labeling?' If you vote against our amendment, that is what you are going to be pegged with. We are going to be characterized as not caring if labels are false and misleading. 
Why can't we say we will support the labeling as long as it is not false and misleading? That doesn't sound like an extraordinary or revolutionary concept. This is basically what we are arguing about. Those who are opposed to us say, `All right, let them provide false and misleading information.' That is the other side of this argument. If they are not going to go through this kind of loophole, to promote it for some other reason, what do they have to fear? 
Mr. President, there are all kinds of technologies out there that are just on the cusp, ready to go on ahead through this particular kind of loophole. You have the mammography screening machines that have not been certified for use in screening. The manufacturers have not been provided information on that use. We know the difficulty we have faced in terms of mammography machinery and false negatives and false positives. 
Are we going to come out on the side of protecting American women on breast cancer, or are we going to say we are going support whatever any medical device company wants to do, no matter how false and misleading that information may be? The vast majority of manufacturers won't use this loophole. But you don't hear the arguments here about what the financial benefit will be to those companies that will not have to conduct the exhaustive tests for safety and efficacy. They will be at a competitive advantage over the other medical device companies that are trying to do it right.

Mr. KENNEDY. In a second. Because there will be those in those corporate boardrooms who will say, look, our competitor is getting in through this particular labeling device loophole. All you have to do is change the label a little bit. We will be able to do it as well. We can avoid the time it will take to do it right, we will save a good deal of our resources. We will get on the market sooner, we will beat the competitor, we will be on the shelves sooner. 
We can use what U.S. Surgical did, where they denied--denied--that they were promoting it, and yet they had some other group that was putting promoting it with their logo, talking about using it for an entirely different purpose. 
That is the issue. This is not a very complex issue. We heard earlier about sifting out the chaff and moving to the substance on this. This is it. 
What woman in this country who is facing having a tumor removed from her breast by a medical device believes that device is a low risk device? What mother that looks over a sick child in the hospital and sees a ventilator, thinks that ventilator is low risk? That is the reason that the Secretary of HHS, the President of the 
United States, virtually every consumer group, every patients' group, every group that will benefit the most by this kind of innovative progress in terms of medical devices, are saying don't do this. Don't play with our future health, don't pass that provision without this language. That is what they are telling us here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
We have been out here with five different sets of language ready to compromise. But, they won't compromise, they have the votes. They say, `We have the votes. We have the profits that are going to come from it.' They will profit over their competition. Other hard-working, decent, ethical medical device companies that are trying to play by the rules, trying to get their product in--are going to think, `Why not? Why not go ahead and do it the other way? Our competitors are doing it and beating the pants off of us.' 
I have just a few moments and I will be glad to yield the floor. 
The question is, will the Senate vote in favor of approving medical devices based on false or misleading labels? Will the Senate allow dangerous medical devices that have not been tested for safety and effectiveness to be foisted on the American people? Will companies like U.S. Surgical Corp. be rewarded for deceiving the FDA? Will the Senate put a higher value on the profits of the powerful than the health of the American people? 
Section 404 of the FDA bill requires the FDA to approve a medical device based on the user claim on the label submitted by the manufacturer, even if that label is false or misleading. It prevents the FDA from requiring the manufacturers to show their product is safe and effective for the purposes for which it will really be used--as opposed to the purpose falsely claimed on the label. 
It stands 20 years of progress toward safer and more effective medical devices on its head. 
Nothing better shows the need for the Reed-Kennedy amendment than the recent history of the advanced breast biopsy instrumentation system, a device developed and marketed by the U.S. Surgical Corp. This attempt to mislead the FDA and foist an untested machine on women with breast cancer shows why it is critical that section 404 not be passed in its current form.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 50 minutes. 
Mr. President, this morning we continue the discussion of one of the most important and one of the most controversial and I believe one of the most dangerous provisions of S. 830. We are hopeful that we will be able to garner the attention of the Members of the Senate to support an amendment that will be offered and voted on Tuesday next that will address this dangerous provision that puts the American consumer at risk. 
At the outset, I want to mention that those of us who are concerned about this particular provision are many. The Department of Health and Human Services, which is the principal agency of our National Government responsible for the health and safety of the American people, is strongly opposed to section 404, and supports the position that I have taken here today. 
Other groups opposed to section 404. Those groups that are opposed to the provision also include the Patients' Coalition, which represents patients from all over this country, a real grassroots organization that understands, at the grassroots level, or the Main Street level, the dangers that this particular provision will mean unless we address it; the Consumer Federation of America; the National Women's Health Network; the National Organization for Rare Disorders; the American Public Health Association, which is charged with protecting the public health of Americans; the Consumers Union, another grassroots organization that looks after the interests of the consumer for a range of different issues and has targeted this particular provision; the Center for Women's Policy Studies; the National Parent Network on Disabilities; the National Association of Social Workers; the Policy Center for Children, Youth and Families; the American Council on Consumer Awareness; and the TMJ Association, they are the victims of the artificial jaw joint group. All of these organizations, and there are many more, are reflecting the anxiety and very deep concern and legitimate concern that consumers have about a particular provision that is included in this legislation, which will effectively handcuff the FDA from looking beyond just the manufacturer's label to get to the bottom line, whether a particular device which has a manufacturer's label is really going to be both marketed and utilized in such a way as to pose a serious and grievous health hazard to the American consumer. 
I think the National Women's Health Network states the situation very well. I will just take a moment, before getting into the principal reasons for hoping that we will be able to alter and change this provision on Tuesday next, to read it, because it really summarizes the concerns of, in this case, the National Women's Health Network representing the millions of women across this country.  
On behalf of the 13,000 individual and 300 organized members of the National Women's Health Network, I am writing to express our continued opposition to S. 830 because of the serious implications this legislation has for our Nation's women. The network is extremely concerned that section 404 prevents the FDA from requiring medical device companies to perform complete reviews of the safety and effectiveness of a medical device. This provision must be amended to give the FDA the authority to verify that the label used is not false or misleading. 
That is what we are talking about this morning, labeling, by the manufacturing company, of a medical device, that is false and misleading. The amendment which we will offer next Tuesday will say that when FDA finds that the medical device company is filing a false and misleading label, that the FDA will be able to look at the safety considerations of that device in order to protect the 
American consumer. 
The Food and Drug Administration has a staff of scientists and researchers, individuals who have expert knowledge of different medical devices, whose only purpose is to protect the public. It is that group of individuals that we entrust--we recognize that they are human and are capable of making mistakes, nonetheless, they are the principal agent to trust to protect the American public's health and safety. When we have false and misleading labels by medical device industries, we need to make sure that the FDA scientists and researchers, who are charged with protecting the American public, are going to be able to make a thorough determination as to the safety and the efficacy of the devices. This is the issue. That is what the National Women's Health Network illustrates. The letter continues: 
Women need the FDA to act as a safety sieve, screening out drugs and devices which are hazardous or ineffective. If section 404 were enacted, a device manufacturer could label its product for a very simple use and the FDA would be limited to asking for proof in safety and effectiveness about that use only. Even if it were clear from the device's technical characteristics that it might be used for other, riskier purposes, the FDA would be prevented from looking beyond the conditions of use on the label. 
If we are concerned about protecting the American consumer, this makes no sense. We should not be tying the hands of the FDA when we should be protecting the health of the American consumer. Look at recent history and the medical device disasters that this country has faced. This bill opens the potential for those diasters to be replicated. We all hope they will not be. But one of the principal safeguards for preventing this is the FDA being able to examine the safety of devices. The letter goes on: 
Section 404 is a serious danger to women's health. 
I repeat, this particular section, section 404-- is a serious danger to women's health, which must be fixed before S. 830 is acted upon by the Senate. In light of today's front page coverage of the fen/phen catastrophe, in which women were the victims of off-label drug use, we find it inconceivable that the Senate would pass a bill with this provision. 
There it is. They have it right. We just had the fen/phen disaster, in which scores of individuals have suffered--have perhaps lost their lives--as a result of off-label use. And here we have on the U.S. Senate floor a particular provision that will invite unscrupulous medical device companies not to clearly and accurately state what their medical device is going to be used for. This is the issue. We have scores of other letters, similar to the one I just read, expressing concern about section 404. 
The issues are clear. Will the Senate vote in favor of approving a medical device based on false and misleading labels? Will the Senate allow dangerous medical devices that have not been tested for safety and effectiveness to be foisted on the American people? Will companies like U.S. Surgical Corp. be rewarded for deceiving the FDA? Will the Senate put a higher value on the profits of the powerful than the health of the American people? 
Mr. President, let me point out, that if U.S. Surgical Corp. is able to have their way--if they are allowed to misleadingly label their medical device as being substantially equivalent--they will be virtually guaranteed approval under the language of this bill. Because this bill says that if the medical device is substantially equivalent to one that has been approved and meets those safety requirements, it must be approved. Despite the fact that this corporation, U.S. Surgical Corp., has a device that is being advertised and will be used for an entirely different purpose. A purpose for which it has not been tested for safety. What happens to the ethical companies? What happens to the other medical device companies that are trying to provide safe medical devices? 
They are going to be at a competitive disadvantage because they will come up and say to the FDA, `Look, our device is for this purpose and we have conducted these expensive safety tests.' That is going to cost that company, and it means that their medical device is going to be more expensive. What happens to these other companies when a company like the U.S. Surgical Corp. is able to get in the door without providing safety information, without doing that kind of testing? This is also an issue. 
It is not the most important argument. The most important one is health and safety. If this language is not altered or changed, it will be an invitation for medical device companies all over America to jump through this loophole in order to get their products on line. Will the Senate put a higher value on the profits of the powerful than the health of the American people? 
Section 404 of the bill requires FDA to approve a medical device based on the use claimed on the label submitted by the manufacturer--even if that label is false and misleading. 
Think of it. The FDA will be required to give approval even though the label is false and misleading. Whose interests are we protecting? Are we protecting the American consumers' interests, or are we protecting the profits of the medical device company? The way this law is currently constructed, it will help protect the profits of companies like U.S. Surgical Corp. It prevents the FDA from requiring manufacturers to demonstrate that their product is safe and effective for the purposes for which it will be used as opposed to the purpose falsely claimed on the label. 
It stands 20 years of progress toward safer and more effective medical devices on its head. For 20 years, since 1974, we have tried, through the FDA, to make sure that medical devices are safe and efficacious. This is the first time in over 20 years that we are taking a step backward. We take modest steps forward on the basis of experience, at both the FDA and across the country, to provide additional protections for the American consumer. Now we are faced with the first significant and major step backward. 
Mr. President, to illustrate that, the U.S. Surgical Corp., a large and successful manufacturer of medical devices, submitted a new machine to the FDA for approval. This machine was called the Advanced Breast Biopsy Instrumentation System. The company claimed that the machine was to be used only for taking biopsies of breast tumors suspected of being cancerous. Cancer is a word that any family in America hates to hear. Many Members of this body, many Members of the House of Representatives and so many American families have been touched by cancer. There are few people listening today whose family has not been touched by cancer in some way. With the increasing number of breast cancers, this particular medical device is the most offensive, because the principal disaster is not only contracting cancer, but it is in the failure of being able to diagnose it and treat it effectively. 
What has the U.S. Surgical Corp. done? The company claimed that the machine was to be used only for taking biopsies of breast tumors suspected of being cancerous, but the machine was designed to excise a piece of tissue 50 times as large as other biopsy devices already on the market. It was obvious from the machine's design that it was intended to remove breast cancer tumors, not simply take samples for biopsy. 
Maybe it works. Maybe it is a major breakthrough. Maybe it can do all the things that the U.S. Surgical Corp. says can be done. Wouldn't that be wonderful? But we don't know. Maybe it doesn't. Maybe it doesn't work. Maybe when the doctor says we have excised the tumor, it doesn't do it completely. We don't know. Maybe when that woman walks out of the doctor's office or leaves the hospital, she is still in danger. She believes she has been treated effectively, but maybe this device isn't effective at removing tumors. Then there is the possiblity that in 4 weeks, 5 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 1 1/2 years, the cancer is still present and life and health are still at risk. 
Why are we taking a chance, Mr. President? Because the medical device companies want this provision. 
It was obvious from the machine's design that it was intended to remove breast cancer tumors. In fact, we have obtained a videotape, made in Canada, that demonstrates that the company knew it would be used for that purpose, despite their false claims to the FDA. 
Here you have the U.S. Surgical Corp. saying to the FDA that we have a small biopsy needle the size of the lead in a pencil, that will be used to check a tumor, returning to the FDA for approval of what they label as a substantially equivalent medical device. Under this legislation--even though the company is out advertising that medical device for an entirely different 
purpose, for which they have not provided any health or safety information to the FDA and under this legislation--FDA would have to approve it. Despite the fact the FDA knows the device will be used for another purpose. Under this bill, the FDA could not say, `Provide the information to show that this is safe and effective.' 
This is the example, Mr. President. We are talking about cancer--breast cancer. We are talking about 1 out of 7 women who are going to be affected at some time in their lives. We know the enormous legitimate concerns that women have, that mothers have, that daughters have. And we are going to say we are prepared to allow them to have less than the best protections we can offer? 
Mr. President, under this section of the FDA bill, the FDA would be forced to approve the new device without any evidence on the safety and effectiveness for new uses. American women do not want to die from breast cancer because the companies are allowed to sell devices whose safety and effectiveness have not been demonstrated. 
No Senator would want their wife or mother or daughter to be subjected to such an untested device solely because a greedy company wants higher profits. The issue goes far beyond the products to excise breast cancer. It applies to lasers to treat prostate disease, stems to be placed in carotid arteries, imaging systems to detect breast cancer, and a host of other treatments for dreaded diseases. 
Public health professionals will tell you as we continue to develop new technological advances this problem will only grow along with the threats to public health and safety. We will be rolling the dice. How many people are willing to roll the dice for a member of their family and use a medical device that has not been adequately tested? The companies are out there, Mr. President, and they won't mind if we roll the dice. Are we going to permit that? 
This provision will give unscrupulous companies incentives to lie to the FDA. It will penalize ethical companies who are truthful and doing the necessary testing to demonstrate that their products are safe and effective. Most of all, it will put the health of the American people at risk so that a greedy few can increase profits. Companies that hope to benefit by weakening the FDA are already powerful and profitable. They believe they have the votes to push this disgraceful provision through the Senate--and this morning they probably would have. It is absolutely untenable and outrageous and unnecessary that we would, except to provide additional profits for a company that will use this loophole to get their devices on market earlier. 
If the American people truly understand what is at stake, I do not believe they will permit this dangerous provision to become law. When the vote comes on Tuesday, we will see how many Senators are willing to stand with the American people and how many are willing to vote in favor of false and misleading labels. Let me make it very clear that the Tuesday vote will not be the end of the story. We will continue to fight to keep this provision from becoming law, and I believe we will succeed in the end. The FDA bill has many constructive elements, but this disgraceful provision should be eliminated. The false or misleading label should have no place in the approval of medical devices. Unscrupulous manufacturers do not deserve a free ride at the expense of the public. 
Mr. President, what we are talking about is S. 830, and section 404, which prohibits the FDA from reviewing the safety of a device for uses not listed by the manufacturer. 
This provision handicaps the principal agency of Government that is charged with safety, and we are writing into the law language that will prohibit FDA--which is the agency charged with protecting the American people from unsafe pharmaceutical drugs and medical devices--from doing its job. The FDA would be prohibited from reviewing the safety of a device for uses not listed by the manufacturer. 
What our amendment says is, OK, we'll prohibit the FDA from reviewing the safety of a device for uses not listed by the manufacturer--unless the label is false or misleading. How can Members of this body say that they will refuse to stand with those of us who support the Reed amendment that says `unless the label is false and misleading'? 
We have the example of U.S. Surgical Corp.'s biopsy needle. A needle designed to extract a small amount of cancerous tissue, maybe the size of a pen or the lead of a pencil. Now what has the company done? It has developed a much larger device that may be able to take a biopsy, but which, in fact, is primarily designed for tumor removal. But all they will have to be able to do is show that they are substantially equivalent. 
Under this proposal, the FDA will not be able to look at what the real purpose of this medical device is. We know what the U.S. Surgical Corp.'s real purpose for this medical device is. We know because we have seen the advertisement they have already prepared. This device which can take out 50 times more material than its predecessor--50 times more material--is not intended to be used for a biopsy, but is designed to excise the tumor. Maybe it can do it well, Mr. President. Maybe it is an important and major step forward. But any woman who has a procedure done with this device, will not be able to judge from the safety information that is provided to the FDA because there has been none provided. They won't know the results of testing conducted on this device because there have been no tests submitted to the FDA. They won't know whether this is a successful device because there is no information to indicate its success. 
We are talking about women and breast cancer. We are talking about a medical device that is put forward with virtually no intention for use for biopsies. Where an earlier smaller, less intrusive device already exists for biopsies. A device that is going to be used to remove tumors, and is advertised to doctors as such. 
What are the American doctors supposed to believe? They say, `Well, we have FDA approval.' 
`Well, isn't that fine. Then it must be all right, it must be safe.' 
But no doctor is able to give that kind of assurance to a woman who is going to have this particular medical device utilized to excise a tumor, because it has not been done. How would our amendment change that? Our amendment would say that if the advertising is false or misleading, that anyone would be able to see that this particular device is going to be used to excise a tumor--U.S. Surgical, show us your studies, show us your information that would indicate that this is safe for American women. Show us where you have tested it to show that it does the job. Show us that it will do what you are advertising will be done. 
Let us examine that. And if that is the case, we approve it for that particular purpose. 
This provision is unconscionable, Mr. President, when you look at the tragedies that have resulted from device disasters. We are not talking about Band-Aids and tongue depressors. We have seen medical device disasters which have cost the lives of hundreds and thousands of American consumers. 
I was here and chaired the hearings on the Dalkon shield IUDs, which injured tens of thousands of women. Their injuries included pelvic inflammatory disease, sterility and perforated uteruses. That is because, Mr. President, with the Dalkon shield we found out that bacteria crept through the string of the device and caused infections in American women. 
As a result of this disaster in the mid-1970's we set up protections for the American consumer with regard to medical devices to ensure that they would be safe and efficacious. Prior to the mid-1970's we did not test for safety and efficacy. We want to be able to make sure that the FDA is going to be able to test for safety and efficacy on a product that is going to be the predominant use of a particular medical device. 
In another example of a human and public health tragedy involving a medical device, the firm Telectronics marketed a pacemaker wire for use in the heart. Twenty-five thousand of these pacemakers were marketed, beginning in 1994, before it was discovered that the wire could break, cause damage to the wall of the heart, or even destroy the aorta. 
Why are we being asked in the U.S. Senate to deny the FDA adequate authority to protect the American people? Safe and effective medical devices is what the American public deserve and it is what Senator Reed's amendment to section 404 would ensure. 
Mr. President, another example is patients with defective Shiley heart valves who died, underwent painful and dangerous surgeries to remove the valves. 
The company increased the degree of a particular vent from 60 degrees to 70 degrees. But because FDA had the power to examine whether this presented any additional health hazards to the American people, the modified valve was not marketed in the U.S. The company sold them in Europe. And the modified valve had six times the amount of disasters in the hearts as a result of that 10-percent increase. Hundreds of deaths resulted in Europe and thousands and thousands of people put at risk. 
Then we have the angioplasty catheters that failed causing dozens to suffer emergency coronary bypass surgery, cardiac damage and death. 
Mr. President, this is what we are talking about. We are talking about S. 830 which allows false and misleading labels for medical devices. S. 830 could result in the surgical needles that do not safely remove the breast cancer tumors. 
FDA has been asked to clear surgical lasers for marketing despite the lack of safety data submitted to support the clear intent of the manufacturer--to cut prostate tissue. What we have are laser manufacturers that say, `Well, all right, we want to use lasers in the operations on the prostate. And a certain amount of cutting is going to be necessary.' They effectively say, `Our laser is substantially equivalent to lasers that are already approved for general cutting,' when the intention of the company is to use the newer designed laser not just in the ordinary cutting of tissues but for use in a prostate operation. Therefore, through this loophole, a device may be used for a purpose for which it was clearly designed but not adequately tested. 
We have also, Mr. President, the example of contact lenses that may cause blindness. FDA can tell by the materials and design of a contact lens that it will be used for extended wear. But a company could submit data only on a labeled use of daily wear and FDA would be prohibited from asking for additional information on extended wear. Extended wear lenses that are not adequately tested may cause ulcers on the cornea and can be sight-threatening. 
Mr. President, we may see in the future digital mammography screening machines that may misdiagnose breast cancer. We have seen enormous progress being made in terms of mammography with all the benefits of early detection of breast cancer which permits early treatment and saves lives. 
These advanced technologies, Mr. President, may be able to perform diagnostic mammography but not mammography screening. There is an important difference. The screening is used to find out whether there are tumors as compared to examining a tumor for diagnostic purposes to make a determination of the appropriate kinds of medical treatment. A mammography instrument labeled for use as a diagnostic machine could have features specific to mammography screening and the safety data should be submitted to support that use. 
Why do we have to take a chance on it? What is the compelling need to take a chance on women's health? Why shouldn't we say to FDA that if they have reason to believe that the primary purpose of this new machine is going to be for screening and the label is false and misleading that they can ask for safety data for the intended use. 
Why should we hamstring the FDA when we know that the purpose for these new kinds of medical devices are not consistent with what is being labeled by the manufacturing company?

Mr. KENNEDY. Under this legislation, the FDA, even though they know this might provide an important safety question for the American people, are handcuffed from doing anything about it. Why are we doing this to the American people? For what purpose? Are we that far behind in terms of online medical devices? We are not. 
I can put in the Record the various publications of the medical device industry that show they have been making important progress over the past several years, and the profits have gone up, and a different atmosphere is out there to bring the various products on the market. A GAO report has shown that medical device review times are down. 
So if that is the case, why, now, are we going to rush these devices on through when their purposes are clearly different from the labeled use and for which we do not have adequate safety data? This is a major step back, and puts the public at risk. 
Madam President, we can go through what some of the dangers are when we find various devices are used for one purpose and then changed and altered for another purpose. In this diagram we have the long bone screws that are used effectively to mend bones. I have a member of my family that has had those implanted and they have been enormously effective. A member of the family had a broken shoulder, and I went back to see her 5 days later and she was able to move her arm, move her shoulder. It was unbelievable when you think of what most of us understood would be a recovery time of several months. 
We have seen how, when used properly, how they can help mend a bone, give stability to bone, and be effective in helping and assisting those people with that kind of a break to long bones. Then what happened? We found out the screws were being sold to back surgeons for another purpose. They were marketed for use in the spinal column to give stability to the spine. 
What happened? Madam President, the screws broke, and they were disasters for many Americans who had the operation. Those screws were not adequately tested for use in the back and should not have been used in that manner. 
These examples are what is happening every day. We have the biopsy needle, the contact lenses, we have the long bone screws, and the list goes on. We ought to be very careful about denying the Food and Drug Administration needed information in terms of their safety and effectiveness. 
Now, Madam President, we cannot prohibit off-label use of medical devices. We are not doing that in the proposed amendment. What we are saying is that when you have on the face of it a clear intention that the new proposal that is being submitted to the FDA is going to be used clearly as a dominant use for another purpose, such as the breast biopsy instrumentation, that the FDA ought to be able to look at the safety and efficacy of the device. 
Why are we going through this, Madam President? Why are we tying the hands of the agency that has the skill and the knowledgeable people to try to protect the public? 
All we are saying is when there is a clear record on the use of a device, make sure the American public's interest is going to be protected and not denied. All our amendment says is when the label is false and misleading, the FDA is going to be able to look behind it. That does not seem to me to be a very dramatic or radical kind of resolution to this particular issue. 
We have indicated four or five different types of compromises to this particular measure to try to protect the public's interest. We are ready to look at different language to protect the public's interest. But the guiding light is, when we know a medical device is being submitted with false or misleading information and that the device is clearly designed for another purpose, the FDA should be able to look at the safety and the efficacy of the device. 
We have seen in recent years the dangers of simple changes like the absorbency of tampon material. It looked like it was just a very modest kind of alteration or change. But women were injured, and subject to infections that caused toxic shock syndrome sometimes leading to death. 
Why are we doing less for the protection of our consumers? Why are we restricting the protections of the American consumers? We are going to have a difficult enough time trying to make sure that when medical devices go through vigorous requirements for safety and effectiveness that they are indeed safe and efficacious. Some mistakes may very well be made. At least we will know we have given it our best shot. At least we will know we have given to the American people the best we have, in terms of scientists and researchers, to try to make sure those products are safe. 
On this particular provision, for the first time in 23 years, we will be effectively rolling back public health protections at FDA. We will be effectively handcuffing the FDA on a major matter that affects the health and the safety of the American people. It is unwise. It is unjust. There is absolutely no rationale or justification for this provision other than the profits of the medical device industry. 
Madam President, I cannot help but believe as the American people understand this issue, understand the health implications, understand on the one hand we are risking the public health of the American people in favor of the profits of the medical device industry, that they will be heard on this issue. This provision puts at serious risk the health of the American people--that is what the HHS says, that is what the Women's Health Network says, that is what the principal consumers groups that are out there to protect the American people say. 
What is the benefit on the other side? The profits of unscrupulous medical device manufacturers. It is not only going to be the profit of those individual companies like U.S. Surgical, but it will be an invitation to other medical device companies to go through a loophole, because otherwise they will be put at a competitive disadvantage. It makes absolutely no sense. 
I hope very much, that when the Senate addresses this issue in the next week, we can have the support of our colleagues and we will have the support of the House of Representatives and we can move forward with an otherwise reasonable bill. 
I see my friend and colleague, Senator Durbin, here on the floor. I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the underlying piece of legislation that we have before the Senate is S. 830, which is the drug reform legislation. Earlier in the course of the debate and discussion, I pointed out one of the most serious proposals in that particular piece of legislation that puts the future health care of all at serious. I also pointed out the bewilderment the President of the United States and I share, which every consumer group shares: Why in the world are we providing the kind of change in protections for the American consumer that are included in this legislation? 
I am reminded, Mr. President, that 30 years ago this Nation was faced with a thalidomide tragedy, and all the implications that that terrible situation had for hundreds of mothers and children. Twenty years ago, we had the Dalkon Shield tragedy, where 18 women died from perforated uteruses, 2,700 women had miscarrages, and millions of women were adversely affected with great illness and sickness and, in many instances, were unable to have children in the future. Why? Because we had a medical device that wasn't safe for American women. 
Ten years ago, we had the Shiley heart valve. A certain part of that heart valve that was found to be unsafe here in the United States, but it was advertised and used overseas and resulted in hundreds of deaths. 
We know that some medical devices can be dangerous. We have to ask ourselves, as we are coming into the final consideration of this legislation, why in the world we are retreating from protecting the American public in this area? That is what we are doing. We are putting the interests of the medical device industry ahead of the public health of the American people. For what reason? For the profits of those medical device industries. 
The provisions of the legislation are clear and simple. S. 830 says: 
. . . prohibits FDA from reviewing the safety of a device for uses not listed by the manufacturer. 
If the manufacturer labels a device as substantially the same as another device that has already been approved, the Food and Drug Administration cannot look at that medical device, beyond the use listed on the lablel, in terms of its safety and effectiveness in protecting the American consumer. 
We are effectively handcuffing the Food and Drug Administration with this language. The amendment, which will be offered by Senator Reed--on which I will join him, says: 
. . . prohibits FDA from reviewing the safety of a device for uses not listed by the manufacturer unless the label is false and misleading. 
Who could defend a medical device manufacturer that knowingly submits false and misleading information? Anybody who is listening to this would say, we can't believe that, Senator. We can't believe that is really happening. Well they should believe it because that is what is happening. 
The clearest illustration of this development is the use of a certain biopsy needle that has been manufacture by U.S. Surgical Co. A biopsy needle used to excise tumor tissue to see whether it is cancerous or not. The biopsy needle is maybe the size of the lead in a pencil. It is used to remove sufficient amount of material to be analyzed. Now, along comes U.S. Surgical Corp., which develops medical devices, with a new medical device that can take 50 times more material than the earlier biopsy needle. U.S. Surgical says: Look, this new device is the same purpose as the other medical device. It is substantially the same. It is for taking material that can be a biopsied. We have been 
approved previously in terms of safety and effectiveness. According to our label, this new device is a biopsy needle and, according to the law, under S. 830, FDA cannot look beyond that use and into the real purpose of this new device to determine whether or not the device is safe and effective for that new use. 
Well, Mr. President, unfortunately for U.S. Surgical Corp., a number of us have seen their ads and promotions for this particular medical device. What is U.S. Surgical Corp. promoting? It is promoting this new device as a device that is going to remove the tumor, not just take the biopsy, but remove the tumor from a woman's breast. Now, it may be very good in removing that tumor. It may be able to get all the cancerous material. It may do the job better than any other medical device we have had before. But we don't know that. The patient won't know it. The doctor won't know it. The family of the patient won't know it. Why? Because U.S. Surgical Corp. would not have to provide one paragraph of information demonstrating that this medical device is safe and effective for removing tumors. The doctors will see it and say, well, this has been approved by the FDA, it must be safe. I think I will use it, especially after reading about, hearing, or watching the promotion film used in Canada to promote this device. 
The FDA would be prohibited from looking behind the labeling of the device to determine whether it is safe and effective. The FDA can say, look, we know the manufacturer is out there day in and day out promoting this device for tumor removal. They can hardly wait to get approval to go out and sell that medical device for the purposes of removing the tumor. According to the proposal under S. 830, if the label says that it is substantially equivalent to the biopsy needle, the Food and Drug Administration cannot require U.S. Surgical Corp. to provide information demonstrating that the device is safe and effective for its marketed purpose. That is wrong. 
We are taking an important step backward in protecting the American people. And it is not just this particular medical device. The real concern is all the other medical devices that are out there now being considered. It is the mammography screening machines that are being used for breast cancer screening. The mammography screening machines may be very good in terms of the diagnostic evaluation of tumors, once the tumor is detected. They may be even better as screening tools to look for such a tumor. But we don't know because the FDA wouldn't be able to ask for safety and effectiveness data for its use in breast cancer screening. So we have examples of mammography machines coming into the FDA that will be approved because they are effective in terms of evaluating and diagnosing tumors, but have not been studied in terms of their effectiveness in screening. Yet we find the machine is being used for screening purposes. 
American women will say that they have been screened with mammography machines, and they have been found to be free of any kind of cancer. They will be very happy about that. Since we have no data on how effective this device is for screening, they may find later, maybe too late, that they have some kind of a tumor. They may find out that this machine didn't do what it was represented to do because it had not been tested in terms of effectiveness. That should not be the case. 
That is true with regard to the surgical lasers that haven't been tested for safety and effectiveness in cutting cancerous prostate tissue. It has been demonstrated that the lasers are safe and effective in cutting general tissue. But, the manufacturer changes the design and puts another laser in that also cuts tissue. But the purpose of that new laser is to cut through tissue in the prostate area, whether it is a cancerous tissue or noncancerous tissue. The laser has not been approved for that purpose. We do not have safety information to know that it is effective in dealing with this particular kind of operation. The manufacturer doesn't have to provide it. All they have to do is say it is a laser that cuts tissue and they get approved. The FDA can be fully aware that they are going to promote it for prostate cutting, but they will not be able to ask the manufacturer to provide safety information for that use. 
The same is true with contact lenses that get approved though this loophole channel--saying that the lenses are substantially equivalent to equipment that has already been approved. But those lens manufacturers are intend to promote these new lenses for long-term use rather than short-term use like the ones that have been approved. The FDA can know about the advertising--and can even tell from the change in materials used to make the new lenses that they are designed for long-term use. But they cannot evaluate the new lenses for safety and long-term use. We can see the dangers that could result--maybe even blindness. 
Mr. President, we shouldn't be taking a risk with the health of the American people in this way. It is fundamentally wrong. The only reason to do so is to give a competitive advantage to unethical medical manufacturing companies. Those are the ones that will use this loophole. And when they do, they will gain a competitive advantage over the ethical manufacturers that take the time and spend the money to conduct the safety and effectiveness studies to show that thier devices are safe. They will be at a financial and competitive disadvantage because less ethical companies will use this loophole for approval. 
That is why each and every one of these consumer groups are opposed to this provision--why we have recommended five different alternatives to address this issue over the past weeks. The medical device industry has turned those down because they say they have the votes. They can roll over the public health concerns of the American people. That has happened in the past. But I hope it will not happen next Tuesday. This issue is too important. It is important for our wives, our daughters, our sons, our fathers, our grandparents--to be sure that when they have to use medical devices, those devices are going to be safe and effective. We have the ability to ensure safety in so many new ways--ways that were unimaginable years ago. 
But with this provision, we are effectively tying the hands of the FDA. If there is an appropriate title for the provision, it is the false-claims provision of the medical device and pharmacy legislation, S. 830. And it is the wrong way to go. 
We look forward to debating this issue next week. I am hopeful that we can address it in a way that will provide the real protection the American people deserve. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to join with Senator Abraham, Senator Hatch, Senator Leahy and my other colleagues in sponsoring legislation to reauthorize provisions of our laws permitting immigrants to come to this country to serve communities in churches and other religious institutions across the United States. 
One of the most significant achievements of the Immigration Act of 1990, which I sponsored in the Senate, was the creation of this important visa category. Religious institutions perform extraordinary services for families and communities. In doing so, they often find it worthwhile to bring in religious workers from other lands as immigrants, to help them carry out their activities in the United States. 
One of the best known supporters of this practice was Mother Teresa. Missionaries in her Order come to the United States frequently to work with the poor in our country. She and the members of her Order have directly touched the lives of millions of Americans. Much of the recent work by her Missionaries of Charity in this country would not have been possible without this important provision in our immigration laws. 
Unfortunately, this visa category expires on September 30, just two weeks from today. We cannot allow this to happen. 
As His Eminence Cardinal Maida of Detroit testified before the Immigration Subcommittee last week, `Should the program be permitted to expire, the impact would be far reaching. Not only would religious organizations and denominations lose access to the much needed contributions of these religious workers, but so, too, would the many communities in which these individuals work.' 
The legislation we are sponsoring would make this visa a permanent part of our immigration laws. Renewal of this visa would be a small, but enduring memorial to Mother Teresa and her work in America. It will enable the members of her Order to continue their charitable and compassionate work in this country long into the future. 
I have been honored to see her good work in America and around the world. I recall meeting her when I visited India in 1971 and viewed firsthand the extraordinary compassion of this remarkable woman. And I was impressed also by the tremendous difference that she and her Missionaries of Charity made in the lives of hundreds of thousands of starving families during the famine in Ethiopia and Sudan in 1984 and 1985. My family and I visited the area during the Christmas season in 1984, and was deeply moved by Mother Teresa's extraordinary healing presence amid that great tragedy. 
Since this visa category was established in 1990, over 20,000 religious workers have entered the United States to serve in our communities. These men and women have brought their skills and compassion to churches, synagogues, mosques, and other places of worship across America. They teach in our parochial schools. They serve as health care workers, cantors, and catechists. They provide religious training to youths and after-school programs that keep young people off the streets and give them hope for a better future. 
I have been deeply moved by the ways in which this special visa has benefitted Massachusetts. Maria Alvarez came to Boston at the invitation of the African Mission Fathers, and has devoted her life to helping city youth deal with gang violence, depression, and other problems that plague inner cities. She has also extended her helping hand to refugees in the Boston area, helping them build new lives in our state. 
Sister Vitolia came to Lawrence, Massachusetts on a religious worker visa through the Society of Mary. She works with unemployed and homeless Spanish speakers there. She helps them find jobs and helps keep their families together. 
Once again, I commend Senator Abraham for his leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Hatch in sponsoring legislation requested by Mother Teresa to waive visa application fees for religious workers coming to the United States to perform charitable work for temporary periods. 
During her visits to the United States, Mother Teresa asked President Clinton to take this step to waive visa fees for her missionaries coming to work in this country. Her Missionaries of Charity come to America to help the poor in our communities and to minister to the sick and the elderly. Each time they travel here, they are required to pay a $120 visa fee to the United States Government. 
It makes no sense to require these religious workers to pay a fee to the federal government in order to come here to help our communities. The legislation we introduce today would waive the fee in these instances. 
This past weekend, while attending Mother Teresa's funeral in India, the First Lady met with Sister Nirmala, Mother Teresa's successor at the Missionaries of Charity Order in Calcutta. Sister Nirmala asked once again for a waiver of the visa fee and was delighted to learn that the United States Senate would be considering legislation this week to accomplish this goal as Mother Teresa had requested. 
This is an important step that Congress can take to honor the memory of Mother Theresa and the compassionate work that her Order brings to America. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. I will say this evening what I have said before, and that is to commend the chairman of our committee, Senator Jeffords, and the other members of our committee for working out, by and large, a commendable piece of legislation to bring pharmaceuticals onto the market safely and rapidly, and to assure that Americans would be able to have the benefits of advances in the areas of medical devices. 
There is a very important provision which has been included in the bill and which I think poses a very significant threat to the health and safety of the American people. I want to take some time this evening to discuss the reasons why this particular provision should be eliminated from the bill or modified to retain existing protections available under the Food and Drug Act. 
I will use the time that I have this evening to try to spell out for the Senate and for those who are watching these proceedings the dangers of this provision so that, hopefully, when the Senate has the opportunity to change this particular provision on Tuesday next it will do so. It is time to make the changes that will protect the American people, and it is important that we do so. 
Mr. President, this is not just a provision that I have reservations about. We have put in the Record, and I will mention at this time once again, that the President of the United States has indicated that this is one of four major concerns that he has in this legislation because of its potential to adversely effect the public health. 
It isn't only the President of the United States who has identified this particular provision as being a danger to the health of the American people, but it is the Patients' Coalition, which is made up of patients from all over this country, who review various pieces of legislation to ensure that the patients of this country are adequately protected: the Consumer Federation of America, the National Women's Health Network, the National Organization of Rare Disorders, the American Public Health Association, Consumers Union, Center for Women's Policy Studies, the National Parent Network on Disabilities, the National Association of Social Workers, and the list goes on and on and on. 
That is why, Mr. President, this particular provision should be revised to protect the health of the American people. It does not do so now, and it has not since it has been reported out of the committee. 
If this provision becomes law, it would force the Food and Drug Administration to approve unsafe or ineffective medical devices in cases where a manufacturer submits false or misleading information about the product. This issue goes to the heart of the role of the FDA, and it is an unconscionable provision. The result is that patients who rely on medical devices may well be exposed to dangerous products that could maim or kill. 
Ninety-five percent of all devices approved by the FDA involve upgrades of existing devices. The upgrades are reviewed in what is called the 510(k) procedure under the statute. Under this procedure, the manufacturer of the device asks for an FDA approval based on the fact that the new device is substantially equivalent to an existing device that is already on the market and that has already been approved as safe and effective. 
On this basis, the FDA usually quickly approves the new device. If the new device has significant technological changes, the manufacturer must submit the data to the FDA to show that the new device is as safe and as effective as the older device to which it is being compared. That is the current law. 
In making these determinations under the current law, the FDA looks at the use of the earlier device and the claims that the manufacturer of the new device makes on the label for the new product. Sometimes, however, the new device has technological characteristics that make it clear that the device is intended to be used for a new purpose, a different purpose than the one the manufacturer claims on the proposed label. 
All we are asking is that the FDA be able to act in these circumstances to assure that the device is safe. We want to prohibit false and misleading labels. 
Mr. President, this is not a hypothetical case. A recent case demonstrates the basic problem. 
A new biopsy needle for diagnosing breast cancer in women was submitted for approval to the FDA by the U.S. Surgical Corporation, a well-known manufacturer of medical devices. Compared to the existing biopsy needle, the new needle was huge, far larger than would normally be used in a biopsy. In fact, the tissue removed by the device was 50 times as large as the standard instrument would remove. 
It was obvious to the FDA that the new needle would be used to remove small tumors, not just to perform a biopsy. In fact, the company marketed the device for that purpose in Canada. Yet, the corporation proposed to market the device with the old biopsy label, which gave no hint of the obvious new use of removing cancer cells. Under current law, the FDA has the authority in such cases to require the manufacturer to submit data on the safety and effectiveness of the needle for the new use, to be sure that it is capable of removing tumors without leaving some cancer cells in place. 
Under this legislation, if the FDA said, `Well, let us examine whether this particular medical device provides safety and protection for American women when that device is used to remove tumors,' the FDA would not be permitted to do so. Under the old law, it would. Under the new law, it would not. 
In this particular case the tissue removed by the device was 50 times as large as the standard instrument would remove. It was obvious to the FDA the new needle would be used to remove small tumors, not just to perform biopsies. In fact, videos were distributed in Canada demonstrating how to use the device to remove breast tumors. Yet, the corporation proposed to market the device with the old biopsy label which gave no hint of the obvious new use for removing tumors. 
Under the current law, the FDA has the authority in such cases to require the manufacturer to submit the data on safety and effectiveness of the needle for the new use to be sure that it is capable of removing tumors without leaving some cancer cells in place. But not under the law that is before the U.S. Senate. 
No woman would want to have a breast cancer removed by a medical device that cannot do the job safely and effectively. No Member of the Senate would want their wife or mother or sister or daughter put at risk by such a device. That is precisely what this bill does in changing the existing law that would permit the FDA to look behind the label to examine the safety and efficacy of a use clearly intended by the technological characteristics of the device. 
The proponents of this legislation say no to an amendment when we have tried to ask that the FDA be able to look at the primary use of medical devices to make sure that when a company, such as the U.S. Surgical Corporation, is going to say that this is really just the old small needle, to permit the FDA to look behind it. They say, `No. We've got the votes. Public be dammed.' 
Unless the American people are going to pay attention to this issue, they will have the votes when we vote on this next Tuesday. But they should not have the votes on it. They should not have the votes on it if we are interested in protecting the American consumer, not only on this particular measure, this particular device, but on others as well. 
The justification offered by the proponents of this provision is that the FDA, in its zeal to protect the public, has sometimes required manufacturers to offer data on safety and effectiveness on purely hypothetical, possible uses of the new device, uses never intended by the manufacturer. 
If that is the goal of the provision, it goes too far because it puts public health at risk. No American should die or suffer serious injury because the FDA is forced to ignore false or misleading claims. That is what Senator Reed's amendment next week will be, just prohibiting false and misleading claims. People will have a chance to vote on that up or down. 
No American should die or suffer serious injury because the FDA is forced to ignore false or misleading claims. That is what this is about. 
As I mentioned, the administration has singled out this proposal as one of the four in this legislation that merit a veto. It is strenuously opposed by a broad coalition of health and consumer groups. An obvious compromise can correct this defect so it achieves what the sponsors say is its legitimate purpose, without undermining health and safety. Under the compromise, the FDA will have the authority to look behind the label only in cases where the label is false or misleading. 
This is a bare minimum requirement to protect public health. What possible justification can there be for the FDA to approve a device based on false or misleading labels? No ethical manufacturer would submit a device with a false or misleading label. No unethical manufacturer should get away with submitting one. And no Senator should vote to protect a false and misleading label. 
The protection is already in the bill for the 5 percent of the devices that go through the traditional approval process. But for the 95 percent of the devices that go through the 510(k) procedures, the bill gives a license to lie to the FDA and harm the public. 
Mr. President, a few days ago the public was made aware of the 
tragedy that resulted from the use of diet drugs in ways that had not been approved by the FDA as safe and effective. This so-called `off-label' use of fen/phen may well have caused serious and irreversible heart damage in tens of thousands of women who thought the drugs were safe. The legislation before us would actually encourage the use of off-label, unapproved uses of medical devices. We have seen in every newspaper in the country, we have heard on every radio station, every television, the dangers that the off-label use of fen/phen has posed for the American people. Now, just at the time that the country is looking at that, we are inviting the same kind of disaster for off-label use of medical devices. 
It is shocking that this shameful provision has been so cavalierly included in the bill. It is incomprehensible that reputable device manufacturers are not prepared to support a compromise that allows the FDA to look behind the labels that are false and misleading. 
Medical devices can heal, but they can also maim and kill. The history of medical devices is full of medical stories of unnecessary death and suffering. But thanks to the authority the FDA now has, there are also many stories of lives saved by the vigilance of the FDA. What is incomprehensible about the bill before us is that it would take us backward in the direction of less protection of public health rather than more. 
That isn't just Senator Kennedy saying that, Mr. President. Those are the findings of our Secretary of HHS, the Patients' Coalition, Consumer Federation of America, National Women's Health Network, National Organization for Rare Disorders, the American Public Health Association, Consumers Union--the list goes on and on. They have reached the same kind of conclusion, Mr. President, that we are going backwards instead of advancing the interests of the public health. 
The whole story of device regulation has been to provide the public greater protections since the mid-1970s. 
Mr. President, let me just take a few moments and talk about what has happened previously in terms of medical devices that posed very important health threats, injury and death to American people when we were not attentive to the public health interests of the people of this country. 
Two decades ago, the Dalkon Shield disaster led to the passage of a law giving the FDA greater authority over medical devices. At the time, this birth control device went on the market, the FDA had no authority to require manufacturers to show that devices are safe and effective before they are sold. In 1974, an FDA advisory committee recommended that the Dalkon Shield be taken off the market--after almost 3 million women had used it. The device was found to cause septic abortions and pelvic inflammatory disease. Hundreds of women had become sterile, and many required hysterectomies. According to the manufacturer's own estimates, 90,000 women in the United States alone were injured. The manufacturer, A.H. Robins, refused to halt distribution of the device, even though the FDA requested it, while the issue was reviewed by the advisory committee. 
The Shiley heart valve disaster was so serious that it led to the enactment of further legislation. This mechanical heart valve was approved in 1979. It was developed by the Shiley Company. The Shiley Company was subsequently sold to Pfizer, which continued marketing the valve. It was taken off the market in 1986 because of its high breakage rate. By that time, as many as 30,000 of these devices had been implanted in heart patients in the United States. One hundred and ninety-five valves broke and 130 patients died. Thousands of other patients who had the defective valves in their hearts had to make an impossible choice--between undergoing a new operation to remove the device, or living with the knowledge that they had a dangerous device in their heart that could rupture and kill them at any moment. Depositions taken from company employees indicated that cracks in defective valves may have been concealed from customers. 
Before the defective valve was withdrawn, the manufacturer had tried to introduce a new version with a 70 degree tilt instead of the 60 degree tilt approved by the FDA. The increased tilt was intended to improve blood flow and reduce the risk of clotting. The FDA's review found that the greater tilt increased the likelihood of metal fatigue and valve breakage, and the new version was not approved for use in the United States. Four thousand of the new devices were implanted in Europe. The failure rate was six times higher than for the earlier valve--causing at least 150 deaths. 
In another example of a human and public health tragedy involving a medical device, the firm Telectronics marketed a pacemaker wire for use in the heart. Twenty-five thousand of these pacemakers were marketed, beginning in 1994, before it was discovered that the wire could break, cause damage to the wall of the heart, or even destroy the aorta. 
The case of artificial jaw joints--referred to as TMJ devices--are another tragedy that devastated tens of thousands of patients, mostly women. These devices were implanted to assist patients with arthritic degeneration of the jaw joint, most with relatively mild discomfort. But the impact of the new joints, sold by a company called Vitek, was catastrophic. The new joints often disintegrated, leaving the victims disfigured and in constant, severe pain. To make matters worse, Vitek refused to notify surgeons of the problems with the joints, and FDA had to get a court order to stop distribution of the product. Similar problems were experienced with Dow Corning silicone jaw implants. 
You see with this chart these dramatic, tragic, human disasters caused by unsafe, inadequately tested medical devices. Do we want less safety? Do we want less protection when we have seen these kinds of human tragedies take place, when there have been these instances? 
Mr. President, another device disaster is the toxic shock syndrome from super absorbent materials in tampons. Most women would not think that a tampon could kill them, but they would be wrong. About 5 percent of toxic shock syndrome cases are fatal. What seemed like minor design changes, the absorbency of the material, resulted in enormous human tragedy. Women and their families deserve protections from unsafe medical devices. FDA should be strengthened, not crippled. 
In yet another example, the FDA was able to block a device that involved a plastic lens implanted in the eye to treat near-sightedness. The device was widely marketed in France, but the FDA refused to approve it for use in the United States. Long-term use of the device was later shown to cause damage to the cornea, with possible blindness. 
The angioplasty catheter marketed by the Bard Corporation turned out to be a dangerous device that the company sold with a reckless disregard for both the law and public health. The device was modified several times by the corporation without telling the FDA in advance, as required by the law. The company was prosecuted and pleaded guilty to 391 counts in the indictment, including mail fraud and lying to the government. Thirty-three cases of breakage occurred in a two-month period, leading to serious cardiac damage, emergency coronary bypass surgery, and even death. 
Now, Mr. President, these tragedies resulted in expanded powers for the FDA to protect the public against dangerous devices and greater vigilance on the part of the agency. But this bill steps back by forcing the FDA to protect the public with one hand tied behind its back. This bill actually forces FDA to approve devices based on false and misleading labels. 
I have already discussed the dangers of a breast cancer biopsy needle that would have been used to treat breast cancer without adequate evidence that it was effective. There are many other examples of the kind of dangerous devices that could be foisted on the American public, if the provision of the bill allowing false and misleading labels is allowed to stand. Under the provision, the FDA cannot look behind the manufacturer's proposed use to demand appropriate safety and effectiveness data, even if it is obvious that the device has been designed for an altogether different use than the manufacturer claims. 
Surgical lasers are increasingly used for general cutting, in place of traditional instruments such as scalpels. In a recent case, a manufacturer called Trimedyne adapted the laser in a way that indicated it was clearly intended for prostate surgery. But it submitted an application to the FDA saying that the laser was only intended for general cutting. The label was clearly false, and the FDA was able to require adequate safety data before the product was allowed on the market. But under this bill, the FDA would be forced to approve the product, without requiring evidence that the device is safe and effective for prostate surgery. 
Prostate surgery is a very common procedure affecting tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of older men. Failed surgery can result in permanent incontinence and other devastating side effects. Do we really want surgical tools to be used to treat this common illness that may not be safe and effective? If this legislation passes unchanged, that is exactly the risk that large numbers of patients needing prostate surgery could face. 
A further example involves digital mammography, an imaging technology that is becoming an alternative to conventional film mammography. The new device is being tested for better diagnostic imaging of a potentially cancerous lump in the breast that has already been detected and shows great promise. But it is not known whether the new machine can be used effectively in screening for breast cancer when there are no symptoms. Under this bill, if a manufacturer seeks approval for a digital mammography machine that is clearly designed for breast cancer screening, not just for diagnosis, the FDA would be prohibited from requiring data to show that the machine is effective for screening. Does the Senate really want to support legislation that could result in women dying needlessly from undetected breast cancer? That is what this device provision could cause. 
We know that there is more money that is going to be made by those particular companies that can get on the market faster than their competitor through this loophole. Is that what we are about in terms of trying to protect the public? The FDA is the principal agency of the government to protect the health and safety. 
The various professionals in consumer organizations and patient organizations that spend every day trying to protect the public health understand the dangers that are involved in this provision. They are all saying why doesn't the Senate build in these protections? 
But no. There is that majority in the United States Senate that would go ahead and accept this, and pass this legislation as it is without the adequate protections. And, unless the public is going to understand that this is something which is important and let their representatives understand that by Tuesday next, that is what will happen. 
The President of the United States has had the courage to say no to this particular provision, because he understands, as the Secretary of Health and Education understands, and as the public health community understands the dangers to the American consumer if we let this provision continue. 
Mr. President, I want to review as clearly as I can exactly what the bill that is before us, S. 830, does. It prohibits the FDA from reviewing the safety of a device for uses not listed by the manufacturer. 
Senator Reed's amendment will prohibit the FDA from reviewing the safety of a device for uses not listed by the manufacturer unless the label is `false or misleading.' You would think we would get 100 votes on that. Is the Senate going to say, `OK, it is going to be all right for device manufacturers to have false and misleading labels?' 
Other examples in the way that this provision could allow unsafe and ineffective devices abound. A stent designed to open the bile duct for gallstones could be modified in a way that clearly was designed to make it a treatment for blockages of the carotid artery. Without adequate testing, it could put patients at risk of stroke or death. But under this bill, the FDA would be prohibited from looking behind the label to the actual intended use of the device. 
Mr. President, the vast majority of medical device manufacturers meet high ethical standards. Most devices are fully tested and evaluated by the FDA before they are marketed. But as many examples make clear, if the FDA does not have adequate authority to protect innocent patients, the result can be unnecessary death and injury to patients across the country. There is no justification--none whatever--for Congress to force the FDA to approve devices with false or misleading labels. 
Each and every time amendments to medical device and pharmaceutical provisions have been approved by the Congress, Republican and Democrat, the public health and safety of the American people has been enhanced. There are provisions in this legislation that will do so. But not this provision. This provision, if left to stand, poses significant health risks to American consumers. 
We ought to be making sure that when the FDA gives their stamp of approval, that devices are going to be safe and efficacious, and that every doctor in this country and every patient knows they are going to meet the highest safety standards. That ought to be our commitment to the American people. 
But this particular provision does not do it. Rather than being a step forward, it is a significant and dangerous step backward. Unscrupulous manufacturers do not deserve a free ride at the expense of public health. 
We have good legislation that is going to extend the PDUFA which is going to mean that we will have many excellent additional professional people to help to move various pharmaceutical products onto the market sooner. 
The public health organizations know what is happening out there, and they have pleaded with all of us in the Senate and said, My God, for once put the profits of this handful of industries that is trying to circumvent the health and safety protections of the American people, put that aside and make sure, when you act next week, the roll will be called, act to protect the public here in the United States. 
That is what this debate is about. That is what we will have a chance to vote on next week. 
Mr. President, I believe my time is just about up. I thank the Chair. We will have an opportunity to go back to this tomorrow morning at 9:30 to add additional information. We hope we will hear from the American people if they care about assuring that their children are going to have safe medical devices, that their parents are going to have safe medical devices, that their daughters and their husbands, their grandparents are going to have safe medical devices. There is only one way to do it, and that is on next Tuesday when the rollcall comes, Senators will support the Reed amendment, which I welcome the opportunity to cosponsor, which will be the most important action we can take in the Senate on this legislation to protect the health and safety of the American people. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in strong opposition to this amendment, which would severely undermine the American heritage rivers initiative proposed by President Clinton in his State of the Union Address this year. 
Since the President's announcement, many communities across the Nation, including impressive coalitions along the Connecticut River, Blackstone River, and Merrimack River in Massachusetts and New England, have expressed their strong support for this new program. They recognize it as an excellent opportunity to work in partnership with the Federal Government to protect the environment and cultural resources that make each of these rivers a unique part of our history and heritage. 
The initiative is designed to join the National Park Service's technical expertise with local decisionmaking, so that cities and towns across the country can decide how best to revitalize their rivers and communities. 
This amendment would impose a host of unnecessary Federal mandates that would make it difficult for communities to nominate their rivers for designation as American heritage rivers. It would be impossible to carry out the program as President Clinton intended. The amendment would dictate the size of each river corridor--requiring uniform boundaries with a 20-mile-wide span along each river--rather than allowing flexibility for local circumstances. It would require mandatory participation of each and every property owner within the 20-mile-wide boundary of the corridor, and upset the ongoing application process that many communities are pursuing in good faith to meet a December 10 deadline. It would also require congressional approval of the President's selection of rivers, injecting politics into a nomination process that is currently based on merit. 
This amendment is a frontal assault on the American heritage rivers initiative. It would strip citizens of their ability to protect and revitalize their rivers on their own terms, and give Congress the authority to micromanage these important local efforts. 
The American heritage rivers initiative has great potential, and has won high praise from communities across the country. It makes no sense to change the ground rules of the game at this late stage, and I urge the Senate to reject this amendment.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, here we go again. Every year since 1989, Congress has held a highly charged debate about the future of the National Endowment for the Arts. This year is no different. Ironically, extremists opposing NEA have recently been claiming that there has been inadequate oversight of the agency. Dollar for dollar, it is likely that no agency has been more heavily scrutinized than the Arts Endowment. 
The arts and humanities have, and deserve to have, a central role in the life of America. The Arts Endowment has contributed immensely to that role. It has encouraged the growth and development of the arts in communities across the Nation, giving new emphasis and vitality to American creativity and scholarship, and to the cultural achievement that are among America's greatest strengths. 
Americans have a great deal to celebrate and learn about our extraordinary cultural traditions. The arts are an important part of our complex and modern society, and will play a key role in fulfilling our country's many possibilities for the future. 
Critics used to claim that the Endowment spent money unwisely--awarding grants to unqualified artists or to artists that clearly did not merit Federal aid. But the critics quickly ran out of examples. Over the period of its entire 32-year history, a grand total of about 25 of the tens of thousands of grants awarded by the Endowment have raised genuine concerns. Yet, the budget for the Arts Endowment has been cut to penalize the agency for these so-called inappropriate grants. Other restrictions have also been imposed--on content, on seasonal support grants, on grants to individuals, and on subgrants. 
Nothing will ever satisfy the critics, because their real intent is to eliminate any Federal role in the arts. Their goal is to abolish the agency--either directly by denying it any funds at all, or, indirectly by block-granting all the funds to the States. 
In fact, the Arts Endowment has an extraordinary record of successful achievement. As a result of the its leadership over the past three decades, there are now double the number of orchestras in America, 11 times the number of dance companies, and 50 times the number of local arts agencies. The NEA reaches out to thousands of America's communities and neighborhoods. It is functioning as it should, encouraging the arts in all parts of the country, providing the seed money that enables local arts to grow and thrive. 
Let us be honest. In recent years, since the rightwing's misguided ideological assault on the agency first began, Congress has gone the extra mile. We have taken every reasonable action to ensure that the Arts Endowment only supports grants and programs that are responsible, that fulfill the agency's widely accepted mission, and that reach the widest possible audience. Every year the agency has to run the appropriations gauntlet and every year it convinces a majority of Congress that it deserves support. This year should be no different, because there is no new evidence to justify the critics' shameful attack. 
The Labor and Human Resources Committee recently approved a 5-year reauthorization of the Arts Endowment. The bill includes appropriate restrictions and set-asides, so that the arts will reach as many communities across the country as possible. The bill also establishes arts education as a primary focus of the agency. The bill was approved by a solid bipartisan committee vote of 14 to 4. 
I commend Senator Jeffords of the Labor Committee for his excellent job in guiding that authorization through the committee. He is a strong supporter of the arts and has been thorough and conscientious in his oversight of the Endowment. 
The Appropriations Committee has also demonstrated its support for the Endowment, by recommending just over $100 million for the Arts Endowment in this bill. I commend the committee for its support. 
The agency has made a significant contribution to the quality of life in thousands of communities in our country. The arts have broad appeal, and the Endowment's mission is to encourage artists and institutions across the country to create, produce, and present programs to tap and encourage that appeal. In 1996, for example, the NEA supported significant programs such as the Delaware Theater Co., the Atlanta Ballet, the Tulsa Philharmonic Society, the University of Southern Mississippi's Folk and Traditional Arts Program, and the International Association of Jazz Educators. 
Countless other examples can be cited. Federal support for the arts has clearly made a large difference in communities across the country. The current Federal role is significant, and it has overwhelming support in every State. Families want their children to visit symphonies and museums. They want to enjoy theater and dance. The arts are more than a diversion or entertainment. They are educational and enriching, and their central place in the Nation's life and experiences should be supported and increased. 
The Conference of Mayors has strongly endorsed the Arts Endowment. These local officials, who know their communities best, clearly understand the positive role of the arts. They know that the arts contribute to the vitality of their locality, and increase its economic base as well. 
In Massachusetts, the arts community is thriving and dynamic. A wealth of cultural and educational activities is available to every citizen. These activities also attract tourists to our State. Recently, the Museum of Science presented its hugely successful Leonardo da Vinci exhibition. A major retrospective on Picasso's early years is about to open at the Museum of Fine Arts. Many of my colleagues, I am sure, had the opportunity to see this extraordinary exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. The Endowment's support helped to make this dramatic exhibition possible. 
People in every State treasure their own arts institutions and arts programs in the same way. Whatever the size of the State or community, the impact of the arts is significant and indisputable, from the youngest child to the oldest senior citizen. 
Leaders in State and local institutions across the country are convinced that support by the Arts Endowment has been a significant part of their success. Federal aid is seed money. It has never been intended to replace State or local or private support for the arts. But it has often been a critical component in the overall development and success of countless local institutions. 
In many communities, the Federal role has been indispensable, especially in disseminating innovative programs to institutions that might not have the resources to develop and produce their own programs. 
Arts education is an excellent example of this impact. Music is an especially effective tool in developing the discipline and the learning potential of students. Recent studies by the college board show that students who have studied 4 years of music or more do significantly better in both their math and verbal scores on standard SAT tests. 
Let me just repeat that. The studies by the college board show that students who have studied 4 years of music or more do significantly better in both their math and verbal scores on standard SAT tests--up to about 50 points more. 
You would find it extremely difficult to point to any single particular educational program that results in that kind of a bump in terms of educational achievement and accomplishment. But there it is. There are the statistics. And it should not be any mystery. 
We know, for example, for 300 years the Greeks had the greatest mathematicians in the world. It is interesting to note that the reason that they had the greatest mathematicians in the world is that they taught their youngest children mathematics through the arts and through music--for 300 years. 
I have 10 schools in my own city of Boston where the Conservatory of Music is working with those schools to try and provide the same kinds of initiative in terms of the music and the math that was used many hundreds of years ago with phenomenal success. 
I remember being in the Trotter School in Boston with Larry Lesser, who is probably one of the world's great cellists, and the time he was working in an inner-city school and working with those inner-city children in terms of enhancing their academic achievement and accomplishment. You would, as I say, rarely find a particular educational program that would have that kind of result. 
We are all looking to what is going to be magical in terms of education, that is going to enhance academic achievement. We have the results in with regard to those students who study music for 4 or more years and how that has enhanced children who have that 4 or 5 years of study in their academic achievement. And it is out there for all of us to see. 
So it is not only an issue that we are talking about in terms of the value of the arts, in terms of the culture, and the values which we value in our society, but it is very, very tangible and a very important component in terms of education. 
We have some important alterations and changes in the authorization to try and enhance and build on that in the reauthorization which Senator Jeffords and I have been strongly supportive of. 
We should be doing more, not less, for the arts. The heavy-handed attempt by the House Republican leadership to eliminate the Arts Endowment should be categorically rejected, and it is gratifying that President Clinton has pledged to veto any bill that reaches his desk that attempts to do so. In fact, many of the agency's strongest and most effective supporters are on the Republican side of the aisle. 
Congress should start listening to the people and stop bashing this small agency. When we listen to the exaggerated protests of the critics, it is hard to remember that we are talking about a program that costs each taxpayer 37 cents a year. 
We have already taken a full range of steps to see that the agency operates as effectively and responsibly as possible. It is time to support fair funding for this important agency, and give it the solid vote of confidence it deserves. 
Mr. President, I remember last year--maybe others do--when we had the Vermeer exhibition at the National Gallery. It was in the wintertime. I remember over a weekend going down to try and visit that exhibit on a cold and blustery day and getting there on a Sunday morning at 8 or 9 o'clock in the morning, and seeing the lines there four blocks long, people outside waiting 4 hours. 
Finally, when I was able to get in there a number of people came up and spoke to me just quietly saying to me, `Senator, we hope you will tell Members in the Congress and the Senate that we value the arts. We are prepared to wait for the 3 or 4 hours outside to see this extraordinary exhibit of the arts.' 
Whether the National Endowment supported that particular exhibit or not, it is doing otherwise, primarily in exhibits that might not have as high a visibility as the Vermeer exhibit but certainly still bringing the value of those programs to the American people. 
Mr. President, in his 1960 campaign for President, President Kennedy discussed the close historical relationship between great achievement in public life and great achievement in the arts. He said, `There is a connection, hard to explain logically but easy to feel, between achievement in public life and progress in the arts. The age of Pericles was also the age of Phidias. The age of Lorenzo de Medici was also the age of Leonardo da Vinci. The age of Elizabeth also the age of Shakespeare. And the New Frontier for which I campaign in public life, can also be a new frontier for American arts.' 
Three years later, as President, in a major address at Amherst College in October 1963, he said this:  
I look forward to an America which will reward achievement in the arts as we reward achievement in business or statecraft. I look forward to an America which will steadily raise the standard of artistic accomplishment and which will steadily enlarge cultural opportunities for all our citizens. And I look forward to an America which commands respect throughout the world not only for its strength but for its civilization as well. 
Those are timeless goals. They apply to our own day and generation as well. I urge the Senate to heed them, to give the arts in America the strong support they so eminently deserve. 
Mr. President, I have one further observation. Yesterday one of the critics of the Endowment raised the issue of elitism and cited a grant to my State as an example of the elitist focus of the National Endowment for the Arts. 
Well, I agree. This grant--to the Phillips Academy--is a perfect example. It is an example of a worthwhile program--and an example of the distortion that critics of the agency rely on to make their specious arguments. 
The Addison Gallery of American Art, which is affiliated with Phillips, applied for a NEA grant as the lead members of a consortium. The grant seeks support for a project entitled `To Conserve a Legacy: American Art From Historically Black Colleges.' The other consortia organizations are Clark Atlanta University, Fisk University, Hampton University, Howard University, North Carolina Central University, the Studio Museum of Harlem, and the Williamstown Art Conservation Center. 
Art work from each of the five participating black colleges and universities will be selected for conservation and inclusion in the exhibit which will travel to Clark, Hampton, Howard, and the Studio Museum of Harlem, in addition to the Addison. 
The works in the exhibition will represent artists such as Romare Beardon, Sam Gilliam, Jacob Lawrence, and others. And one component of the project is a year-long training program in which minority students will be selected by the participating universities to work on-site for one school year during the selection and conservation of the art work. 
This is one of those grants that is going to Massachusetts--yes, it is, but its scope and audience and impact is national. And the funds were matched on a 3-to-1 basis. 
I believe that this grant is not only defensive but also commendable. And I think those that have criticized this grant as an elitist grant will take a second look.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the National Endowment for the Arts has been accused of elistism. But the true record of the Endowment is far different. It is a record of diversity, excellence, and outreach. 
The Endowment has been supportive of national efforts of the Country Music Foundation. The Endowment supported their commission of the Thomas Hart Benton famous last painting `Sources of Country Music' through its Art in Public Places Program. The painting is on display, it has traveled the Southeast, and has been exhibited in a vast array of venues from the Hirshhorn Museum to the cafeteria of the Nissan Plant in Nashville, TN. 
Another grant in the late 1970's catalyzed fundraising for a major country music discography of the early 78 rpm recordings from 1922 through the 1940's. The project is just being completed today. 
Again, in the 1980's, the NEA supported an educational kit entitled `Tennessee Traditions' distributed to every public school in Tennessee. One of the components of the kit was a folk music tape. 
Each year the Arts Endowment honors National Heritage Fellows. The fellows are from a wide variety of disciplines of the folk and traditional arts. Among the honorees this year are bluegrass musicians Jim and Jesse McReynolds of Tennessee; Gladys LeBlanc Clark who is a Cajun weaver from Louisiana; blacksmith Francis Whitaker from Carbondale, CO; Hystercine Rankin, a quilter from Lorman, MS; and Ramon Jose Lopex, a metalsmith from Santa Fe, NM. 
These honorees will be honored next week at a White House ceremony and will perform and celebrate their work. The National Heritage Fellowships are the Nation's most prestigious recognition of accomplishment in the folk and traditional arts. And it is an NEA program. 
Another traditional program that owes early and critical support to the NEA is the Cowboy Poets Festival. In the early 1980's Elko, NV, was chosen as the site for the Western Folklife Center. It was established in the center of the ranching community to celebrate its culture and folk traditions. 
They approached the NEA for support when corporate sponsors and other funders were hard to come by. With NEA support in 1985, the first cowboys festival got underway, with about 60 poets and approximately 1,000 audience members. 
Today, corporate supporters join the NEA to support the festival and the center and this year's festival welcomed 8,000 attendees. 
Support for the folk and traditional arts continues at the Arts Endowment. This year the Endowment has funded the Southern Arts Federation's `Southern Connections,' which is a 2-year training and touring program to support indigenous southern artists. 
The Endowment also supported the West Virginia Folk Arts Apprenticeship program; the Creative Arts Guild of Dalton, GA; and the Alabama Folklife Association. The grant to Alabama will support the publication of documentation of primitive Baptist hymn singing through a publication, cassette recordings, and compact discs. 
The Endowment also funded Appalshop, Inc., Roadside Theater in Whitesburg, KY. This grant will work with the theater and a consortium of the Performing Arts League/Prairie Mountain Players of Choteau, MT, and Community Connection of Austin, TX, to develop, test, and document a nationally applicable model for the creation of rural drama. 
I hope that, as we debate the appropriate funding level for the National Endowment for the Arts, we can be fair about its record, and responsive to the overwhelming need across America for the programs that the Endowment supports. 
In many ways, in so many communities, the NEA is a lifeline of financial stability. 
I urge my colleagues to oppose the seemingly relentless attacks of the critics and support the record of the Endowment. Let's support full funding for this small, but worthy, Federal program.

Mr. KENNEDY. I am pleased to join with Senator Hatch in sponsoring legislation requested by Mother Teresa to waive visa application fees for religious workers coming to the United States to perform charitable work for temporary periods. 
During her visits to the United States, Mother Teresa asked President Clinton to take this step to waive visa fees for her missionaries coming to work in this country. Her Missionaries of Charity come to America to help the poor in our communities and to minister to the sick and the elderly. Each time they travel here, they are required to pay a $120 visa fee to the U.S. Government. 
It makes no sense to require these religious workers to pay a fee to the Federal Government in order to come here to help our communities. The legislation we introduce today would waive the fee in these instances. 
This past weekend, while attending Mother Teresa's funeral in India, the First Lady met with Sister Nirmala, Mother Teresa's successor at the Missionaries of Charity Order in Calcutta. Sister Nirmala asked once again for a waiver of the visa fee and was delighted to learn that the U.S. Senate would be considering legislation this week to accomplish this goal as Mother Teresa had requested. 
This is an important step that Congress can take to honor the memory of Mother Theresa and the compassionate work that her order brings to America. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, an educated work force has become the most valuable resource in the modern economy. Our Nation's long term economic vitality depends on the creation of an effective, accessible, and accountable system of job training and career development which is open to all our citizens. Schools must assume more responsibility for preparing their students to meet the challenges of the 21st century workplace. Disadvantaged adults and out of school youth need the opportunity to develop job skills which will make them productive members of the community. Dislocated workers who have been displaced by the rapid pace of technological change deserve the chance to pursue new careers. The way in which we respond to these challenges today will determine how prosperous a nation we are in the next century. 
The importance of highly developed employment skills has never been greater. The gap in earnings between skilled and unskilled workers is steadily widening. For those who enter the work force with good academic training and well developed career skills, this new economy offers almost unlimited potential. However, for those who lack basic proficiency in language, math and science and who have no career skills, the new economy presents an increasingly hostile environment. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act which I am introducing with Senators Jeffords, DeWine, and Wellstone will provide employment training opportunities for millions of Americans. It responds to the challenge of the changing workplace by enabling men and women to both acquire the skills necessary to enter the work force and upgrade their skills throughout their careers. It will provide access to the educational tools that will enable them not only to keep up, but to get ahead. 
The legislation which we will be introducing represents a true collaboration of our four offices. I want to publicly commend Senators Jeffords and DeWine for the genuine spirit of bipartisanship which has made this collaborative effort possible. Senator Wellstone and I appreciate it. Over the last 6 months, each of us has devoted an enormous amount of time and effort to fashioning a legislative consensus which will truly expand career options, encourage greater program innovation, and facilitate cooperative efforts amongst business, labor, education, and State and local government. While each of us can cite provisions in this bill which we would like to change, we all believe that the Workforce Investment Partnership Act will accomplish our principal goals. 
I also want to recognize the important role President Clinton has played in bringing about this dramatic reform of our current job training system. He has consistently emphasized the need for greater individual choice in the selection of career paths and training providers. The philosophy behind the skill grant proposal is reflected in our legislation. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act is designed to provide easy access to state of the art employment training programs which are geared to real job opportunities in the community. The cornerstones of this new system are individual choice and quality labor market information. In the past, men and women seeking new careers often did not know what job skills were most in demand and which training programs had the best performance record. All to often, they were forced to make one of the most important decisions in their lives based on anecdotes and late-night advertisements. 
No training system can function effectively without accurate and timely information. The frequent unavailability of quality labor market information is one of the most serious flaws in the current system. In order to make sound career choices, prospective trainees need both detailed information on local career opportunities and performance based information on training providers. That information will now be available at easily accessible one stop employment centers, along with career counseling and other employment services. The legislation places a strong emphasis on providing information about what area industries are growing, what skills those jobs require, and what earning potential they have. Extensive business community participation is encouraged in developing this information. Once a career choice is made, the individual must still select a training provider. At present, many applicants make that choice with a little or no reliable information. Under our bill, each training provider will have to publicly report graduation rates, job placement and retention rates, and average earnings of graduates. 
Because of the extensive information which will be available to each applicant, real consumer choice in the selection of a career and of a training provider will be possible. The legislation establishes individual training accounts for eligible participants, which they can use to access career education and skill training programs. Men and women seeking training assistance will no longer be limited to a few predetermined options. As long as there are real job opportunities in the field selected and the training provider meets established performance standards, the individual will be free to choose which option best suits his or her needs. 
This legislation will organize the delivery of services more effectively and utilize resources more creatively. There will be a significant consolidation of the dozens of narrowly focused programs which currently exist into several broad funding streams for the distinct populations needing assistance. Consolidation makes sense in those areas in which multiple programs are currently serving the same population. However, it is equally important to preserve separate streams of funding for distinct populations. The programmatic needs of middle age dislocated workers with extensive employment histories are quite different from the services required by young adults with limited skills and no work histories. Similarly the problems faced by out of school youth require very different solutions than those confronting the adult population. Ensuring that services which are designed to meet the needs of each of these populations are available is a Federal responsibility. For that reason, this legislation maintains distinct programs with separate appropriations for dislocated workers, disadvantaged adults, and at risk youth. 
The WIPA gives State and local government significantly enhanced discretion in designing their training systems. If this reform is to be truly responsive to those at the community level who are in need of services, it is essential that the authority which the Federal Government delegates to the States be exercised through a broad based decisionmaking process. Governors, State legislatures, mayors, and other county and local officials should all have a meaningful voice in the design of a State's new job training system and they will under this legislation. Local boards of business, labor, education and community leaders are--in my opinion--essential to insuring that programs meet the real world needs of participants, and that the training programs correspond to labor market demands. The success we have had a Massachusetts has been due to large measure to active participation by local business leaders on the regional employment boards. WIPA strengthens the role of such boards, giving them major new policy making responsibilities. These boards will play the primary role in assuring that training programs address the actual employment needs of area businesses. 
An essential element of the new system we have designed in accountability. As I noted earlier, each training provider will have to monitor and report the job placement and retention achieved by its graduates and their average earnings. Only those training programs that meet an acceptable performance standard will remain eligible for receipt of public funds. The same principle of accountability is applied to those agencies administering State and local programs. They are being given wide latitude to innovate under this legislation. But they too will be held accountable if they programs fail to meet challenging performance targets. 
There is no challenge facing America today which is tougher or more important than providing at risk, often out of school, youth with meaningful education and employment opportunities. Far too many of our teenagers are being left behind without the skills needed to survive in the 21st century economy. I am particularly proud of the commitment which the Workforce Investment Partnership Act makes to these young men and women. This legislation authorizes a new initiative focused on teenagers living in the most impoverished communities in America. These areas range from the poorest neighborhoods of our largest cities to impoverished rural counties. Each year, the Secretary of Labor will award grants from a $250 million fund to innovative programs designed to provide opportunities to youth living in these areas. The programs will emphasize mentoring, strong links between academic and worksite learning, and job placement and retention. It will encourage broad based community participation from local service agencies and area employers. These model programs will, we believe, identify the techniques which are most effective in reaching those youth at greatest risk. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act includes titles reauthorizing major vocational education and adult literacy programs. Both programs will continue to be separately funded and independently administered. We have incorporated them in the Workplace Act because they must be integral components of any comprehensive 
strategy to prepare to meet the demands of the 21st century workplace. Students who participate in vocational education must be provided with broad based career preparation courses which meet both high academic standards and teach state of the art technological skills. Adult literacy programs are essential for the 27 percent of the adult population who have not earned a high school diploma or its equivalent. Learning to read and communicate effectively are the first steps to career advancement. In vocational education and adult literacy, we are placing the same emphasis on program accountability which we did in job training. 
The Workforce Investment Partnership Act we are introducing today will make it possible for millions of Americans to gain the skills needed to compete in a global economy. In doing so, we are also enabling them to realize their personal American dreams. 
In closing, I want to recognize the important contribution which Stephen Springer, a key member of my staff during the 104th Congress, played in the evolution of job training reform. Tragically, he died at a young age after a courageous battle with cancer. He believed that the type of innovative work force development system which this legislation would create had the potential to open doors of opportunity for millions of Americans. His commitment was extraordinary. He continued to work on this issue even as his health was failing. He is no longer with us, but he continues to inspire us. Stephen Springer's creative vision of a work force development system equal to the challenges of the 21st century economy is reflected in the Workforce Investment Partnership Act. When enacted, it will be a wonderful legacy for this extraordinary individual.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from Illinois for reminding us how important this debate is here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We are talking about the agency of Government that has the prime responsibility for protecting the health of the American consumer. We all have an interest in making sure that medical products are available earlier. Every one of our families have benefited from the innovation and resourcefulness of the medical device industry and from the advances of pharmaceuticals. I doubt there is any Member of the body that has not. So all of us want to be able to make sure that medical advances will be available to the American public. 
We are in a situation today where the United States through the FDA is leading the world, in terms of approving new drugs as well as medical devices. That has changed from recent years. I think all of us have seen some very dramatic and important progress made in recent years. As I have said many times before, I want to give a tribute to the chairman of our committee who has worked tirelessly on this issue. He has brought together those individuals on our committee and outside that have differing views, all struggling to try and advance the interest of the public health. I think he has made remarkable progress in moving us forward to where we are today. But there are important remaining items that I hope we can dispose of in the Senate within a reasonable time period so that the process could move forward. I take exception from the understanding of the language that has been included in this bill with regard to ensuring that the consumers of medical devices and users of medical devices have the kind of protection that has been referred to here by my friend and colleague, the Senator from Connecticut, and others. 
I have here, Mr. President, a letter from the Secretary of Health and Human Services, which indicates that they have four major concerns with this particular legislation. One of them was 
the area of cosmetics. Another area is environmental considerations, and another area is device manufacturing procedures. But the other important area is the one that I am going to address here today, and that is what I call the safety issue, the fen/phen issue as it applies to medical devices. 
The Secretary, speaking for the President of the United States, has identified this as being a major issue. So when others gather around and say, `Look, we have debated this and discussed it, why are we bringing these matters up in this debate at this time?' The reason that we are bringing it up is, as the Secretary of Health and Human Services has recognized, there are very powerful health consequences we ought to take note of and deal with and that we ought to alter and change. 
It isn't only the Secretary of HEW. Here is the National Women's Health Network, who points out: 
The network is extremely concerned with the section 404, which prevents FDA from requiring medical device companies to perform complete reviews on the safety and effectiveness of a medical device. This must be amended to give FDA the authority to verify that the label is not false or misleading. Section 404 is a serious danger to women's health, which must be fixed before S. 830 is acted upon by the Senate. 
Then the Patients' Coalition indicates a similar concern. It outlines probably eight or nine major issues and section 404 is one of them. 
The Consumer Federation of America wrote: 
We are writing in support of your amendment to change section 404 to prevent serious injuries to patients and consumers from medical devices with false or misleading labels. 
This isn't just the Senator from Massachusetts that is saying this. Here is the Secretary of HEW saying it. Here are the primary groups defending women's health and consumers' health, all who have joined in recognizing the dangers that this particular provision provides, and why it is so important that we are going to change it and alter it. 
The Consumer Federation says: 
Section 404 has been crafted to permit medical device manufacturers of class II devices to limit FDA's review of the safety and effectiveness of a device based upon conditions of use listed on the label. Even if it were clear from the device's technical characteristics that its real use would be for risky purposes, FDA would be prevented from looking beyond the conditions of use on the label. 
There it is. That is what the issue is. The Consumer Federation understands it. They are pointing out that 404 was crafted to permit the device manufacturers of class 2 devices to limit FDA's review of the safety and effectiveness of a device based upon conditions of use listed on the label. Even if it were clear from the device's technical characteristics that its real use would be for risky purposes, FDA would be prevented from looking beyond the conditions of use of the labels. 
That is what we are addressing, Mr. President, and why this is important. Mr. President, all we have to do is look at today's newspapers. Look at this morning's newspapers, the Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, all across the Nation, talking about the off-label use of pharmaceuticals, those pharmaceuticals that were used on an off-label basis. That is similar to the issue we are talking about here today with regard to medical devices, the off-label use of medical devices. 
But the issue that we have before the Senate this afternoon is more insidious. Why? Because it says that if a medical device company is submitting an application for a certain use, FDA can't look at any other uses even if there is a clear intention--and we are glad to spell out what that criteria would be--for example predominant use--to use the device or market the device for another use. That is what we are interested in--having FDA look at the safety and efficacy of a use clearly intended by the design of the medical device. 
I am going to illustrate this in just a few moments. The issue is whether the FDA has the authority to look at whether that medical device has been tested for the off-label use, which is the clear intention of the medical device company. And the answer is, no, they cannot. This isn't off-label use of two products that are being put together and then prescribed by various medical professions. This is the guardian of the American public, the FDA, that is being denied the ability to look beyond the label at the technological differences of a device in terms of safety and effectiveness. That is the issue. 
Now, there are those that say--and we heard the argument by my friend from Connecticut--that FDA inherently retains that power. If they do, let's spell it out. If we spell it out, we haven't got a problem. But the Secretary of HEW does not believe they have the inherent power. The Consumer Federation doesn't believe they have the inherent power. The various patient groups don't believe they have the inherent power. The various groups that are out there protecting the public, virtually none of them believe they have the inherent power. If they have it, let's spell it out. We can work that language out. We have been attempting to do that for a considerable period of time, but we have not been able to do so. 
The answer on the other side is, well, we can't anticipate every possible use that a medical device might have and we are not going to submit safety data for every possible use and that FDA shouldn't get in the minds of various doctors using that medical device, for whatever purpose. That is not the argument. That will be the argument you will hear out here on the floor of the Senate. That isn't what we are talking about. 
We are talking about a limited number of medical device companies that will go to FDA and abuse this process because they are able to get through the process with a label that in so many respects matches a previously approved one, but the medical device has an entirely different technology that clearly indicates a different intended use. That is what we are talking about. 
For example, the new lasers that are being approved by the FDA labeled as general lasers that are for cutting various tissue, but clearly designed to treat prostate cancer. We want the FDA to be able to say, if you are going to use that for prostate cancer, we want to make sure that it is safe and efficacious. We don't want to permit the medical device industry to submit false and misleading statements. 
That is a powerful statement. But I daresay if they are going to submit a statement that says they are going to use a particular medical device for one purpose and FDA can demonstrate that the company has intended the device for another purpose, and they are already involved in, advertising and promoting that particular medical device in countries all over Europe for an entirely different purpose, I say that is false and misleading. The Members of the U.S. Senate are going to have a chance to decide whether or not they are going to stand and say we will not permit the medical device industry to submit false and misleading information on labeling. We will see how that vote will go. 
We include false and misleading under what they call the PMA's, which means the various medical devices that have to go through a more elaborate procedure. We have protections against false and misleading advertising on that. But we are going to say that the American public shouldn't be assured that when the medical device industry submits a particular product, that they do not submit information that is false and misleading. And what we mean by that is that they have an intention to use that various medical device for an entirely different purpose for which there have not been adequate safety standards established or safety records advanced. That is the issue, Mr. President. 
That is a very, very important health issue. It is a very important one. You can say it is only one section out of a whole piece of legislation, but it is very important. First of all, let me review very quickly about how medical devices are approved in the FDA, so that we understand and put this into some criteria. 
I want to go through examples of some of the problems that we are facing today. I'd like to let the American people make judgments and decisions about whether they think adequate safety information should be available for digital mammography and digital diagnostic x rays. Let the American people judge whether these devices should be used in surveying women who may have cancer when they haven't been approved for that. 
Mr. President, let's get back to where we are today. In the light of today's revelations about fen/phen should we be thinking about a provision in this bill that would allow device manufacturers to get their products approved for off-label use on the basis of a false and misleading label. 
There are two stories in the Wall Street Journal--one yesterday and one today--as well as one in the Post today, which tell us why the Senate should give a resounding `no' to this fen/phen device division. 
The first article explains in detail how an unscrupulous drug company engaged in a broad conspiracy to illegally promote the use of a product for treatments that have not been shown to be safe and effective. This conspiracy involved the laundering of money, deceptive deals, and hospital physicians' coercion of honest employees who objected to these corrupt practices. Fortunately, companies which engage in these kind of fraudulent practices are the exception rather than the rule. But it is precisely the exceptions that make a strong FDA so critical. 
The second story outlines the tragic results of off-label use of two approved drugs, dexfenfluramine and fenfluramine. These two drugs, used in unapproved combination for weight reduction, were found to have caused irreversible heart damage in thousands of women. In addition, there are early revelations that fenfluramine phentermine, known as fen/phen, had also caused severe heart damage. 
This is truly appalling--women receiving medical assistance for weight reduction, assistance they have been led to believe was entirely safe but which has not been tested adequately for that use--ended up suffering severe heart damage. 
The provision that is before us, rather than increasing protection for American consumers against products that have not been safe and effective, would actually reduce those protections. It would permit a device manufacturer to design a product for one use and falsely claim on the label submitted to the FDA that the device was for a different use. The FDA would be barred from protecting consumers. It would require the FDA to accept the manufacturer's label at face value. The FDA under this legislation has to accept the labeling that the manufacturer has put forward, even if it were false or misleading. Fen/phen should teach us that the American consumers deserve to be protected against unsafe product uses. But the provision before us goes in exactly the opposite direction. That is why the President has threatened to veto it. That is why a broad coalition of consumer health groups oppose it. And that is why the Senate should reject it. 
Mr. President, as we know, there are two categories of medical devices. Let me give a brief explanation of how the FDA regulates and clears medical devices for marketing. It will help clarify the need for this amendment. 
Under the current law, the manufacturers of new class I and class II devices get their products onto the market by showing that they are substantially equivalent to devices already on the market. For example, the manufacturer of a new laser can get that laser onto the market if it can show the FDA that the laser is substantially equivalent to a laser that is already on the market. 
Similarly, the manufacturer of a new biopsy needle can get that biopsy needle onto the market by showing that it is substantially equivalent to a needle already on the market. These manufacturers are obligated to demonstrate substantial equivalence to the FDA by showing that the new product has the same intended use as the old product, and that the new product has the same 
technological characteristics as the old product. If the new product has different technological characteristics, these characteristics must not raise new types of safety and effectiveness questions in order for the product to still be substantially equivalent to the older product. 
So, if the product is substantially equivalent and doesn't raise new safety effectiveness questions, it moves on through. The logic of the process for bringing medical devices onto the market is simple. If the product is very much like an existing product, it can get to market quickly, but if it raises new safety or effectiveness questions, those questions should be answered before it gets on the market. 
This process for getting new medical devices on the market, commonly known as the 510(k) process, is considered by most to be the easier route to the market. That process accounts for how 95 percent of all devices get to the market. Devices that are not substantially equivalent class I or class II devices already on market must go through a full premarket review. Thus, device manufacturers have an incentive to get new products on the market through the 510(k) process. In fact, well over 90 percent of the new devices get on the market through the submission of a 510(k) application. Section 404 of the bill prohibits the FDA from requiring safety and effectiveness data on any device following the 510(k) route except for uses the manufacturer chooses to put on the label, even if the label is false and misleading--even if the manufacturer says, `We are just going to use it for cutting tissue, we are not going to use it for prostate cancer,' knowing full well that they intend to use it for prostate cancer. All the world knows that they are going to use that device for prostate cancer. The FDA is prohibited from saying, `Let us see where the safety is.' Where is the safety information on that? That, Mr. President, is the issue. 
Let me give you a few more examples. 
On the biopsy needle for breast tumors, the needle is labeled for performing a biopsy. But the design clearly indicates that it is designed to remove tumors. Here you have a case where you have a small needle with a very narrow opening at the one end which is used for testing a biopsy of a particular tumor. Now the manufacturer comes in with a much broader needle, a much wider needle, and says, `Look, our needle is for the same thing, just to biopsy the tumor.' The design clearly indicates that it is built to remove tumors. Under the bill language, FDA could not ask for safety and efficacy data for the needle's use for tumor removal, even though that is clearly indicated by the designer of the device. The company comes in, and says, `Look, we have a biopsy needle right here. Sure, ours is a little larger. But this biopsy needle is really absolutely intended to do the same thing as the others out there and, therefore, we are substantially equivalent,' even though they are out there advertising that this needle can be used for removing a tumor. They don't have to provide any safety information about how safe or effective that device is for the removal procedure. 
There is also the `laser for cutting' issue. The labeled use is for general cutting. But the laser has been adapted specifically and clearly to cut prostate tissue. Under the bill language, FDA could not ask for safety and efficacy data for cutting prostate tissue. 
Digital mammography is currently approved and labeled for diagnostic x rays--which are used to confirm the suspicion of a breast tumor. If digital mammography is clearly going to be used for screening, based on the design of the instrument, which requires a higher degree of accuracy, FDA should be able to look at the effectiveness of that technology for that use. Without this assurance, too many women may undergo biopsies or be misdiagnosed. But this bill would prevent FDA from asking for the data needed to protect women. 
Orthopedic implants--plates and screws for long bones--some implants are made to be removed after the bone has healed and, 
therefore, labeled for short-term use. But if the FDA determines from the design of the device, or from the particular materials that the implant will clearly be left in the patient on a long-term basis, FDA should be able to ask for safety and efficacy data. For example, how does the bone react to having the implant there over a long period of time? Is the bone weaker? But this bill would prevent the FDA from asking these questions. 
Mr. President, I can go on, and will go on when we have the more general debate. But these stories exemplify the issue. The issue is safety. The issue is protecting the safety of the American consumer in regards to the use of medical devices which clearly demonstrate that the dominant use of those medical devices differs from what is put on the label. 
It would surely seem to me that men and women of reason would be able to work this out in a spirit of order to provide those protections. But we have been unable to do so. Being unable to do so we should understand the real implications. As when you have the off-label use of fen/phen, and the concern of the American people and all of the newspapers all over the country. You would think that here in the U.S. Senate we would be thinking about how we are going to provide further protections for the American people instead of fewer protections. Here in this particular medical device provision, we are hamstringing the FDA and its ability to gather data on safety and efficacy when it is so clear that the devices are going to be used for in a manner that differs from the one claimed. 
That is why many of us--not only the administration, but many public health groups and organizations that represent women--have been so concerned about this issue. 
I withhold the remainder of my time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I just say to my good friend from Indiana, as well as the Senator from Vermont, I think if we could work this particular provision out we would probably be able to end this legislation today--tonight. I think this is really the last remaining major issue. 
I know the Senator mentions the cosmetic issue and then this new issue was raised. This was one of the four items that were identified in the President's letter. I have identified this issue previously. We had a brief discussion on section 404 during the cosmetic debate. 
But this, I believe, is really the last issue. There are other issues that other colleagues have spoken about, but I urge early time considerations if we are able to resolve this legislation. I shall try to do the best I can to continue to work on these issues. 
If I can ask consent to have 1 more minute and then 1 more minute on his side, too? I ask unanimous consent to have 1 more minute on either side.

Mr. KENNEDY. We will try to work with the Senator hoping that we might now be able to work something out that will meet both the legitimate objectives that the Senator has and the concerns that I have discussed and share with the administration. I am not suggesting that FDA read the minds of all the device companies and determine every conceivable way that a device might be used. Instead that they be limited to the very narrow case where there is a predominant or dominant use or clearly defined use that would be intended that was not on the label. Perhaps an advisory group could make these decisions. I am not interested in trying to anticipate every possible use, just in those very narrow areas which I think pose a threat. 
I will try to explore a compromise with both the Chair and the Senator. We are going to the Interior bill and then come back to the FDA reform bill, but as I indicated to Senator Jeffords earlier I thought there could be a very timely disposition of all of the remaining amendments.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with all due respect to my friend and colleague, the majority leader, the fact of the matter is by the votes that we had last week requiring that we have some opportunity to examine a very important provision--and that is the preemption of various States' ability to protect their public--we have seen a rather dramatic change in the language of the provision that will continue to permit the States to protect their public. That was very important for the protection of the American public. I know that there are some people around here who want to see the trains run on time. But some of us--not only those of us here but the National Governors' Conference, the public health organizations, the women's network organizations that deal with women's health issues--a wide range of consumers believe, quite deeply, that we are absolutely within our rights to make sure that this provision was offered and changed, and we did so. And, by doing so, the public health interest is preserved. 
Now here we are on the floor of the U.S. Senate the morning after having seen the headlines from two national journals--yesterday in the Wall Street Journal, talking about a particular prescription drug called fen/phen, that had been moved through, rushed through the FDA. It has been linked to everything from brain damage in animals to primary pulmonary hypertension; a rare but fatal lung disease; millions of Americans tried the drugs to slim down; some 60 million people worldwide were estimated to have taken the drug; the straw that broke the camel's back was a heart valve problem which now has been widely recognized. 
Here is an item in the Washington Post. Two diet drugs are pulled off the market. Why? Because the products were used for purposes for which the drug was not approved. 
We are talking about an identical provision in this body with regard to medical devices--the use of the medical device for purposes for which it has not been approved. 
We have seen the whole world being awakened to this particular health problem. Some of us are trying to making sure that we don't have headlines like this in 3 months, 4 months, or 6 months with regard to the medical device issue. That is what we are talking about. 
Mr. President, I would just point out that there are about six little words that, if the majority would be willing to accept, would move us right ahead, and get us very short time agreements on the other elements. 
Let me just point out. Mr. President, there are the two provisions with regard to medical devices--one they call class II--devices which represent about 5 percent of the devices. Those are the new devices. 
In the language of this bill, it says, whether or not there is reasonable assurance of safety effectiveness, if the proposed labeling is neither false nor misleading. 
`Neither false nor misleading,' that is in regard to class III devices. But, if you look at class I and II devices with regard to the representations that are made involving the FDA, there is no such language. 
If the majority will take the language that we propose for class III and apply that to class I and II, we will call this cloture vote off. What person in the United States of America wants to permit medical devices to be approved if we cannot have agreement by the manufacturers that their statements to the FDA reflect the true uses for the devices? 
My goodness, are we in that big of a hurry? That is why this issue is important. Now, the majority leader says we have just one more item. We are glad to deal with this issue, and we have offered compromise language to deal with it. It is of vital importance and we will have a chance later to discuss the health hazards associated with it. The medical device industry, which has been enormously cooperative in working out other provisions on this, had refused to go along with our proposed language. Medical device labeling has important health implications. 
You can rush this through and say the rest of the bill is fine. It is fine. Senator Jeffords and his Republican colleagues deserve great credit. My Democratic colleagues deserve great credit. But do we have to be reminded again that the FDA has the responsibility for the protection of the public health. If we do, we don't need to look any father than reading this mornings newspapers. All we are saying is let's not do with medical devices what was done with regard to these diet medicines. I think that is an important health matter. So do the overwhelming majority of patient coalitions and public health coalitions. 
If the industry wants to debate that, we are going to take the time to debate it. If there are Members on the floor of the U.S. Senate who want to take the position that we don't need this change in the bill language on medical device regulation, let them make that case on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Because that is the case they are going to have to make, because the amendment has been filed. If the majority indicates they will accept that, that's all fine and well. Our amendment will ensure that FDA is able to comprehensively examine the safety of medical devices. We will move through this legislation very rapidly indeed. But this is one Senator who is not prepared to roll over on that issue. We will have the opportunity during the course of this morning or this afternoon or tonight or tomorrow, or however long it takes, to go through the various instances where medical device labeling could pose an important and significant public health threat, a threat to the American people. 
There may be those who do not think this is an important issue. I believe the overwhelming majority of the American public will think so. As they are reading their papers this morning and listening to those who say, let's rush this bill on through, I would think some Americans would say, let's take another look at what we have in this legislation, particularly with regard to the medical device provisions. 
Mr. President, with all respect to my friend and colleague, we have talked about this. Senator Durbin has talked about sections 404 and 406. This particular issue is the key issue. 
If we can get the language in the bill ensuring that we will not permit the medical device industry to restrict the FDA's ability to make a full study of medical device safety, I think we would move ahead with the legislation. 
I withhold the remainder of my time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to join Senator Abraham, the chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, in introducing legislation to extend the Visa Waiver Program for 5 additional years. The programs serves the Nation well, and deserves to be extended. 
I am particularly pleased that the bill we introduce today would create a pilot program to expand the number of countries able to participate in the Visa Waiver Program. I am optimistic that Portugal, for example, will qualify for the waiver program under the legislation which Senator Abraham and I propose today. I have advocated Portugal's inclusion in this program for several years because of the close ties between the people of Massachusetts and that country. Its inclusion in this program will allow Portuguese citizens to come to the United States to visit relatives or conduct trade and business without facing the often time-consuming task of obtaining a visa. 
This Visa Waiver Program started as a pilot program in 1988 with only one country, the United Kingdom. Today, it has grown into an important part of overall U.S. immigration policy. Twenty-five countries now qualify for the program, and it brings significant benefits to the United States as well as to visitors from those nations. 
Almost half of those who visit the United States for business or tourism now enter under this program. Billions of dollars in international transactions are facilitated by the ease of travel that it makes available. According to the Travel Industry Association of America, tourists coming to this country under the program contribute $84 billion to the economy and help support 947,000 American jobs in the tourist industry. 
The Visa Waiver Program also strengthens immigration enforcement. Rather than spending tax dollars to conduct needless visa interviews, the program enables us to concentrate scarce resources on the serious immigration problems of keeping criminals and terrorists out and dealing more effectively with visa fraud. As a result of the program, millions of dollars and hundreds of consular personnel have been reallocated to target the most serious immigration threats. 
Countries must meet strict criteria before they are eligible to participate in the waiver program, in order to prevent illegal immigration to the United States. The Attorney General may cancel a country's participation at any time if she believes a waiver compromises law enforcement or national security. 
Travelers from participating countries may come to the United States without visas, but they still must be interviewed by U.S. immigration officials at the airport or other points of entry before they are admitted to this country. According to INS statistics, few travelers abuse the program to enter the United States illegally. INS has turned away less than 1 percent of those seeking entry under the Visa Waiver Program. 
The bill we introduce today makes a good waiver program even better. It builds on the success of the current waivers by establishing a small pilot program to enable certain countries that do not currently qualify to participate if they meet certain strict requirements. A precondition for the pilot program is for INS to develop and implement an automated entry-exit control system. Today, we know who comes to America, but we do not always know who leaves. We need this information in order to track down visitors who remain in this country illegally after their visas expire, and to ensure that countries are abiding by the requirements of the program, and are not contributing to illegal immigration. 
In order to participate in the new pilot program, a country must have a low visa refusal rate at our consulates abroad. Under the normal Visa Waiver Program, qualifying countries must have a refusal rate of less than 2 percent over the past 2 years. The Abraham-Kennedy pilot program would set the requirement at 3 percent for countries to enter the program on a pilot basis. In recent times, Portugal's refusal rate has been below the 3-percent threshold, so unless Portugal's refusal rate rises, I would look forward at long last to welcoming Portugal into this program. 
Mr. President, the Visa Waiver Program works, and I urge Congress to extend it. I commend Senator Abraham for offering this timely legislation, and I am proud to be a sponsor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 30 years ago this week, Senator Robert Kennedy addressed the World Conference on Smoking and Health in New York City on ways to address the mounting death rate attributed to cigarette smoking. He spoke to the conference about the difficulty of convincing people, particularly the Nation's youth, that smoking can kill them. He emphasized the grim statistics of premature death and illness caused by smoking. 
Today, 30 years later, little has changed. Over 400,000 Americans die from smoking-related diseases each year. In fact, in 1993, smoking was attributed to one in every five deaths--more than alcohol, car accidents, fires, homicides, suicides, drugs, and AIDS combined. 
This chart, Mr. President, shows very accurately what the impact of cigarettes is in terms of the mortality of Americans--the red line being 418,000. These are all statistics from the Centers for Disease Control--from alcohol, 105,000; car accidents, 46,000; suicides, 30,000, and so on. This is a very clear graph about the magnitude of the impact of the use of cigarettes, of which 90 percent of smokers start when they are children of 14 or 15 years of age. It is an issue that must be addressed in any kind of agreement that this body is going to sanction or support. 
One million young people between the ages of 12 and 17 take up the deadly habit every year, 3,000 new smokers a day, and 90 percent of the current adult smokers began to smoke before they reached the age of 18. If nothing is done to reverse this trend in adolescent smoking, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 5 million of today's children will die prematurely from smoking-caused illnesses. 
Congress and President Clinton have a historic opportunity to protect current and future generations from the scourge of nicotine addiction and tobacco-induced illnesses. 
Study after study has shown that the most powerful weapon in reducing smoking, particularly by the Nation's youth, is to raise the price of cigarettes. A $1.50 price increase, as Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler have advocated, would have a double benefit. It would reduce youth smoking by more than half over the next decade and provide some compensation to the Federal Government for the damage that smoking has done. 
Most health economists agree that in addition to Medicaid, tobacco imposes a heavy toll, exceeding $20 billion a year, on numerous other Federal health programs, including Medicare, the Department of Defense health programs for military personnel, veterans health programs, and the Federal employees health benefit programs. 
To compensate the Federal Government fairly for these high costs, the total settlement would have to be more than doubled from its current figure. 
The State attorneys general have done a very impressive job in working out the tobacco settlement, but their primary focus was on reimbursing the States for the States' participation in the Medicaid Program. They did not have the responsibility to try to ensure the protection for the Federal Treasury in terms of these other health-related programs--Medicare, the veterans programs and others. 
If you evaluate those programs and the costs, as Professor Harris has done in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and also before the Labor and Human Resources Committee, you would see that the cost of treating tobacco-related illnesses to Medicare alone are approximately $9.3 billion, and others have calculated the Medicare costs to be substantially higher. Yet the proposed settlement provides not a single penny to the Federal Government for the recovery of these expenses. 
As I mentioned, the State attorneys general have obtained a fair reimbursement under the pending settlement for the costs imposed on Medicaid. It would be unreasonable and irresponsible for Congress and the Clinton administration to let Joe Camel and the Marlboro man off the hook for the high costs imposed on Federal health programs. 
Already this year the tobacco industry had the audacity to write a special-interest loophole in the budget legislation requiring the Federal Government to deduct the $50 billion amount generated by the increased cigarette tax devoted to children's health from the amount the industry would pay under the tobacco settlement. I am pleased that the Senate voted to repeal this flagrant provision earlier this week, and I commend Senator Durbin and Senator Collins for their outstanding effort. But its surreptitious inclusion in the budget legislation demonstrates that nothing has changed in big tobacco's continuing efforts to subvert reasonable legislation. 
The Federal Government has the same claim for recovering health costs as the States that are suing the tobacco industry for billions of dollars in Medicaid expenses. 
You could have a situation where one person was in a hospital bed under the Medicaid Program, in the next bed a person might be under the Medicare Program, and in another bed somebody might be there under the Veterans' Administration health care program. All of the patients may have the same kind of illness as a result of their addiction to nicotine. 
The attorneys general looked out for the individuals who receive Medicaid. But certainly the taxpayers and the Medicare trust fund ought to be able to receive compensation for the costs to the Medicare system. 
If the tobacco industry understood and agreed to compensation under Medicaid, it is difficult for me to see why they should not also agree to the compensation under Medicare, the veterans health care programs, or other health programs which are supported by the American taxpayers. 
The tobacco companies admitted that cigarettes are deadly. They have accepted the necessity for broad new restrictions on cigarette marketing and advertising. They have admitted their liability for billions of dollars in compensation for tobacco-induced illnesses. Having made these admissions and concessions, the industry can no longer put up a smokescreen and maintain its past position of total denial. Clearly, the tobacco industry should pay more and can pay more. Given Joe Camel's deep pockets and the substantial toll that tobacco imposes on the Federal Government, doubling the final settlement is reasonable, justifiable, and affordable. 
A doubling of the settlement would have a number of important public health benefits. I believe that the test ought to be what the impact of the settlement will have on the public health of this nation, primarily in terms of youth smoking. 
Mr. President, the doubling of the settlement would require that the tobacco industry increase the price of their products by about $1.50 to compensate the Federal Government and the States for the costs of smoking. 
Professor Harris estimates that under the current settlement, cigarette prices would only rise by 62 cents a pack. Since teenage smokers are very sensitive to price increases because of their lack of income, a 62-cent price hike would reduce tobacco use by the Nation's youth by only 18 percent over the next decade, which is significantly less than the settlement's requirement that teenage smoking drop by 58 percent in 10 years. 
There have been extensive studies and extensive review of what has happened when the price of cigarettes has gone up and what the impact has been upon youth smoking. 
We have also seen that, where the price has gone up and the tobacco industry has redoubled their efforts in advertising, still young people will go out and purchase cigarettes. There are studies that make the clear case that when you have a significant increase in the price of tobacco products and have effective advertising restrictions, you have a dramatic impact in reducing teenage smoking. That ought to be our objective, and it ought to be our objective at the beginning of the process, not at the end of the process. 
The best estimates by those who have reviewed what the price increase ought to be in order to discourage young people from purchasing cigarettes is at least $1.50 a pack. Such an increase would move us much closer to the objective which has been agreed to in the settlement of a reduction of 58 percent in youth smoking over the next several years. With a $1.50 increase, the tobacco industry will be able to meet these youth smoking reduction targets, and will at least partially compensate Federal health care programs for their expenditures due to tobacco-induced illnesses. 
Doubling of the settlement would also bring cigarette prices in the United States in line with other industrial nations. With a 62-cent increase, cigarette prices in Europe will still be far higher than in America. With the 62-cent increase, we are talking about the price in the United States being $2.56 a pack. In Canada, it is $3.06 a pack. In Germany, it is $3.18 a pack. If we have a $1.50 increase, the United States will be at $3.44. This figure is, in effect, doubling the amount of resources that would be paid by the cigarette companies. 
This is the price increase recommended by Dr. Kessler and Dr. Koop, which would have a dramatic result in reducing teenage smoking. When you look at that increase, even though it appears to be quite significant, it still puts a pack of cigarettes cheaper in the United States than it would be in France, where it is $3.47 a pack, or in Denmark, where it is $4.75, or Ireland, at $4.94, or the United Kingdom, at $5.27. We would still be in the lower range of the industrialized nations of the world. The best estimate and review by those who understand the workings of the tobacco companies believe that they can afford that. 
So, doubling the settlement amount would raise an additional $10 to $15 billion a year over the next quarter century to improve the health of the Nation's citizens or other important purposes. For example, we could extend the recently enacted children's health insurance program for low- and moderate-income working adults. We are talking about the sons and daughters of working families who are starting off as teachers or as police officers or social service workers--all starting out at $28,000 or $29,000 a year. We could also act on the new knowledge about the important role of the first 3 years in a child's life by launching an initiative to transform the lives of millions of children. We have learned dramatically in the last several years that early intervention has a significant impact in building skills and confidence in young people. With all of the research that has been done on the brain and early development, we are finding out that children in those first years have immense capacity for learning. We know the vacuum that is out there in so many different parts of America. There are children who are not being encouraged to expand their horizons. Even at the very earliest age, we ought to be about trying to find the ways that we can stimulate that early learning experience for children. 
This is a matter of national importance. President Clinton has made a strong commitment to improving the early years of children. We would have an opportunity to really respond to that very, very important human need--the need that families are facing. 
The tobacco industry can easily afford the $1.50 increase in prices. There is broad support within the public health community for a price increase as high as $2 a pack. Dr. Koop 
and Dr. Kessler and the members of the commission have endorsed such an increase, and so has the American Cancer Society. 
Doubling the settlement payment is the right thing to do. It will provide a fair measure of compensation to the Federal Government and the American taxpayer for the hundreds of billions of dollars that smoking-induced illnesses have cost us. 
Robert Kennedy closed his speech 30 years ago with these words which are equally true today:  
We must be equal to the task, for the stakes involved are nothing less than the lives and the health of millions. . . . But this is a battle which can be won. 
Congress and President Clinton should accept nothing less than a doubling of the tobacco settlement, and I urge my colleagues' support. 
Mr. President, I think most of us would agree this Congress is going to be hard pressed this year to get about the business of resolving this issue. But the tobacco settlement will be a matter of enormous importance and consequence at the beginning of the next Congress. It is important that we begin to establish some parameters in which to consider these various agreements. It is important to provide some criteria by which we can judge whether the proposal is beneficial to the country or whether it is a proposal that needs to be enhanced, as I believe this one does need to be. 
So, this is a matter of enormous importance for the public health of the American people for the future. We must make sure we are not going to involve the nation's children in the nicotine addiction which has brought such tragedy and loss of life into so many families of this country. We can do something about it. It is a challenge for all of us, and I hope we are going to be up to the task. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend President Clinton for his announcement today of his nomination of Dr. David Satcher to be Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health. 
David Satcher is an excellent choice for these important positions. As Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the last 4 years, he has ably led that agency which is responsible for protecting health and preventing disease, injury, and premature death. He is uniquely qualified to become the Nation's foremost spokesman on health issues. 
In 1992, under Dr. Satcher's leadership, the CDC launched and implemented a successful childhood immunization initiative. Before the initiative, only a little more than half of the Nation's children--55 percent--were immunized. Now, 78 percent are immunized. As a result, vaccine-preventable childhood diseases are at record lows. 
Dr. Satcher has also led CDC efforts to strengthen the Nation's defenses against infectious diseases and food-borne illnesses. We rely on the CDC to provide a rapid response to outbreaks of disease and protect public safety. Under Dr. Satcher, CDC has begun to implement a comprehensive strategy on infectious diseases and plays a key role in a new early warning system on food-borne illnesses. 
Dr. Satcher was previously a member of the faculty of the UCLA School of Medicine and the King/Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles. For 2 years, he served as interim dean of the Drew Postgraduate Medical School. He also served as professor and chairman of the department of community medicine and family practice at the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta. 
For over a decade, from 1982 to 1993, Dr. Satcher served as president of Meharry Medical College in Nashville, the Nation's largest private historically black institution for educating health care professionals and biomedical researchers. 
At the CDC, he has combined a proven track record of leadership and effectiveness that make him an excellent choice to be Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for Health, and I urge the Senate to move expeditiously to confirm him.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
Mr. President, the fact of the matter is, whether it is the intention or not the intention of those that propose this amendment, one can reach no other conclusion that this amendment is on the floor of the U.S. Senate because of the success of the Teamsters in the recent UPS strike. For the first time in many years, the Nation focused on the particular needs of part-time workers--their future, their security, and their well-being. 
During that UPS strike, one of the key points that was made--and which I think resonated across the country--was that part-time workers don't have part-time mortgages, don't have part-time bills when they are feeding their children, don't have part-time bills when they are trying to work for their families, and bring up their families, and that in this Nation with our growing and expanding economy--and with the strongest economy that we have had in many years--part-time workers should not be excluded. That is the key issue. There are many of those that fought that issue. But, nonetheless, as a result of collective bargaining, part-time workers' needs were recognized. I think America understood this issue much better. Pension issues were resolved to try to ensure that we are not going to only have Social Security to rely on when they retire but at least have some benefit in terms of their pensions for men and women that work hard over a long period of time. 
Those were the negotiations. Now there are many, and many in this body, that do not like the outcome of that particular measure. They have put this measure that is before us, which I think is really a reflection of that success. 
The fact is, Mr. President, if we accept this amendment of Senators Nickles and Gregg, we will be directly interfering with a consent decree that was agreed to by a Republican administration, agreed to by a Republican Attorney General, Attorney General Thornburgh, and it was heralded at that period of time as a great success by Republicans in trying to clean up corruption in a particular union. The fact is that when the Teamsters have a Teamster Union election, the Teamsters pay for it. But under that consent decree, if there are going to be Federal supervisors involved in this, and the Federal Government is going to be involved in ensuring that the election is going to be fair, then the Federal Government is going to be paying for this and participating. 
We are not saying now and in the future when this matter is before the courts what the future is going to be, or whether there is going to be another election and who ought to pay for it. All we are saying is let the consent decree that is in place now continue to be respected and not be undermined by actions by the legislative body which is a direct interference into the separation of powers and into the judicial decision to have a consent decree by which the executive body agreed to. 
That is the issue, Mr. President, and there are many important scholars that agree that, if we do have this kind of interference in a consent decree, we are going to subject this body to a contempt action because we will be interfering in a consent decree. 
Mr. President, it seems to me that we ought to follow the regular order. This overall agreement consent decree is before the Southern District Court in New York. Briefs are being required by the middle of this month. There will be a judgment to be made by the judge in that decision. And we ought to respect that particular decision which has been agreed on and it is now a matter of consent decree. We should not interfere with a consent decree with a legislative intrusion. There are no funds in this appropriations affecting that particular settlement. And we have no business, as the Senator from Alaska has pointed out, a Republican, to be adding these kinds of extraneous issues into an appropriations bill. It makes no sense. 
I withhold the remainder of my time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I congratulate Senator Coats, Senator Gregg, and our Republican friends for working with the administration and working with concerned Members in fashioning this compromise. 
I think there are basically two fundamental approaches that we ought to be doing for our children. One is we ought to have support systems and, secondly, we ought to have accountability. 
What we are trying to do with this testing program is empower parents, empower parents so that they know how their children are doing, and then to ensure that we are going to have support systems to help those parents. 
We are seeing an expansion, hopefully, of our literacy program. We have an expansion of our basic skills program with the math and science, with the title I programs. We have seen the support for our technology program. Under Senator Jeffords, we are going to see an expansion of teacher training. Under our Goals 2000 program, 90 percent of the money goes locally to help the local schools meet these standards. 
So what we are trying to do is have the support systems for our children, but on the other end we want to have accountability for parents and for children so they know how they are doing. If children do not know how to read, as 40 percent of them do not at the fourth grade level, they are going to be in trouble in terms of continuing their education, the problems of dropping out and all the other challenges which they are going to face. 
This is really an enormously important effort to try and address that very considerable concern for every family in this country. We welcome the strong bipartisan effort we are seeing reflected on the floor at this time. 
I thank the Senator from New Mexico.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in the past the Senate has supported, through the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, music training as an educational tool. I support the continuation of support for this type of program. 
I urge the Department of Education, through its fund for the improvement of education, to give favorable consideration to a proposal that will stimulate students' interest in and attention to music by airing the work of young and gifted student performers and which will also involve the public through supplemental educational tools. A young performance series, which affords 6-18-year-old musicians the opportunity to publicly demonstrate their talents would be especially suited to carry out such a demonstration. 
If we are to encourage innovation and talent, we must foster that talent by recognizing the developing skills of our Nation's youth. Public broadcasts of a quality young performance program will encourage youth involvement in classical and other serious music.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, every Member of Congress understands the importance of elections. The votes cast on election day determine the leadership and direction of communities across the country, and of the Nation as a whole. We know that informed voters are the essence of our democracy. 
The National Student-Parent Mock Election helps young students learn about the importance of the election process. It also offers parents and teachers across the country an opportunity to help students learn about democracy, make decisions about key issues, and understand the meaning of the citizen responsibility on which democracy thrives. 
On October 30, 1996, millions of students and parents across the country cast their votes for President, Vice President, Senators, Representatives, Governors, and local officials as part of the National Student-Parent Mock Election. Every State called in its votes on who would win the elections and its recommendations on key national issues to the National Mock Election Headquarters, while over 20 million viewers watched on television. 
The National Student-Parent Mock Election is an on-going project that received $125,000 in Federal funding in fiscal year 1997. 
I understand that it is the intention of the chairman and ranking member of the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee to fund the National Student-Parent Mock Election at $225,000 for the fiscal year 1998 so that it can continue to educate students on key issues and the principles of democracy.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I have on other occasions, I pay tribute to my friend and colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, who has been shepherding this very complicated but enormously important health policy issue through the Senate. As he has correctly stated, there has been broad agreement on a number of the very important aspects of the bill that relate to the drug and medical device provisions. 
We have made considerable progress on one other aspect of the legislation, and that deals with an amendment which was added by the Senator from New Hampshire, which I will address momentarily. There are still some very important issues that are still being considered by Members. All of us are hopeful that we will have a positive outcome, but we are not quite there yet. 
Mr. President, just on another item, I want to identify myself with the excellent remarks of my friend and colleague from Iowa, 
Senator Harkin, on the vote that was taken just an hour or so ago about the block granting of various education programs. 
I think all of us have understood that the role of the Federal Government is very limited in terms of its help and assistance to local communities in terms of education. We have a much more profound responsibility in the areas of higher education. But our responsibilities in the elementary and secondary education respects that education is a local function but also an important State responsibility. 
That is why for every dollar that is expended, only about 6 cents of that dollar really comes from the Federal Government. The targeting of those programs has been in the areas where there has been, as he pointed out and others have recognized, general recognition nationwide of very important national objectives, and that is with the most disadvantaged students, primarily in the areas of basic skills--basic skills--math and science programs in the title I programs across this country, the neediest children in the most disadvantaged areas. It is a very important program. It has been evaluated, has had broad support. That is one of the very important areas. 
There have been adjustments about what programs will be in and what programs will be out, but you cannot get away from the fact that these programs that have been included are targeted and by and large go to local communities where there is wide discretion. If you take the Goals 2000, 90 percent of that fund is spent at the local level. You can't get any more in terms of local control than what we have at the present time. 
You find that there is 2 percent administrative costs by the Department of Education in the overall programming, 6 percent at the State level of all of these various programs. A great percent of that 6 percent is technical assistance, goes to local communities that are trying to deal perhaps with special-needs children. Maybe it is a small community that has two or three members of a class that have special needs. They do not develop a whole program, but there are other schools, other school districts that have similar kinds of needs. 
This technical assistance helps and assists those local communities: the School to Work Program has had strong bipartisan support--we still remember the strong Republican support to try to help young people move from school into the employment programs and into employment--the drug-free schools to try to do something about the problems of drug addiction and violence in our various school districts. 
Now, we do not know. There is no accountability in this particular program. There is no requirement for reporting on how the money is expended. It bypassed even the States, so the States will not have an understanding of how these resources are going to be spent. We do not know which States are going to be advantaged, which disadvantaged or communities advantaged or disadvantaged. 
So I join in expressing strong reservations. I want to say very clearly that if this comes back, this particular provision, we are going to take some time on the floor of the U.S. Senate to really make sure that not only every Member of this body understands it but all Americans understand it. If the local States want to expend additional resources, let them go out and tax their local communities to do so. If they want it, let them do it. But if we are going to commit ourselves to trying to raise resources to meet targeted needs for the neediest children in this country, we ought to be able to do it. If you are going to take that and block grant it and send it back to the States and just use the Federal tax system to raise these funds, that ought to be done in a different forum. We will have a longer time to debate it if it comes back. But we should not permit a vote in support of the general appropriations to go by without some comment. 
Now, Mr. President, I am pleased that we have achieved an important compromise on one of the most important issues in the FDA reform legislation, the issue of Federal preemption of State regulation of over-the-counter drugs and cosmetics. 
I compliment Senator Gregg, Secretary Shalala, and others involved in working out this responsible agreement. It will assure that States have the ability to step in to protect consumers from cosmetics when necessary while also providing companies reasonable guarantees that when the FDA has acted effectively to protect consumers, they will not be subjected to conflicting and potentially duplicative labeling requirements. 
Under the agreement, the Federal Government will not preempt State regulation of the safety of a cosmetic. This is appropriate. If a State feels strongly enough about a particular ingredient or a product to ban it or to take similar actions, it should be free to do so. States virtually never use this authority. But even though it is rarely used, it should be preserved. 
In the critical realm of packaging and labeling where States have been most active in ensuring consumers receive the information they need to protect themselves, this amendment strikes a fair balance. The reason preserving States' ability to act is so important is that FDA regulation has been weak. Under this agreement, States would continue to have the ability to act to protect their consumers except in those cases where the FDA has already taken appropriate action in a specific area. 
The compromise reached in section 762, which relates to the preemption of the State regulation for the packaging and labeling of cosmetics, will assure that the States retain full authority to regulate cosmetics in those circumstances when the FDA has not acted. As you know, I think it is essential for the States to be able to regulate the labeling and packaging of cosmetics whenever the FDA has not acted. This is especially important because there is so little FDA regulation in the area of cosmetics. 
Section 762 would preempt a State labeling and packaging requirement only when FDA has specifically acted on the same aspect of the labeling or packaging of that cosmetic. Thus, if FDA issues a regulation that requires cosmetic manufacturers to include a specific warning about an aspect of an ingredient in a cosmetic, a State cannot require a different warning about the same aspect of that ingredient. 
For example, if the FDA required a warning label for a particular product regarding its use by pregnant women, the State would be prohibited from requiring a different warning label for the same hazard and product. On the other hand, where the FDA has not taken action, the States would be free to fill the gap. So, if we are going to breathe new life into the FDA to take on more and more kinds of responsibilities to assure the public in terms of some of these health hazards, as a result of the debates we have had in the past days, they are free to do so. 
On the other hand, if a State wants to require a warning on a cosmetic and FDA has not acted, the State can require that warning. For example, Minnesota has required a caution statement on flammable products. This provision would not preempt that requirement because FDA has not acted. 
Similarly, if FDA requires a warning about a specific ingredient contained in a cosmetic, ingredient A, and a State wants to require a warning about another ingredient in the same cosmetic, ingredient B, the State would not be preempted. Likewise, if FDA requires a warning about a certain aspect of an ingredient for example, ingredient A causes cancer, a State can require a warning about a different aspect of the same ingredient for example, ingredient A causes birth defects. The bottom line is that the States are preempted only when FDA has acted on the same ingredient and the same health concern. 
Finally, this provision does not in any way affect the State's ability to regulate the safety of cosmetics. Thus, if FDA has a specific labeling requirement for a cosmetic ingredient about a particular concern, the State may take additional steps, such as a ban on the ingredient, to protect the public health, although the State cannot require additional labeling about the concern for that ingredient. 
This may very well be an invitation to give the FDA the authority and the resources to adequately regulate cosmetics, but if they do not do it, which is the condition today, we are not going to be interfering with the States. That is very, very important. 
The debate on this issue has highlighted the potential hazards that cosmetics pose to consumers, especially women, which are too often underestimated. 
A study by the respected, nonpartisan General Accounting Office reported that more than 125 ingredients available for use in cosmetics are suspected in causing cancer. Other cosmetics may cause adverse effects on the nervous system, including convulsions. Still other ingredients are suspected of causing birth defects. And a carefully controlled study found that 1 in 60 users suffered a cosmetic-related injury identified by a physician. 
The fact is, Mr. President, there are enormous numbers of new compounds, an enormous expansion of the use of various products, including toxic products, that are being utilized in cosmetics. We want to make sure that the States, through their own public health agencies or through various studies or through their research, are going to be able to raise health concerns necessary to protect their consumers. 
Mr. President, we have outlined at other times on the floor various items which raise some important concerns--alpha-hydroxy acid, feminine hygiene products, and talcum powder. We have heard from Dr. Wallinga, a physician at the Natural Resource Defense Council. He points out the dangers of these products citing studies in prestigious medical journals. 
We have in this compromise preserved the right of the States to protect the public. 
We have seen recently the impact of State laws on public health. In California, for example, action has been taken against Grecian Formula and toluene in nail polish. 
We also know of other States that have introduced legislation aimed at further regulation of cosmetics. New York, for example, is pursuing expiration dating of certain cosmetics. Ohio and Texas are also considering additional regulation of cosmetics. My own State of Massachusetts is pursuing a consumer right-to-know law similar to that in California. 
Nothing in this legislation will infringe upon these or similar activities by the States to protect the public. 
The agreement we have reached today is a very reasonable one. I commend Senator Gregg for his hard work in making it a reality. The fact is neither the Food and Drug Administration nor the States are doing enough to protect women from the dangers posed by cosmetics. This issue deserves to be a high priority. I intend to see that it is. 
Mr. President, regarding remaining issues in the legislation, I hope we can have the same hard work and accommodation in addressing these issues before we turn to the legislation. They deal with important questions about the procedures of the Food and Drug Administration in reviewing medical devices. We want to make sure that the medical devices that are going to be used on the American public are safe and effective. We want to make sure that FDA reviewers look at data on the use of a medical device that is clearly indicated by the technical design of the device--whether or not it is on the label. Under the current language, FDA would be unable to make a complete review of the device. The public would be deprived of assurances they have today that devices are truly safe and effective. We talked about this previously on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We will have further opportunity to address this issue. It is an extremely important one. 
A second item we hope to address is ensuring that FDA can consider certain manufacturing practices that produce an unsafe product in clearing a medical device for marketing. The language requires FDA to allow a new device on the market even if the manufacturer is producing defective devices. This provision endangers the public health by putting unsafe products on the market. It also requires the Food and Drug Administration to spend its resources chasing after unsafe medical devices already on the market rather than simply requiring that the device be produced safely in the first place. 
These are important items and in my full statement, to a considerable degree, I expand on them. 
There are environment considerations, the effective removal of the environmental impact statements under NEPA. I do not remember considering this provision as part of our hearings on this legislation. I do not feel that we should start taking various agencies and exempting them from considering the environmental impact of their actions. I think this is an issue that we should address. 
My colleagues have raised other questions in terms of the ethical issues that surround the payment of third party reviewers. These individuals are going to be reviewing products that are manufactured by the same companies that are paying them. This raises important ethical issues. I will have an opportunity to debate and take action on some of those. 
I thank very much, Mr. President, the chairman of the committee, for his continued cooperation, and the other Members for their help and assistance. I am particularly grateful to Senator Gregg for his cooperation in helping us work out a satisfactory resolution of the amendment on cosmetics. 
Consumers have suffered painful, permanent injuries from hair treatment products that have caught fire. They have suffered serious urinary tract infections from bubble bath. They have suffered life-threatening allergic reactions to hair dyes, and severe chemical burns from skin creams and sun tan lotions. The GAO concluded that `cosmetics are being marketed in the United States which may pose a serious hazard to the public.' 
And these are only the acute injuries that require immediate medical care. The poisons in cosmetics can also cause long-term injuries and illnesses that do not develop for years after exposure. 
Three specific products highlight the risks consumers face. Alpha-hydroxy acid is one of the hottest selling cosmetic products on the market, with sales of roughly a billion dollars a year. It is sold to erase fine lines and tighten the skin. FDA has received numerous complaints of adverse effects from the use of these products. Alpha-hydroxy acids have been linked to severe redness, burning, blistering, bleeding, rash, itching, and skin discoloration. Most troubling, there is concern that alpha-hydroxy may promote skin cancer by increasing sensitivity to sun exposure. Yet these products are in the marketplace--with no warning labels and no limits on the concentrations that may be sold. Under this bill, every State would be prohibited from requiring these sensible warnings. 
I ask unanimous consent that I may put a fact sheet laying the issues on alpha-hydroxy in the Record.

Mr. President, a critical point is that an industry-appointed panel itself set out safety tolerance levels for use of the product with regard to short-term effects and warned that the product should not be used without sunscreen. Yet, there is absolutely no binding requirement that manufacturers follow these recommendations--and virtually none of the products carry the information or warnings developed by the industry's own committee that would enable consumers to help protect their own safety. And, in point of fact, there has been no truly independent evaluation of the work of the industry panel. In fact, the FDA is so concerned about the safety of alpha-hydroxy acid that it has chosen it has its top priority for review by the prestigious National Toxicology Program. 
A second example is feminine hygiene products, which have sales of $100 million a year. More than one-third of women use them--but they pose serious health hazards. They have been shown to cause upper reproductive tract infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancies, and infertility. They may place women at additional hazard for cervical cancer. Women using these products should have the right to warning labels informing them of these hazards. But the FDA has done little to protect or warn women against these dangers. 
There are a substantial number of studies on the safety of these products. The evidence that they are dangerous seems incontrovertible--but this legislation would prevent States from acting to simply warn women of the dangers. How outrageous it is that women should face illness and sterility without being warned of the danger of a seemingly harmless and beneficial product. 
A third example is talc, or talcum powder is widely used in popular bath and cosmetic products. But it is chemically similar to asbestos, and it has long been suspected of causing cancer. A number of studies have suggested the possibility of a link to ovarian cancer, which afflicts 26,000 women annually--but there are no warning labels on these products. American women deserve better protection from their Government. 
These three issues have been carefully analyzed by Dr. David Wallinga, a physician and the senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. He points out the dangers of each of these three products based on studies in prestigious medical journals from researchers at institutions like Yale and the Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. I ask unanimous consent to enter his comments in the Record, along with the articles analyzing these issues. 
Federal oversight of this $20 billion industry today is extremely limited. The basic Federal law regulating cosmetics has not been updated since 1938. The FDA has less than 30 employees overseeing this huge industry--and only two employees dealing with the critical issues of packaging, labeling, and consumer warnings. The FDA has no authority to require manufacturers to register their plants and products. It cannot require manufacturers to file data on the ingredients in their products. It cannot compel manufacturers to file reports on cosmetic-related injuries. It cannot require that products be tested for safety or that the results of safety testing be made available to the agency. It does not have the right of access to manufacturers' records. It cannot require recall of a product. 
In the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act there are 126 pages devoted to the regulation of drugs and devices; 55 pages are devoted to foods regulation. A full eight pages of the act is dedicated to definitions. But less than two pages are devoted to cosmetic regulation. 
In 1938, there was no requirement that industry show safety of drugs, medical devices, food additives, or cosmetics before they were marketed. Today, the public demands higher standards of protection, and they have been established for drugs, for medical devices, and for food additives--but not for cosmetics. 
The agreement we have reached today is a highly reasonable one. I especially commend Senator Gregg for his hard work to make it a reality. But the fact is that neither the FDA and the States are doing enough to protect women from these dangers. This is an issue that deserves a higher priority, and I intend to do all I can to see that it gets it. 
There are important remaining issues in this legislation, and I hope that with the same hard work and spirit of accommodation we can reach agreement on these issues before we return to consideration of this legislation on Tuesday. 
Two changes in the regulation of devices in particular put consumers at unacceptable and unnecessary risk. They should be removed in this bill before it goes forward--and the administration has made it clear that they put the whole bill at risk of a veto. 
A great deal of negotiation has taken place on the medical device provisions of this bill, and I compliment Senator Jeffords, Senator Coats, and my other colleagues on the committee for resolving most of the device provisions in a way that is consistent with protection of the public health. But there are at least two medical device provisions in the bill which still raise substantial concerns. They could be corrected very simply and with negligible effect to the basic purpose and intent of this bill. Yet these corrections have not been made and my colleagues deserve a clear description of the hazards they pose. 
A brief explanation of how the FDA regulates and clears medical devices for marketing may first be in order. Under current law, manufacturers of new class I and class II devices can get their products onto the market by showing that they are substantially equivalent to devices already on the market. For example, the manufacturer of a new laser can get that laser onto the market if it can show FDA that the laser is substantially equivalent to a laser that is already on the market. 
Similarly, the manufacturer of a new biopsy needle can get that biopsy needle onto the market by showing that it is substantially equivalent to a biopsy needle already on the market. And the manufacturer of new patient examination gloves can get those gloves onto the market by showing that they are substantially equivalent to patent gloves already on the market. 
Mr. President, these manufacturers are obliged to demonstrate substantial equivalence to the FDA by showing that the new product has the same intended use as the old product and that the new product has the same technological characteristics as the old product. If the new product has different technological characteristics, these characteristics must not raise new types of safety and effectiveness questions in order for the product to still be substantially equivalent to the older product. 
The logic of this process for bringing medical devices onto market is quite simple: if a product is very much like an existing product, it can get to market quickly. If it raises new safety or effectiveness questions, those questions should be answered before the product can be marketed. 
This process for getting new medical devices on the market, commonly known as the 510(k) process, is considered by most to be the easier route to the market. Devices that are not substantially equivalent to a class I or class II device already on the market must go through a full premarket review. Thus, device manufacturers have an incentive to get new products on the market through the 510(k) process. And in fact, well over 90 percent of all new devices get on the market through the submission of a 510(k) application. 
This legislation seriously compromises the FDA's ability to protect the public health through its regulation of medical devices that are marketed through the 510(k) process. Of the dozens of provisions that we have negotiated and discussed which affect medical devices in this bill, these two still raise fundamental public health problems. Although few in number, these provisions raise substantial risks to the public health which simply cannot be ignored. 
The first problem raised by this bill relating to medical devices is its prohibition on the FDA from considering how a new device will be used if the manufacturer has not included that use in its proposed labeling. 
You may think that this approach makes sense--why should the Agency consider the use of a device if the manufacturer has not specified that use on the label? I'll tell you why--because that proposed label may be false or misleading. How would the FDA know that? Because the design of the new device may make it perfectly clear that the new device is intended for a different use. 
Let me provide my colleagues with a few examples. Let's talk about the biopsy needle I mentioned before, which is used on breast lesions. Most biopsy needles for breast lesions currently on the market take a tissue sample that is about the size of the tip of pencil lead. Let's assume the manufacturer of a new biopsy needle comes to the FDA with a 510(k) submission. But this new biopsy needle takes a tissue sample that is 50 times as big--the size of a 1-inch piece of a hot dog. 
The manufacturer of this new needle has proposed labeling that says that the needle will be used like the old, marketed needles to biopsy breast lesions. But FDA knows that the chunk of tissue being biopsied will usually exceed the size of the lesion. This makes it clear to FDA--and to any impartial observer--that the new needle will in most cases be used to remove the lesion. 
Under these circumstances the FDA should be able to ask the manufacturer to provide information on this new use. Is it safe to remove lesions? Does it really work? The bill, however, categorically bars FDA from asking these essential questions. This means that the FDA would be unable to make a complete review of the device and the public would be deprived of existing assurances that devices are truly safe and effective. 
The proponents of this provision have argued that the FDA could simply say that the change in device design or technology--such as the change in size of the biopsy needle--renders the new product unequivalent to the old product. But that is not always true. The manufacturer could argue that there are no new questions of safety or effectiveness for the purpose claimed on the label. In the case of the biopsy needle, Mr. President, there are times where a large sample is needed--a sample larger than a pencil tip. 
So long as the larger needle is safe and effective for removing a sample, FDA would still be barred from obtaining data about the new use of removing lesions--and to the extent the needle is used for the new use, women could be put at risk for an effective or unsafe treatment of breast cancer. 
Another good example is surgical lasers. Lasers have been used for decades to remove tissue. Several years ago, a manufacturer added a side-firing mechanism to their laser to improve its use in prostate patients. While the manufacturer did not include this specific use in its proposed labeling, it was transparently clear that the new side-firing design was intended solely for this purpose of treating prostate patients. 
As a result, FDA required the manufacturer to submit data demonstrating the laser's safety and effectiveness in treating prostate patients. This is precisely how the device review process should work. Manufacturers must prove their devices live up to their claims, while patients and doctors receive all of the information needed to make the best possible treatment choices. 
But under this bill, FDA would be prohibited from getting adequate safety data on the laser's use on prostate patients--even though that would be the product's primary use. This defies common sense yet this is the result of one troubling and indefensible provision. 
Other examples in the way that this provision could allow unsafe and ineffective devices abound. A stent designed to open the bile duct for gallstones could be modified in a way that clearly was designed to make it a treatment for blockages of the carotid artery. 
Without adequate testing, it could put patients at risk of stroke or death. But under this bill, the FDA would be prohibited from looking behind the label to the actual intended use of the device. A laser to use to excise warts could have its power raised so that it was also possible to use it in smoothing facial wrinkles. But without FDA's ability to assure adequate testing, the use of the laser for this purpose could lead to irreversible scarring. 
Most companies, of course, will not try to bypass the process in this way. But some bad actors will. And this legislation should not force the FDA to fight those bad actors with one hand tied behind it. This provision is like asking a policeman to accept a known armed robber's assurance that the only reason he is wearing a mask and carrying a gun is that he is going to a costume party. 
The second way this bill undercuts the FDA's ability to protect the public health and adequately regulate medical devices is the way it forces the FDA to clear a new device for marketing even if the Agency knows that the manufacturer cannot manufacture a safe device. 
Let me repeat that statement. It sounds frankly preposterous but it is true. One of the bill's provisions actually requires the FDA to allow a new device onto the market even if the manufacturer is producing defective devices. Surprisingly, the proponents of this provision freely admit that this is true. 
Under current law, let's assume that a maker of new examination gloves submits a 510(k) to the FDA and claims that the new gloves are substantially equivalent to gloves already on the market. If the FDA knows for a fact from its inspectors that the company uses a manufacturing process that often results in these gloves having holes, FDA would simply not clear the gloves for marketing. FDA would find that these gloves are not substantially equivalent to gloves on the market because gloves on the market don't have holes. That's common sense, and fortunately, that's also the law. 
In contrast, this bill would force FDA to clear the gloves for marketing. At this point, these defective gloves would be sold to hospitals, clinics, and HMO's, where they will be used routinely by doctors, nurses, paramedics, and other health professionals every single day. Every single glove would expose these professionals needlessly to the risk of fatal blood-borne diseases like AIDS and hepatitis. 
Here is the response of the provision's supporters. They argue that once these defective gloves are in the market and being used by health professionals, FDA can simply institute an enforcement action to remove them from the market. But when hundreds or thousands of defective devices have been distributed, and when dozens or hundreds of facilities may be using these devices, an enforcement action entails far more than blowing a whistle or picking up the phone to place a simple call. 
In reality, the FDA must coordinate with the U.S. Attorney's office, the U.S. Marshal's Service and persuade the court of jurisdiction to issue the appropriate papers. As any attorney or law enforcement professional can tell you that this takes precious time. And in the case of a defective device which is exposing people to unnecessary risks, time is absolutely critical. The sooner a defective glove is pulled from the market, the sooner the public is protected. 
But all this makes absolutely no sense when the FDA today can prevent this situation from ever arising. If this provision becomes law, the debater's point distinguishing between different forms of FDA authority will ultimately be paid for in the health and safety of American consumers placed at needless risk of death and injury. In fact, even the regulated industry is willing to compromise on this provision, because they recognize that it is so unreasonable. 
So I hope we can continue to work to compromise these important devices issues over the weekend. We have been successful on so many other issues in this bill. These should be resolvable as well. 
The last unacceptable element of this bill is an assault on basic environmental protections contained in the National Environmental Protection Act. The National Environmental Protection Act of 1969 is a key Federal environmental statute which regulates the Government's own actions through environmental impact statements. Under NEPA, Federal agencies must undertake a comprehensive environmental planning process for every major action they take. This law is a crucial statutory assurance that the work of the Government and the actions of regulated industries are consistent with the guiding principle of environmental protection. 
Section 602 of the bill broadly exempts the FDA's activities from environmental impact assessments under NEPA. In fact, the provision even precludes the FDA from taking environmental considerations into account in its work. The administration unequivocally opposes this provision. This week, I spoke with the Vice President, who expressed his serious personal concerns about this provision. In just a few sentences, this bill opens the door to weakening our environmental protections and lays a welcome mat down for future exemptions and future attacks on an effective and essential environmental statute. 
This is a terrible precedent, but it also directly affects the environment. The FDA regulates products which constitute a quarter of our gross domestic product. When it makes decisions on food containers, or manufacturing plant approvals, or handling and disposal of medical supplies, it can have an immense impact on the environment. 
Ironically, this antienvironmental extremism is not even demanded by the regulated industry, which regards the reforms of the NEPA process recently announced by the Clinton administration as fair and balanced. 
We all agree on the importance of FDA reform. The reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Program is tremendously important to assure that the FDA will have adequate resources to review new drugs and biological products quickly and effectively. This legislation contains many significant reforms that can streamline the regulatory process and codify improvements that FDA has already taken administratively. I compliment Senator Jeffords, the chairman of our committee, and many other colleagues who have worked hard on this bill and have been willing to work together to eliminate many other troublesome provisions in the bill as originally introduced. Let us now move to complete this work by fixing the remaining contentious issues included in this legislation.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know that it is the desire of the Senator from Illinois and others to have the Senate make a judgment on this issue. But it is a very, very important issue. I welcome the opportunity to join my colleagues in making comments about the implications of this particular amendment. And I do so at this time. 
Mr. President, the Sessions amendment is really one more attempt to aid the tobacco industry at the expense of the public interest. Make no mistake about it, its effect would be to set up a major roadblock preventing the States from pursuing their cases against the tobacco industry. 
The Sessions amendment, as I read it, would restrict the ability of States to retain the attorneys to pursue States' claims against the tobacco industry. As we all know, 40 States have filed suit against the tobacco companies. So far only two of those cases have been settled. Just yesterday, the tobacco industry said that it will no longer be settling cases. The Texas case is scheduled to go to trial within the next few weeks. 
As Senator Wellstone has pointed out, Minnesota, which has done an enormous amount of work on covering the sordid history of the tobacco industry, is scheduled to go to trial in just a few months. 
So it would be an outrage for this Senate, acting at the behest of the tobacco industry, to handcuff the States as they seek to compensate their citizens from an industry that kills 400,000 citizens each year. 
If Senator Session's intent is to regulate the amount of attorney's fees to be paid as part of a national settlement, clearly, this amendment is premature and unwarranted. Congress has not even begun to seriously debate the merits of the national proposal. The issue of attorney's fees in a settlement should be considered after there is a settlement, not before. 
The real intent of the Sessions amendment is clearly demonstrated by the fact that, as originally drafted, it only sought to restrict the attorney's fees of attorneys representing the States, not the attorney's fees of the tobacco industry. To restrict the plaintiff attorney's fees would dramatically tilt the already uneven playing field even more in favor of the tobacco companies. While Senator Sessions has now added defense attorneys to his amendment, regulating the amount of attorney's fees paid by the private party is highly questionable and probably unconstitutional. Thus the effect of the amendment would still be to place a burden just on the States. 
Since under the terms of the settlement plaintiff attorney's fees would be paid by the tobacco industry and those funds are not to come out of the proposed $368 billion national settlement, limiting plaintiff attorney's fees would not produce an additional dollar for either the State governments or the Federal Government. It would merely further enrich the tobacco industry. 
While the amendment says that the money saved would be paid to the Federal Government for use by the National Institutes of Health, the amount saved would never be determinable, and thus no significant payment to the Government would result. 
So make no mistake about this amendment, blessed by the tobacco industry, it is a ploy to kill the Durbin amendment. We were all outraged when we learned that a paragraph had been slipped into the budget agreement to give the tobacco industry the $50 billion credit. The amendment, if it is allowed to remain law, would cost the taxpayers $50 billion. 
There has been a justified outcry against that gross abuse of the legislative process. And there is now widespread support for repealing that ill-conceived provision. Big tobacco knows that it cannot prevent repeal directly, therefore, it has embraced the Sessions amendment as a diversionary tactic. 
Let us decisively reject this cynical gambit, beat the Sessions second-degree amendment, and overwhelmingly approve the Durbin amendment. To do otherwise would be to erect an enormous roadblock in the path of the States pursuing justice for their citizens against the tobacco cartel. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. I see. Well, I understand from the discussion of the leaders that we will be addressing the sense-of-the-Senate resolution as proposed by Senator Daschle and cosponsored by myself. 
I send a modification to the desk on behalf of Senator Daschle to amendment No. 1116, a sense of the Senate regarding Pell grants and child literacy funding. The modification is technical and it has been cleared on the other side. I ask that it might be in order. If it is the desire of the Chair, I will withhold making that request for a moment or two.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I strongly support Senator Daschle's sense-of-the-Senate amendment and its two key provisions--that Pell grants should be funded at a total of $7.6 billion, and that a child literacy initiative should be funded at $260 million in the 1998 fiscal year. 
I also congratulate Senator Specter and Senator Harkin for their leadership in making education a priority in the bill. Education is a national priority and we need to do all we can to make sure that education is accessible and affordable for all Americans of all ages and all income levels. This amount is a significant step toward achieving that goal. 
Pell grants are an indispensable source of college aid for low- and middle-income students. But too often, the current eligibility rules shortchange too many students. 
Single, independent students at public 4-year institutions are not eligible for a Pell grant if their annual income is over $10,000. At that low-income level, many of them will not benefit from the tax credit for college expenses recently enacted in the budget law. So fair eligibility standards for Pell grants are especially important for these students. 
A similar problem faces parents trying to pay for college for their children. Current law penalizes college students who work part time to help pay the cost of their education, by reducing their eligibility for Pell grants. We should be encouraging students to work, not take out additional loans, so that they do not graduate under a mountain of debt. 
The budget agreement contained a clear commitment to allocate $700 million to improve the needs analysis formula for Pell grants. The House bill provides only $500 million to meet this commitment, and the Senate bill contains no funds at all for this needed change. A strong, bipartisan vote in favor of the Daschle amendment is our best hope of achieving the reform we need in the conference because the House of Representatives, with their figures, have some disposable resources that will be available. A strong vote in the Senate will be a clear indication of a strong, bipartisan effort to channel those funds into this needed area. 
The second provision of the amendment reiterates the budget agreement's promise to provide $260 million for a child literacy initiative this year. The Senate should be strongly committed to seeing that legislation authorizing the initiative is enacted as soon as possible. 
Forty percent of the Nation's fourth grade children cannot read at the basic level. Low achievement in reading is a national crisis, and it demands immediate attention. President Clinton is right to focus on this critical problem, and Congress should respond. It makes no sense to delay the appropriation. 
Both of these items have been considered over a considerable period of time in the discussion on the budget resolution and, basically, we are conforming this appropriation bill to what was agreed on in the budget resolution by Republicans and Democrats. We believe that there is a very, very important reason and justification in prioritizing these funds, in these two very particular areas, when this legislation goes to conference. 
So I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I hope we will have an overwhelming vote of approval to insist that the conferees find a way to pay for these two essential reforms in education. It will be a clear indication that education, and particularly for the independent students and also in the area of reading, have the wholehearted support of the Senate, and it will be a clear instruction that those functions should be given the priorities that I think all of us in this body and the American people think they should receive.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the Gorton amendment because it hurts students and goes against the Nation's commitment to helping poor and educationally disadvantaged students who need our strong support. It also undermines the partnerships that have been created by Federal, State, and local education agencies to improve all schools for all children. 
We all agree that education is a local responsibility. But the States and the Federal Government are important partners in helping to improve education for all children. We all need to work together to improve the Nation's public schools. 
This amendment rejects that basic principle. It shifts Federal dollars away from the neediest communities to the wealthier ones. It destroys carefully crafted and widely supported Federal programs. And it undermines the States' roles as vital partners in improving the achievement of all students. 
This amendment would strip the States of their ability to integrate Federal funds with innovative State programs and State standards. Most of the small portion of Federal funding that is retained by the States under current law--only 6 percent--supports technical assistance and training for local school districts that do not have the expertise, resources, or desire to conduct such training themselves. 
Currently, Federal funds are offering a helping hand to local school districts in meeting high priority responsibilities important to the Nation as whole. The funds help schools and school districts improve reading and math skills of disadvantaged students, help teachers get the extra skills they need to teach all children to higher standards, help communities create safe and drug-free schools, and help communities modernize their schools. This amendment would take away Federal funding for these crucial, targeted purposes to help children who need it most, but who are often short-changed under current State and local law. 
Contrary to arguments made by proponents of the amendment, Federal education laws are more flexible and school-friendly than ever before. States and local education agencies are working in closer and more effective cooperation. The result is that schools are doing a better job of helping all children meet higher standards of achievement. The Federal-State-local partnership in education isn't broken and the amendment can't fix it. Congress should be doing all it can to strengthen that partnership, not destroy it. 
As a nation, we have made a commitment to help all students have the opportunity to get a good education. We have a responsibility to make sure that public tax dollars are well spent. This amendment provides no accountability for how these dollars are spent. Reforming the Federal role in education does not mean abdicating that role. 
This amendment is the wrong direction for the Nation's children and the wrong direction for education. It is not an attempt to offer a helping hand to local schools. It is simply a thinly veiled attempt to dismantle the Federal role in education. 
We should support efforts to improve education for all students, not undermine them. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Gorton amendment.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator Abraham and I have introduced a 2-year extension of the Refugee Act. The Refugee Act is the core of U.S. refugee policy. It sets the criteria under which persons can be designated as refugees, and provides funds for refugee resettlement. Last year, the United States admitted more than 75,000 refugees under the Refugee Act's criteria. 
In addition to determining whom is considered a refugee, the Refugee Act allows the Department of Health and Human Services, through the Office of Refugee Resettlement [ORR], to provide services to refugees resettled in the United States. For example, ORR provides job training and employment assistance to new refugees to help them become economically self-sufficient. ORR helps States provide English language classes, preventive health services, and cash assistance to new refugees to help them get on their feet in their new country. Refugees often arrive in the United States terrified, jet-lagged, and with few possessions. Most fled persecution in their home countries, and left their clothes and possessions behind. These programs make a refugee's assimilation into the United States a little easier. 
In addition to providing assistance directly to refugees, the Refugee Act provides funds to the Public Health Service to provide overseas medical screening for United States-bound refugees for the protection of public health against contagious diseases. ORR also provides targeted assistance to States and counties with large refugee populations, and runs matching grant programs for voluntary agencies that assist States in refugee resettlement. For example, The Boston Tech Center in Middlesex County, MA received $250,000 in discretionary targeted assistance to teach refugees short-term skills training, basic English and math. The International Rescue Committee in Boston received funds under the Refugee Act to provide a refugee youth program for newly arrived Somali children. 
Mr. President, the Refugee Act is the heart of our refugee law and policy. If it is not reauthorized, the United States will send a signal worldwide that refugees are no longer welcome here. We cannot let that happen. I am grateful to my colleagues for supporting this bill.

Mr. KENNEDY. I have listened to the Senator from West Virginia. I agree with his position. I heard earlier today Chairman Roth's opposition to this effort. And I understand other members of the Republican leadership also intend to speak on their concerns and opposition to this amendment. 
Even under the proposal as it was recently passed, we will 
only reach about half of the currently uninsured children. As the Senator remembers, we had a more expansive and robust program that might have provided the kind of extensive coverage that the Senator from Washington was talking about. And with the work of the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from Rhode Island, we explored options to expand coverage among working families in a manner that would have also helped states that have already acted to expand Medicaid eligibility guidelines. However, that proposal failed, and the program signed into law was designed instead to fit on top of what each state is currently doing. The new $24 billion investment in children's health is supposed to provide assistance to the 10 million children in working families whose parents are unable to afford health insurance and are not currently eligible for Medicaid. 
So, with all due respect, it is difficult to argue in the abstract that we are pitting one type of uninsured child against another. The point of this new program is to build upon current state efforts to work up the income scale from what is currently being done in a state to ensure that the sons and daughters of working parents receive coverage. We are talking about teachers, nurses aides, janitors, and other professionals whose salaries are too low to enable them to purchase health insurance but too high to qualify for Medicaid. These are hard-working Americans who put in 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year. 
I would join with the Senator from Washington and the Senator from West Virginia to see an expansion of this program. 
Through the work of the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Roth, Senator Moynihan and others in that conference, we were able with the leadership of the President to get a good program enacted. But we are still probably going to need to enhance that program or strengthen it down the road. 
As I understand the Senator's position, we ought to put the new program in place, find out what those needs are, and then I am sure the Senator from West Virginia will be a leader here in the Senate to make sure that we are going to help and assist families in the State of Washington, West Virginia, or Massachusetts to try to make sure that the sons and daughters of working families that are not covered are going to be able to get some coverage. Is that correct?

Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. 
Madam President, there are items that we will be dealing with--the McCain amendment, the Durbin amendment, and also the other Gorton amendment which we will be voting on in just a few moments--and I would like to speak very briefly on each of them. 
I strongly support the Durbin amendment which will repeal language in the budget agreement that deducts the cigarette tax devoted to children's health from the amount of the settlement. 
In effect, this last-minute loophole inserted in the budget bill by Big Tobacco in the dead of night behind closed doors reduced the value of the settlement by $50 billion. It was one of the most devious and reprehensible actions that I have witnessed in my years as a Senator. 
The lesson is clear. When tobacco issues are debated in the public, the American people win. But when the debate moves into the backrooms of Congress, the tobacco industry's interests come first, and the public interest comes last. 
It's time that Congress stood up to the tobacco industry and said `no' to Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man. This tobacco loophole has no place in the budget agreement, I urge my colleagues to support the Durbin-Collins amendment. 
I strongly oppose the McCain amendment which would have a devastating effect on our essential efforts to address physician work force issues. 
Medicare pays approximately $9 billion per year for graduate medical education. Over the years, these payments have been a strong incentive for hospitals across the country to increase the size of their residency programs. The increase has resulted in turn in widely reported concerns about an oversupply of physicians. The Institute of Medicine, the Pew Health Professions Commission, the Association of American Medical Colleges, and the Council on Graduate Medical Education have all emphasized the urgency of dealing effectively with this problem, and Congress can't ignore it. 
In addition, the longstanding hospital reimbursement policies have been more generous for specialist residents than primary care residents. As a result, most of the growth in the number of residents has come in specialist positions, not in primary care, and has produced an extremely serious oversupply of specialists. 
Congress addressed these issues in the balanced budget legislation enacted this summer. We expanded the New York graduate medical education demonstration project into a national program to encourage teaching hospitals across the country to adjust the numbers and types of physicians they train. The program provides incentive payments to teaching hospitals to voluntarily reduce the number of medical residents in training, and to increase the proportion of residents training in primary care. 
The program pays hospitals for residents who are not being trained. But the payments are reduced over time and phased out completely after 5 years. These payments help cushion the blow for institutions heavily dependent on the Federal funds, and allow an orderly downsizing of residency training programs, with minimal disruption to the provision of health services. 
The McCain amendment, however, would eliminate incentives for hospitals to downsize the overall number of resident positions and recalibrate the number going into primary care. The glut of physicians and the imbalance between general practitioners and specialists would go unaddressed. 
The McCain amendment could also have a harmful effect on rural and underserved areas. The budget agreement established a hospital-specific cap on residents, based on 1996 levels. It gave the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services the authority to lift the cap for residency programs in rural and underserved areas if the total number of positions does not exceed the national cap. By eliminating these payment incentives under the McCain amendment, large residency programs will no longer downsize. This result will hamstring efforts to establish new residency programs to address the health care needs in 
rural and underserved areas due to the overall cap. 
Finally, the amendment would result in over $300 million in lost savings, according to CBO estimates. 
A critical part of health reform is responsible action to reduce the over-supply of physicians and correct the imbalance between primary care practitioners and specialists. The Budget Act is helping us put a more effective policy in place, and we should not reverse the progress we have made. I urge my colleagues to reject the McCain Amendment. 
The second Gorton amendment hurts students and goes against the Nation's commitment to helping the poor and educationally disadvantaged students who need our strongest support. 
Although meaningful education reform happens not at the Federal level, or even at the State level, but at individual schools, the State and Federal Governments are important partners in helping to improve education for all children. We all need to work together to improve the Nation's public schools. 
This amendment does not support meaningful reform. Instead, it shifts Federal dollars away from the neediest communities to the wealthier ones. It guts carefully crafted and widely supported programs with specific purposes. And it undermines the State's role as a crucial partner in improving the achievement of all students. 
This amendment is the wrong direction for the Nation's children and the wrong direction for the Nation's future. It is not an attempt to offer a helping hand for local schools. It is simply a thinly veiled attempt to dismantle the Federal role in education. 
Currently, Federal funds help schools and school districts improve reading and math skills of disadvantaged students, help teachers get the extra skills they need to teach all children to high standards, help communities create safe and drug-free schools, and help communities modernize their schools. This amendment would strip Federal funding of these crucial, targeted purposes intended to help children who need it most. 
Time and time again, research has indicated that it is in high-poverty communities that children are most likely to fall behind and drop out of school. This amendment disregards the research and the testimony that we have heard over and over about the need to help disadvantaged and low-achieving students. 
This amendment would shift funds from poor school districts to wealthier ones. Currently, some States depend heavily on Federal funds. Alabama, Arkansas, and Louisiana get more than 10 percent of their schools funds from the Federal Government. Mississippi depends on the Federal Government for a full 21 percent of its education funds. We should not do anything to weaken that support. 
As a Nation, we have made a commitment to help all students have the opportunity to get a good education. We have a responsibility to make sure that public tax dollars are well spent. This amendment provides no accountability mechanisms and it is not fiscally responsible. Reforming the Federal role in education is neither a casual nor quick decision, and it should not be taken lightly. 
Federal education laws are more flexible and school-friendly than ever before. States and local education agencies are working in greater and more effective collaboration. Schools are helping all children meet high standards of achievement. We should not undermine these efforts when they are just getting off the ground. We should support efforts to improve education for all students, not undermine them. 
I also strongly support and am a co-sponsor of Senator Daschle's sense-of-the-Senate amendment with two key provisions--that Pell grants should be funded at a total of $7.6 billion, and that a child literacy initiative should be funded at $260 million this fiscal year. 
Pell grants are an indispensable source of college aid for low- and middle-income students. But too often, the current eligibility rules shortchange too many students. 
Today, single independent students at public 4-year institutions are not eligible for a Pell grant if their annual income is over $10,000. Many of these students will not benefit from the tax credits for college expenses recently enacted in the budget law. Greater Federal assistance is needed to help them meet their most basic college expenses. 
A similar problem faces parents trying to pay for college for their children. Current law is actually a disincentive for college students to work part-time to help pay for the cost of their education. Yet over three-quarters of undergraduates now work part-time while enrolled in college. 
It makes no sense for the current law to penalize students who are willing and able to work their way through college. Many students work full-time during the summer and part-time during the school year. But if they do so, the response by current law is to reduce their eligibility for Pell grants. We should be encouraging students to take part-time jobs, rather than take out additional loans, as long as their jobs do not become so burdensome and time-consuming that they interfere with the students' education. 
The budget agreement contained a clear commitment to allocate $700 million to reform the needs analysis formula for Pell grants. The House appropriations subcommittee provided $500 million to meet this commitment, but that is not sufficient. The Senate bill is far worse--it contains no funds at all for this needed change. 
The second part of the amendment will help more children learn to read well. We know the dimensions of the current problem. Some 40 percent of the Nation's fourth grade children cannot read at the basic level. 
Low achievement in reading is a national crisis, and it demands immediate attention. Children who lack good reading skills by the fourth grade are far more likely to fall farther and farther behind, and eventually drop out of school. President Clinton is right to focus on this critical problem, and Congress should respond. 
This amendment will provide $260 million for a child literacy initiative--and it will provide the funds this year. As the ranking member of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, I am strongly committed to seeing that legislation authorizing the initiative is enacted as soon as possible. But it makes no sense to delay the appropriation. 
I urge my colleagues to support these two important sense-of-the-Senate provisions. We all know that the final bill will be written in the conference between the Senate and the House. I hope we will have an overwhelming vote of approval to insist that the conferees find a way to pay for these two essential reforms in school and college education. 
Another essential reform for elementary and secondary students is the President's proposal for a voluntary national test for fourth grade reading and eighth grade math. Schools need clear standards of achievement and realistic tests to measure their achievement. These tests are a tool they can use to measure their progress and identify areas of need to bolster student achievement. 
I strongly support having the National Assessment Governing Board take responsibility for formulating policy guidelines for the voluntary reading and math tests. NAGB is in the best position to oversee this important issue. This bipartisan group has done an excellent job managing the National Assessment of Educational Progress. As we all know, NAEP has served to point out how we are doing as a nation and helped educators think about ways to improve our education system. 
The voluntary national tests, however, will go further. They will help each school district, each school, each student to identify areas of need in order to make the necessary changes to improve individual student achievement. 
The tests are linked to national and international standards. They will show whether individual students are meeting widely accepted standards in reading and math. No current test is available to provide this essential information to students, parents, teachers, and school administrators. For families that move from community to community or State to State, there is no current way to measure the performance of students on a comparative basis. 
The President's proposal for voluntary national tests has broad support from business leaders, including the Business Roundtable, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Business Alliance, and many others. 
It also has strong support from the education community, including the Council of Great City Schools, the Chief State School Officers, and the National School Boards Association. 
Seven States, including Massachusetts, and 15 major cities have already agreed to use the voluntary test. 
Voluntary national tests are an excellent way to support local school reform and hold schools and districts accountable for student achievement. I urge the Senate to reject any effort to deny Federal funds for these tests. 
Finally, the Nickles amendment is a blatant attempt to punish the Teamsters Union for winning the UPS strike, and it does not deserve to pass. The amendment would require the Federal government to abdicate its responsibility under the court-approved consent order signed by the Justice Department under the Bush administration. If the Federal Government abdicates this responsibility, it could be subject to contempt proceedings in Federal court. 
This is an unacceptable result. It would substitute the Senate's judgment for that of the Federal court about the meaning of the consent order. This is not how the judicial process was meant to operate, and I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.  
Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as was pointed out by the Senator from Alaska and others, this is an extraneous matter. We had a good debate on it the other evening. I believe that it would probably take--we did not really complete the debate on it the other evening, so it will probably take some time to reach a resolution of it. But the majority leader has spoken to the minority leader about it and talked to me about it in terms of time, but I think it will probably take some time. I know the Senator from Maryland was very much involved in it. I don't see him in the Chamber at this particular time.

Mr. KENNEDY. First of all, I want to just comment about the devotion and duty of our friend and colleague from Vermont. I am sure there may be those who are watching the proceedings this morning who may not know, as many of us know, the Senator and his daughter were rear-ended last Friday morning. Nonetheless, he came in here during the course of the consideration of this legislation, and now he is here doing his duty in spite of the inconvenience and discomfort he is feeling. So I think all of us have great respect for Senator Jeffords. His devotion to duty is again reflected in his presence here this morning and his commitment in moving ahead this legislative process. 
Mr. President, I also want to, as I did at the opening of the discussion and debate, congratulate Senator Jeffords on his efforts in the consideration of this legislation. We considered this legislation--FDA reform--in the last Congress. We reported legislation out of the committee. It did not move toward a successful resolution. There were a number of features there that were extremely troublesome in terms of the protection of the public. There were areas of strong difference. Although the process did move forward, it was not successful. 
Senator Jeffords has built upon a strong record and made every effort to try to work through an important public policy area, reform of the Food and Drug Administration, in ways that recognize its primary responsibility, which is to protect the public. As we go forward with this debate, FDA reform should serve the public interest and also take into consideration the innovation of the pharmaceutical industry and the medical device industry in bringing new products onto the market in ways that can improve the health care of the American people. That is always a balance. 
Men and women of good judgment can differ. There are two important provisions in this legislation, which eventually will be subject to further debate and discussion, dealing with what we call sections 404 and 406, labeling and manufacturing. I will come back to those measures a little later in the course of the debate. We heard references to those items by our friends and colleagues, Senator Reed and Senator Durbin, on Friday last. We will have a chance to outline at least some of the concerns about those measures, and, ultimately, the Senate and the conference will have an opportunity to deal with those. 
I personally feel that they pose important public health issues that need to be addressed. But I agree with what Senator Jeffords has outlined, which is the broad sweep of this legislation, and the areas of broad agreement that have been an impressive legislative achievement. Senator Jeffords should receive commendation for that because all of us who were part of that process feel that there are many features in here that should move forward. 
Some of us are hopeful that we can address the medical device legislation and also address what I consider to be one of the important amendments that was passed in the consideration of the legislation in one of the last markups--passed with a strong vote, after some discussion, but nonetheless, poses what I consider to be an important and unnecessary health hazard to the American 
people. That is, the provisions which are known as the cosmetic preemption provisions, which were added to this legislation, not included in the original mark of the chair, not included in the original mark of Senator Kassebaum a year ago, but added at the behest of the industry. As a matter of fact, the language itself was drafted by the industry. It was advanced in the committee considerations and now is part of the legislation. 
As I mentioned last week, I am absolutely convinced that if this had been introduced as a separate bill, it would be far back in the recesses of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, in terms of its consideration. But nonetheless, action was taken by the committee and that action has resulted in the inclusion of the cosmetic preemption provision. If this legislation is passed, it will effectively say to the 50 States that you virtually have no rights or opportunities for protecting your consumers from unsafe or dangerous cosmetics. 
Now, I listened with interest to what the Senator outlined in regards to the powers of the FDA, in terms of protecting the public. But the fact is, as we know, the food and drug law has 126 pages that relate to drugs or prescription drugs and medical devices, it has 55 pages dealing with labeling and nutrition labeling, it has 8 pages dealing with definitions in the food and drug law, and it has a page and a half on cosmetics. 
There are only two members of the Food and Drug Administration who oversee cosmetic packaging, labeling and warning. We have seen where the various studies that have been done by governmental agencies, like the General Accounting Office, have stated that what is necessary to give assurance and protection to the American people regarding cosmetics is more significant regulatory authorities for FDA to make sure that the ingredients that are going into cosmetics are going to be safe. We do that with the pharmaceutical industry; we do it with the medical device industry. We do not do that with cosmetics. 
The American people go into their drugstore and get a prescription drug or an over-the-counter drug. They know that, in effect, there is a warranty from the FDA that bears the gold standard for safety in the world, that those products are going to be safe. They get a medical device and they know it is going to be safe. But the fact of the matter is, Mr. President, we are not so sure when it comes to cosmetics. For example, when we consider the safety of our cosmetics, we know that, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, more than 10 years ago--and the utilization of cosmetics has grown exponentially since that time--reports 47,000 emergency room visits as a result of the use of cosmetics and cosmetic products in one single year. 
Does that sound very safe to all of you? What is the record? Where is the testimony to say how safe it was? You do not have it. You do not have it because we have not had any hearings. It would have been a good hearing if we had two or three former heads of FDA that appeared before the committee and said this is what the safety issues are, these are what the health issues are, these are why either we agree or we differ on the issues of preemption. But we didn't have them in the Senate. And you have not had them in the House. You didn't have them in this Congress. You didn't have them in the last Congress. You have not had them in the Congress before. You have not had them for 20 years. The only documents you have are from the GAO. And they don't talk about how safe everything is. They have a series of recommendations, which I have read into the Record, that say what we ought to be doing in order to guarantee safety and security. 
That is what the GAO said. That isn't the Senator from Massachusetts. That isn't the four other Senators that said let's stop, look, and listen. But we are going to go ahead pell-mell with this particular provision. We have looked at the results of the GAO study. They have not been refuted, and we have not had any hearings providing evidence that can refute the GAO. 
Mr. President, is this something that just now a single Senator, or three, or four, or five Senators should be concerned about? 
It is interesting that the administration has targeted this provision, as well as the two to three other provisions that I mentioned earlier, as matters that have to be addressed. 
The National Governors' Association: This is what they say about this provision.  
When the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee considered reauthorization of the Food and Drug Administration, the committee adopted an amendment proposed by Senator Gregg that preempts State regulations, disclosure requirements, labeling, and warning requirements as they apply to nonprescription drugs and cosmetics. The National Conference of State Legislatures and the National Governors' Association, vigorously oppose this provision and hope that it will not be part of the bill when it is reported by the Senate. 
All the Governors are saying virtually the same thing. Let us, in the 50 States, be able to take actions with regard to cosmetics, allow us to protect our people. That is what all the Governors are saying. But oh, no. `Washington knows best.' Remember those old statements that we used to hear all across the country by many of our colleagues. Let's not have a one-solution-fits all. Let's not have that. Let's not have `Government knows best.' Well, here you have Government knows best. They don't know best. They can't handle and protect their people in California, or Ohio, or Massachusetts. Absolutely not, even though there have been strong efforts in each of these States to try and move ahead and to protect their people. But we are saying not after we pass this law. 
Mr. President, as I said last Friday here on the floor of the U.S. Senate, we are making tough decisions on matters over which reasonable people can differ. And these are in many instances heartrending decisions. I mentioned last Friday, the decisions that we had in our Human Resources Committee where you have a limited amount of money. You have to make a decision for Meals on Wheels; whether you are going to provide all of the money to the congregate sites to feed elderly people--and you can feed more elderly people if you put it in the congregate sites--or are you going to take a third of that money and feed people that are shut-ins? The money will not go as far. You are not going to reach as many people if you take those scarce resources and reach the shut-ins. What should be the public policy question? Should we give the money to feed more people, or should we allocate some to the shut-ins, or should we just leave this up to the local community? 
These are important public policy issues that affect the lives 
of real people. But not on this cosmetic issue. What are the public policy considerations on the other side? Money. Greed. Cosmetic industry. Greed. What are the public health considerations of preemption? How are they advanced? How are they preserved? How are the American people further protected by a preemption? They are not. We have not heard that argument made on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We have not heard it, because it is not there. 
This legislation is proposed because of what has been happening in the area of California, and some of the other States which have been looking at the kinds of concerns being raised by so many consumers day in and day out--I will mention those in just a few moments--that are really wondering whether some of these products are safe. And there is good reason to ask whether they are safe because as we have seen from the GAO, many of these products are potential carcinogens. What is a carcinogen? It is a cancer-causing agent. We wouldn't permit these products to go into processed food because the Delaney clause would protect the American people from carcinogens in processed food. But can you add them to cosmetics? You can add them to cosmetics. They are added to cosmetics today. 
That is another reason, Mr. President, why the Environmental Defense Fund says no to this provision; why the Natural Resources Defense Council says no to this provision; why the Patients Coalition Consumers Union says no to do this provision; why the Consumer Federation of America says no; why AIDS Action says no; why the American Public Health Association, the association to protect the American public health, says no to this provision. All of these organizations say no to this provision. Why? Because it doesn't protect and advance the interests of the public health in the States. It advances the bottom line of the cosmetic industry, but it does not advance the interests of the public health. 
Mr. President, I will mention what the National Women's Health Network says in a letter that I will include. 
I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed at an appropriate place in the Record.

Mr. KENNEDY. They say: 
The spectrum of the cosmetic industry is broad and not simply limited to lipstick, mascara, or eye shadow. Hair gels and dyes, soap, toothpaste, baby powder, and lotions also fall under the umbrella of this $20 billion industry. Most women use one or more of these products every day, and assume that they are safe for themselves and their families. 
Sadly, this is not the case. There is virtually no federal oversight of cosmetic products which, according to a 1987 Consumer Product Safety Commission study, led to an estimated 47,000 emergency room visits in one year. 
Just to depart for a minute, if you have 47,000 people going to the emergency room, how many other thousands are going back to see their doctors? How many other thousands have gone to their dermatologists? How many other thousands have gone to their own doctors, and not to the emergency room and willing to pay the other $150, $175, or $200 to just visit the emergency room? How many others knew that? There were 47,000 emergency room visits in one year. 
Additionally the General Accounting Office reported that a number of cosmetic products marketed in the United States `may pose a serious hazard to the public.' 
That is the GAO-- `* * * may pose a serious hazard to the public.' 
It would seem to me this morning that we ought to be debating how we are going to advance public health, and how we are going to protect those individuals whose health may be in danger. Are we debating that? No. To the contrary. We are going to say as a result of this legislation that the health of the consumers of cosmetics are going to be at greater risk. That is the only conclusion, and that the bottom lines of the cosmetic industry are going to be higher. 
I continue: 
The Women's Health Network `* * * believes that S. 830 puts the financial bottom line of the cosmetic industry ahead of the health of millions of women by banning states from regulating the industry's products.' 
There it is. There is the heart of the argument right there by the National Women's Health Network, one of the effective organizations that looks out after the public health of American women. Does it get it right here? 
The Network believes that S. 830 puts the financial bottom line of the cosmetic industry ahead of the health of millions of women by banning states from regulating the industry's products. 
That is it. That is what we got tagged onto this bill that is dealing with pharmaceuticals and prescription drugs, dealing with medical devices, dealing with the extension of PDUFA, which is a source of revenue to ensure that the FDA can be tops in the world in terms of approving new products. We support those various provisions. But now we have added onto this train this cosmetic preemption that the principal organizations that are dealing with public health say to the U.S. Senate: `Stop. Say no. Do not move ahead with that.' 
It continues, Mr. President: 
It is absolutely crucial that provisions in S. 830 preempting states' rights to regulate cosmetics be removed from the bill. Women and their families deserve to have complete information about the safety and effectiveness of these products and states who are willing to step forward to safeguard the health of their residents must be allowed to do so. 
Mr. President, let me just continue on with the groups just so that we understand the breadth of the opposition. It isn't just a few Senators. As I mentioned, the principal public health associations, those that are primarily concerned about women's health, the ones that use these products to the greatest extent--the administration, the State legislators. The State 
legislators were joined by the Association of State and Territory Health Officials. They emphasized State laws provide consumers with important protections in areas where the FDA has insufficient resources to act and represent a legitimate exercise of State authority. 
As I mentioned before, Mr. President, if we were debating the regulatory authority of the FDA to protect the public health, that is a legitimate debate. But that is not where we are. We are not out here debating what would be appropriate power for the FDA to have to ensure protections for the American consumer on cosmetics. 
If there are those that can say with a straight face with the $6 million budget that they are allocating through FDA and two people that are overseeing the areas of packaging and labeling, which is the only thing that the States can do in terms of trying to get at these health considerations--if we were out here to say, `Look, they have too much power, they have been abusing that power, and they are inefficient with that power,' that would be one thing. But we are not out here debating that. We are just saying we know, as the cosmetic industry does, that the agency does not have the wherewithal in order to protect the consumer, that the historical protections for the consumer on health and safety have been the States and local communities, and what we are out here now saying is that we are going to take all of their power away. That is the issue. It isn't that we have a strong FDA. We don't have it. It is not represented. It was never discussed in the course of our markup. We had no hearing that would be able to represent it. 
Let me just take a few minutes to indicate how we have gotten to where we are with regard to the FDA power on drugs, pharmaceuticals, and on cosmetics. 
As I mentioned, the FDA has less than two people to regulate the labeling, packaging, and warning for a $20 billion a year industry. The FDA has less than 30 people to work on cosmetics, and FDA's authorities are grossly inadequate. The FDA regulation of cosmetics is a dinosaur, an anachronism from the time when drugs didn't have to be effective, when food additives didn't have to be safe, and when medical devices didn't have to be safe or effective. Just go back with me in terms of the times so we understand where we are. 
I chaired the hearings that we had in the 1970's about medical devices. Twenty-three women died from perforated uteruses as a result of the Dalkon shield. And that was the beginning of the changes in our medical device legislation--in the mid-1970's. Because of the danger with the sophistication of medical devices, we were going to have to make sure they were going to be safe and efficacious. And we did. 
Mr. President, in 1938, the last and only time the Congress acted specifically to regulate cosmetics--1938 is the last time--FDA was given authority to regulate products that were misbranded or adulterated. FDA had the burden. FDA had to find the problem. FDA had to do the studies. FDA has to bring a court action. 
The entire burden is on the agency. In the last 60 years, we have progressed in other areas of public health and safety. In 1954, we passed the Miller pesticides amendment. In 1958, we passed the Food Additives Amendment requiring manufacturers of food additives to demonstrate safety before putting potentially harmful chemicals in the food supply. Now manufacturers have to demonstrate that their products are safe in order to go in the food supply. 
Do you have to do that with regard to cosmetics? No, you do not have to do that with regard to cosmetics. Two years later, we passed the color additives amendment to establish a premarket approval system for additives used in food, drugs and cosmetics. The drug amendments of 1962 fundamentally restructured the way FDA required premarket approval of safety and effectiveness for every new drug. Prior to that it was not there, not necessary. They have to prove safety and effectiveness. 
In 1976, we enacted the medical device amendments following long years of study and debate. So now we have the agency requiring that each of the products in terms of the prescription drugs and with regard to medical devices have to be proven safe and efficacious. Do they have to do that with regard to cosmetics? No. No, they do not have to do that today. 
Among the most recent changes in FDA's authority were the infant formula amendments of 1980 and the 1990 Nutrition Labeling and Education Act, and the 1990 Safe Medical Device Act. Under these laws Congress held manufacturers responsible for safe and effective products. We asked the manufacturers to provide data to FDA to demonstrate safety before they could sell the products. 
We went ahead again with regard to prescriptions and again with regard to medical devices. Do we do it with cosmetics? No. Despite all this progress and advance in public health and safety, cosmetic regulation has lagged far behind. FDA's authority and regulation of cosmetics is still stuck in the framework of the 1938 law that Congress found it necessary to update in every other product area. This is not to say that Congress has not revisited the area of cosmetic regulation. In fact, every time that Congress has revisited cosmetic regulation it has resulted in a call for additional protection and additional safety measures--every single time. But here we are on this FDA reauthorization bill, to reauthorize the FDA and bring it up into the modern period in terms of medical devices and pharmacy. Here we are with a change, significant change in terms of the relationship of the protection of the American people from cosmetics. 
And here we are without the hearings, using the exact language of the cosmetic industry which is going to mean health threats to the American consumer--at what benefit? Well, as I mentioned, the bottom line of the cosmetic industry. So we have each and every time, with regard to pharmaceuticals and medical devices, we see what we have done and we have seen each time that Congress has gotten into it or the GAO studies have gotten into it, they say it is an area which cries out of the need for greater protection of the public. 
In 1948, George Larrick, who became the Food and Drug Administrator, said:  
Real scientific appraisal of cosmetic ingredients should be made before an ingredient is marketed. 
Did we do that? No. In the 1952 hearings, James Delaney in the House found that partial regulation of cosmetics resulted in insufficiently tested cosmetics that are a source of discomfort and disability. Further, the House report found that cosmetics should be subjected essentially to the same safety requirement as applied to new drugs. Yet today that is far from the case. 
In 1978, the U.S. GAO report strongly recommended the FDA be given adequate authority to increase safety of cosmetics. Among its findings: Although there is increasing evidence that some cosmetic products and ingredients may carry a significant risk of injury to consumers, the FDA does not have an effective program for regulating cosmetics. Some coal tar hair dyes may pose a 
significant risk of cancer because they contain colors known to cause or are suspected of causing cancer in humans or animals. However, the exemptions granted to coal tar hair dyes in 1938 prevented FDA from effectively regulating hair dyes. The industry was sufficiently powerful at that time to write an exemption in the law. And there is increasing evidence that people with darker hair who use these darker colors have higher incidence of troubles in terms of not only their scalps but also their general health conditions and there are increasing studies concerning the exposure these individuals may have had to carcinogens and cancer. 
Serious burns have been reported from the use of flammable cosmetics. Among those likely to ignite at the time of application are perfumes and colognes which usually contain a high concentration of alcohol and nail polish removers which contain flammable ingredients such as acetone and ethyl acetate. 
In 1975 FDA sponsored a 3-month survey of 35,000 users of cosmetics. Participants kept a diary and reported adverse reactions. These reports were reviewed by a team of physicians to determine if the injuries were cosmetically related. One of every 60 participants suffered an injury confirmed by a physician as cosmetically related. One in every 450 participants suffered a severe or moderate injury. 
These are studies that were done back in 1975 by the FDA. Do you think we have updated those studies? No. Do you think we have had hearings about that? No. And yet each and every time there is a serious evaluation we are finding these incidents involving health hazards. We have seen the varying degrees of the hazards in the examples and in the pictures that are here behind us. And we could go through picture after picture of the damage done by various kinds of products. 
The GAO report concludes that cosmetics are being marketed in the United States which may pose a serious hazard to the public. 
That is not the Senator from Massachusetts. That is the GAO, not Democrat, not Republican. In drawing on the best scientific information, this is what they conclude.  
Cosmetics are being marketed in the United States which may pose a serious hazard to health. Some contain toxic ingredients which may cause cancer, birth defects or other chronic toxic effects and contain contaminants known to cause cancer in animals because exposure to these ingredients can occur through skin absorption and inhalation as well as oral ingestion. It is important that the hazards posed by them be carefully assessed. 
I tell you, Mr. President, if this provision passes, those hazards are not going to be assessed by the States because of the way the language is written in the legislation. I am talking about what will be preempted on page 119, line 8: 
Shall be deemed to include-- 
This is the preemption-- any requirement relating to public information or any other form of public communication relating to the safety or effectiveness of a drug or cosmetic. 
There it is. Here you have the last studies being done, nonpartisan. Individuals are reviewing the most recent, up-to-date scientific studies. Cosmetics which are being marketed in the United States which may pose a serious hazard to the public. 
Why are we asked to take a chance on it, Mr. President? Why are we being asked to take this action? One reason and one reason only--the bottom line for the cosmetic industry. There is no public health argument that can be made on the other side--absolutely none--just the greed of the cosmetic industry. 
Every American ought to understand that. Here you have the GAO saying cosmetics are being marketed which may cause a serious hazard to your health. You have the several States: Texas, California, Ohio, my own State of Massachusetts, and a number of other States that are attempting to deal with some of these potential and real hazards to us and they are going to be preempted. Sure, we exempted California from this provision, but there are other health protections in California that are going be precluded. 
I have my differences with the attorney general, Dan Lundgren out there in California, but you read through his letter about this action and about the efforts California is making trying to protect its public and how it is completely contrary to the interests of California. Here is the Attorney General of California: 
Regulation of health and safety matters has historically been a matter of local concern, and the Federal Government has been reluctant to infringe on state sovereignty in these traditional areas. 
And he says: 
As noted above, S. 830 would, in the absence of specific FDA exemption, appear to prevent the State of California from enforcing their Sherman Food Drug and Cosmetic Law which is there to protect the people of California. And it goes on to make the case in opposition to this particular provision. 
So now we have the GAO report and we have what this statute does. 
The 1988 hearings held in the House of Representatives raised the same issues about the FDA's lack of authority and resources in this important area. Nothing has been done. Let me review one more time what FDA cannot do under its current authority. 
It cannot require cosmetics manufacturers to submit safety data on their products--cannot require that. It can require it with regard to pharmaceuticals. It cannot require cosmetic manufacturers to register their plants or establishments or require cosmetic manufacturers to register their products or require premarket approval of any cosmetic or cosmetic ingredient even when such approval is necessary to protect the public health; cannot require manufacturers to submit consumer complaints about adverse reactions to cosmetics; cannot require manufacturers to perform specific testing necessary to support the safety of a cosmetic or an ingredient. 
So, Mr. President, this is what we have under current law. I would like to mention just some of the dangers associated with this limited authority. We have talked in generalities. We talk about jurisdiction. We talk about preemption. We talk about inspection. But here are examples of dangerous cosmetics. These injuries took place this year, and there are dozens and dozens of them in graphic detail. I want to read a few of them for you. 
Do any of you use Alberto Hot Oil Treatment for your hair? There was a complaint just last month of eye dermatitis from this product. Do you know what that means? It means blisters, chemical burns, rash, redness, swelling, and inflammation. All that from a simple hair treatment. 
Everybody in America uses toothpaste every single day. In August, a consumer used a type of Colgate toothpaste with baking soda and peroxide. What happened? Mouth pain and dermatitis. That's a fancy way of describing itching, burning, and swelling of the lips, tongue and gums. 
In case you are thinking of switching brands, think again. Somebody else used Crest Tartar Control toothpaste in January and developed the same symptoms of burning, itching, and swelling in the mouth--not what you would expect from brushing your teeth in the morning. 
Here is another example. In August somebody used Gillette Cool Wave clear stick deodorant. Instead of being clean and presentable, they ended up with armpit dermatitis and bleeding. Can you imagine bleeding from using deodorant. 
How about a product called Revlon Outrageous Shampoo and Conditioner? It is outrageous all right. The user developed scalp sores, swelling, and inflammation from the shampoo. 
Have you ever used Bath salts? You may not want to after you hear this. In March, someone developed `nervous system and urogenital tract reactions' from Essential Elements Bath Salts. Can you imagine expecting a nice relaxing hot bath and end up with dizziness and headaches. 
These examples go on and on. 
Prestigious manufacturers L'Oreal, Avon, Clairol, Neutrogena, familiar names like Procter and Gamble, Revlon, Maybelline, Mr. President, this list provides a dismaying parade of horrors from products we rely on every single day. 
Here are just a few examples of the injury complaints received by the FDA. Dermatitis includes rash and redness, swelling, blisters, sores, weeping and lumps, inflammation, chemical burns, and irritation. Pain ranges from itching and stinging to soreness and tingling. Tissue damage, other than thermal burn, can include dryness and peeling, splitting, cracking, hair and nail breaking, hair and nail loss, ulcerations, hair matting, and scars. Nervous system reactions range from dizziness, and headache to irritability, nervousness, and numbness. 
How many people using these products have symptoms like dizziness, headache, irritability, nervousness, or numbness, and wonder where in the world this is all this coming from? It may very well be coming from their cosmetics, from their shampoos and toothpastes and other types of cosmetics. 
If these examples aren't striking enough, there are respiratory system reactions, like upset stomach, nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, and diarrhea. Or urogenital tract reactions: painful urination, discharge, stopping of urination, and on and on it goes. 
Mr. President, I asked for the complaints that we have gotten in just the last few months. Here in my hand is the list of them from the FDA. It is interesting to note that, a number of years ago, we tried to get authority for an FDA hotline so people could call up with their cosmetic injuries. It was struck out in the Appropriations Committee at the behest and intervention of the cosmetic industry. We tried to get a hotline so that at least we would be able to get more information and the FDA would be able to act on that information about specific products. 
What is the lesson we can draw from this? The industry does not want more information about cosmetic injuries. They don't want others to have that information. So they eliminated funding of the cosmetic hotline. We have successful and important hotlines in many other areas. They have been a strong success. I have been a strong supporter of them, because they assist people in obtaining information and, most important, help in a timely way. But they also allow the Government to register various complaints and gauge the seriousness of public health problems. 
We tried to get the hotline. We had it authorized, it went on to the Appropriations Committee a few years ago, but it was knocked out by intensive lobbying. So I am truly amazed that the FDA has the kinds of reports I will describe, and the sheer number of cases that they do. The truth is, most people who suffer injuries or adverse reactions from cosmetics simply don't know who to tell, other than their doctors. They in turn don't have anyone to tell or don't know who to tell. Certainly, the companies are under no obligation to tell the FDA--nor do they. 
I will return a little later to the efforts that were made to try to get the manufacturers to voluntarily assist the FDA in reporting complaints. At the end of the day, only about 3 percent of the manufacturers cooperated in that effort. When hearings were held in 1988, there appeared to be a consensus to do more to protect the public. The industry itself said, give us an opportunity to voluntarily provide the FDA the complaints that we receive. Well, it ended up being about 3 percent of the companies that actually participated. I will get to this in just a few moments. 
Let's begin with the injury complaints. In August, Alberto Culver & Co.'s hot oil treatment for color-treated and permed hair: Eye dermatitis, including rash, redness, swelling, blisters, sores, weeping, lumps, inflammation, sunburn, chemical burn, and irritation. Clairol Helene Curtis, the brand was Nice N Easy Natural Lite Ash Brown No. 114 and Degree antiperspirant; upper trunk and shoulder pain, including burning and stinging. Clairol's Nice N Easy Medium Brown No. 118: Hair tissue damage other than thermal burns. Procter & Gamble's Covergirl Makeup 
Master, facial and nose injury including dermatitis; Revlon's Professional Nail Enamel Remover: Finger injury, including cuticle, irritation, dermatitis. Neutro-gena's Clear Pore Facial Treatment, facial injury; Dixie Health, Dermal KK is the brand: Face, including nose bleeding. 
In July, Maybelline's Great Lash Mascara: Face pain and dermatitis in the nose. Realistic's, which is Roux Labs, Revlon Super Fabulayer Hair Relaxer Conditioner: Scalp dermatitis; Shark Products' Africa Pride Relaxer is the brand: Hair tissue damage. Procter & Gamble's Pantene Shampoo: Upper trunk dermatitis, neck tissue damage. Vidal Sassoon Shampoo: Upper trunk dermatitis. Clairol Hydrience Permanent Hair Color: Permanent discoloration of the hair. I can't imagine a product that could unintentionally make hair permanently discolored, but that is what has been reported. 
The list goes on. It lists the names of just about every major kind of cosmetic maker in the book. Andrea International's eyelash adhesive: Eye pain. You have perfume from Stern & Co., the product is Oscar: Respiratory system reactions. And the list goes on. I have page after page of these kinds of complaints. 
It seems to me if the States want to bring these matters up and it was the desire of the States to try to protect their consumers, they should have the opportunity to do so. Just as California has done and just as other States which are presently studying these issues will do. These States could go and talk to the manufacturers and the manufacturers can make changes, which they have on product after product sold in California. Proposition 65 is the basis for this California system, which works by inducing product improvements without having to remove products from the market or even putting labels on them. That is the way it has worked in California. Safer products. And time in and time out, the manufacturer comes out and advertises that they have upgraded their product. It is a better product now than it ever has been--an interesting and desirable outcome. 
But in this bill we say no. We just say no. We tell consumers, you cannot have the remedy of the State and you cannot have the remedy at the Federal Government. The result will be more individuals like the 59-year-old California woman who was almost killed by an allergic reaction to hair dye. Or the woman who lost her hair and was horribly scarred when her hair caught fire from a flammable hair treatment gel. The 6-year-old daughter of an Oakland, CA, woman who used a hair product on her child who suffered second-degree burns. Two women who used eyelash dye, one of whom died and the other who went blind. A 16-month-old toddler died of cyanide poisoning after swallowing artificial nail remover, and a 2-year-old child from Utah was poisoned by the same cosmetic. If there is a State that wants to do something about children, like putting a warning label on these items in order to protect children, it will never happen under this bill. We know that children get into all kinds of products in the household and there is the chance of them ingesting some of these items. Obviously, some may be considerably more dangerous than others, and consumers will want to have labeling that says if the child ingests this, take the following steps or contact the following people. But under this bill, if the State wants to do that, they are virtually prohibited from doing so. They are denied the opportunity to protect their children in their own States. 
What if a review is made of the scientific information in these States on these products if ingested by children, asking do they present serious threats of poisoning among children that may be life-threatening? Should warnings be placed on the labels? The result under this bill will be: No, you are out. You can't do that. I just find it difficult to understand why can't the States do this? Why can't they if they want to in Massachusetts or any other State? The reason will be because the Congress of the United States, at the request of the cosmetic industry, says you can't do it. Congress and the industry say you can't do it. That is what we are dealing with, Mr. President. It is just why I think this makes absolutely no sense. 
We reviewed earlier this morning some of the groups that were opposed to this provision: The Governors and State legislatures, virtually all of the public health and consumer groups like the National Women's Health Network, the wide range of agencies and officials with primary responsibility over the public health. They are virtually unanimous in their opposition. I will happily wait to hear from public health groups in support of the provision. We will have time during the course of the debate for other Members who are able to get that kind of information and place it in the Record. In the face of such unanimous opposition, they will be few and far between. 
Here is a letter from the United Food and Commercial Workers, Beth Shulman, the international vice president.  
We are appalled that the Senate is considering preempting state cosmetic safety regulation in the almost complete absence of any Federal protection. 
Unlike all other products governed by the Food and Drug Administration, such as food and drugs, the FDA has essentially no authority to assure the safety of cosmetic products prior to entry into the marketplace. The FDA has no legal authority to require manufacturers to conduct safety testing, submit lists of ingredients to the agency, company data, or consumer complaints. Most consumers would be shocked to learn that there is no Federal government regulation or testing to assure the safety of cosmetics before they appear on store shelves or are used by hair care professionals. It is scandalous that the Senate is now considering stripping states of their legal authority, so that the safety of cosmetic products used by millions of consumers will now be completely unregulated. 
The United Food and Commercial Workers Union, which represents barbers and cosmetologists among its 1.4 million members, has a long history of campaigning for stronger Federal regulation of cosmetic products. Over the past twenty years we have testified repeatedly about the hazards of cosmetic products and the need to protect not only the 750,000 professional cosmetologists, but the millions of consumers that use these products daily. 
They point out they take strong exception to those protections. Now, why should they be concerned? They gave some excellent testimony several years ago to the Congress. Let me give an example. After 2 years as a wig stylist, a cosmetologist from San Francisco began to experience memory loss, nausea, and dizziness. She had troubles with vision and balance. She stated, `I can't remember things I did just a short while ago. I have to write everything down.' Her condition was blamed on the ingredients in hair spray and other products she was using in her work. She appeared as one of the witnesses where Congress was working to regulate the largely unregulated industry. 
Another example: Christy Smith enrolled in a beauty college in 1984. Christy began to have trouble breathing, a problem that worsened over the years. She dropped out of beauty school after 10 months. She was found to have irreversible occupational asthma. Again, her condition was attributed to cosmetics present at her school. 
A 1997 study in the Journal of Environmental Medicine found evidence to support the claim that female hairdressers are at a higher risk of asthma as a result of occupational exposure to chemicals found in various hair products. This prompted a related study by the Palmer Group, which found an increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms and diseases among female hairdressers. These diseases included asthma, bronchitis, emphysema, and other chronic lung diseases. 
Female hairdressers face daily exposure to many harmful chemicals that are used in a wide array of hair care products on the job. I will give a few examples. These chemicals include persulfates, which are used in hair bleaches and can cause allergic skin and respiratory symptoms. Several indications of occupational asthma among hairdressers have been reported. Polyacrylates mixed with chemicals and hydrocarbons in hair styling agents can cause irritation of airways and adversely affect other respiratory functions. 
Ammoniac and sulfur compounds released in hair dying and permanent waving can cause irritation of the airways. 
The relative risk of asthma and chronic bronchitis among hairdressers was measured almost twice that of a reference group between 1980 and 1995. This study found that the youngest cohort of female hairdressers experienced the greatest occurrence of asthma, 42 percent; and chronic bronchitis, 44. These women ranged in age from 35 to 44. 
Mr. President, this is what is happening in the beauty parlors among beauticians across the country. Why? Because they are inhaling these products. They suffer from the higher concentrations of these toxins, but the women of this country who use these products at home are also inhaling them and endangering their health. 
I am not here to say precisely what the extent of this problem is, but we know now that it is happening as a result of studies that the compounds that are being used are more toxic and there are more of them being used every year. The health hazards have to be greater. At a time when the health hazards have to be greater, why are we taking away the rights of the States to render judgments to protect their citizens? This is especially true in an area of traditional State authority. 
What if the States want to take some kind of action? We are prohibiting them from doing so. We are denying them that chance to do so. It makes absolutely no sense--no sense at all. It does make dollars and cents because the industry is going to benefit from it, but it doesn't make any sense in terms of the public health. That is why virtually every public health agency committed to protecting women and women's health wants this provision out. It undermines their ability at the State level to give additional protections to consumers, and for no other reason than the financial interest of the cosmetic industry. 
Mr. President, I will mention here how the United States compares with the rest of the world. That doesn't happen to be the most important argument made this morning, but we heard on the floor of the Senate last Friday about how we have fallen behind other countries in terms of the FDA's work. In reality, the United States has been compared with the rest of the world, and impartial sources such as the General Accounting Office have found that the United States has the fastest and most vigorous product approvals. American consumers expect the best and that is what they get from the FDA. 
But when it comes to cosmetics, the U.S. motto should be: `Expect the best, but settle for less.' 
Looking around the world, it is remarkable how inadequately the United States stacks up against other countries. The European Union requires documented proof of good manufacturing practices and similar proof that extensive testing be carried out on all its products. What do they know that we don't know? What are their scientists and research scientists finding? Are we taking the time of the Senate to go through their various studies that point out the health hazards in their communities? They have done it, and they are providing additional protection. 
Let us examine another major economic power: Japan regulates cosmetics likes drugs, requiring the companies to do safety tests before marketing. Why? What is it they understand about cosmetic safety? Is it possible they have reviewed and found the same things that we have talked about this morning? The same things that the GAO has found out about the dangers posed by cosmetic products? 
Japan requires testing before marketing. That is exactly what the Congress said in 1952 we should be doing in the United States. Forty-five years later, we are still waiting for safety testing. The Japanese are not. 
Let's look at North America. Mexico adopted a regulation mandating expiration dates on all cosmetics. To the north in Canada, manufacturers submit data to show the product is safe under normal use conditions. 
The Scandinavian countries: Sweden and Denmark are initiating product registration for cosmetics, something the FDA can't require. 
Malaysia already requires mandatory registration of cosmetics. That is something the cosmetics industry would fight tooth and nail. 
The bottom line is that the American consumers have less protection than consumers in any other country that I have mentioned. The United States is a First World country with a Third World cosmetics safety system. That is the way it is today, and this legislation is going to make it worse. Much worse. That, Mr. President, is wholly unacceptable. 
I want to mention more specifically the products of which I think people should have some awareness. These are five common cosmetics products with potentially devastating health effects: 
Alpha-hydroxy acid, used in face cream, causes skin cancer. 
Feminine hygiene products cause infertility in young women; 
Talc used in baby powder that may cause cancer; and 
Mascara that can cause blindness. 
Alpha-hydroxy acid is one of the hottest selling cosmetics on the market with sales of roughly $1 billion a year. This product is sold to erase fine lines and tighten the skin, but has devastating health effects that are unknown to most consumers. The agency has received 100 reports of adverse effects with alpha-hydroxy acid products ranging from mild irritation and stinging to blistering and burns. More importantly, these products make users more sensitive to ultraviolet radiation from sunlight which causes skin cancer. 
To find out if a cosmetic contains an alpha-hydroxy acid, the consumer has to look for one of the following ingredients: glycolic acid, lactic acid, malic acid, citric acid, L-alpha-hydroxy acid, mixed fruit acid, triple fruit acid, sugar cane extract. All of these are alpha-hydroxy acids, although you'd hardly know from their names. 
The cosmetics industry sponsored a study linking alpha-hydroxy acids to increased ultraviolet sensitively and, most likely, skin cancer. An industry panel concluded that alpha-hydroxy acid cosmetics are safe at concentrations less than equal to 10 percent at a pH of greater than or equal to 3.5 percent when directions for use include daily use of Sun protection. 
Equal to less than 10 percent. This is what the cosmetic industry says will be safe if used along with these other items. 
Wouldn't it be useful for someone else or someone impartial to get a chance to look at the basic science and research that the industry has used to make a judgment? Wouldn't that be worthwhile? Wouldn't it be valuable if the FDA had a chance to have that data submitted to them? They could have their researchers look at it and see whether they come to the same conclusion as to the safety. 
But, no, there is a recognition by the industry itself that if there is something wrong, they want to do their own study and make their own recommendations. We, the public, don't know. We don't know whether they are accurate. We don't even know whether there is going to be any kind of enforcement, or by whom. By the industry? How? All we have is the industry's record and their willingness to comply voluntarily with the FDA. We have less than 3 percent of them willing to submit adverse kinds of reactions to the FDA. So we have no way of knowing about the true safety of cosmetics. What we do know is that the industry itself understands that there are health hazards with this specific product and want to control what's on the warning label. 
Don't we want researchers out in the great centers of research in this country to say, `Look, we'd like to try to find out if and how we can protect people.' Maybe States with broad exposure to the Sun, such as the South and Southwest, should have particular interest in trying to do this. They might want to do some studies to find out. 
Would they be able to try to make some kind of a judgment under this bill? Mr. President, the answer is no. We are 
preempting those States. Let us look at alpha-hydroxy acids again. Here we have one of the most highly advertised products on the market today. We have the industry's own recognition of their health hazards. Again, are we doing something on the floor of the Senate to protect the consumer from those hazards? Absolutely not. We are undermining what protection there is out there among the States. 
Consumers should be aware that alpha-hydroxy acid concentrations and pH are generally not noted on these products, not unless FDA's two employees find the time and resources to initiate rulemaking to establish such a regulation. FDA is reviewing the industry report, as well as other data, about these products and may initiate rulemaking sometime in the future, but do not expect the States to protect their citizens from alpha-hydroxy because under the law, States could not warn their citizens about alpha-hydroxy acid creams. 
Feminine hygiene products are other harmful, largely unregulated products, with roughly $100 million a year in sales. Many women who buy these products will be surprised to find the overwhelming majority of these feminine hygiene products are regulated only as cosmetics. These products have been known to cause upper reproductive tract infection, pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancies, infertility in women. This reduction in fertility is even greater in young women. 
Researchers at the Center for Health Statistics in Seattle, WA, have published studies regarding the risk of pelvic inflammatory disease from the use of feminine hygiene products. These researchers have found that the risk of ectopic pregnancy doubles in women who use feminine hygiene products. Researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School also published data regarding the adverse health effects of feminine hygiene products. We had better hope that those two people at FDA working on cosmetics labeling and warnings have time to work on adequate labeling for feminine hygiene products. 
The National Women's Health Network has testified before an FDA advisory committee that more has to be done to protect the reproductive health of women, which is clearly affected by these cosmetics. Just look at the science. But the industry doesn't want the States to have the authority to warn consumers. So, for the women of the State of Washington, we should say goodbye to the research studies conducted in Seattle and what they found out--because we are preempting what those States can do with them. 
Even in my own State, research conducted at Brigham and Women's Hospital found that the risk of ectopic pregnancy doubles in women who use feminine hygiene products. 
It is worthwhile to inquire if there are other researchers who come to contrary conclusions. These are studies being done. What State is going to go out and perform studies, and which research centers, when they know they are preempted from doing anything about it? That is why the Women's Health Network is opposed to this provision. And for what reason are we risking women's health? Why are we risking lives? It is because of the cosmetic industry. It is going to be cheaper for them, allegedly, when they don't have to deal with warnings and disclosure of health risks. It's too much trouble for them. 
Talc is something widely used in baby powder and other body powders. 
In 1992, the National Toxicology Program published a study of the effects of talc inhalation in animals and an epidemiology study on exposure to talc and ovarian cancer risk. The researchers reported an elevated risk of ovarian cancer associated with talc use. Workers at Columbia University have reported the detection of talc particles in the ovaries of patients undergoing surgery. 
The Cancer Prevention Coalition has submitted a citizen's petition to FDA addressing their concern about the possible health risks posed by talc and requested the agency establish regulations to require carcinogen warning labels on cosmetics containing talc as an ingredient. FDA is reviewing the information and may respond sometime in the future. Those two workers are going to be hard pressed with this one, too. If the State wanted to warn its consumers about the potential carcinogen, they would be prohibited under S. 830. 
A technique that has been used to extract ovarian tumor material found talc particles in approximately 75 percent of ovarian tumors examined. Subsequent evaluations have appeared to support the contention of an association between talc and ovarian carcinoma. 
The most recent study reported by the American Cancer Society has validated the claim that talc exposure increases the risk of ovarian cancer. Since the use of talcum powder is not an unusual practice for women, further studies need to be conducted to further understand the effects on a woman's female reproductive system. We had hoped that perhaps some of these research centers, some of these States would be interested in this. They might have done some work and might have been able to provide some health and safety recommendations in this area. 
But now we are saying that if the State of Washington, that was interested in alpha-hydroxy, or if we are going to find out from Columbia University the work they have done with regard to the finding of talc particles in the ovaries of patients undergoing surgery, if they wanted to do something in warning people in the State of New York, those would effectively be off the table. Why are we not debating how we are going to provide greater protection for women? 
We have seen important research done up in Seattle, WA. Why are we not out here debating what we are going to do about it? How can we provide protections? What about these kinds of recommendations in terms of the talc? How dangerous is that to our children? Why are we not out here debating that rather than saying, look, even though we have seen this kind of study, we are not going to permit the States to get into this--into this at all--because the cosmetic industry does not want it. 
On mascara, the FDA had numerous reports of corneal ulceration associated with mascara products, some of which caused partial blindness of the infected eye. In addition, many other reports of conjunctivitis caused by contaminated mascara were received. 
In a 1969 FDA survey of hand and body lotions and creams, about 20 percent of the products sampled contained microbial contamination. Researchers at the Medical College of Georgia demonstrated that 10 percent of eye cosmetics were contaminated when sold. Bacteria were isolated from about 50 percent of all used eye cosmetics. Popular brands of mascara were marketed without preservative systems and are particularly vulnerable to contamination. 
Mascara cosmetics can become easily contaminated during customary use because human skin is not sterile, and contact between the skin and a cosmetic leads to microbial contamination of the products. FDA published a notice asking the industry to provide information covering microbial testing methods and standards of performance suitable to assure that cosmetics do not become contaminated with microorganisms during manufacture as well as use. However, FDA's request for information resulted in no substantive response from the industry. The industry just said no. 
What can FDA do about it? Since FDA has no authority to request the safety data from the manufacturers or look at industry records, FDA's inquiries likely stops there. Can the States perhaps do something down the line? Perhaps they could have at some point, but not under this proposal. 
Expiration dates would help remind consumers to get rid of cosmetics before the bacterial contamination becomes dangerous. Under this legislation, States could not act to require expiration dating on cosmetics. 
So, Mr. President, the cosmetic provision of the bill is utterly irresponsible. It is a flagrant example of a special-interest lobby using its back room muscle to attain unfair advantage over the public interest. 
You bring that bill out separately, Mr. President, and let us have an opportunity to debate that on the floor of the U.S. Senate. The votes are not there to carry that individually. And they should not be there. But now we have seen that the cosmetics industry has added this on to legislation that was initially devised for the extension of PDUFA, to ensure adequate funding for FDA's drug review program so that the United States can be first in the world in terms of approving new products in the pharmaceutical industry. 
It is time for the Senate to stand up for the health of the American people, reject this unjustified, unwise, unacceptable provision that is nothing more than a tribute to the greed and recklessness of the cosmetic industry. The political power of the cosmetic industry is not a license to ride roughshod over the rights of the States and the health of the Nation's men, women, and children who use their products every day. 
The American people deserve safe cosmetics. They have a right to full and fair information about the actual and potential danger of their products. The last thing Congress should do in a bill called the FDA reform is to give the cosmetic industry a blank check, poisoning the American people with its products. 
Mr. President, we allow States to decide whether their bottles will be recycled or buried or whether their barbers are going to be licensed, whether their pets will be registered, how close to a crosswalk you can park your car, what hours the stores can be open. But this bill prohibits the States from protecting the consumers from cosmetics that can give you cancer, catch on fire, or cause birth defects. 
As I mentioned, the language broadly preempts any public information or public communication. That is an ironclad guarantee that the consumers will know less about their cosmetics. States will not be able to require warnings to parents or children about the dangers of a particular product. American consumers are going to know less about their products. The cosmetic industry introduces 1,000 new ingredients every single year into our cosmetics, everything from lipsticks, hair creams, soap, deodorant, and hair dyes. 
Do you think we will know how safe they are if this language becomes law? Who will be looking out after the public interest under this language? I suppose it is left to the two employees at FDA--an agency with limited authority and resources--who are charged with regulating $20 billion worth of cosmetic labeling and packaging. This language that we are considering was drafted by the cosmetic industry itself so make no mistake who it is intended to benefit. 
Many challenges to State action have been rejected by the Federal appellant courts because the courts interpret preemption narrowly. This is because the courts cannot imagine that Congress would want to preempt the States from protecting their citizens. So what does the cosmetic industry do? They carefully drafted this language to give them their broad preemption. They have admitted that they drafted this law specifically to force the Federal judges to interpret preemption very broadly. 
Mr. President, this provision should not become law. 
Mr. President, beyond this issue, I will mention two other 
important items that I hope we will have a chance to debate in the form of amendments when we move to the bill itself. Others have spoken to them, and I will work with them or introduce legislation on these particular provisions. 
The overall legislation includes a number of provisions that will significantly improve and streamline the regulation of prescription drugs, biologic products, and medical devices. I am pleased that, through a long process of negotiation both prior to and subsequent to the markup of the legislation, many provisions that seriously threaten public health and safety were dropped or compromised. 
But despite our best efforts, this legislation includes several Trojan horses that I think undermine important positive proposals in this bill. I would like to discuss the changes in the regulation of devices that put consumers at unacceptable and unnecessary risk. They should be removed from the bill before it goes forward. The administration has made it clear that these provisions put the whole bill at risk. 
A great deal of negotiation has taken place on the medical device provisions of this bill. I compliment Senator Jeffords and Senator Coats and other colleagues in the committee for resolving most of the divisive provisions in a way that is consistent with the protection of the public health. I see in the chair Senator Gregg. We worked with Senator Gregg on the health claims issues in a constructive manner. 
But there are at least two medical device provisions in the bill which still raise substantial concerns that could be corrected very simply with negligible effect on the basic purpose and intent of the bill. Yet these corrections have not been made. My colleagues deserve a clear description of the hazards they pose. A brief explanation of how the FDA regulates and clears the medical devices for marketing may be first in order. 
Under the current law, manufacturers of new class I and class II devices can get their products onto the market by showing that they are substantially equivalent to devices already on the market. For example, the manufacturer of a new laser can get that laser onto the market if they can show the FDA that the laser is substantially equivalent to a laser that is already on the market. 
Similarly, the manufacturer of a new biopsy needle can get that biopsy needle onto the market by showing that it is substantially equivalent to a biopsy needle already on the market. And the manufacturer of new patient examination gloves can get those gloves onto the market by showing that they are substantially equivalent to patient gloves already on the market. 
Mr. President, these manufacturers are obliged to demonstrate substantial equivalence to the FDA by showing that the new product has the same intended use as the old product and that the new product has the same technological characteristics as the old product. If the new product has different technological characteristics, these characteristics must not raise new types of safety and effectiveness questions in order for the product to still be substantially equivalent to the older product. 
The logic of this process for bringing medical devices onto the market is quite simple: If a product is very much like an existing product, it can get to market quickly. If it raises new safety or effectiveness questions, those questions should be answered before the product can be marketed. 
This process for getting new medical devices on the market, commonly known as 510(k), is considered by most to be the easier route to the market. Devices that are not substantially equivalent to a class I or class II device already on the market must go through a full premarket review. Thus, device manufacturers have an incentive to get new products on the market through the 510(k) process. In effect, well over 90 percent of all new devices get on the market through the submission of a 510(k) application. 
This legislation seriously compromises the FDA's ability to protect the public health through its regulation of medical devices that are marketed through the 510(k) process. Of the dozens of provisions that we have negotiated and discussed which affect medical devices in this bill, these two still raise fundamental public health problems. 
Although few in number, these provisions raise substantial risks to public health which simply cannot be ignored. 
The first problem raised by the bill relating to medical devices is a prohibition on the FDA from considering how a new device will be used if the manufacturer has not included that use in its proposed labeling. 
You may think this approach makes sense. Why should the agency consider the use of a device if the manufacturer has not specified the use on the label? I'll tell you why--because that proposed label may be false or misleading. How would the FDA know that? Because the design of the new device may make it perfectly clear that the new device is intended for a different use. 
Let me provide my colleagues with a few examples. Let's talk about the biopsy needle I mentioned before used on breast lesions. Most biopsy needles for breast lesions currently on the market take a tissue sample the size of a tip of a lead pencil. Assume the manufacturer of a new biopsy needle comes to the FDA with a 510(k) submission. But the new biopsy needle takes a tissue sample 50 times as big, the size of a 1-inch stack of checkers. 
The manufacturer of this new needle has proposed labeling that says that the needle will be used like the old, marketed needles to biopsy breast lesions. But FDA knows the chunk of tissue being `biopsied' will exceed the size of the lesion. This makes it clear to FDA--and any impartial observer--that the needle in most cases will be used to remove the lesion. 
Under these circumstances the FDA should be able to ask the manufacturer to provide information on this use. Is it safe to remove lesions? Does it really work? The bill, however, categorically bars FDA from asking these essential questions. This means the FDA would be unable to make a complete review of the device and the public would be deprived of existing assurances that devices are truly safe and effective. 
The proponents of this provision have argued that the FDA could simply say that the change in device design or technology--such as the change and size of the biopsy needle--renders the new product not equivalent to the old product. But that is not always true. The manufacturer could argue that there are no new questions of safety or effectiveness for the purpose claimed on the label. In the case of the biopsy needle there are times when a large sample is needed--a sample larger than a pencil tip. 
So long as the larger needle is safe and effective for removing a sample, FDA could be barred from obtaining data about the new use of removing lesions and to the extent the needle is used for the new use, women could be put at risk for effective or unsafe treatment of breast cancer. 
Another example is surgical lasers that have been used for decades to remove tissue. Several years ago, a manufacturer added a side-firing mechanism to their laser to improve its use in prostate patients. While the manufacturer did not include this specific use in its proposed labeling, it was transparently clear that the new side-firing design was intended solely for this purpose of treating prostate patients. 
As a result, FDA required the manufacturer to submit data demonstrating the laser's safety and effectiveness in treating prostate patients. This is precisely how the device review process should work. Manufacturers must prove their devices live up to their claims, while patients and doctors receive all of the information needed to make the best possible treatment choices. 
Under this bill, FDA would be prohibited from getting adequate safety data on the laser's use on prostate patients, even though that would be the product's primary use. This defies common sense, yet this is the result of one troubling and indefensible provision. Other examples in the way this provision could allow unsafe and ineffective devices onto the market abound. A stent designed to open the bile duct for gallstones could be modified in a way clearly designed for treatment of blockages in the carotid artery. Without adequate testing, it could put patients at risk for stroke or death. But under this bill, the FDA 
would be prohibited from looking behind the label to the actual intended use of the device. A laser for use in excising warts could have its power raised so it was also possible for use in smoothing facial wrinkles, but without FDA's ability to assure adequate testing, the use of the laser for this purpose could lead to irreversible scarring. 
Most companies, of course, will not try to bypass the process in this pay. But some bad actors will. This legislation should not force the FDA to fight these bad actors with one hand tied behind it. This provision is like asking a policemen to accept a known armed robber's assurance that the only reason he is wearing a mask and carrying a gun is that he is going to a costume party. 
The second way this bill undercuts the FDA's ability to protect the public's health and adequately regulate medical devices is the way it forces the FDA to clear a new device for marketing even if the agency knows that the manufacturer cannot manufacture a safe device. 
Let me repeat that. It sounds, frankly, preposterous but it is true. One of the bill's provisions actually requires the FDA to allow a new device on to the market even if the manufacturer is producing defective devices. Surprisingly, the proponents of this provision freely admit that this is true. 
Under the current law, let's assume that a maker of a new examination glove submits a 510(k) to the Food and Drug Administration and claims that the new gloves are substantially equivalent to gloves already on the market. If the FDA knows for a fact from its inspectors that the company uses a manufacturing process that often results in the gloves having holes, FDA would simply not clear the gloves for marketing. FDA would find that these gloves are not substantially equivalent to gloves on the market because gloves on the market don't have holes. That is common sense, and fortunately that is also the law. 
In contrast, this bill would force FDA to clear the gloves for marketing. These defective gloves would be sold to hospitals, clinics, and HMO's where they would be used routinely by doctors, nurses, paramedics, and other health professionals every single day. Every single glove would expose these professionals needlessly to AIDS and hepatitis. 
Here is the response of the provision's supporters. They argue that once these defective gloves are in the market and being used by health professionals, FDA can simply institute an enforcement action to remove them from the market. But when hundreds or thousands of defective devices have been distributed, and when dozens or hundreds of facilities may be using these devices, an enforcement action entails more than blowing a whistle or picking up the phone to place a simple call. 
In reality, FDA must coordinate with the U.S. Attorney's Office, U.S. Marshal's Office, and persuade the court of jurisdiction to issue appropriate papers. As any attorney or law enforcement professional can tell you, that takes precious time. In the case of a defective device which is exposing people to unnecessary risk, time is absolutely critical. The sooner a defective glove is pulled from the market the sooner the public is protected. 
All this makes no sense when the FDA can prevent this from arising. If this provision becomes law, the debater's point distinguishing between different forms of FDA authority will be paid for in the health and safety of American consumers, placed at needless risk of death and injury. In fact, even the regulated industry is willing to compromise on this provision because they recognize it is so unreasonable and should be removed from this bill. 
In the end, there is simply no justification for these troubling medical device provisions. Our overriding priority in regulating medical devices should be distinguishing between reforms which preserve the public health and protections and those which endanger the public health. 
Mr. President, we have had arguments on the other side of that 
provision which say, well, on the labeling provision are we going to have to require the manufacturer to dream up every possible use and be able to answer the charges that some nameless person at FDA can possibly imagine that a particular medical device would be used for? 
We say, no, that is not what we are looking for. We are looking for what would generally be defined as the predominant or dominant use of the device as a criteria. That ought to be the key. We know many devices are used in different kinds of ways. We are looking here at the predominant or dominant use for the device. That is what we are concerned with. 
You might have a pacemaker which can speed up the activities of the heart and some treatment might require that you slow down the beat of the heart. You might have one pacemaker that has already been approved, and someone else wanted to get on stream and say that they have a pacemaker that speeds up the heart but also may slow it down. So they come in and say, `We want this approved because it will speed up the heart but it also has the possibility of slowing it down,' in order to circumvent the safety requirements. 
It seems to me we ought to be able to work that out. We are looking, as I said, as a criterium of the predominant and dominant device use as the key. We are not looking for these other, incidental uses. It seems to me we ought to be able to work that through. For the reasons I outlined in discussing the good manufacturing practices provision, it seems to me we also ought to be able to find some common ground in that area, as well, but we are not there yet. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the education amendment offered by Senator Reed to appropriate $35 million to maintain the State Supplemental Incentive Grant Program. 
The SSIG Program is effective in encouraging States to allocate funds for need-based student aid programs. Elimination of SSIG will cause a significant loss of funds for many needy students and will discourage States from providing this important type of student aid. 
Continued funding for SSIG is supported by the American Council on Education, the United States Student Association, US PIRG, the National Association of Graduate-Professional Students, the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs, and the Education Trust. 
SSIG is a Federal-State partnership in student aid. States must match the Federal funds on a dollar-for-dollar basis. Eliminating the Federal share will inevitably result in many States dropping their programs entirely. 
SSIG constitutes a significant percentage of need-based aid in several States. It is also an incentive for State legislatures to provide their own need-based student aid. In 13 States, Federal SSIG is 20 percent or more of the total need-based aid in the State. In Hawaii and Mississippi, the elimination of SSIG funds would cut the State need-based aid in half. 
In Rhode Island, the State legislature provided need-based aid in order to obtain the Federal SSIG funds. The Connecticut Legislature increased need-based aid in order to meet the SSIG requirements. Louisiana will end all need-based aid if Federal funds for SSIG are not appropriated. 
One of the fundamental goals of the Higher Education Act is to provide greater access to higher education for all qualified students, regardless of income. Expanding this access is still a major challenge. In the upcoming reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, we will be considering all aspects of the roles of the Federal Government, the State governments, colleges, students, and their families in meeting the costs of higher education. 
SSIG is a program that works. It's a sensible Federal-State partnership, and it may well be a model for other steps to leverage the use of Federal funds. I urge my colleagues to support the Reed amendment to appropriate adequate funds for SSIG, so that needy students across the country will not lose this critical aspect of college aid.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator Graham has introduced, on behalf of Senator Abraham and me, a 2-year extension of the Refugee Act. That act is the core of U.S. refugee policy. It sets the criteria under which persons can be designated as refugees and provides funds for refugee resettlement. Last year, the United States admitted more than 75,000 refugees under the Refugee Act's criteria. 
In addition to determining who qualifies as a refugee, the Refugee Act allows the Department of Health and Human Services, through the Office of Refugee Resettlement [ORR], to provide services to refugees resettled in the United States. For example, ORR provides job training and employment assistance to new refugees to help them become economically self-sufficient. ORR helps States provide English language classes, preventive health services, and cash assistance to new refugees to help them get on their feet in the United States. Refugees often arrive here terrified and with few possessions. Most have fled persecution in their home countries and left virtually all their possessions behind. These programs make a refugee's assimilation into the United States a little easier. 
In addition to providing assistance directly to refugees, the Refugee Act makes funds available to the Public Health Service to provide overseas medical screening for U.S.-bound refugees for the protection of public health against contagious diseases. ORR also provides targeted assistance to States and counties with large refugee populations and has matching grant programs for voluntary agencies to assist States in refugee resettlement. For example, the Boston Tech Center in Massachusetts received $250,000 in discretionary targeted assistance to give refugees short-term skills training and teach basic English and math. The International Rescue Committee in Boston received funds under the Refugee Act to provide a youth program for newly arrived Somali children. 
The Refugee Act is the heart of our refugee law and policy. If it is not re-authorized, the United States will send a signal worldwide that refugees are no longer welcome here. We cannot let that happen. The act deserves to be extended and I urge the Senate to approve this amendment.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have just been notified about the death of Mother Teresa. I think I speak for all of the Members of the Senate, and I know that I speak for all of the members of my family and the people of Massachusetts that feel a sense of loss with Mother Teresa. She was really an extraordinary, inspirational, spiritual person whose life was devoted to others. She was a woman of enormous tenderness, gentleness, faith, and spirituality. 
I had the chance to visit with her in Calcutta in the late 1970's and was first exposed to her extraordinary work with the homeless and destitute in that community. I saw how she was able to minister unto the poorest of the poor in ways that were absolutely inspiring, in terms of her gentleness and in terms of her capacity for caring. Anyone whose life she touched will never forget her. She was really a very, very special person. This world is a better world because of her life. I know that all Americans will feel deeply about the loss of Mother Teresa. I just hope that we will all say a prayer for her. Thank you very much. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KENNEDY. I welcome the Senator's focus on that particular provision. We had attempted to address that question, but it was done very unsatisfactorily. I think the Senator has raised a very important issue with regard to what we have done in the legislation and the power of the FDA to deal with tobacco in this legislation. 
We will have an opportunity to address that when we move toward the legislation itself, but I think it is important and one of the principal reasons for taking the additional time on the legislation for the reasons that the Senator has just identified. 
For example, I think we have heard from responsible legal authority that if the manufacture of tobacco products were to label them as `intended for smoking pleasure' or `intended for weight loss' or `intended to be used twice weekly,' then there is a real question whether FDA can get safety data on the addiction of those health hazards. 
We know how creative--and the Senator from Illinois knows well because he has been a leader in the House of Representatives and in the Senate with regard to the activities of the tobacco industry--how creative they can be in terms of packaging, so to speak, their intercessions with the FDA in ways that can circumvent the kind of protections that all of us are so concerned about, primarily with youth, and also as part of this whole tobacco negotiation. 
I commend the Senator for the work that he is doing and welcome the opportunity to join with him to try and address the actions of the tobacco industry in the recent budget item to circumvent the agreements that the tobacco industry had made with the attorneys general. That is another issue for another time. What it does reflect is how the industry is working tirelessly at every junction to try and foreclose the opportunity of meeting their responsibilities, either under the agreement or under this legislation. 
I think they undermine the authority of the FDA in their agreement, which they signed with the attorneys general, and that agreement should not pass under any circumstances unless that measure is addressed. I know the Senator will work with us closely in doing that. 
But the Senator has identified another potential loophole that ought to be addressed. I am very hopeful that we will be able to do that. I thank the Senator for raising this because this is another very important aspect, as we are being asked to rush through this legislation. There are only two or three Senators evidently concerned about this particular proposal. We have seen the fact that the Governors, all of the Governors, the State legislatures sent in their resolution and their letter saying, `Go slow,' in opposition to the legislation. As the Secretary of Health and Human Services has also indicated, go slow. 
I thank the Senator for his comments on these other items, but particularly with regard to tobacco.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator would yield for a question on my time? 
As I understand, Minnesota has passed a hazardous product labeling bill requiring warning of all products that are ignitable, corrosive, reactive, or toxic, and that that this legislation will effectively be preempted--Minnesota's passage of that particular legislation. 
I was just interested in the Senator's reaction to that. That has been a judgment made in Minnesota by Minnesotans and passed by their legislature, is now current law, and has not been grandfathered into this legislation. It effectively would be eliminated.

Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I think we had earlier comments by our chairman, which we welcome, about the fact that California has been able to be grandfathered in and they will have the protections. But Massachusetts, my State, is about to pass this legislation. The people of my State of Massachusetts are concerned about the public health of citizens in that State, and want to provide the protection for those people. The action here in this legislation, as it is prepared, will basically wipe out those protections. 
I have been on this floor so often and have heard that we want to get away from the Washington solution to these problems, that what we want to do is get away from this one-form-fits-all solution; what we want to do is let the States make judgments and decisions. And here we are writing legislation that is going to preempt States from taking action in the future. We grandfather in one State, California, but are denying any other State the opportunity to take action. 
I find that very difficult to understand, or to be able to accept.

Mr. KENNEDY. I will give my assurance that if there is a Senator on the other side coming over here on the floor and wants some time, we will be delighted to make sure they have an opportunity to do so. 
Mr. President, again, I thank my friend and colleague from Vermont. We have worked long and hard on this issue, although there are areas where we do have differences, and I mentioned those here today. It is very important. It doesn't negate the point of the substantial progress that has been made on a wide variety of different matters, which we all believe will make a difference in terms of the health of the American people. 
Mr. President, I want to just, first of all, address and respond to some of the comments made by my friend from Indiana, Senator Coats, about the FDA, come to their defense because it was a rather blistering assault on the FDA. I have heard those comments made by the Senator on previous occasions. But as we are here on the floor of the U.S. Senate, I want to say a few words about the FDA and where it is now. Perhaps those comments might have been relevant some years ago. I don't believe that they are relevant today. 
Out of fairness not only to the men and women that work at FDA day-in and day-out and toil to protect the American consumer because the protection for the American consumer sets an example for the rest of the world, and for the agency itself, and for respect for that agency, I would like to point out that there are few more important agencies of the Federal Government than the Food and Drug Administration. The FDA is responsible for assuring that the Nation's food supply is pure and healthy. The FDA provides a guarantee that the drugs and devices we rely on to cure and treat diseases are safe and effective. It does its job. 
The FDA can speed miracle drugs from the laboratory bench to the patients' bedside. If the agency does its job poorly, it can expose millions of Americans to unsafe devices and medical products and jeopardize our food. I think even the most zealous supporters of the FDA recognize that there have been troubles in the past. But we would also recognize there has been the sincerest effort to address those deficiencies in the past. To listen to some of the speeches we have heard on the floor today, you would think that the FDA was a regulatory dinosaur, mired in the past, cumbersome and bureaucratic, imposing unnecessary and costly regulatory burdens on industry and denying patients speedy access to life-saving drugs. That is a myth. Those who want to destroy the FDA in the service of an extreme ideological agenda, or in the interest of higher profits at expense of patients' health, would love you to believe that. But it isn't true. 
The FDA's regulatory record is the envy of the world. It sets the gold standards for the protection of patient health and safety. The agency's recent performance under the leadership of former Commissioner David Kessler and the Clinton administration represents a model of how to transform the regulatory process so that it is more flexible, responsive, and speedy, while maintaining the highest standards of patient protection. Indeed, a large number of the positive elements of this legislation simply codify or extend actions the agency has undertaken administratively. 
The landmark PDUFA reauthorization contained in this bill was essentially negotiated by the agency and the industry, working collaboratively with the bipartisan efforts here in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. I welcome the chance to work closely with Senator Hatch in the passage of this legislation to improve the review process. 
In recent years, in partnership with Congress and the administration, FDA has responded to growing criticisms of delay in approving new products by taking impressive steps to improve its performance. The PDUFA Act of 1992 was one of the most effective regulatory reforms ever enacted. The bill established a new partnership between the agency and the industry. The industry agreed to provide additional resources and agreed to measurable performance standards to speed the review of products. This was unique instance where, in receiving the additional funding, they established criteria to be measured by over a period of time and those were strict criteria and a strict challenge. Every goal set by the legislation has not only been met, but it has been exceeded. 
Today, the FDA is unequaled in the world in its record of getting new drugs quickly to market without sacrificing patient protection. In fact, last year, the average review times in the United States were twice as fast as in Europe. Fifty new drugs were approved in both the European Union and in the United States. In 80 percent of the cases, the United States approved the new drugs either first or at the same time as the European Union. More companies chose the United States for the introduction of breakthrough drugs than any other country. 
In addition, to speeding the review times, the FDA has taken far-reaching steps to reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens on industry and modernize its regulatory process. More needs to be done, but these steps have added up to a quiet revolution in the way the FDA fulfills its critical mission. When PDUFA was originally passed, the device industry refused to agree to user fees that would give the FDA the additional resources and performance standards that have contributed to so much to the agency's outstanding record on drugs and biologics. 
I remember the negotiations. They were unsatisfactory, regrettably. But even in the device area, the FDA's recent achievements have been impressive. The so-called 510(k) applications, devices approved based on their substantial equivalence to a device already on the market, accounts for 98 percent of all the device admissions. FDA has now essentially eliminated its backlog. Last year, it reviewed 94 percent of these devices within the statutory timeframe, compared to only 40 percent just 4 years ago. 
Even in the area of class 3 devices, where the most problems remain, the FDA has improved its performance substantially. According to a study by the General Accounting Office, median review times dropped 60 percent between 1991 and 1996. In a recent survey of device industry executives reported that the business climate for the industry is in the best shape in the 5-year history of the survey. I introduced that in the Record in our markup. The industry publications are virtually uniform in terms of the progress that has been made and the atmosphere that has been created and the current very positive atmosphere. The sponsor of the survey attributes this favorable response in large measure to improvements at FDA and concludes that the agency has not only reduced the delays to allow new products to be introduced but, more importantly, has also greatly reduced executives' and investor's uncertainty about the timeliness of future product introductions. 
So, Mr. President, the FDA must continue to improve many of the provisions in this legislation. The idea that the reforms in this legislation must be passed at whatever cost, because the agency is doing a bad job, is simply incorrect. 
Now, Mr. President, I want to just return to what I consider the most troublesome part of our legislation. We have had very important discussions and representations by our colleagues and friends, the Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Reed and Senator Durbin, on particulars of the legislation, which I think need further attention. In my remaining time here, I would like to talk again about the whole issue of protection of the health and safety of the American consumer as it relates to cosmetic products. That is the most egregious and, I believe, unjustified provision in the bill, which would effectively cripple consumer protections by preempting State regulations on cosmetics. 
I note for the Record that these provisions, as I mentioned, were not in the chairman's mark, they were not the subject of significant hearings, and they have no place in the bill, whose primary purpose is to reauthorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act. That is the principal purpose of the bill, the reauthorization of that program and to try and accept these adjustments, incorporate into the law some of the measures which have been so successful administratively by the FDA. And also to incorporate the great majority of the measures which have been included in the bill that relate to pharmaceutical products and device products. 
If the Congress were earnest about addressing over-the-counter drug and cosmetic regulation, it would have undertaken a serious and detailed inquiry into the regulatory structure and authorities which assure that consumers are adequately protected before even remotely contemplating the possibility of preempting active and essential State protections. 
The preemption of cosmetic regulation is especially outrageous and shows a callous disregard for the health of American men, women and children. Cosmetics are broadly used by Americans, far more broadly than prescription drugs and medical devices and biological products. 
Mr. President, I want to mention why we find ourselves where we find ourselves today and why this issue is of such importance. I have here the testimony of Commissioner Young from some years ago, 1988. It points out that Congress, in 1938, recognized the public health problems associated with cosmetics and addressed them in the laws they enacted based on the science available to them. But science and the cosmetics industry have changed. In 1938, at most, only a few hundred ingredients were used to formulate cosmetics, and the industry was small in numbers of manufacturers that marketed products. Today, tens of thousands of cosmetics are in distribution, and the number of ingredients used has risen to an estimated 4,000 for producing a multitude of base formulation in equal number for compounding fragrances. 
Regulatory sciences have also progressed. When the law regulating cosmetics was enacted in 1938 the science was based on a less sophisticated concept for evaluating the safety of chemicals used on the skin. If you saw a reaction, you treated it; then avoid it. Today, science can take into account the effects produced under chronic long-term exposure to trace contaminants in addition to acute toxic effects, such as immediate skin irritations, contact allergic reaction, systematic reaction resulting from inhalation and ingestion. In 1938, the skin was considered to be an impenetrable barrier to cosmetics or other substances. 
As the number of ingredients and products has multiplied through scientific and technological innovation, our ability to measure minute amounts of residual contaminants and unwanted substances also has taken a quantum leap. At the same time science has developed more precise ways to assess risk, taking into account relevant factors such as use and exposure over a lifetime.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was pointing out how the change in the complexity of the different products had taken place from 1938 and the number of products that were out there; the number of potentially dangerous products that were out there and the progress that had been made from the time when there were only a few hundred of them; back to 1938. 
Listen to what we have now at the present time. This is according to the Food and Drug Administration and the studies that have been done. The number of cosmetic ingredients in the industry's own inventory is over 7,500. The industry has been adding new ingredients at a rate of 1,000 per year for the last few years. Virtually none of these ingredients have been properly tested for safety. The industry's safety review process has reviewed only 450 of the most commonly used cosmetic ingredients. That is about 20 a year. At this rate, even using the industry's own process, it will be many years before new ingredients are considered for safety. 
So the sheer number of cosmetic ingredients in products makes safety assurance difficult. And most adverse reactions for cosmetics are immediate burns or irritation--long-term effects which do not show up for many years, such as cancer or reproductive effects are even more difficult to determine. They require special studies designed to measure this risk, while many ingredients are studied for only short-term effects when they are added to products. Risk of cancer or reproductive effects are not available for the vast majority of cosmetic ingredients. 
Mr. President, we have been talking here this morning and this noontime about the authority and responsibility of different agencies. We have been talking about the power of the States. We have been talking about rules and regulations. But, when we are talking about health and safety, we are talking about real people. 
Let me give you the kinds of examples that we are dealing with. 
A woman from Santa Rosa--this is 1995, April 22--complained about an acrylic product which is for nails. She had the product applied to her nails. The product burned, and the cosmetician tried to remove it. Since the incident, six of her nails have fallen out. 
That was according to the California Department of Health Services, in April 22, 1995. 
Here is another one. 
On her 29th birthday, a woman from New Jersey was supposed to retire from the career she loved. She was a hairdresser for 11 years until a series of ailments, including difficulty breathing, burns in her sinuses and severe headaches prompted her to quit in August 1985. Her doctors had concluded that the beauty products she used on the job led to her medical problems. She had no idea what was actually in the products which she used in her beautician job. Lack of labeling is neither unusual nor illegal, although cosmetic manufacturers are required to list ingredients containing products sold to consumers. They need not do so for products sold for use only by professionals. 
Another case is Carolyn, a secretary from Rockville, MD. She arrived at a wedding shower and realized the permanent she had received at a beauty salon the day before resulted in a red swollen, face. Carolyn's is a case of cosmetic contact dermatitis, also known as acute allergic inflammation of the skin caused by contact with various substances found in cosmetics, including materials used by the hair stylist. This is a case that was reported to the FDA. 
A 33-year-old housewife consulted her dermatologist because of inflammation of her hands, face, and neck. She had experienced two similar episodes earlier in the year. After the skin properly healed, the physician determined through appropriate testing, that Swedish formula lotion had caused the adverse reaction. 
A telephone company supervisor was hospitalized after a 2-year history of chronic irritation of her eyelids. She received a variety of topical medications without relief. Her contact history revealed a long list of cosmetic eye drops, and multiple spray perfumes. All the cosmetics were removed from her hospital environment, and after her skin healed, patch testing showed lanolin in her creams--lanolin in her creams--was causing her condition. 
That is from a subcommittee hearing on health. 
The use of chemical skin peeling products caused severe injuries, including reports of skin burns from using a product called Peel Away. FDA sources said such products can penetrate the skin too deeply causing severe skin damages. In several cases persons have been hospitalized with severe burns, swelling, and pain. In one case, a California woman suffered seizures, shock, and second-degree burns after a combination of skin peel chemicals was applied to her legs by a beautician. Skin peeling procedures used to be carried on by plastic surgeons. 
However, they are now being done by nonmedical professionals, by beauticians and some using newly marketed preparations. Many have inadequate instructions. None has been approved by the FDA as being safe and effective. Again, an FDA consumer report. 
A letter from the CDC cited nine cases of eye infections due to microorganisms contained in mascara. One was a 47-year-old woman who developed a corneal abscess within days of scratching her eye with a mascara wand. The woman eventually needed a corneal transplant. 
As I understand it, it is because of the failure to be able to indicate that mascara needs an expiration date. 
So, Mr. President, this list goes on. I want to show what the States have been doing with regard to the protection for the American consumer. The issue now that is before the Senate on the FDA reform deals with the medical devices and pharmaceuticals and the extension of what we call the PDUFA, which will help to expedite the consideration of those measures. 
By and large, there is strong bipartisan agreement to those provisions. There are several that have been identified today that need further attention, but men and women of good will can work that out and work it out with the administration so that we can have a successful conclusion. But what was not considered in the original bill is the provisions that apply to preempting the States from giving protections to their consumers on the use of cosmetics. What we have recognized in this debate is that the Food and Drug Administration does not today have the authority, power, or personnel to protect the American consumer on the issue of these cosmetics. 
What we know overwhelmingly today is that the number of dangerous and toxic products and the number of carcinogens has expanded exponentially and is continuing to expand. All you have to do is look at the past record, of the numbers that have been introduced, and it is continuing and continuing to grow and those products are not being tested adequately today. 
So who has been protecting the American consumer? Who has been protecting the American public? The States have been doing it, and primarily California has been doing it, under the legislation which they have passed. How important that has been. It has not ended up with actions that have been taken by the State of California as the result of very extensive studies that products have been removed. What has happened is that the producers and the manufacturers have withdrawn the product, addressed the problem, put it back on the market, and by and large, if you look at the advertising, they would say the product is better today than it was yesterday. 
That has been the record. That has been the record. And that is why this is so important. Just review with me, Mr. President, the extent of this preemption--as I mentioned before, the extent of this preemption of the cosmetic industry in the States. This is the language that there will be the preemption for--`labeling of cosmetics shall be deemed to include any requirement relating to public information or any other form of public communication relating to the safety or effectiveness of a drug or cosmetic.' 
There it is in the legislation. They are effectively saying no to the States in providing public information or any public communication relating to safety. If the States are trying to protect their people and they develop public information on the basis of scientific studies, they are prohibited under this legislation. I don't know what the penalties are. I don't know what the civil penalties are, but they must be in there. They are prohibited from providing public information or any form of public communication relating to safety or effectiveness. 
That is what the cosmetic industry is doing in this legislation. That is the disdain that the cosmetic industry has for those in the States who are trying to protect the public. That is the arrogance that this industry has for legislators or Governors or attorneys general or medical professionals who are interested in the public. 
This is what this says. You cannot do it. You cannot provide public information even with regard to safety. That is arrogance. That is greed. That is the greed of a $20 billion industry. 
What do the States say? Well, why are you so worked up, Senator? It isn't just myself. Again, we have shown we have the letters from the Governors, the State legislators. This is not just one Senator's position. This happens to be the position of the Governors and the State legislators. 
Yes, I listened to the comments of my friend and colleague, Senator Jeffords, about the general statements of two of the Governors with regard to the health provisions on pharmaceuticals and devices, that is, an admirable job has been done. I think we still have areas to deal with. But I would certainly sign on to that. But what we are talking about is what we are saying to the States. The cosmetic industry is saying to the States you are not going to stick your nose in and protect the consumers there. What have they done in the past? Why are the other Governors worked up about it? Because of what these two charts demonstrate, Mr. President. 
Here we have the issue of lead which is known to cause birth defects and has also been found in hair dye. That is the result of State action, of State analysis, of various hair dyes that are out there that contain lead product. Initially, when there was the analysis, they said, well, this really isn't dangerous because it is just on the scalp. Then they did additional kinds of studies and found that the lead got into the individuals, obviously, who were using it. That lead was passed on to pets, children playing with pets, children ingesting it and when people are washing their hair day after day after day it causes a birth defect. Lead is one of the principal causes of mental retardation among children, period. We find, as a result of State activity, they have found it and it has been changed in many, many of the products--not all of them, because the cosmetic industry was able to get an exclusion from some participation. 
Mercury, which can cause mental retardation, has been found in lipstick and nail polish--lipstick and nail polish, mercury. With all the implications that has in terms of women's health and in terms of safe pregnancies, it is found in lipstick and nail polish. That was another study that was done in California. 
Alpha hydroxy, a known carcinogen, has been found in face creams. That was not done by the Food and Drug Administration. That is a result of State activities. There is not a physician in this country who does not know the dangers of lead and mercury and the alpha hydroxy to the American consumer, primarily women. There isn't a doctor who will not tell you that. Yet this legislation is saying, no more. This 
legislation is saying, no more. `Any requirement relating to public information or any other form of public communication relating to safety or effectiveness of the drug or cosmetic'--preempted. So we are saying, if you find this out, we are preempting you. You are not going to have to tell the public. 
As a result of State regulation protecting consumers, we have seen that States forced the removal of reproductive toxins from lipstick and nail polish. That is a result of State action. You have to admire the resourcefulness, the innovativeness, the persistence of the leaders in States that have had the courage and the determination and have been willing to take on the cosmetic industry, the cosmetic industry that by its own agreement spends 70 percent of its lobbying dollars in the States rather than on the Federal Government. You can understand that, because we haven't got any power over it, so they have targeted it in the States. Yet you find the courage of State public health officials who have been willing to force the removal of reproductive toxins from lipstick and nail polish. They didn't take the products off the markets. The manufacturers took them off the market and they addressed those issues. 
States forced the removal of harmful lead from hair dyes and antacids and calcium supplements. The States forced the removal of mercury from suppositories. These are just examples. 
How do we know how many other dangers there are out there when we have an explosion of dangerous products that have been agreed to by Republican and Democratic leaders of the FDA over the period of years--increasing exponentially with the dangers of toxins and carcinogens. The problem isn't getting less. The problem and the danger is getting more as every consumer understands the range of additional kinds of products that are out there and available to them. Nonetheless, we are asked on the floor of the Senate to say no to the States. We are not doing it at the Federal level. 
As I mentioned before, if you said, well, we are going to have a whole review, regulatory review, we are going back to say, OK, we will preempt the States but we will find out what we are going to do with regard to providing protection--we have had, as I mentioned earlier, the GAO studies that have been done 10 years ago which made a series of recommendations to the Congress about steps we ought to take if we are going to protect the public--then maybe, maybe then it makes some sense. But we have not done that. We have not done that. The FDA has been starved in resources to even fulfill its requirement for protection in terms of the American consumers in medical devices and with regard to pharmaceuticals. 
So we have a situation where we have limited, limited, limited authority under the FDA to protect the public for a range of these cosmetics. We find a record today where you are getting the explosion of these dangerous products, of toxins and carcinogens. Carcinogens cause cancer--cause cancer. We are seeing those numbers expand. We are finding completely inadequate policing by the cosmetics industry. We find the only breath of air that is out there to protect the public is the States. California is leading the way. Thank God, at least California has been grandfathered in. 
What we are saying is California is grandfathered in, but my State of Massachusetts, which is just about to pass a similar law, is out. We cannot protect people. Washington knows best. Washington is saying to Massachusetts, no matter how you want to protect your consumers up there, you can't do it because we are preempting you. 
Come on, Mr. President. This is a health issue. This is a safety issue. This involves primarily women, it involves children, and to some degree men in our society. But it involves health and safety. 
We have thousands and thousands of complaints about various products. I indicated earlier today--maybe I didn't--about the number of people--there were 47,000 cosmetic-related injuries in the emergency rooms in American hospitals in 1987--47,000. I wonder how many today, with greater utilization of cosmetics, greater danger, more toxins, more carcinogens. These are just the emergencies. These are not the kinds of situations that maybe--they may be--have long festering, long lasting kinds of implications and have been festering for a long period of time. 
That is what is happening out there--47,000 cosmetic-related injuries in the emergency rooms. How many others where people go back to their doctor and do not go through the emergency room? How many others? 
We have scores, scores and scores of complaints that have come to the FDA, and they go down the list. Thousands of consumer complaints in 1996 alone: Equate Baby Oil--these are complaints to the FDA--their complaints are eye tissue damage. Disney Kid Care Bubble Bath: urogenital track reactions. Nat Robins Eye Shadow Pencils: eye rash, burns and irritation. Flame Glow No Mistake Eyeliner Pen, black magic color: Rash, burns, and irritation. Incredible Lex Mascara, Eye Perfector, Dramatic Timing Faceneck, Covergirl Professional Advanced Mascara: rash and burns. 
These are the companies. You have the Disney Co., the Reckitt & Colman Co., Softsoap Enterprises, Great American Cosmetic. They produce Nat Robins eye shadow pencils. 
You have Del Laboratories, Estee Lauder eye shadow; Avon products; Procter & Gamble, rash and burns. 
You have Helene Curtis, Salon Selective Styling, flammable, resulting in thermal burns. 
You have American Pride, hair relaxer, Alberto Culver lotions, hair tissue damage and hair loss. 
You have Clairol, Clairol Infusion 23 Shampoo, hair loss and hair tissue damage; 
Del Laboratories; 
You have Products Naturistics Mango Shampoo, hair loss and damage; 
Helene Curtis, Suave Balsam and Protein Shampoo, hair loss, hair damage. 
Vigoral--we find hair loss and tissue damage. 
Alberto Culver Co., VO5, hot oil concentrated treatment, hair loss and tissue damage; 
Hydrox Laboratories, Fresh Moment Mouthwash, mouth infections--mouth infections; 
Carter Wallace, Arrid deodorant, bleeding and infection with utilization; 
Apollo Health Care, Baby Bear Lotion, pain, including itching, stinging, burning, and soreness. 
Mr. President, these are just some of the items. I may very well include the whole list in the Record on Monday. These just give an example of some of the leading companies. 
Some may say, these are not really accurate. We would know whether they are accurate if we were able to give the assurances that we had those in the States who were looking into this and be able to say, `Look, this isn't a problem.' But now we are not going to know because all the States are preempted. Now we are going to find these reports are going to come in more and more. We will have to just presume that they are accurate, because the cosmetic industry will not let us find out whether they are or are not accurate. They will not permit the publication of information that is going to reflect poorly on either safety or effectiveness. 
Mr. President, these are just some of the items that I think form the compelling case for State action. I think we will on Monday go through some of the particular cases in more detail on the California situation, because I think that they have really had the soundest record. It isn't easy to get this kind of information, but we will go through it. These that I just mentioned are some of the thousands of consumer complaints to Government agencies. This is only for a few months of the year, and I have read just a very few of them. I will perhaps get into even more of them later on. 
Mr. President, I mentioned earlier a study by the General Accounting Office which reported that more than 125 ingredients used today are suspected of causing cancer. We have scores of cosmetic ingredients that can damage the nervous system, including headaches, drowsiness, convulsions. 
To all of those watching this program I would say, `don't discount the fact that perhaps some of your ailments--headaches, drowsiness, and convulsions--may actually be resulting from the use of cosmetics.' Don't discount that, because the record shows that cosmetics manufacturers are including ingredients that can cause those symptoms. You don't know, your State won't know, the Federal Government won't know, we won't be able to tell you because of the power of the cosmetic industry in foreclosing that kind of study and the publication of information about the real health implications. 
The GAO found that additional Federal authority is necessary to protect the public. That is the General Accounting Office. It is not this Senator from Massachusetts, not a Democrat, it is not a Republican. Here is the General Accounting Office reaching the conclusion, after reviewing this whole subject matter, that if you want to protect the public, you need greater Federal authority--we are not getting that today. The only authority that we have out there is at the State level, and this bill is taking that away. 
How much do we have to yield to the greed of this industry? How much? And why? Why should we do it? We patch together something that will take care of California because they passed their law a couple of years ago. But we say to the other 49 States, `You can't, you are never going to be able to do it again, never be able to do it again, ever.' They have been able to protect their consumers. Hopefully, they will be protecting the people of Massachusetts, because that is the only way we are going to be protected, not at the Federal level, but through their own leaders, legislature, and representatives. No, we are just saying absolutely not. 
So, Mr. President, the cosmetic industry wants the public to believe that no effective regulation is necessary or desirable. They are masters of the slick ad and expensive public relations campaign, but all the glamour in the world cannot obscure the facts. 
Mr. President, I just showed what the results of some of these actions are in terms of affecting people. I mentioned the peelaway product. This is a before and after appearance and complaint of the peelaway product. You can take a look and see what happens to people. 
These are various ingredients which have been put on an individual's feet. Look at the reactions to it. We are saying, no, we are not going to permit the States to try and do something about that kind of activity. And we could have had a whole series of charts up here. 
I mentioned just a few moments ago what was happening in terms of burns and irritations that are occurring with skin products and what is happening to eye tissue and what is happening with rash and burns and hair tissue and hair loss and mouth infections and bleeding--the list goes on and on. 
We could have had charts all around this room. Generally speaking, when you have this kind of circumstance, we would be in here debating what to do about it. Instead of thinking about what we are going to do about it, we are talking about what we are not going to do about it. 
Mr. President, here we have seen what the States have done, what the problems have been, what the dangers are to the American consumer in terms of mercury, lead, and other substances in products that everyone knows are dangerous and are health hazards. Here we have a problem, and it is getting bigger. The products that are being produced for the market are more dangerous. Yet, we are doing less and less and tying the hands of the local communities to act in our stead. 
We allow States to decide whether your bottles are going to be recycled or whether they are going to be buried. We permit the States to decide what they are going to do about licensing barbers. States decide and have rules and regulations and laws about pets. We have States that have rules and regulations about how close to the crosswalk you can park your car. We have regulations in the States about what store hours are going to be, how late a store can be open. But this bill would prohibit the States from protecting consumers from lipsticks, hair creams and the soaps, hair dyes, mascara, and deodorants that can give you cancer or can catch you on fire as a result of flammable ingredients, or cause serious birth defects. 
Now, does that make any sense at all? Does that make any sense at all? When you have the most serious dangers in terms of health and safety, we are denying States the opportunity to do something about it, but we will let them go ahead and look after these other kinds of issues which are not related in any particular way to health and safety. 
It just doesn't make any sense. It makes no sense at all. The proponents of this provision know they couldn't pass this legislation if it wasn't tagged on to the Food and Drug Administration bill. They wouldn't dare bring this legislation out here on its own. The reason they tagged it on this bill is because they knew the importance of food and drug reform. They knew that we had to pass the extension of PDUFA, which is a key program to provide sufficient resources to the Food and Drug Administration to get the qualified people who can help expedite the more rapid consideration of new products, new pharmaceuticals in the Food and Drug Administration and has been very creatively utilized over there. 
So what do they do? They tag this on to that train. This legislation would be laughed out of this body if it came up here on its own. Why don't they try to bring it up on its own? We have Members in the Senate say, `We don't understand, there are just one or two Senators troubled by this.' All the Governors seem to be troubled by it, and you can't blame them. They have the fundamental responsibility for protecting health and safety. That has been fundamentally a responsibility at the State and local level. It is a fundamental responsibility that is as old as this country. So the Governors don't buy into this. 
The administration understands that this thing is a phony grab, a greedy grab for profit, because that is what it is. It will mean that the various cosmetic industries are not going to have to be altering or changing their products because you are not going to have the research being done or the authority in the States to bring changes that would make products safer. It is going to mean more profits. On the one hand, more profits for the cosmetic industry and much greater health threats in terms of safety, in terms of potential birth defects for infants, for various kinds of ingested products with a whole range of sensitivity to the body--eyes, mouth, ears, hair--and the problems of lips and the ingestion of various products that are dangerous.

Mr. KENNEDY. It just defies any logic. So, as we all know--we have been around here--hopefully even the newer Members understand this one, where you get something that is going through and can't make it on its own, and is added at the last or next-to-last markup with just a fraction of the discussion as we have had to date out here today during this consideration, and it is locked in. 
That cosmetic industry is just smiling. They are smiling now with the votes that they had down there saying, `Well, it seems we've got through this hurdle.' I am just telling you, this is a long, long process. And they better get used to the fact there is going to be a long process, because this issue is not going to go away. It is not going to go away today, and it is not going to go away when we talk about this some more on Tuesday and get more information. It is not going to go away on Tuesday and not going to go away in terms of the consideration of the legislation. It is not going to go away for a long, long time. 
Amazing about how a measure like this can slow something down over a long time so that the American people can begin to understand what is really at risk. I do not believe that they do. I wonder how many Members of this body have read through the legislation and understood exactly what was included in terms of the cosmetic program. 
So with this particular proposal in there, we are going to have to ensure that we are going to have the kind of full awareness and understanding, not only by our colleagues here but the American people as well, as to what the health implications are. 
This has important and significant health implications. We deal with a variety of different proposals in terms of education--the HOPE scholarship, the tuition credit, the work-study programs--and we debate those and discuss those and allocate resources to those, trying to decide how much we are going to provide in terms of the Head Start Program. Will it be 59,000 new children this year or 100,000? At the end of the day we may understand that our side does not win, others prevail on it, but we know that we have made the battle and made the fight, and the people that are going to be disadvantaged may be those children who are not going to get that benefit in terms of education. And that is a tragedy in terms of a mind developed. 
But here we are talking about something else that is even much more important. You are talking about the vital health of the American people and the safety of the American people. You are talking about the dangers to children and infants and about the birth of healthy children. You are talking about the dangers to children's eyes, and you are talking about the dangers to people who are trusting just what they see on the shelves of American pharmacies across the country. 
I would say that 9 out of 10 Americans who walk into any pharmacy this afternoon and see a product on the shelf are saying, `Well, this is just sort of like my medicine or just about like the other products that I'm buying here. Somebody's looked at it, the Food and Drug Administration or somebody's looked at it, and it is safe or it wouldn't be out there.' That is baloney. It is true for prescription drugs. And by and large it is true about over-the-counter drugs. True about medical devices, by and large. You can flyspeck and find instances, but that is true about those. We have the safest regulatory systems in the world. But it is not true for those products that are on those shelves that so many millions of people are using and have resulted in, in 1 year, 46,000 people going to the emergency room. 
People do not go to the emergency room unless it is serious. I do not know whether it is $300, $800 to go to an emergency room to get any kind of attention. People might go back to their doctors with good health insurance, go back to their dermatologists to ask them to do it, but how many people are going to the emergency room? Someone with a little burn is not going to that emergency room. Particularly if you are working families and have children and you do not have health insurance, you are not going to be going down. How many other people did not go and still were adversely affected? But we say, `Oh, no, no, no, we're not going to do anything about that.' Whatever was being done out there by the States--that is out now. You cannot go forward with it. 
So, Mr. President, the cosmetics industry wants the public to believe there is no effective regulation that is necessary or desirable. They are masters of the slick ad and expensive public relations campaign. But all the glamorous pictures in the world cannot obscure the facts. This is an industry that is underregulated and its products are too often hazardous. 
The severe reactions may be only the tip of the iceberg. Long-term illnesses, ranging from cancer to birth defects, may not be linked to their underlying cosmetic-related causes. As the GAO points out, `Available estimates of cosmetic-related injuries do not accurately reflect the extent to which consumers are exposed to toxic cosmetic products and ingredients. Because symptoms of chronic toxic effects may not occur until months or years after exposure, injury estimates generally account for only acute toxic effects.' 
The GAO is saying that with those 46,000 people that are going to the emergency room, that is only the tip of the iceberg. And Lord only knows, if you did not have State action in taking away the lead and the mercury and the other kinds of poisonous products that are cancer forming there would be even a much more dramatic number for it. 
Here we have the GAO effectively saying that because the symptoms of chronic toxic effects may not occur until months after exposure, injury estimates generally account for only acute toxic effects. We see that in 1987 we had 46,000 of what we know now was the exponential increase in the danger of all these products. We can imagine the dangers that exist out there today. 
In light of this limited authority and even more limited resources to protect the public, you would think Congress would want to encourage States to fill the regulatory vacuum. You would think we would be out here asking, what can we do to help, if anything, the States that are trying to address protections for their consumers? What can we do with the Centers for Disease Control to help Massachusetts, to help Georgia, help North or South Carolina? What are the resources that are out there to assist your State legislatures, Republican and Democrat, to provide protection from some of these toxic or carcinogen problems? 
But, oh, no, we are not out there asking that this afternoon. We are out there putting more roadblocks in front of the States in their attempt to do so. In fact, the language is so extreme the States have been barred, as I mentioned, from establishing `any requirement relating to public information or any other form of public communication relating to the safety and effectiveness of a drug or cosmetic.' 
So, Mr. President, the last time the Senate looked at the issue of cosmetic regulation was in the late 1970's. We held extensive hearings, and we debated the issue, and we passed a comprehensive bill that included additional authorities for the FDA. Today, we are considering a bill that resulted from no hearings, where there has been little debate, no expert testimony in a product area that touches the American public every day. 
It should be made clear to anyone that cosmetics are as deserving of adequate regulation as they were 20 years ago. It defies logic that our single action in this important consumer product area is to preempt the States from acting where there is wide agreement that FDA has neither the authority nor the resources to adequately fill the field. An attorney, now with Procter & Gamble, wrote in a 1996 Food and Drug Law Journal article that although cosmetics are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, `the agency's regulation is extremely lenient.' If lenient regulation led to the chamber of horrors documented in the Senate hearings 20 years ago, it is difficult to imagine the impact of preempting the States from acting. 
The proponents of the bill will tell you their language preempts State safety regulations only--remember we heard that during the course of the day--that their language preempts safety regulations only where the Federal Government has acted. But the actual statutory language is very broad and demonstrates a different intent. The industry admits that the language is drafted specifically to undermine Federal judges that have narrowly interpreted the Federal preemption. 
For instance, if FDA sets a standard for lead in hair products, this bill would direct a conclusion that the lead level sets the standard for other, unrelated products that might have different routes of exposure. So we know what the industry was doing. You can talk about these issues in generalities, but you have to look at the specific language here. 
Mr. President, I have no doubt the industry will argue that any little action on FDA's part will preempt State action. Yet we have no assurance the FDA is actually up to the task of filling the void left by the States. Again, we have had no hearings, no public record, no expert testimony. In fact, the industry cannot cite one example of a burdensome State regulation that this law preempts. I hope that if that is not the case, that this record will be clarified. The industry cannot cite--you have not heard in this debate here this afternoon the industry citing one example of a burdensome State regulation. Instead, they suggest that the benefit of this law is prospective. They claim they are concerned about what the States might do in the future. This is legislation for a problem that does not exist. But they see that this was the chance to get on this particular train, and they are riding it. 
The stark reality is that, according to the cosmetic industry itself, the industry spends 70 percent of its lobbying dollars influencing State legislatures. I suppose we should really call this the FDA Lobbying Relief Act. I find scarce comfort in the fact that this bill will relieve cosmetic lobbyists from having to lobby 50 States, who can now focus on Congress. Even worse, if this provision is enacted, the cosmetic lobbyists will spend their time getting FDA to act in some small way on a safety issue simply to create a broad scope of Federal preemption of the State in that area. 
This is irresponsible deregulation, putting the proverbial cart before the horse. Let me emphasize that if we want to truly reform the FDA's regulation of cosmetics, we should start with ensuring they are protecting the American public from unsafe cosmetic products. Once the American people can be confident that FDA has the authority and the resources to protect them, that FDA is up to the task, then we can talk about State preemption. That is the way we have always approached State preemption in the past, and that is the only way to approach it now. 
The proponents of this provision claim that by permitting States to petition for exemptions, there is adequate protection for States rights. In reality, the high procedural hurdles in this provision, especially the extreme, burdensome requirements of formal rulemaking, ensures a lengthy process where industry will entangle States in years of hearings. Given the lack of Federal presence in the area of cosmetic regulation, it is unconscionable to make the States jump through hoops in order to continue to protect and warn their citizens. 
They finally say, `Well, OK, you can make some progress and deal with this, but you're going to have to jump through all these hoops.' How many times have we been hearing on the floor about rules and regulations and the bureaucracy of Federal regulatory agencies, and here we have those that support this proposal on cosmetics setting up hoops for any of the States to jump through--hoops and landmines--hoops for the States to jump through in order to continue to protect and warn their citizens? 
I assure my colleagues that this is only the first instance of where you will witness efforts at sweeping preemption in the absence of significant Federal activity. We will be faced with a barrage of bills seeking to preempt State authority in the area of public health regulation. It is certainly ironic that this Congress is so determined to undermine States rights. 
Mr. President, let me emphasize again how this provision hinders States from protecting their citizens at the end of the day. The labeling and packaging of a cosmetic is preempted completely under this language. States will be unable to communicate safety concerns in the most effective and sensible manner--through labeling and packaging. Even if the States retain some vestige of authority over cosmetic safety, this bill ties their hands and prevents them from giving the public the information it needs to make informed choices. `Right to know' under this provision means `right to no information.' 
What about the FDA? Today, the FDA has fewer than two people working on labeling and packaging. In fact, most of the 30 people working in the FDA Office of Cosmetics work on the regulation of color additives and not actually on cosmetics. The reason for this underwhelming presence is simple: FDA has put limited resources in the cosmetic program because they simply do not have adequate legal authority to address cosmetic safety. If you can't enforce the law because there is no enforcement authority and because the standards are basically nonexistent, 
you are not going to squander valuable personnel where there are drugs and medical devices to approve, and foods to keep safe. 
For example, if the FDA suspects a cosmetic safety problem exists, as they do with the use of alpha-hydroxy, acid face creams, the agency faces high hurdles in bringing any kind of regulatory action. The FDA bears the burden of demonstrating by its own testing that the product is injurious to health. The FDA cannot make the company demonstrate they are selling a safe product. That is important, Mr. President. The FDA cannot come in and say to the company, `Show us the information for the product you are testing to demonstrate this is a safe product.' No, they do not have that power or authority. The FDA cannot require the companies to come in, and the FDA, by its own testing has to demonstrate that the product is injurious to health. 
Today, the FDA knows how many milligrams of aspirin are in a tablet and they know how much sodium is in human or animal food and can require disclosure of this information to consumers, but the FDA does not have to know how much alpha-hydroxy acid is in face cream. The agency cannot even require the cosmetic companies to disclose the presence of a known carcinogen like alpha-hydroxy acid to consumers. We need to understand, Mr. President, that the agency cannot even require the cosmetic companies to disclose the presence of a known carcinogen--they cannot do it--like alpha-hydroxy, to consumers. 
It is, frankly, no wonder that 70 percent of the cosmetic industry lobbying takes place in the States because that is where the action is. That is where the standards are being set. That is where the standards are being set and enforced. 
My colleagues do not have to take my word. We have a letter from the National Governors' Association, Association of Food and Drug officials, and the Association of State Legislatures, voicing strong opposition to this whole provision. We have a letter from the conservative Republican Attorney General of California, Dan Lundgren, strongly opposing this provision, and speaking eloquently about the importance of State laws on cosmetic safety. 
In my own State we have a bill that would extend the same public health protections enjoyed by California under their right-to-know law, Proposition 65. Proposition 65 is so successful and so popular with California voters that the committee has excluded it from preemption. No one has refuted the positive impact Proposition 65 has had on the public health. No one has. But instead of taking a law that is working so effectively to protect the public and encourage other States to emulate California today, we are debating whether to preempt every State but California. 
Some of my colleagues have expressed satisfaction with grandfathering Proposition 65. They should delay their celebration. This bill grandfathers Proposition 65 in its current form, which applies to reproductive toxins and carcinogens. But California cannot react to future scientific developments by warning its citizens against other hazardous substances.

Mr. KENNEDY. Reading from the last paragraph: 
Proposition 65, as well as the Sherman Food and Drug Law are examples of the type of State regulation that protects the health and safety of its citizens and that coexist comfortably with Federal regulation. The States should be permitted to continue in their historic role as guardians of the welfare of their citizens. We therefore respectfully urge you to seek modification of your bill to address this issue. 
There it is, Mr. President, from the attorney general of California, a conservative Republican, who understands as a person that has been working and implementing this legislation why this proposal is rotten and why it ought to be adjusted. 
Mr. President, a few years ago, the agency proposed establishing a cosmetics hotline to receive consumer complaints. The FDA hoped to fill in gaps because their voluntary cosmetics adverse event reporting systems had dismal compliance rates of well below 40 percent. The majority of all cosmetics health problems were going unreported, and here was an ingenious solution. The reason the reporting systems were all voluntary is because the FDA does not have the authority to require companies to tell consumers what kind of problems consumers are having. Put Congress and some heavy lobbying together and you get a congressional prohibition forbidding FDA from establishing the hotline. So we were denying the FDA from having a hotline. 
When will it stop, Mr. President? We are preempting all of the States, except California, from taking any steps to give the FDA any kind of additional authority. Then when there was the effort to just establish a hotline so people could call in and register their complaints, the funding for that hotline was dropped. I wonder why? I can tell you why. I gave you some examples of why, just a few moments ago, with the consumer complaints to various agencies, including the FDA, with people writing in. No, we are not going to hear from the public. 
Finally, Mr. President, there was some reference earlier about medical device legislation in Europe. We often hear about FDA's regulation of drugs as the international gold standard. I refer to our country's regulation of cosmetics as the fool's gold standard. Cosmetic regulation in other countries is far superior to our own. The European Union requires full ingredient listing on packaging, documentary proof of good manufacturing practice, and similar proof that extensive testing has been carried out on all products. Mexico recently adopted regulation mandating expiration dates on all cosmetics. Although New York recently adopted just such a rule, it may live a short life--the bill before the Senate would preempt that regulation even if FDA does not have its own regulation in place. 
Let's continue on our world tour. Canada requires that manufacturers submit data showing that a product is safe under normal use conditions. Sweden is initiating product registration for cosmetics and Denmark is considering a similar law. Malaysia requires mandatory registration of cosmetics. The list goes on, but the point is clear. We are not content to lag behind other countries in protecting our citizens. We prefer to buck the trend and expose them to greater hazards. As experience has shown in other countries and in California with Proposition 65, the industry can readily comply with meaningful safety standards when they are imposed. 
Unlike food or drugs, cosmetics are not essential to our health. We use them because their benefits are so clear. We need only mention this summer's unprecedented beef recall to illustrate that our food supply is not perfectly safe. But cosmetics are a different matter. We are not compelled to use them. For that reason, we should be far less willing to accept injury and death from such products. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier I reviewed for the Senate the actions that have been taken by the States which have resulted in additional kinds of protections for safety for the American consumer in those States, primarily in California. I reviewed some of the items that posed the principal health hazards for citizens--the lead, the mercury, and other items and what has happened by the States when removing those items. 
Then I also mentioned, Mr. President, the limitations we have in terms of the Food and Drug Administration in taking any actions to protect people and the power of the cosmetic industry in refusing to even have a hotline. We have hotlines in so many different and important areas for American people. We have them with regard to battered women, as one of the principal sponsors for that. We are not comparing that need with this one but there is enormous importance and enormous justification and that has been a powerful, powerful instrument for battered women in our society. 
We wanted to try and have at least a hotline for people that might be able to have been impacted adversely by these cosmetics. We mentioned already that there are 46,000, at the last count, people going to emergency rooms--46,000. And we know the dangers which are out there in terms of impacting the American consumer and they have increased dramatically with the increase in products. It has been recognized by the companies and the industry itself by the number of products and the complexity and the toxins that have been included. 
So the only real opportunity that we have other than going to the States and reviewing the kind of complaints that they have has been from the various agencies of government. I mentioned just a few moments ago about these various items and I will go into greater detail with the companies and what the allegations are and what the results are on Monday. I have them here but I will not take the additional time. 
The fact is, these are the kind of results we are having, Mr. President. When California runs into those circumstances they can do something about it. When California found out about a particular product, the State was able to do something about it. Now, under this legislation, on this preemption, 49 States will not be able to do something about it. California has been grandfathered in, but all of the rest of us that come from other States will not be able to get that kind of a protection. 
Now, I just mention the kind of injury complaints that have been included. They include, going through this code which we are gradually going through, injury code 14 includes rash, redness, swelling, blisters, sores, weeping, lumps, inflammation, sunburn, chemical burn and irritation; code 19, pain, to include itching, stinging, burning, soreness, and tingling; injury code 20, tissue damage--other than thermal burn, peeling, splitting, cracking, hair, or nail breakage; code 21, discoloration; code 22, infection; code 23, nervous system reactions, to include dizziness, headache, irritability, nervousness, numbness; injury code 24, respiratory reaction, to include choking, coughing, sneezing, shortness of breath, wheezing; code 25, digestive system reaction, upset stomach, nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea; code 26, bleeding, code 27, 
urinary tract infections; code 28, flammability resulting in thermal burns; code 29, blurred vision; code 30, death as a result of inhalation or sniffing deaths, and code 31. 
These are serious, Mr. President. These are serious health hazards. Before we in this body and the House of Representatives see a piece of legislation tagged on to the important Food and Drug Administration, the medical device and the pharmaceuticals which are so important, on which we have made so much progress, on which all of us are hopeful will finally result in a bipartisan agreement, we see the greed of the cosmetic industry go right out there and tag on this amendment as one of the last amendments to preclude the States--they have gotten the Government effectively precluded, unlike the European countries. The European Union, and most of the other industrial countries of the world, have some protections. They have been able to preclude the Federal Government, and now they are precluding the States from protecting the consumers and putting them at risk for all those kinds of illnesses and sicknesses that I have talked about here that are resulting from all of those products. 
That is what we are being asked to embrace. That is what we are being asked to embrace. For those that understand the importance--the Attorney General of the State of California, who has been working on this, makes it so clear: Don't do it, Senator. Don't do it, Senate of the United States. Don't do it in the Congress and Senate. Mr. President, don't sign that legislation. He wants to be able to protect the people in California, as other public health officials want to be able to protect their people in the other 49 States. That is the issue. That is the issue. 
We are going to come back to it again and again and again, Mr. President, because it is of such enormous importance to the health and safety. The other side of the balance is the question of greed by the cosmetics industry. Usually, when we are making tough decisions around here--and we have made them--we have limited funding; for example, for the food programs for our elderly people. We have to make a judgment, are we going to treat more people in congregate sites where you can feed more elderly people with limited resources, or are we going to carve out some and feed them at home, which means you will get to less people, you will get those people that are homebound. What do you do under those circumstances? You are placing needy people of one side against needy people on the other. 
No easy answers on this. Painful judgments and decisions on that. We don't always get it right. We understand that. People of good will can differ on that and feel strongly about it, and we respect them here in this body. But under this circumstance, we are talking about the profits of the cosmetics industry and the risk to the American consumer. That is what the balance is. That is what is unacceptable. That is what is outrageous and that is why that cloture vote was necessary, so we begin to wake up America as to what is happening to these States. That is what we are going to have an opportunity to debate as we go to this bill, plus the other measures. 
Mr. President, the last unacceptable element of this bill is an assault on the basic environmental protections contained in the National Environmental Protection Act, which is a key Federal environmental statute that regulates the Government's own actions through environmental impact statements. Under NEPA, Federal agencies must undertake a comprehensive environmental planning process for every major action they take. This law is a crucial statutory assurance that the work of the Government, the actions of regulated industries are consistent with the guiding principles of environmental protection. 
Section 602 of the bill broadly exempts FDA's activities from environmental impact assessment under NEPA. This is the first preemption of NEPA in a regulatory agency and is the beginning now of cutting back very, very important environmental issues. For what reason? Why are we, in our committee that is responsible in terms of the education and the health and basic research, and the basic oversight of laws dealing with labor and management, pensions, and some of the older Americans activities --why in the world are we going around here in terms of preempting NEPA from the FDA? Who do you think was interested in that? Perhaps some of the industries who want to get out from under filing the environmental impact statement. If we are starting off with this agency, we know exactly what is going to happen in each of the other agencies. 
This week, I spoke with the Vice President who expressed his serious personal concerns about this provision. Just a few sentences: This bill opens the door to weakening environmental protection, and lays a welcome mat down for future exemptions and attacks on the effective and essential environmental statute. This is an act of environmental extremism, which should have no place in this or any other bill. 
The reauthorization of the prescription drug and user fee is tremendously important to assure that the FDA will have the resources to review the new drugs. That is what we ought to be addressing. 
Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I congratulate my friend and colleague, Senator Jeffords, for the attention he has given to trying to bring the FDA into the modern world and to trying to consider a wide variety of different recommendations and suggestions and for working with the members of our committee, both the Republicans and Democrats. 
This has been a trying process, but I commend him--and I speak for all of those on our side--for the diligence with which he has approached this and the knowledge he has demonstrated on this particular range of issues. 
We all understand, the American people understand, that the principal responsibility of the FDA is to preserve and protect the public health. This is different from other agencies. Therefore, any alteration or change in the authority of the FDA and in consideration that various aspects of the law have to be balanced against what is in the short-term, medium-term and long-term interest of the public health of the American people. The FDA is the singular agency throughout the world that has demonstrated that it understands that particular commitment and has done an extraordinary job. 
Many of us have frustrations about the FDA on particular products in our State and about general kinds of process and procedure. But no one can review the history of the FDA and not understand that today the FDA is the principal instrument for approving new drugs and new medical devices. This legislation today is to try to extend what we call the PDUFA, which is a proposal that was enacted under the leadership of Senator Hatch and myself a number of years ago, which provides user fees by the major drug companies to make sure that we will have the expertise to consider various drug products more rapidly. There is an important need for the extension of that particular proposal, and all of us want to see it extended. I am a strong supporter of extending it. There are many, many features of this legislation which I support. 
But having said that, Mr. President, we have to look at the remaining items that need attention and, in particular, one which is completely unacceptable and enough to warrant and justify the attention of the Members of the Senate about whether we are prepared to move ahead and consider this legislation, with that particular provision in in, that is now before the U.S. Senate. It is a provision that was not a part of either the initial proposal that was advanced last year by Senator Kassebaum or advanced this year by Senator Jeffords. It concerns the whole question of the preemption of the States with regard to cosmetics and over-the-counter medicines, but primarily on the issue of cosmetics. 
There are other important protection items dealing with unsafe or ineffective medical devices, including provisions that could undercut FDA's ability to regulate cigarettes, and there is a back-door assault on one of the most important environmental protections. We will have a chance to get into those later in the course of the morning. 
I want to point out what this legislation is going to do with regard to cosmetics, to all of the Members as we are coming over here to consider a cloture vote. We have to recognize and we will have a chance later on in the morning to point out the limitation of the Food and Drug Administration in regulating cosmetics. It has virtually no regulatory authority in this area. 
The American people should take no satisfaction in extent of the protections regarding the cosmetics they use every single day because the Food and Drug Administration does not have the jurisdiction to determine what is in those cosmetics, whether they are safe and whether they are effective. Absolutely none. There are only two members of the FDA who are out there supervising this issue--only two members of the FDA--in terms of looking out after the packaging and the labeling provisions--two members. 
The enforcement, in terms of protection of the public health on the issues of cosmetics, are left to the States. That is where the real regulatory authority is today. And now, because of the greed--and it is greed--of the cosmetic industry and because of the success of a referendum in California, they want to preempt any kind of protections for the health and the safety enacted by the States with Federal legislation that will effectively eliminate for all time the possibility of the States providing protection on health and safety. That was put into this legislation as an amendment. That amendment has been objected to, not just by the Senator from Massachusetts, but by all of the Governors of the 50 States. 
I will submit the correspondence from the National Governors' Association and from a principal Republican Attorney General Dan Lundgren of the State of California, a State that has done more in terms of protecting the American public as a result of the legislation passed in California than anyone else. 
The last GAO study points out that in the cosmetics used primarily by women in this country every day, 125 ingredients are suspected of causing cancer, 20 ingredients are suspected of damaging the nervous system, 20 ingredients are suspected of causing birth defects. 
And the list goes on and on and on. 
And to put that into this legislation without a single day of hearings--without a single day of hearings; the last hearings in the Senate of the United States were in 1978--will amount to a wholesale threat to the health of the American consumer. Primarily the women of this country do not deserve the kind of vote for cloture in moving ahead and effectively denying us the opportunity for a full debate and discussion of the issues that this provision deserves. That is why I hope that the vote on cloture is not successful.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is not just one Senator. Let me read from `The National Governors' Association, The National Conference of State Legislatures.' 
When the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee considered the Food and Drug Administration Reform legislation . . . the committee adopted an amendment proposed by Senator Gregg that preempts state regulations, disclosure requirements, labeling, and warning requirements as they apply to nonprescription drugs and cosmetics. The National Conference of State Legislatures and the National Governors' Association, vigorously oppose this provision and hope that it will not be part of the bill when it is reported by the Senate. 
These are the Governors, the State legislatures. The Secretary of Health indicated that `We and the administration all agree PDUFA is in the best interest. However, as maintained in its present form, with the outstanding issues not addressed, we will be forced to recommend to veto the legislation.' 
We are talking about health and safety. And we will have a chance to develop that in the postvote of this. But this bill contains too many important provisions with PDUFA and the medical devices and the drug provisions to go forward. And I believe that it should go forward, but not with this provision.

Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. The legislation we are debating today includes many positive elements. It reauthorizes the important prescription drug user fee program, one of the most effective regulatory reforms ever enacted. It includes a number of other provisions that will significantly improve and streamline the regulation of prescription drugs, biologic products, and medical devices. And I am pleased that through a long process of negotiation, both prior to and subsequent to the markup of the legislation, many provisions that seriously threaten public health and safety were dropped or compromised. But a bill that includes the damaging provisions that remain in this bill, should not become law. 
I have received a letter this morning from the Administration announcing their opposition to these provisions and their judgment that the bill should be vetoed if they are not eliminated. It would be the height of folly for the Senate to doom this important legislation to failure by taking it up before the provisions that merit a veto are removed or changed. 
The provisions that make this bill unworthy of passage by the Senate include: The preemption of State regulation of cosmetics and over-the-counter medicines; the elimination of two important protections against unsafe or ineffective medical devices, including a provision that could undercut FDA's ability to regulate cigarettes, and a backdoor assault on one of the most important environmental protections. The most egregious and unjustified provision in this bill would effectively preempt the State regulation of over-the-counter drugs and cosmetics. These provisions were not included in the chairman's original mark. They were not the subject of significant hearings. They have no place in a bill whose primary purpose is to reauthorize the Prescription Drug User Act. 
If this bill were serious about dealing with issues of over-the-counter drug and cosmetic regulation, it would undertake a serious reform of the whole regulatory structure to assure that consumers are adequately protected and not include a single provision designed to protect the profits of wealthy companies at the expense of the health of consumers. Preemption of cosmetic regulation is fundamentally outrageous and shows a callous disregard for the health of American women, especially those who are pregnant. It shows a callous disregard for the likelihood of birth defects in newborn babies. Cosmetics are used far more broadly than most prescription drugs, medical devices, and biologic products. 
Whether the issue is hair spray, or shampoo, or lipstick, or baby powder, or suntan lotion, or soap, or toothpaste, Americans assume that the products they use are safe. But this confidence is too often unjustified because Federal oversight of this $20 billion industry today is extremely limited. The basic law regulating cosmetics has not been updated since 1938. The FDA has less than 30 employees overseeing this huge industry. Only two deal with packaging and labeling. 
The legislation, Mr. President, the food and drug and related law, has 126 pages dealing with drugs and devices. It has 55 pages for foods. It has 1 1/2 pages of Federal law dealing with cosmetics. It basically does not deal with regulating the cosmetics of this Nation. 
The FDA has no authority to require manufacturers of cosmetics to register their plans or products. The FDA has no authority to require manufacturers to register their plans or products. It cannot require manufacturers to file data on the ingredients of their products. So there is no information with regard to the ingredients of their products. That is completely different, obviously, from the complex and vigorous review schedules which are places for pharmaceuticals and for medical devices. The FDA cannot require the manufacturers of cosmetics to file data on the ingredients in their products. It cannot compel manufacturers to file reports on cosmetics-related injuries. It cannot require their products be tested for safety, nor can it require that the results of safety testing be made available to the agency. It has no power, as it does with prescription drugs and medical devices, to require that the tests be done or that they gather information as a result of tests. It has no oversight authority in terms of making sure there are safe manufactured products. None of that currently exists with regard to cosmetics. The FDA does not have the right of access to manufacturers' records, and it cannot require recall of a product. The FDA is virtually outside the loop with regard to giving assurances to the American people about the health and safety of their products. This is unlike prescription drugs, it is unlike over-the-counter drugs, it is unlike medical devices. The FDA is outside the loop. 
A study by the respected, nonpartisan General Accounting Office reported that more than 125 ingredients available for use in cosmetics are suspected of causing cancer. Twenty cosmetic ingredients may cause adverse effects on the nervous system, including headaches, drowsiness, and convulsions. Twenty cosmetic ingredients are suspected of causing birth defects. The GAO concluded that cosmetics are being marketed in the United States that may pose a serious hazard to the public. That is the GAO. They concluded that cosmetics are being marketed in the United States that may pose a serious hazard to the public. 
The legislation that is before us is saying that the States should not be able to do anything about it. This is the primary issue in terms of the health the American people--may we have order, Mr. President?

Mr. KENNEDY. The cosmetic industry wants the public to believe that no effective regulation is necessary at either the State or Federal level. They are the masters of the slick ad and expensive public relations campaign. But all the glamorous pictures of the world cannot obscure the basic facts. This is an industry that is underregulated and, too often, hazardous. 
A mother of a beautiful 6-year-old girl in Oakland, CA, found this out when she used a hair product on her child that resulted in second-degree burns on her ears and neck. A 59-year-old California woman almost died from an allergic reaction to hair dye. A 47-year-old woman had her cornea destroyed by a mascara wand. In another tragic case, a woman's hair caught fire as a result of an inflammable hair treatment gel. She lost her hair and was severely scarred. Beauty parlor employees are particularly vulnerable to asthma and other diseases that result from exposure to chemicals in the products that they use. 
In fact, for every 1 million cosmetic products purchased, there are more than 200 visits to the doctor to treat cosmetic-caused illnesses. In 1987, a study for the Consumer Product Safety Commission found that, in 1 year alone, cosmetic products resulted in 47,000 emergency room visits. These severe reactions are only the tip of the iceberg. As the GAO study points out, available estimates of cosmetic-related injuries do not accurately reflect the extent to which consumers are exposed to toxic cosmetic products and ingredients. Because symptoms of chronic toxic effects may not occur until months or years after exposure. The injury estimates generally account for only the acute toxic effects--the effects that are seen right away. It is a fact that many of the ingredients, according to the GAO, included in many products are toxic in nature, maybe carcinogens, that take time to work their way through the body system and only later reflect themselves in incidence of cancer, or assaults on the nervous system, or birth defects long after they are used. 
In the face of limited Federal authority to protect the public against these hazards, and the even more limited resources devoted to preventing them, you would think that the Congress would want to encourage the States to fill the regulatory vacuum. Since the Federal Government is not doing it, you would think we would want the States to make sure that they are protecting their consumers. 
That is logical. We are talking about a health and safety issue. We are not talking about the economic regulations. We are talking about health and safety issues. If we are not going to have a responsibility in doing it, you would think we would want the States to move ahead and at least ensure the protections. But not in this legislation. Effectively we are preempting the States--telling the States they can't do it. We are not doing it, and we are not going to permit the States to do it either, ever. 
That is the effect of the provisions that have been included and added on to the bill in Committee--not in the initial proposal offered by Senator Kassebaum, not in the initial proposal offered by Senator Jeffords. It was one of the last of the amendments that were considered. There have been no hearings on this issue since 1978, 1988 in the House of Representatives. Still we have moved ahead, basically at the whim of the cosmetic industry, a $20 billion industry. This bill entirely bars the States from regulating packaging and labeling and places severe limits on the States' ability to establish other forms of regulation. 
Mr. President, just listen to this language on the scope of the preemption provision on the packaging or labeling of a cosmetic: `* * * shall be deemed to include any requirement relating to public information, or any other form of public communication relating to the safety or effectiveness of a drug or cosmetic.' 
There it is, clear as can be; no more information for the people of California, no more information for the people in the Midwest or the East. This is what it says. `This preemption shall be deemed to include any requirement relating to public information, or any other form of public communication relating to the safety or effectiveness of a drug or cosmetic.' 
We don't do it at the Federal level, and we are denying the States the opportunity. What is the cosmetic industry so afraid of that they are precluding any public information or any other form of public communication relating to safety? What are they so frightened about? Is the almighty dollar worth that much when you are talking about carcinogens and toxic substances? 
There it is, Mr. President, as clear as can be. The language, no warning labels, no information that a product contains carcinogens or can cause severe allergic reactions; no `keep out of the reach of children' labels; no notification that a product has been recalled because it is dangerous or adulterated; no expiration dates. Mexico requires expiration dates. The European Union has expiration dates. Sri Lanka has expiration dates. But no way--particularly in products such as mascara that can deteriorate and adulterate and cause serious threats to people's eyes--no expiration dates. The materials have been held in terms of the danger of mascara over a period of time without endanger rates or warnings to the public that use mascara; no preemption, right here in this legislation. 
We are talking about health and safety. That is why we voted on this measure--health and safety issues. 
We have already spent more time on this issue now this morning than we spent in the committee in its discussion. No `keep out of the reach of children' labels; no notification that a product has been recalled because it is dangerous or adulterated; no notification. The cosmetic industry seems to believe that for purchases of their products ignorance is bliss. In fact, what you don't know today can severely injury you, or even kill you. 
Some States are already taking an active role in protecting consumers. Many more may do so in the future. But not if this bill becomes law. Minnesota has passed a hazardous product labeling bill requiring a warning on all products that are ignitable, corrosive, reactive, or toxic. You would think that all consumers should be entitled to that kind of information about products which they put on their faces or spray on their hair or wash their bodies with. But the cosmetic industry disagrees. 
California requires notification if a product contains carcinogens or reproductive toxins that cause birth defects. You would think every consumer should be entitled to that information. Not after you pass this provision. When you take the time later in this debate to go through each of these and show the medical information, the study, the research which supports that finding, there are products that contain carcinogens and reproductive toxins. The studies have been done by some of the great research institutions in this country, but the data from their studies, warnings to expectant mothers, or to others who are going to use that product cannot be communicated to the American public by the States. 
That authority will be gone. You can do all the research you want, find everything you want, but that authority will be gone. It is out. You would think that the consumer should be entitled to that information. 
We had support for nutritional labeling around here for consumers to have information. It is one of our most important achievements, that people have some idea of the nutritional content of their diets, their fiber, and the various nutritional elements included in those. People want to know. That is enormously important in terms of the general health and dietary needs of the American people. But here we are talking about carcinogens. We are talking about toxic substances. We have the information that is being made available to the public on the one hand. But when it comes back to items that are going to endanger the health and safety, we are saying, no way--no at the Federal level and no at the State level. 
Texas is investigating hormone creams that may affect the reproductive health of young women. You would think the States should be encouraged to take this kind of action. But this law prohibits it. 
New York requires expiration dates on cosmetics because products can break down and be subject to bacterial contamination after a certain time period. 
Most of you would think that this is basic information that every consumer should have. But not the cosmetics industry. If you want to try to say, OK; we had a preemption of various States' activities with regard to food and nutrition, yes. We did. We worked that process out. It was worked out with the various interests of the American consumer, and it is protected. If you want to go back and see where you want to have a national program in terms of preemption in terms of these dangers, you are going to talk about a completely different regulation. But that isn't recommended. That isn't suggested. That isn't talked about. That isn't being considered here. No. All it is saying is you are not doing it here at the Federal level. Legislation under the Food and Drug Act doesn't permit you to do it, right in that page and a half. It shows that they don't have the authority to do it. And we are not going to permit you to do it at the State level. 
Mr. President, this provision of the bill is an example of what I consider to be the worst kind of sweetheart deal for special interests at the expense of the public interest. It is intolerable that it should be included in a bill that purports to be the Food and Drug Administration Modernization and Accountability Act. We are supposed to be out here modernizing the FDA, on the one hand, balancing the very important public health interests and also trying to consider the legitimate interest of the patient and the consumers using medical devices and new pharmacy products. That is a balance. It is a difficult and a complex one. You want to bring on line the new kinds of innovative products. But you don't want to do it if it poses a threat to public safety. That is a balance. And we have differences about the time, the process, and the procedure. Those are legitimate public health debates and discussions. 
But not with regard to cosmetics. 
So we have worked through the whole area with regard to pharmaceuticals and with regard to devices. There are two items which I think are of major importance that still need to be addressed. We have made very significant and important progress on the matters that are enormously important to the health and the safety of the American public. 
And because that train is going down the track, here comes an old industry, the cosmetic industry, to hook this sweetheart deal right on it; hook right on it. 
I hope we are not going to hear from other Members that we now need to have hearings now on various other issues after what we have seen on the cosmetics. I hope we are not going to have those issues. I heard the other day that we need more study in terms of the testing of children. We need more hearings on all of this. We have had extensive hearings over in the House and some hearings over here. But we need many more days of hearings before we jump into this at this direction--when you are talking about health and safety. And that has effectively never been done. 
Another unacceptable part of this bill, Mr. President, contains the two provisions dealing with the safety of medical devices, which I will come to in just a few moments. 
I see a friend and colleague, the Senator from Rhode Island, here on the floor. I would be glad to yield to him whatever time he might take.

Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator very much for identifying not only this issue on cosmetics, but also the issue of the medical devices proposal. That is an extremely important measure. Obviously, if there is advertisement and an intention for a certain kind of purpose and technologically it is suitable for that purpose, it meets the health and safety standards to be used for other kinds of purposes, that raises some very, very important questions. 
The particular example that the Senator gave with regard to the biopsy needle is a current one. We understand it might be a suitable device in getting a biopsy in terms of cancer, but there are those actually using it to extract certain kinds of tumors. Whether it does that or not--and people assume it is going to be effective in doing that because it is used for other purposes --this is something that the device has not been tested for or intended. I think they there are very important health issues that are related and can be addressed. There are ways of trying to address those particular issues. We have tried to do this, and we still have important health and safety issues which I think are unresolved.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the letter says: 
The second issue relates to what FDA may consider in making substantial equivalence determinations for newly marketed devices. For example, the bill requires the agency to review the intended use of a new device based on the manufacturer's proposed labeling, even if the device's technology clearly indicates the device will be used for a use not included in the labeling. 
So I think the point the Senator makes where they get approval for a particular purpose, it might be easier to get it for one purpose but with the clear intention of marketing for another purpose in which there has not been testing, and that can produce a hazard to the individual. 
We have seen, for example, in some of the laser technologies that they have been approved for certain kinds of cutting procedures, and then they have been in certain instances adopted, for example, for prostate cancer, where they have not been tested and have not been effectively cleared and pose some very important health hazards. 
So this is something that is very important, as we are moving through innovation, because we want to make sure we get those innovations. We want to make sure that the products are tested and have full information and disclosure. 
I thought we worked out language to try and deal with that. It is an important health issue, and I appreciate the Senator's focus and attention on it. It is a matter of sufficient importance in terms of public health that we would have this identified by the Secretary as being one of the two or three items that the Secretary has identified would pose sufficient health hazard as to indicate a recommendation for a veto.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for raising those issues, because that is a rather technical issue, it is a rather targeted question, but one that is of very significant importance. 
I certainly agree with the Senator that we don't believe that the overwhelming majority of the medical device manufacturers don't intend to do such things. But what we have to try and do is make sure that those who may want to--and that is basically what happens in any regulatory procedure--you want to try and catch those particular items which are dangerous; that this is one that, with the tremendous expansion, in terms of certainly medical device technology, that we should address. 
I appreciate the Senator saying that it can be addressed. We had language that we had considered, that I thought the device industry had been very supportive of and was acceptable. Then in the rush at the end, somehow individuals who had been involved in it felt they didn't want to have any further kind of adjustment or change in the language. 
I think it is significant--and I am sure the Senator would agree and the chairman would agree--that we have had, in the fashioning of this bill great support and cooperation from the industry, from the pharmaceutical and also the device industry. We have perhaps some differences that have been moving along on particular kinds of items, but I must say--and I think the Senator would agree; I know he is proud of the industry in his own State, as I am in my State--we have had enormous cooperation and help. So many of these items are technologically difficult, complicated, and involved. We are basically generalists as Members of the Senate. We have some information and try to develop some expertise in particular areas of responsibility, but this gets to an involvement in detail which is enormously complex. When we have responsible industry involvement trying to help us. I did find that in other parts of the legislation it was very helpful. What we hope to do as this whole process moves ahead is come back and visit this provision and see if we cannot address it.

Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. 
When we are talking about these technicalities, we have to remember that some of these items, particularly those medical devices that enter the body, have enormous health implications. I remember chairing, in 1974 or 1975, the Dalkon shield hearings where we found that 2,300 American women died from a perforated uterus from the Dalkon shield. That was before we had a Food and Drug Administration that really looked into medical devices. 
We have the Shiley heart valve that passed through the FDA, and then eventually the FDA was able to uncover some of the difficulties with that and took steps. I think, if my memory serves me correctly, they were going to use a perfected Shiley heart valve over in Europe, and they altered some opening where the blood went through by just about 10 degrees, and that resulted in a rather significant increase in the failure of that medical device which was actually marketed abroad. The FDA was very much involved in seeing the termination of that. 
So even very modest changes or alterations can have important kinds of health implications. We are not going to be able to solve all the problems and we are not interested in producing a bureaucracy that is going to halt innovative and creative ways of dealing with some of these issues. But it is important that we are talking about a Food and Drug Administration and public health. 
As I mentioned briefly at the outset, this is the one agency that is intimately involved with public health. It has broad jurisdiction on a wide variety of items, and it has important responsibilities for the public health. This is where the buck stops. Some feel it ought to just be the agency to fast track various kinds of devices or fast track various pharmaceuticals without considering the health and efficaciousness of those products. That is why I think it is useful to pause here for a little while to give some focus to exactly this legislation and what its implications are going to be in terms of public health. 
I thank the Senator.

Mr. KENNEDY. The fact is that the FDA does not have the authority today--just does not have it. It has the authority to deal with pharmaceuticals and with medical devices but not with the issues which involve health and safety. 
I will spend a moment or two just going through the Food and Drug Administration Act, the actual law. It is a page and a half. And there cannot be a fair reading of this, of these provisions, section 601 to 603. To believe that there is any adequate protection for American consumers in this page and a half is folly. I mentioned earlier the FDA has no authority to require manufacturers to register their plants or products. It cannot require manufacturers to file the data on the ingredients in their products. It cannot compel manufacturers to file reports on the cosmetic-related injuries. It cannot require that products be tested for safety or that the results of safety testing be made available to the agency. It does not have the right to have access to manufacturers' records. It cannot recall a product. 
Now, those are powers the FDA has with regard to pharmaceuticals and medical devices, but not with regard to cosmetics that may also be carcinogenic, and may also include toxins. We are not talking about an unimportant matter. We are talking about questions of health and safety. I find it difficult, with all respect, to say, `Well, look, in California, we've carved that out. All of our Members will probably understand that means. `We have carved out California.' California considered this and took action. But if Minnesota--and they have been interested in taking some action on some products--wants to take action down the road in the future to protect its consumers, it cannot do it. In my State of Massachusetts, that has very similar legislation to that of California pending now, and they hope to be able to pass it in the next legislative session--they are out. They are finished. 
We have taken care of one State, California. I am glad we did not wipe out California because I am interested in the protection of the citizens of California. They are going to get some protection, but not full protection, because you are going to preempt other health and safety statutes in California. This did not provide all the protections in California. Nonetheless, I am glad that the consumers in California are going to get some protection. But I cannot understand why we are denying other States from making a judgment that they want some protection. That is what this legislation does. 
An additional point others will make is, `Well, we're just dealing with packaging and labeling.' But that is where the States act, with packaging and labeling. We do not see the withdrawal of products. They are able to do that and have been effective at it, in California. And I will get into how effective they have been, because they have been very effective in protecting consumers, not only in California, but the rest of the country, because when California, as a result of an extensive kind of medical research, has discovered that various products may contain carcinogens or dangerous and toxic substances, and required those products to be labeled, what happened? The manufacturer changed the product. And I will get into the examples. 
This is the power that regulations on labeling and packaging can have. This is where they have been effective. These are the key elements, the possibility of developing warning labels. They have not had to develop the warning labels in California because the companies and the manufacturers have changed the products. One of the outstanding examples is Preparation H. Where there were products that were dangerous to consumers, the California regulations were effective in improving product safety. The manufacturer reformulated the product itself and says now it is better than it even was before. That was as a result of research that was done to uncover potentially dangerous substances that had been included in the product. 
So, Mr. President, we have an agency that cannot practically deal with and has been restricted from packaging and labeling. We have seen a carveout, a carveout in the FDA authority in section 601 that talks about various products. It says they will not be able to deal with either poisonous or adulterated cosmetics, and cannot apply to coal-tar hair. Coal-tar hair dye. There is the cosmetic industry able to write right into the law `coal-tar hair dye,' even though the research has shown what that has done in terms of making hair dyes more dangerous than they need to be. The cosmetics industry has been effective enough to get written into this legislatively that, even though it is dangerous, there cannot be any kind of oversight of it. That is the power. That is real legislative power. 
Mr. President, just on this question of the FDA and its ability to deal with this, let us go back to what the GAO said should be done if we were to have an FDA that would be able to provide adequate protection for the public health. This is a public health issue and a safety issue. That is what we are dealing with with regard to cosmetics. 
The other items that we mentioned earlier deal with health and safety and are of importance. But on cosmetics, we are effectively talking about health and safety issues. When the GAO last looked at the FDA, and were charged with making recommendations, these are the recommendations that they made. They said:  
We recommend that the Congress amend the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to give FDA adequate authority for regulating cosmetic products. Specifically, we recommend that the Congress authorize FDA to require: 
Registration of all cosmetic manufacturers. 
Registration of cosmetic products and filing of ingredient statements [so that they know what ingredients are in the various products]. 
Manufacturers to submit to FDA data to support the safety of their products and the ingredients in them [to demonstrate the safety of their products prior to putting them on the market. Before marketing, to be able to give the assurance of safety and also to be able to get the ingredients of these products]. 
Premarket approval by FDA of certain classes of cosmetics or ingredients when the agency deems such approval necessary to protect the public health. 
Why? Because they take notice that some of these products contain possible carcinogens and some of them have toxic products. They are saying we ought to be able to demonstrate the safety of those products rather than put them out in the marketplace and endanger the public. 
The GAO report further recommends that: 
Manufacturers to submit to FDA consumer complaints about adverse reactions to cosmetics. 
Manufacturers to perform specific testing FDA deems necessary to support the safety of a cosmetic or an ingredient. 
So if the FDA were to make a judgment that they believe that items may cause birth defects, may cause an assault on the nervous system, may somehow threaten seriously the health and the well-being of the consumer, that they would be able to ensure there is going to be adequate testing. Those are very minimal standards. These recommendations are from the last review for the power and the authority for the FDA. 
Now, do you think we have any of those today? No, we do not have any of those. And all we have to protect the consumer is what is happening at the State level. That is all we have. With this legislation, we are effectively preempting the States from providing those protections to the consumers in their States. 
I find it extraordinary how quickly we are to be willing to accept that particular provision without hearings. We understand the power of the cosmetic industry. We understand why this has come up. This has come up, Mr. President, because of the action that has been taken by California. Because California has acted in various cases in order to ensure that the cosmetics that are being used by Californians are safe and effective. They do not want to have to keep dealing with this. Nonetheless, manufacturers have changed their products. They have made them, in so many different instances, safer. That is the way it should be. 
If we are not going to do it at the Federal level, why do we take away the power of the various States? It is effectively like preempting the States from having State police. All the States have various State police in order to look after safety and security in their States. We are saying, we are not going to provide any kind of help and assistance, but, in addition, we are taking away your safety, a means of protecting your people as well. And that, I believe, is wrong. 
Mr. President, I want to just mention some of the various items since we have talked in generalities here about some of them. Some of these items that we have addressed here have posed a threat to the health and safety. 
First of all, we have hair dye, the coal tar in the hair dye. That is a potential carcinogen. It is a danger in terms of the American public and the consumer. One State, California, has a State law. Ohio has tried to deal with this, but they have been basically unable to do so. The industry has been so powerful it has been able to get written into the law, into the bill itself, that we cannot tamper with something we know is directly a public health hazard. In public health we know that, and still it is written into the law. 
We have the old Grecian Formula. It does not have to go through the FDA. It had lead in it--lead. People thought, well, we can use it because it is just a hairspray. We know what happens when lead is ingested. We know it causes mental retardation, for example, in children. 
One of the principal problems in inner cities is old paint chips that have the lead content. We know the incidence of mental retardation, and if you go into any urban area in this country and go to the great county hospitals, they have a lead paint poisoning program. You see the incidents of mental retardation that are a direct cause of lead in the paint. The children are either eating the chips or they are playing outdoors and the chips are ingested. They get on the cats and dogs, and children pet them and then scratch themselves or put their hands in their mouths. 
It just goes on. We understand that. That has been well understood and documented for 30 years now. But we now know there was lead in Grecian Formula. This came out as a result of the various analyses in California. There was a certain amount of concern about it, but then there was action by the company, and they said, look, maybe there is lead in it, but it is on your hair, and you are not ingesting it, so, therefore, it is not a problem. Then other studies showed that people were washing their hair and were also embracing their children and touching their children and working with their animals or their pets, and this was picking up the flakes and, if the dye was being used over a considerable period of time, the lead posed a significant and important threat to children. 
So what happened? Grecian Formula changed their ingredients as a result of this to make a safer product. They did not miss a beat in terms of being able to market it and being able to be successful. But it was changed, and that is because of local activity--not the FDA, but because of local activity. 
Mr. President, I will give further illustration, but I will just at this point remind Senators, as we are going through some of these examples, there may be those who say, `Well, OK, you've got a half dozen out there, but is that really enough to try to resist this provision to preempt State activities?' Well, the last serious study that was done by a congressional committee was actually done by our colleague, Congressman Wyden, who held landmark hearings in 1988. 
The industry gave his subcommittee a list of 2,983 chemicals used in cosmetics. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health at NIH analyzed the 2,983 chemicals and found 884 cosmetic ingredients had been reported to the Government as toxic substances. Let me just repeat that: The industry, the cosmetic industry, provided to the Congress a list of 2,983 chemicals that are being used in cosmetics. 
The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, what we call NIOSH, which is the center for expertise in being able to analyze various toxic substances, and NIH analyzed these chemicals and found that 884 cosmetic ingredients have been reported to the Government as toxic substances. 
We have known for 10 years that a third of cosmetic chemicals are toxic, but we have done nothing to strengthen the consumer protections. Instead, we would rather weaken the consumer protections. Instead of trying to make some progress to protect the consumer we are taking steps to put them at greater risk. Does that make any sense? 
We had debate and discussion about the Delaney amendment with regard to carcinogens and processed food and we debated those issues and said is it not time to alter, change, and modify that? We passed very good legislation dealing with pesticides, insecticides, and fungicides just 2 or 3 years ago because we were looking at the fact that the best estimate is that there are probably 2,600 to 3,000 Americans that were dying because of pesticides and insecticides that were being put on products and were being ingested. We have run into problems. We had extensive hearings about the dangers of insecticides on children, because children eat more bananas and certain types of food and products have more insecticides, and therefore it has more of an impact in terms of their bodily functions. 
We spent hours and hours and days and days on hearings because we wanted to provide protection against carcinogens in our food supply. Here we have now, according to NIOSH, and according to the NIH, 884 cosmetic ingredients that have toxic substances. Rather than trying to do something about those in terms of examining those in relationship to what is being done in the House and in terms of the well-being of the consumer, we have not only had no enforcement or regulatory protection at the Federal level but we are eliminating what actions could be taken at the State level. 
It makes no sense, Mr. President, makes no sense at all. That is what the effect of the preemption does. I read the language on the preemption and that is effectively what that language does. 
Now, Mr. President, we have a situation, for example, that has come up in fairly recent time, a hair spray that might be inflammable, and we find out that the State of Minnesota was looking at trying to make some effort to try and identify the dangers that result from this. 
Mr. President, there is a Senator here that would like to address the Senate and I am happy to accommodate him.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just for the benefit of the membership, to describe where we are, the amendment that I have offered would include the Nickles amendment, but it would also add to the Nickles amendment: `Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the obligations of the United States under the consent decree' entered into in United States v. Teamsters, decided in 1989.' 
So, effectively, the Nickles amendment would be perfected with the Kennedy amendment. All we are saying with the Kennedy amendment would be that nothing in the Nickles amendment would eliminate the obligations of the United States that was a part of a consent decree that was signed in 1989 because we are not operating in a vacuum here today with regard to the Teamsters elections. We are basically operating on the basis of a consent decree that was signed by the previous administration, signed by the Bush administration, and supported by the Bush administration. 
All that we are saying is that whatever decision that is going to be made, or whatever language would be included in the Nickles amendment, it will not be contrary to what was agreed to by the United States, agreed to by the U.S. Government and the previous administration and adhered to by the courts. We don't know what the future is going to bring with regard to any potential future election or what the allocation of responsibility would be in terms of who would be responsible to pay for various aspects of the election. We don't prejudge that. All we are saying is that nothing in the Nickles amendment will, in any way, undermine the responsibilities of the United States, which I believe is a solemn agreement and a solemn commitment, and that has been accepted in the courts of law by the United States. 
Now, Mr. President, this amendment, I believe, is basically a transparent attempt to punish the Teamsters Union for winning the UPS strike, and it doesn't deserve really to pass. This issue is no light matter. The amendment would require the Federal Government to abdicate its responsibility under the court-approved consent ordered and signed by the Justice Department under the Bush administration. If the Federal Government abdicates this responsibility, it could be subject to contempt proceedings in the Federal court. 
The amendment would deny Federal funds to oversee the forthcoming Teamsters election, which had been ordered after the 1996 election was nullified by the Government-appointed election officer. That election was paid for by Federal dollars. The Federal Government agreed to fund that election under a 1989 consent order in the Federal court of New York City that resolved a racketeering suit brought by the Government. The suit was a culmination of over 30 years of effort to eliminate organized crime from the leadership of the Teamsters Union. Congress has been heavily involved in that process. From the McClellan committee hearings in 1957 to the Senate permanent subcommittee investigation hearings in 1994, we have worked to reduce the influence of organized crime in the union and in the industry where its members work. 
In 1988, the Justice Department, under President Bush, sued the Teamsters under the Federal racketeering laws. The charge was that the union was dominated by organized crime. That was settled in 1989. The court-approved consent order was designed to rid the union of officers with ties to organized crime and to create a new, open and democratic structure in the union. The consent order provided that the 1991 election for Teamster offices would be supervised by a court-appointed election officer. The consent order also required the 1996 election to be supervised by the election officer. 
Let me quote the union-defendant's consent to the election officer, at Government expense, to supervise the 1996 elections on page 16 of the consent order: 
In accord with that decree, the election officer supervised the '96 election, at Government expense. Late last month, the officer ruled that the '96 election must be rerun because of irregularities committed by consultants to one of the candidates. The election officer specifically refused to find that any union officer or member committed any misconduct and noted that Teamster President Ron Carey cooperated with the election officer in a manner inconsistent with guilt. Under the consent order, the Federal court must formally order any rerun election that is held. The court's decision will be issued later this month. 
It is the consent order that obligated the Government to pay for the 1996 election. Under the consent order, any rerun of that election ordered by the election officer should be Government-funded. Yet, this amendment asks the Government to walk away from that clear obligation. If passed, the amendment would order the Government to subject itself to a contempt proceeding. These financial obligations were entered into by a Republican-controlled Justice Department and a Republican administration. They were part of a comprehensive and successful effort to root out organized crime from the Teamsters Union and restore democratic process to that union. 
It is an outrage to ask Congress to abdicate our responsibility to help in eliminating corruption in this union. The heart of this amendment is an attempt to punish the Teamsters for their extraordinary success in the recent UPS strike, in which the Teamsters won 10,000 more permanent jobs for their members, improved benefits for all 185,000 UPS employees, and sensitized the entire Nation to the gross abuses in many workplaces that force hard-working men and women into part-time jobs with lower wages and lower benefits than they deserve. 
Some of our Republican friends may believe the Teamsters should be punished for these gains. I believe that they deserve praise instead of punishment. I urge my colleagues to give our amendment the kind of support that it deserves.

Mr. KENNEDY. I would expect that what we would include in that is any court orders that would be related under the consent decree or that would be related to the consent. Is there something in particular--I would be glad to attempt to define that, if the Senator has some particular concerns in some particular way. But it seems to me to be fairly clear. Any of the orders that would be a part of that consent decree. Now that we are retained and we are within the consent decree, there would be any of the court orders with regard to the various elections. 
And I would expect that as we did before, we would want to comply with the consent decree in those areas.

Mr. KENNEDY. If there was any court order affecting the 1996 elections of Teamsters officers--I would like to try a short quorum call to make sure that would be language, which I think appears to be to the Senator's point, and I think it would meet the objectives. But maybe we could suggest a short quorum call to make sure that we have the language that conforms to both of our understanding. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are mindful now that we are only a few short days from the time that the UPS strike was resolved and settled, and settled in a way which benefited many thousands of workers. There are 186,000 workers that were involved, and there was important progress made in the areas of pensions and part-time work. There was great progress made in a number of different areas which we may or may not have an opportunity to discuss here this evening. 
But, quite frankly, Mr. President, I doubt whether this amendment would be before us if we had not seen the success of the Teamsters as a result of a collective-bargaining process. We saw 15 days where the Nation was focused on the issue about whether the workers of UPS were going to participate in the extraordinary kinds of successes that UPS was involved in. Americans around the country responded to the fact that many of those that had been on part-time were not having part-time mortgages, part-time payments in terms of food bills, part-time payments in terms of children's clothing bills. Finally, the UPS and the Teamsters worked out an agreement. It was important for those working men and women. 
There are some here, some here in the Senate who just cannot stand the fact that workers were able to have their rights considered and to have their rights resolved in a positive and constructive way. And there are those who just want to somehow get back at these workers, somehow get back at them. I believe here we are seeing some attempt to try to do so by the mischievousness of this particular amendment. 
The amendment which I have proposed is an amendment to the Nickles amendment that does not require the American taxpayers to pay. The Senator from Oklahoma believes that the judge does not have the authority to require the payment for the election by the taxpayers. All the amendment that I have offered is saying is that if the consent agreement does not require it, it does not have to be expended; if it does require it, we are not going to take any action that is going to interfere with a judicial process and a consent agreement that was signed under the Bush administration, was initiated by a Republican, Mr. Giuliani, in New York, was ratified by the Attorney General, Mr. Thornburgh, who is on record in strong support of this agreement. 
This agreement is still applicable. As a matter of fact, the respondents are required, under the Southern District Court, to file their briefs on September 19--on September 19. This is a court order that is in effect at the present time. All we are saying in support of the amendment that I have offered is, let us not interfere with the court order that was established in 1989 that was agreed to by the participants. It is part of a judicial process and procedure. 
What we are basically asking, under the Nickles amendment, is that we are going to interfere with a legitimate judicial procedure. All my amendment says is, let the judicial procedure flow as it was designed and agreed to at an earlier period of time. That is the extent of my amendment. We are not requiring, in my amendment, that taxpayer money be used. We are not saying that it will not be used. We are saying, whatever the judge, under that consent agreement in 1989, understood that agreement to be, that we will not interfere with it. 
But that is not satisfactory to Senator Nickles. He wants to rig, evidently, or change the consent agreement. We believe that the consent agreement ought to be maintained for the reason that consent agreements are put into place and agreed to by the different parties. When the consent agreement goes in and the different parties agree, we do not see that they agree on one day and the next day we are going to have interference with that particular agreement. That is really what is at issue. 
Here is Rudolph Giuliani, in 1988, saying, `Today the U.S. Government is bringing a lawsuit to attack and reverse, once and for all, a major American scandal.' This is not an issue that is just brought up today. This has been the result and consent agreement from a long, long history which I reviewed earlier in the debate. 
Richard Thornburgh said, `This settlement, which union leaders agree to today, culminates 30 years of efforts'--30 years of efforts--`by the Department of Justice to remove the influence of organized crime within the Teamsters Union,' and then indicates support for it. Thirty years of effort and the consent agreement in 1989. 
We have seen a continued consent agreement, as these cases are going on to the Southern District Court today. The briefs are required by September 19. So this issue is very much alive, Mr. President. 
All we are saying in support of our amendment, which is basically an add-on to the Nickles amendment, all our amendment says is nothing in this section under the Nickles amendment shall be construed to apply to the expenditures required by the consent decree in the U.S. v. International Brotherhood. We do not say you are going to have to pay for them. We don't say you will have to pay part of them. We don't say that they are not going to or we are going to restrict the judge. That is effectively what we are basically attempting to do with this particular amendment. 
Mr. President, I think there are strong reasons for accepting this amendment. I will speak just for a few more moments on this particular issue. Mr. President, as I mentioned, in 1988, the Justice Department under President Bush sued the Teamsters Union under the racketeering laws, and the U.S. attorney who prosecuted the case was Rudolph Giuliani, another Republican, who now, of course, is the mayor of New York City. In 1989, Mayor Giuliani negotiated a resolution to the suit with the Teamsters that imposed sweeping reforms on the union. 
A critical part of the election reform was the supervision of all aspects of the union elections by a court-appointed election official. Thus, the consent decree establishes the position of election officer and gave the officer substantial authority to regulate the entirety of the electoral process. Under the consent order the expenses of the 1991 Teamster election were borne by the union itself, including the expenses of the election officer. 
But the 1996 election was different as to that election. The consent order stated the union defendants consent to the election officer at Government expense to supervise the 1996 election. The election officer and all parties to the suit complied with this provision of the consent decree. The Republican refusal to appropriate funds for fiscal year 1996 for the Labor and Justice Department forced the election officer to seek a court order requiring the Justice Department to fund the critical preelection activities. The Justice Department and union joined in the election officer's request for that order which ultimately was granted in October of 1995. Ultimately, however, the funding was obtained and the election was conducted. Protests were filed with the election officer to resolve them and an opinion issued late last month. In that opinion, the election officer found that misconduct by consultants to one candidate required that the election be rerun. The officer specifically declined to find wrongdoing by any officer or member of the union and noted that President Carey had conducted himself throughout the investigation in a manner inconsistent with guilt. 
So, there is a judicial finding and conclusion that there has been no conclusion to this current election and has not been certified and therefore the election officer maintains the jurisdiction. 
In accordance with this decision, the election officer did not certify the 1996 election. She did, however, apply to the Federal court for an order requiring that the election be rerun. That application is pending. The parties' briefs will not be filed until September 19 and the court will not rule until after that time. The court may order that the election be rerun or it may not. It may require the Government to fund the election officer's supervision of the election or it may require the union to do so or it may require each party to bear some part of the cost. Let me repeat that: The court may order the election be rerun or it may not. It may require the Government to fund the election officer's supervision of that election or it may require the union to do so. Or it may require each party to bear some part of the cost. We do not know that. We do not know that. That still has to be resolved. 
Under the Nickles amendment it would prejudge that. All we are trying to do is say we had the agreement in 1989. It is under active consideration before the Southern District Court of New York and we should do nothing that is going to affect that agreement which has been agreed to by all the principle parties and negotiated under the previous administration. 
The point is we do not know how the court will rule. But this amendment would tell the court that regardless of its ruling the Government will not be permitted to fund the election, even if the consent order requires the Government to pay, this amendment will refuse to permit that. Thus the amendment would interfere with an ongoing judicial process. 
That is, basically, the issue. Are we going to permit legislative interference in an ongoing judicial process? It is as simple as that. Moreover, the amendment would renege on an agreement that a Republican-controlled Justice Department entered into 8 years ago by repudiating part of that agreement. The amendment would order the Government to subject itself to a contempt proceeding, and that is an outrage and an untenable result. 
Why do those on the other side of the aisle seek to achieve this result? It can only be because they want to punish the Teamsters Union for their tremendous success in the recent UPS strike. That is what is at the bottom of this, make no mistake about it. Does anybody think if they had not been successful in that strike we would be considering this here? It is a basic, fundamental assault on the fact that they were able to negotiate some protections for part-time workers and for pension rights for workers. There are those in this body and in this country that cannot stand that. They want to give those workers a comeuppance. That is really what is at issue here. That is what is being attempted, to try to interfere with this judicial process. 
That strike resulted in significant improvements for 185,000 workers at UPS. It sensitized the entire Nation to the gross abuses in many work forces that forced hard-working men and women into part-time jobs with lower wages and lower benefits than they deserve. 
Let me highlight a few of the achievements of the Teamsters in the UPS strike: 10,000 new full-time jobs by combining existing low-wage part-time positions. That is in addition to the full-time opportunities that are normally created through growth in the company, retirements or people leaving for other reasons. Pension increases that are the same or better as the increases the company had already said it would make, but under the Teamster pension plan, not a company-controlled pension plan. Under the Teamster's central pension fund, a UPS worker could retire at 30 years with a pension of $3,000 per month, 50 percent more than the current amount. Limits on subcontracting--to replace some contractors with UPS workers, so that as UPS grows, full-time UPS jobs grow as well. Wage increases of $3.10 an hour for full-time plus an extra dollar an hour for part-time workers. That may not sound like a lot to the Members of this body but that is important for working families. Safety protections for workers who handle heavy packages may not sound important to a lot of people around this body but that is important for a lot of workers who are handling those heavy packages. The list goes on, and the list goes on. 
Our Republican colleagues seem to think that the Teamsters deserve to be punished for these gains and I think the union deserves praise. 
Mr. President, I believe, for the reasons I have outlined here, this is a consent decree, that the consent decree is still active, that there is pending action that is before the Southern District Court, and the amendment which I introduced would effectively accept the Nickles amendment but it would indicate there would be no interference with any decision that is going to be made by the judge in that decree that will be forthcoming, and the outcome of which we do not know. 
Let me mention, Mr. President, some of the observations of the Judge, David Edelstein, approving the consent decree.  
Just over two months ago I signed a consent decree between * * * Teamsters and the government. The decree contains an acknowledgment by the Teamsters leadership that there are severe shortcomings in the way it has conducted its affairs in the past, and it embodies the standards by which the leadership of the * * * Union should conduct its affairs in the future.* * * 
These goals alone, however, are merely statements of good intentions--and we all know where those can lead. Without a dedicated effort to put these ideals into practice, the good intentions will become empty promises and unfulfilled hopes. * * * The public has a significant stake in the outcome of the decree. The IBT exercises vast power and cuts across every segment of society--political, social, and economic. It affects every aspect of our lives. Such power must be insulated against corruption and criminal elements and must be reserved for legitimate use to achieve legitimate ends. 
* * * The conditions that have necessitated and justified such unprecedented measures are extreme. The remedy therefore is necessarily extreme. The court expects that all parties involved--the union, the government, and the three individuals I am about to appoint--live up to the spirit and letter of the laws and Constitution of the United States as well as the consent decree.

Mr. KENNEDY. So, here we have the Republican administration that is committed to this consent decree. We have the consent decree still active in the southern district court requiring the submission of various briefs, a judge that is going to make a judgment based upon those briefs, and the facts as have been found on the recent election. We do not know what the terms of the pronouncement is going to be in terms of the judge, and all we are saying in the Kennedy amendment is that we are not going to interfere with the judgments of that judge in fulfilling the consent decree requirements that were agreed to by all parties, that go back over a long period of time, some 30 years of involvement, and we are not going to prejudge that, tonight, to interfere with a judicial proceeding. 
That is, basically, what the effect of the Kennedy amendment would be as a perfecting amendment to the Nickles proposal. 
Mr. President, I find it difficult to see how a President of the United States, if this were to go through and to pass and to be actually accepted in the committee in the conference report, how a President of the United States could sign this appropriation that would have a legislative intrusion in terms of a consent decree that had been agreed to and honored by all of the parties. 
It seems to me that this would be a clear interference by the legislative body into the judicial consent decree and would certainly be subject to a Presidential veto. It is of that importance and of that consequence. I hope my amendment will be agreed to. Just to repeat it, all we want to say is that nothing in this section--which would be the Nickles amendment--should be construed to apply to expenditures required by the consent decree. We are not saying what they may be, what they might not be, whether they would be or would not be. But all we are saying is that we would not interfere with the consent decree. It is as plain and as clear as can be, Mr. President. I hope the amendment will be accepted.

Mr. KENNEDY. Just two brief comments. One with regard to the Congressional Research Service. It is not true that section O of the consent decree permits the U.S. Government to avoid its legal obligations under the decree, including its legal obligation to pay for supervision of the upcoming election. 
Section O is a general savings clause retaining the right of the Government to seek remedies against the defendants for misconduct. It was never intended, nor can it be reasonably read, to override the remainder of the consent decree. 
Under the overbroad reading of section O, the consent decree is meaningless--the parties would have agreed to nothing, because section O would always undermine the original understanding. This is an absurd reading of the provision. 
It violates the basic rule of legal construction that meaning must be given to the entire text of the decree. 
It has also been argued that under the decree the United States did not need to insist on supervision of the election and therefore need not pay for the election. This is also absurd--the United States did elect to supervise the election, and therefore must pay for the election. To say otherwise is to make the Federal Government a deadbeat; a party to litigation weaseling out of its legal duties. 
Mr. President, Senator Stevens said it best when he talked about bringing into this appropriation matters which are not directly related to the appropriations. I have here the statement of administration policy, September 2. I will read these provisions. 
The administration understands that a number of controversial amendments may be offered, such as an amendment to prohibit the use of funds in the act for supervising the Teamster's election * * * The President's senior advisers would be forced to recommend that the President veto the bill. 
There are other provisions but that I think supports what the Senator from Alaska has mentioned. 
I had hoped that we could have tabled the whole proposal, and I would have supported it. But nonetheless we don't have that opportunity at this time, so I hope that the proposal of the Senator from Oklahoma to table the measure would not be agreed to. And if that were the case, I would not object to tabling the whole proposal and get on with the business of the appropriations. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as two Senators have indicated, this is basically a restatement of the Nickles amendment. The Senator from Oklahoma indicated earlier in the course of the debate that he was not interested nor did he want to interfere with the consent decree that had been signed in 1989. 
I offered an amendment to make sure that that would be the case, by neither requiring the payment of taxpayers' funds to be used in a subsequent election nor prohibiting funds to be used. The principal issue that is before the Senate is whether we are going to interfere with a judicial proceeding that is before the Southern District Court of New York in which briefs are required to be filed on September 17. 
This agreement, this consent decree, is not the result of the Clinton administration or the Clinton Department of Labor. This consent decree was initiated by Mayor Giuliani in 1988 and agreed to in the Federal District Court of New York in 1989 and approved by a Republican Attorney General. They understood the powers which were being included in that consent decree. They understood fully what was being agreed to. The record demonstrates that. We can have a chance to go through that in greater detail if there really is a question by the Members on that particular fact. They understood the range of authority and responsibility as a result of that particular agreement. 
This was based upon some 30 years of various activities by the Teamsters and the resulting initiative by Mr. Giuliani, who was the U.S. attorney in New York trying to bring a resolution to a great deal of the challenges, the difficulties, and the corruption that had been a part of the Teamsters in the past. 
So now we have had intervening activities under that consent decree. But that consent decree has not been concluded. As I mentioned, that consent decree is active, and it is very much alive. 
I did not hear the voices of those who are so troubled this evening complaining about that consent decree in 1988 or 1989. I did not hear the voices that are speaking on the floor of the U.S. Senate tonight that are concerned about how the consent decree was going to be implemented, saying that we will agree to a certain part of the consent decree but we will not agree to other provisions of it. That was not the case. 
The only initiative, and the new initiative, to somehow interfere with this consent decree comes 2 weeks after the UPS and Teamsters strike, which was a strike for some 15 days and which resulted in the protection of certain rights of American workers, the 185,000 workers that were working for UPS, and other rights in terms of part-time workers and other issues involving pensions. 
There are those who say, `Well, this is completely coincidental. This is really just here today. We just feel it now in our bones that the fact that it is just after the successful UPS strike has nothing to do with it. And the indignity which has been demonstrated on the floor of the U.S. Senate to suggest that there might be some kind of correlation between the fact that this amendment is being offered now today, tonight on this appropriations bill, is startling to me.' It speaks for itself. The facts speak for themselves. The facts speak for themselves. I think the Members in this body understand what is going on here. 
As has been pointed out by Members on the other side--Members on the other side--this is a judicial process, judicial proceeding, and it should not be altered or changed. That was a Republican Senator, Senator Specter, who pointed that out very effectively and very well. And we have the statements of others on the other side. The Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, said we should be about the fact of having an appropriations and move the appropriations process forward and should not become involved in these extraneous issues. 
There will be those comments later on, I am sure, probably not too long from now, about how some Members are delaying the completion of the appropriations bill, when we took an hour last night to consider the issues of fetal transplantation, which is an issue that has been debated and debated and debated and debated, in which this body had gone on record time and time again, and we debated that over the course of the morning, which was basically an extraneous issue, and now we have been debating over the course of the afternoon about this issue which is extraneous to the appropriations process and procedure. 
The statement of the administration with regard to this legislation is very clear. I will read it again: Unfortunately, the administration understands that a number of controversial amendments may be offered, such as an amendment to halt the testing initiative, an amendment to prohibit the use of funds in the act for supervising the Teamsters' election. 
That is what this amendment does. It effectively undermines the court's flexibility in terms of the supervision of the Teamsters election.

Mr. KENNEDY. If I could further respond, the consent decree required, as of September 17, the submission of additional briefs--September 17--to be submitted in the district court of New York on this very issue with regard to the recent election. This is a consent decree that is ongoing and is continuing. 
What we are being asked is effectively to have legislative interference into a judicial proceeding. That case was made very clearly, I thought, and convincingly by Senator Specter and others, that there is a clear constitutional issue about separation of powers. I think it is very clear from the administration's letter that this will open this measure to a veto. I certainly believe that it should, since it is a clear violation of the separation of powers. 
We were not either requiring, under the amendment that we had, that there be an expenditure of public funds or not. We are not trying to give guidance to the court to make a judgment. That judgment ought to be made on the basis of the facts and the briefs that are submitted to it.

I would not object to setting this aside to consider other measures. That is not my idea of delaying. If it were to be set aside, I would not object to that process.

Mr. KENNEDY. So, as the Senator from Maryland has pointed out, the court may order the election to be run or it may not. It may require the Government to fund part of the election officer's supervision in some ways. It may be limited, maybe to that election, or it may require the union to do so, or it may require each party to bear some of the costs. All of that is out and all of that is possible. 
The point is we do not know how the court will rule. We don't know how the court will rule, but this amendment now would tell the court that regardless of its ruling, regardless of its ruling, the Government will not be permitted to fund any of the election. Even if the consent order requires the Government to pay for part of it, the amendment would refuse to permit that. Thus, the amendment would interfere with an ongoing judicial process. 
Effectively, the amendment, I believe would force the Government to be in a position of reneging on this consent decree. It would, I believe, leave the Government subject to a contempt citation. I think you can make a strong case at that time if we were to take this kind of action that the Government itself would be liable to a contempt citation.

Mr. KENNEDY. I know the Senator is going to make a proposal in just a moment. I do want to just point out for the Members the obvious, and that is that we have spent all day today debating two basic issues: One is the issue of fetal transplantation which, basically, has no position on this legislation, an issue that we have debated and debated and debated and which the Senate has voted on time and again and the outcome of which was fairly obvious. We took all morning to debate that. 
All afternoon we have been debating the Nickles amendment which, as the Senator from Alaska has pointed out, is not really basic and essential to this appropriations bill, which the administration indicates it would very likely veto. So it has not been the Members on this side who have delayed the Senate from moving ahead. As one, among others, who is concerned about the Nickles amendment, I indicated that if the leader wanted to set that aside and continue to vote on other measures this evening, there would be no objection on our side. 
So I think that it is important to understand what the situation is. We are basically considering an item which is an antilabor item. It is raised in the wake of the successful UPS strike and, basically, is legislative interference on a consent decree which raises very important constitutional issues. So there should not be any surprise about that factor. 
With regard to FDA reform, the Senator made a very good point about the Members being ready and willing to vote on the medical devices and the FDA reform. What the Senator didn't mention is the other provisions which apply to the cosmetic industry which effectively is going to preempt every State in this country from getting adequate warning in terms of health and safety in the utilization of cosmetics. We know it is a $20 billion industry that for the last 20 years has been trying to get this achieved and have a preemption on issues relating to health and safety that primarily affect the American women in this country. 
I am not going to be a part of rushing and ramrodding that particular provision through the U.S. Senate. And if I am the only one who votes against cloture tomorrow, I will take my time and explain in good time what we are being asked to consider. I have no regrets for insisting that we have a cloture vote. I indicated to the majority leader, if he wanted to have the cloture vote later at a more convenient time on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday of next week, that is fine with me, absolutely, whatever he wanted to do to accommodate other Members.

We are going to be here for another 5, 6 weeks in this body. We have been attempting to negotiate these particular issues. I am very hopeful we will. 
I want to vote for the medical devices and the pharmaceuticals. I commend Senator Jeffords and all of our 
colleagues on the committee for the excellent work that they have done. I think that measure is a very, very important measure. There are one or two items which I think would be addressed in terms of amendments, but on the issue of the cosmetics preemption of every State in the country in terms of health and safety, that is an issue that is not going to go easily.

Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I want to just point out that the person that sets the schedule is the majority leader. If the majority leader files the cloture motion on a Wednesday, we end up having the cloture vote on a Friday. That is what the majority leader has done. It was his decision. He has every right to. And that is what we have as the regular order that is before the Senate. 
But effectively what the majority leader now is doing is asking a consent to vitiate what the regular order would be in terms of the cloture motion. I do not question that we are short on the votes and that there will be an overwhelming vote in favor of moving toward the bill. But the regular order is, as filed by the majority leader on Wednesday, for a cloture vote on Friday. He knew what he was doing. He knew what he was doing. 
He was the one that set the vote for Friday. And so I find it somewhat difficult to accept easily the fact that somehow the burden ought to be on other Members because the Senator now does not want to move ahead and have the vote on Friday. He was the one that established that process and procedure and set in motion those procedures. And for the reasons that I have outlined earlier with regard to particularly the preemption with regard to the cosmetics, and the protection of the consumers on those issues, which I think is a travesty in protecting the American families, and primarily the American women, I am going to object to the elimination and vitiation of the cloture motion.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one thing should be very clear in this discussion. This is not a debate that pits those who are pro-choice against those who are antiabortion. In fact, it is not a debate about abortion at all. The issue is whether Americans suffering from a host of dreaded diseases are going to have the benefits of the best and most ethical medical science possible. 
Though the Senator has targeted his particular amendment on one particular disease, there is a broader issue that is raised and that ought to be considered, because if we accept it for this disease, it is going to be accepted obviously for the other diseases of which this process, this procedure is applicable. 
Mr. President, let us review the record. And there is an extensive record because the Senate has already voted on this issue a number of times and spoken decisively in favor of ethical, controlled, scientifically valuable fetal tissue research. 
In 1988, a Reagan commission, a panel of experts consisting of theologians, scientists, legal experts, ethicists, and pro-life activists studied this issue extensively and voted 18 to 3 to lift the moratorium on fetal tissue transplantation research. 
In 1992, both the House and the Senate overwhelmingly approved bills to lift the moratorium. The vote in the Senate was 87 to 10. This legislation was vetoed by President Bush. 
Again in 1993, the Senate voted to approve fetal tissue funding for this vital research. That vote was 93 to 4. 
Each of these votes was preceded by exhaustive debate, careful consideration of all the issues and concerns associated with fetal tissue research. Each time the support for and recognition of the need for this research was overwhelming. Over the last decade, opponents of fetal tissue research have attempted to create a connection between abortion and fetal tissue testing. The use of fetal tissue in medical research cannot and should not be associated with the abortion issue. Past and present supporters, pro-life and pro-choice alike, have clearly stated that fetal tissue research is a medical, not a moral, issue. 
Many of my antiabortion colleagues, including Senator Dole and Senator Thurmond, spoke in support of fetal tissue research during the 1992 debates. They, like many others, recognized that supporting this research is the true pro-life position because it offers hope and a chance for a better life to individuals suffering from such terrible afflictions such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, cancer, birth defects, and spinal cord injuries. 
Yesterday, we heard a number of arguments against this research. And I would like to review and respond to these arguments for the benefit of my colleagues because they are based on a misunderstanding of the facts. 
First, we heard that fetal tissue research was no longer needed for the study of Parkinson's disease. Information from the Parkinson's Action Network was cited in support of these claims. I have today a letter from the Parkinson's Action Network correcting the Record. The letter states that fetal tissue transplant research shows tremendous promise. In fact it shows such promise that persons currently afflicted with Parkinson's are looking to the research as a likely source of major therapeutic benefit to them--if the research is not halted. 
The letter further states that alternative sources of cells, such as genetically engineered cells, pig cells, and stem cells, may eliminate the need for cells from abortions to be used in the future. At the present time, however, it is vital that the research be allowed to continue so that the therapy and the alternative cell sources can be developed at the same time.

Mr. KENNEDY. We also heard allegations that providers were altering the methods of abortion to obtain tissue suitable for research purposes, thereby putting women's health at risk. 
NIH guidelines provide that `no abortion should be scheduled or otherwise accommodated to suit the requirements of research.' To do so would be a clear violation of the safeguards that Congress enacted into the law. 
As part of its 1997 study of adherence to these and other guidelines to assure that the research was conducted ethically, the GAO contacted the NIH's Office of Protection from Research Risks as well as the institutional review boards of each of the institutions conducting fetal tissue research and found that no violations of tissue donation restrictions had been reported or detected. None. 
My staff called NIH this morning to verify that no violations have been detected or reported since the GAO study was completed, and we were told that there were none. 
Concern was also expressed that the success of fetal tissue therapies would create an economic link between abortion providers and the research community. Again, I point to the NIH safeguards which prohibit the purchase of fetal tissue. Since no economic incentives exist for abortion providers, it is impossible to create an economic link between providers and the research community. 
This issue has been debated and debated. Each time the opponents of the research have tried to argue that fetal tissue research will somehow stimulate abortions. Each time these arguments have ignored the extent of safeguards built into the law and regulations to assure that there is no link between the decision to have an abortion and the decision to allow fetal tissue research to be conducted. Each time these arguments have been rejected by the Senate and the American public. 
The preservation and enhancement of life is the foundation of this research. Fetal tissue research and transplantation are not just clinical abstractions, they are transforming the lives of Americans every day. 
A 55-year-old man who suffered with Parkinson's disease for more than 20 years and had lost much of his mobility is now able to climb mountains. A 58-year-old woman suffering from the disease for 14 years used to begin her day by literally crawling to take her first dose of medication. She is now able to ski and play tennis. 
The benefits of fetal tissue research are not limited to Parkinson's disease. Recent breakthroughs in the study of treatments for a host of other diseases and conditions, including diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord injuries, blindness, Huntington's disease, cancer, birth defects, multiple sclerosis, and conditions causing intractable pain, are the direct result of fetal tissue research conducted on Parkinson's disease. If this amendment is adopted on this disease, it will be readily applied to those as well. 
Any attempt to turn back the progress made in this area by placing restrictions on Parkinson's research will jeopardize further advances in the treatment of these conditions. These setbacks and delays will lead to unnecessary suffering for the millions of Americans afflicted with illnesses that are currently benefiting from Parkinson's research. Make no mistake about it, if the fetal tissue research is banned for Parkinson's disease today, it will be banned for every other disease tomorrow. 
Every time this issue has been put to the Senate, it has spoken strongly in favor of ethical, scientific, promising medical research that offers hope to millions of Americans. I urge the Senate to reaffirm that commitment by rejecting the pending amendment. 
Mr. President, I will take just a moment of the Senate's time to review the set of eight requirements that were established in the 1993 legislation. 
First, informed consent of the donor must be obtained. Each woman must sign a written statement that she is donating fetal tissue for research without knowing who the recipient will be. 
Second, the physician obtaining the tissue must make a written statement declaring that consent for the abortion was obtained prior to the consent of the donation and that the abortion was not performed solely for the purposes of obtaining the tissue. 
Third, the researcher using the tissue must sign a statement acknowledging that the tissue is human tissue and that it was obtained from an induced abortion or stillbirth. He or she must also agree to inform all subsequent users or recipients of those facts. 
Any recipient of transplanted tissue must sign a statement indicating that he or she is aware that the transplant tissue is human tissue and that it was obtained from an induced abortion or a stillbirth. 
Each agency head must certify that copies of all signed statements will be available for audit by the Secretary of HHS. 
Recipients of funding for research must agree to conduct research in accordance with applicable State laws. 
HHS must submit an annual report to Congress detailing compliance with these requirements. 
And the purchase of fetal tissue is prohibited and no donated tissue can be transplanted into a recipient specified by the donor. 
These were guidelines developed by theological, ethical, and religious people, as well as researchers. And we have the GAO study. And I will include the relevant parts of this study that was conducted by the NIH reviewing this particular program from 1993 to 1997. 
And as the results say--I am directly quoting `Results in Brief'--`There's been no reported violations in the acquisition of human fetal tissue for use in transplantation according to NIH and our verification efforts.' 
By just reviewing this report, and I will not take the additional time unless there are further questions about it, there is a very clear indication that the guidelines that have been established in the 1993 legislation have been conformed with. It does not say there have been some violations. It does not say there is an increasing number of violations. It does not say that the GAO recommends further congressional action. It says there have been no violations, none, in 1997. 
Mr. President, at a time when there have been extraordinary opportunities for progress in treating Parkinson's disease and so many other diseases and conditions, and with the kind of protections that have been agreed to by ethicists, those religious and research panels investigating the utilization of this type of material, and with all of the hope and opportunity this provides to so many American families in addressing some of the most prominent ailments suffered by mankind, to try and restrict fetal tissue research in Parkinson's disease and in other areas would be a dramatic and a serious mistake and would have a very significant and, I believe, grave impact and effect on the research and the opportunity for important progress in helping to relieve the pain and anxiety associated with these various diseases. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by Senator Kyl. I am reluctant to do so because I strongly support changes in the eligibility rules for independent and dependent students for Pell grants. 
Congress needs to make changes in the eligibility rules for these students. Both independent students and dependent students are unfairly disadvantaged by the rules now in effect. Today, single independent students at public 4-year institutions are not eligible for a Pell grant if their income is over $10,000. Many of these students will not benefit from the HOPE tax credit and the tax credit for lifelong learning. Federal funds should be available to help them meet their most basic college expenses. 
A similar problem faces dependent students. The income protection allowance is so low for them that it has become a disincentive for college students to work part-time to help them contribute to college costs. Over three-quarters of undergraduates work part-time while enrolled in college. The current system penalizes students who work during the summer and part-time through the school year by reducing their Pell grant eligibility. We should be encouraging students to take part-time jobs, rather than take out additional loans. 
The budget agreement contains a commitment to allocate $700 million for changes to the needs analysis formula under the Pell grants. The House appropriations subcommittee provided over $500 million toward this commitment, but the Senate bill contains no funds for this needed change. 
I am working with others in Congress and with the Department of Education to ensure that a satisfactory appropriation level is contained in the final bill. 
Senator Kyl supports making funds available to reform the needs analysis. But unfortunately, to pay for the reform, he makes a deep cut in the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. 
For the 5 million beneficiaries of LIHEAP across the Nation, including 120,000 in Massachusetts, it will be an unnecessarily harsh winter if this important program is slashed. 
Some 95 percent of the households receiving LIHEAP assistance have annual incomes below $18,000. They spend an extremely burdensome 18 percent of their income on energy, compared to the average middle-class family, which spends only 4 percent. 
Researchers at Boston City Hospital have documented a `heat or eat effect.' Higher utility bills during the coldest months force low-income families to spend less money on food. The result is increased malnutrition among children. 
Almost twice as many low-weight and undernourished children were admitted to Boston City Hospital's emergency room immediately following the coldest month of the winter. No family should have to choose between heating and eating. 
Low-income elderly will be at the greatest risk if LIHEAP funds are slashed, because they are the most vulnerable to hypothermia. In fact, older Americans accounted for more than half of all hypothermia deaths in 1991. 
In addition, the elderly are much more likely to live in homes built before 1940, which are less energy efficient and put them at greater risk. 
Low-income elderly who have trouble paying their fuel bills are often driven to rely on room heaters, fireplaces, ovens, and wood-burning stoves to save money. Between 1986 and 1990, these higher-risk heating sources were the second leading cause of fire deaths among the elderly. In fact, elderly citizens are up to 12 times more likely to die in heating-related fires than adults under 65. 
LIHEAP is a lifeline for Massachusetts and many other cold weather States. I hope we can work together to make the needs analysis changes in the Pell grants, without denying this lifeline to a very vulnerable group. I urge that the Kyl amendment be defeated.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I strongly support the amendment that Senator McCain and Senator Wellstone have offered. More research is clearly needed if we are to conquer this debilitating disease that afflicts more than a million Americans. 
I strongly disagree, however, that this is an appropriate place to revisit the issue of fetal tissue research, and I urge the Senate to defeat the Coats amendment. 
The earlier ban on fetal research was lifted 4 years ago, and that action was deeply justified. The ban was lifted by the administration and Congress after careful consideration and exhaustive debate. 
Research involving fetal tissue holds the potential to provide tremendous advances in treatments and cures for a long list of debilitating conditions such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, blindness, leukemia, hemophilia, sickle cell anemia, spinal cord injuries, deficiencies of the immune system, birth defects, and certain conditions causing intractable pain. The list goes on and on. 
It is no wonder, then, that opposition to a ban on fetal tissue research is supported by a wide range of organizations dedicated to improving the health of Americans, including the Alzheimer's Association, the Epilepsy Foundation of America, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, the Parkinson's Disease Foundation, and the Society for Pediatric Research. 
Four years ago, Congress decided that the benefits of this research far outweighed the unsubstantiated fears and concerns that the need for fetal tissue would lead to increases in abortions. The vote in the Senate to lift the ban was a resounding 93 to 4. 
The bill enacted in 1993 established rigorous standards to safeguard against any possibility that fetal tissue research would influence individual decisions about abortion. Those safeguards are in place and they are working--and working well. 
A 1997 GAO study of the safeguards reports that `the act's documentation requirements were met' and that `there have been no reported violations in the acquisition of human fetal tissue for use in transplantation.' 
The safeguards are working not just in research on Parkinson's disease, but in all research involving fetal tissue. It is irrational and inappropriate to revisit this debate by singling out research on Parkinson's disease for excessive restrictions. 
Since 1993, the NIH has awarded more than $23 million in grants for research involving the study, analysis, and use of human fetal tissue. The research that is being carried out today is producing effective solutions that can end the suffering associated with a wide variety of illnesses, and it makes no sense, no sense at all, to restrict it. 
One other point should be made. The research being conducted today with fetal tissue is also providing new techniques such as specialized cell lines and genetically engineered cells. In fact, the development of these new technologies may well eliminate the need for using fetal tissue for research purposes. Ironically, the best way to achieve the goal of the Coats amendment is to defeat the Coats amendment, and I urge the Senate to do so. 
My Republican colleagues have argued that women will decide to have an abortions in order to donate tissue for research. 
These claims are unfounded and uncorroborated. The substantial history of fetal tissue research--extending back at least 30 years to the development of the polio vaccine--shows no evidence--and no evidence has been presented here to the Senate this evening--that the results have encouraged abortion. 
American women for various personal and entirely unrelated reasons choose to have over 1 million legal abortions each year. These legal abortions will continue to be performed in the future, regardless of the extent of fetal tissue research. 
Congress enacted stringent safeguards to address this claim. No woman can know in advance if the remains from her abortion would or even could be used for research purposes. A woman may not be approached for consent to donate the aborted tissue until after she has made the decision to have an abortion. 
Safeguards established by the NIH have eliminated any potential incentives for abuse. No profit can be derived from providing the tissue for research. No family member or friend can benefit from a woman's abortion. A woman may not designate who will be the recipient of the tissue. 
This issue has been reviewed and studied as to the effectiveness of the rules and regulations which have been established. It is effectively working and working well. This amendment would have an adverse impact in terms of the real potential for making significant progress in areas of research, and it would not be justified in terms of providing the kind of restrictions that are included in the Coats amendment. For that reason, I hope the Coats amendment will not be accepted. 
Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support this year's spending bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education. 
I commend Senator Specter and Senator Harkin for their outstanding job in developing this bipartisan legislation. This bill also reflects President Clinton's priorities in his 1998 budget for strengthening our commitment to education, enhancing the productivity of the Nation's workforce, and improving the health of all Americans. 
Clearly there is an urgent need to allocate increased resources to these important investments if the Nation is to maintain its competitive edge in the 21st century. 
We need to ensure that millions of children do not fall behind in reading, in math, in science, and technology. 
We need to make certain that the rising cost of tuition does not put college education out of the reach for working families. 
We need to ensure that the rising demand for job training services is met, as 1.7 million welfare recipients leave the welfare rolls and seek jobs under last year's welfare reform legislation. 
We must also recognize the need for increased funding for biomedical research, which holds great promise to cure or prevent so many illnesses and can be an important factor in finding a long-term solution to the fiscal problems facing Medicare. 
This year's spending legislation for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education takes an important step toward making these critical investments for our Nation's future. 
Most notably, it increases the Pell grant maximum from $2,700 to $3,000, which will increase college aid for over 3.6 million low- and middle-income students. 
The bill increases Head Start funding by $324 million over last year's level, which will provide essential preschool services to an additional 36,000 low-income children. 
It increases the education technology funding by $275 million to help teachers learn to use technology effectively and help raise student achievement. 
It provides $40 million for the construction and repair of schools in needy areas. The General Accounting Office has found that a third of the Nation's schools, with 14 million students, have one or more buildings needing extensive repair. This was an concern that was debated and discussed during the consideration of the budget. Great leadership on this issue has been provided by our friend from Illinois, Senator Moseley-Braun. 
The legislation provides $81 million over last year's level for the Ryan White AIDS Program and $24 million for the Community and Migrant Health Program. 
And it provides $1.2 billion in fiscal year 1999 for LIHEAP, which will enable this important program to serve thousands of additional senior citizens, the disabled, and working families by providing them with heating and cooling assistance. 
Yet the bill falls short in a number of important areas. It fails to provide the additional $700 million that President Clinton requested to help 218,000 independent students afford a higher education under the Pell Grant Program. We need to make sure that individuals who are moving through the economy are going to be able to upgrade their skills. We know that unlike 30 years ago when an individual had a job and kept that job for his or her entire life, individuals who now enter the job market will probably have seven different jobs over the course of their lives. What we are attempting to do is recognize the importance of making available to these middle-income Americans the opportunities to upgrade their skills and continue their education. 
None of us can visit the various community colleges without seeing the dramatic change that has taken place in the ages of many of the students who will be attending. We see the average age increased now to 26 or 27 years of age. These are individuals who are taking advantage of various training programs and educational opportunities to upgrade their skills so they can participate in the new economy. This issue is a high priority of the President, but we have seen the funding for independent students fall short. 
No funds were also appropriated this year for the new child literacy program. Low achievement in reading is a national problem that deserves our immediate attention. Children who lack reading skills by the fourth grade are more likely to fall behind and eventually to drop out of school. We have had extensive hearings in the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on that particular need. We know the committee has delayed funding for child literacy, and we know that we do not have, at this time, the authorizing legislation needed to ensure that those efforts and those resources would be carefully targeted to get the most meaningful assistance to children. But we also know that the chairman of our authorizing committee, Senator Jeffords, and others--a broad, bipartisan group--are strongly committed toward developing that literacy program. This issue is a national priority, and we should not delay action. 
As the ranking member of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, I am strongly committed to seeing that legislation authorizing the child literacy initiative is enacted this year. We cannot stand by and delay the $260 million needed to implement this important program. 
The Appropriations Committee also eliminated the Supplemental State Incentive Grant Program that helped over 1 million students attend college last year. Any of us who have had the chance to talk to students who are using this program know what a difference it makes. I think, given the very modest amount of resources we are talking about--some $50 million--we ought to be able to continue the Supplemental State Incentive Grant Program. 
Both the National Labor Relations Board and the Health Professions Education Program are seriously underfunded in this spending bill. These shortfalls will adversely affect the investigation of unfair labor practices and the access of minority and low-income Americans to health care services. 
There is in the country a sense that we have committed large resources for the development of professional education in the area of health care. You can make a case that in certain areas of our country we do have greater numbers of trained professionals in our health care system than are necessary. But what we do not have is the kind of outreach programs which this Health Professions Education Program was meant to have--to ensure that many low-income individuals and minorities would be able to access the education and be able to go and serve in underserved areas of the Nation. 
The initial proposal by the administration in the area of health professions was dramatically even below what has been appropriated--or requested for appropriations in the House or the Senate. Both the House and Senate bills have made improvements on the Clinton administration's proposal, and I think that Health Professions Education programs ought to be strengthened in the final legislation. 
Also, the appropriations for the National Labor Relations Board will mean that the opportunity for investigations of various unfair labor practices will be unattended. If we are really interested in the continued fairness in the workplace, and when we recognize that, over the past year, hundreds of thousands of workers were shortchanged in terms of back pay and other types of unfair practices, we want to make sure their interests are going to be adequately protected. 
I commend the Appropriations Committee for its 7.8 percent increase for the National Institutes of Health. But much more funding is needed if the Nation is to continue to make progress in the development of new and more effective treatments for cancer, AIDS, heart disease, and many other serious and debilitating conditions. 
Both Senator Harkin, Senator Specter, Senator Mack, and many others have worked tirelessly on behalf of the NIH over the years. I have welcomed the opportunity to join with them and others to try to make sure that the opportunities that are out there now, which are unparalleled in terms of our research history, are taken advantage of in order to make an important difference in terms of the health of our fellow citizens and American families; but also in terms of reducing the burden of health care for those families, and also to the States and the Federal Government. 
Increased funding for biomedical research will reap other rewards as well. It will encourage more of the best and brightest of America's college graduates to make their careers in scientific research. It will provide benefits to the larger economy as scientific advances move from the laboratory into the private sector, creating new businesses and job opportunities for many individuals. 
Equally important is a recent study by researchers at Duke University that indicates expanded funding for NIH can help keep Medicare solvent for the long term. Currently, the very ill account for the overwhelming majority of Medicare costs. If we invest in biomedical research to make senior citizens healthier, we can save enormous sums, protect Medicare for future generations, and prevent many of the illnesses of old age. 
Mr. President, yesterday the Nation saluted its working families on Labor Day. This year's spending bill pays tribute to these families by making a downpayment on important education, labor, and health programs. 
More still needs to be done. Legislation still can be approved, but it should not be weighted down with poison pill amendments, as was the case in the 104th Congress when language was offered which would have prohibited Medicaid funding of abortions, and it would have barred OSHA from considering new ergonomic rules. The bill represents a careful bipartisan compromise, and I strongly support its adoption. 
I mentioned, Mr. President, in my comments, the provisions on the increase in the Pell Grant Program and education technology. We find a number of States are moving ahead in voluntary ways, such as Massachusetts, to make sure that all of their schools are actually going to be tied into the Internet system. A combination of the excellent cooperation between the software council in my State of Massachusetts and the labor unions resulted in every school in the State tied into the Internet system. They have laid 50 miles of cable in Boston alone, which was the result of voluntary contributions of labor in wiring those schools and voluntary contributions from the various industries in providing the software. 
What we need to do is make sure we not only have the education technology, but have trained educators who are going to be using technology in various ways that are going to enhance education. There are important resources in this bill for that program. 
The Head Start Program, which under the more recent authorization will help expectant mothers in parenting skills as well as reaching down into the early childhood years. Still, there is enormous need for the expansion of that program which is so important. 
Years ago, we felt that the principal advantage of Head Start was just to equip children with confidence-building measures, so as they entered education in kindergarten and the first grade, they would be able to move ahead in learning. Now we are finding out that they are in a position in the very early years--2 years old, 3 years old, 4 years old--to actually learn something. That is what the most recent research is showing, and we need to make sure we are going to be able to reach out to many of the disadvantaged children, the poorest children who do not have the opportunities for the development of that kind of early start and give some help and assistance for them. 
School construction and repair work has been an issue that has, in recent times, come before us. I can mention in terms of Boston, New Bedford, Fall River, Lowell, Lawrence, and Springfield--and the list goes on--the number of schools that are closed every day in major cities during the wintertime because of poor repairs and temperatures. The need for school repairs are so important. 
Local school districts are doing something, and we have a modest Federal program, as has been outlined, to begin to show that such an initiative is enormously important. If children go to schools that are deteriorating and dilapidated, you are sending a message to the children--maybe it is a subliminal message, but a message nonetheless--that even though as political leaders we are making speeches about the importance of children and the importance of education, the children see that education is not the priority of a State, a community, or the Nation as it should be. This is a modest effort to address this important issue. 
There is support of the Ryan White bill and community and migrant health, which is important in reaching out to so many people. And the LIHEAP program which is a tried and tested program which is absolutely essential for so many of our elderly who live in the colder climates. 
Independent students, as I mentioned, is a key element and needs support. I believe students--young, middle age, and older--who are going back to upgrade their skills at community colleges should be able to get some help and assistance under the various education programs. The importance of this was understood in the budget agreement. I know both Senators Specter and Harkin understand the importance of these programs. Still, this is an area that we need to give, I think, some attention to as we go on into the conference. 
We will have some opportunity to debate child literacy as we move ahead. The real question is in timing. I think all of us here understand the importance of the enhancement of the literacy program. There are many excellent programs that are taking place now, and we want to continue to make progress. We are not making progress nationwide, and this is an area of enormous importance. 
Again, with NIH and health professions education, the appropriations exceed what was initially proposed by the administration. The House has a more favorable funding level. This program is very, very important in creating opportunities for people to go into the health professions who will go out and serve in many different parts of our communities. 
Mr. President, again, I express strong support for the job that was done, and I commend our committee for those areas where they have, I think, made a very, very important commitment of scarce resources. We understand that there will be at least an expectation that as we move into the conference, there may be additional resources that will be available that could be used for funding some of these areas where there is an important need. 
I look forward, as this debate takes place, to try to see if we cannot find either offsets to enhance these programs that are a priority or at least to work with the committee to see if out of the conference we cannot get greater attention. 
I thank the Chair and yield the floor.  
Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support Senator Durbin's point of order under the Byrd Rule, which would strike from the tax legislation what should be called the `Joe Camel Tobacco Loophole.' 
This loophole will allow the tobacco industry to credit the new 15-cent cigarette tax against the $368 billion it must pay in injury claims and other health expenses under the so-called `global settlement.' 
Over the next ten years, the loophole would add a $16 billion tax break for the tobacco industry, which peddles in deadly products that already addict 50 million Americans, and cost society $100 billion annually in medical expenses and lost productivity. 
The tobacco industry was also able to water down the 20-cent increase in the cigarette tax to fund children's health, despite the fact that it had overwhelming public support and passed the Senate last month by a vote of 80 to 19. 
The lesson is clear. Joe Camel still prowls the halls of Congress. When tobacco issues are discussed in the light of day, the American people win. When the debate moves into the back rooms, the tobacco industry's interests come first, and the public interest comes last. 
It's time that Congress stood up to the tobacco industry and said `no' to Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man. This tobacco loophole has no place in this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support the Durbin point of order.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I regret that we have been unable to reach final agreement so far on FDA reform. In fact, the negotiations this month have made significant progress on almost all of the issues surrounding the bill. Reasonable compromises were reached on 26 separate proposals that had raised serious health and safety concerns and were opposed by the FDA and the administration. 
Two issues remained today. It is critical that FDA be able to get all the data they need to ensure that devices that have different technological characteristics from a predecessor device are safe and effective. Provisions of the committee-reported bill might unduly tie the FDA's hands in this important area. 
The second issue involves the proposal for sweeping Federal pre-emption of the current authority of States to regulate over-the-counter drugs and cosmetics. In cosmetics, for example, there is virtually no significant Federal regulation at the present time, and States should have the right to act to protect their citizens against dangerous products. Too often, there have been abuses such as lipsticks containing substances that could cause birth defects, skin creams made with known carcinogens, excessive lead in hair dye, and suntan products that produce severe chemical burns. 
In my view, acceptable compromises can be reached on both of these issues, and I hope that good faith negotiations will continue. 
Unfortunately, in the wake of the current impasses on these two issues, several additional matters that had previously been settled have now been reopened. A fair overall compromise is still possible that adequately protects the public, and I am optimistic that we can achieve it by September.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, too often we take for granted the exceptional work done by our Ambassadors and members of the foreign service. These individuals perform their duties in countries throughout the world, often in difficult conditions. Their service is a great tribute to their ability and their loyalty to our Nation, and they deserve America's enduring gratitude for the job they do so well in representing our country in other lands. 
Earlier this month, one of our most respected ambassadors, Richard Gardner, completed his service as Ambassador to Spain. Dick has previously served as Ambassador to Italy, and is widely recognized as one of the Nation's foremost experts on foreign policy. The knowledge, enthusiasm, and diligence he brought to his post in Madrid significantly strengthened the political, economic, and cultural ties between our Nation and Spain. 
I commend Ambassador Gardner for his outstanding service.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is a great day for America's children. With this agreement, we have taken a giant step toward giving all American children the healthy start in life they deserve. 
The establishment of a new, $24 billion program to provide low and moderate income families the help they need to purchase health insurance for their children is a landmark achievement. It represents the most far-reaching step that Congress has ever taken to help the Nation's children and the most far-reaching advance in health care since the enactment of Medicare and Medicaid a generation ago. 
The funds provided under this bill are sufficient to assure that every American family has access to affordable insurance for its children. 
President Clinton deserves tremendous credit for his leadership in achieving this milestone. His fight for health security for all Americans in the first 2 years of his administration laid the foundation for the progress we made in the last Congress and for today's agreement. 
The Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation enacted in the last Congress guarantees that workers can change jobs without losing their health insurance coverage, or being denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition. The vast majority of Americans obtain health insurance for themselves and their families through their jobs, and ending insurance discrimination against those in poor health was a significant step toward greater health security for all families. 
Today's expansion of health insurance coverage for children could not have happened without President Clinton's strong support. The President fought hard to include a $16 billion commitment for children in the budget agreement. And it was his unwavering support that assured the additional $8 billion added by the Senate was included in the final bill. 
I also commend several others who contributed to this victory for children. Mrs. Clinton has made the issue of good health care for children a lifetime of commitment, and I thank her for her strong support. Senator Hatch's courageous leadership in the battle for health insurance coverage financed by a cigarette tax was absolutely critical. Senator Rockefeller, Senator Chafee, Senator Jeffords, Senator Kerry, Representatives Nancy Johnson, Bob Matsui, and Marge Roukema and others were effective leaders in reaching this bipartisan goal. 
Among many outside groups that worked to make this day possible, the Campaign for CHILD Health Now, co-chaired by the Children's Defense Fund and the American Cancer Society, was indispensable in its tireless efforts to inform and mobilize the public in support of children's health insurance. Marian Wright Edelman, as always, was outstanding in these efforts. 
When Senator Hatch and I introduced our children's health insurance proposal in March, we said that it would help guarantee good health care for millions of children who have been left out and left behind. These children come from hard-working families. Their parents work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year--but they still cannot afford the health care their children need. Whether the issue is eyeglasses, or hearing aids, or asthma, or prescription drugs, too many children do not get the care they need for the healthy start in life they deserve. 
The agreement today brings new hope to these children and their families. It means that they will have a better opportunity to achieve a long and healthy life. It means that our country has at last given children's health the high priority it deserves. 
I am also pleased that there will be an increase in the cigarette tax, but I am disappointed that the cigarette companies still wield sufficient power in the back rooms of Congress to roll back the tax below the 20-cent increase approved by an overwhelming bipartisan vote in the Senate. A higher tobacco tax is an effective means to discourage children from smoking. This issue will not go away, and I expect the Senate to return to it later this year, either in the context of legislation on the tobacco settlement or as part of other bills. 
Finally, it is gratifying that the agreement drops the harsh and ill-thought-out proposals on Medicare, such as raising the eligibility age, imposing a means test on premiums, and requiring copayments for home health care that would have penalized the oldest, sickest, and poorest senior citizens. Long-run reforms are needed to keep Medicare strong, but any reform worth the name deserves careful deliberation by Congress, not the short-circuited consideration imposed by the strict rules on budget bills. 
Finally, I express my very personal appreciation for the strong leadership that was provided by Senator Daschle, on our side, and for his strong commitment on health care. Senator Daschle had indicated that health care for children was going to be one of our Democratic strong priorities in this Congress. His unflagging strength and commitment and support for this program was invaluable in seeing its achievement. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the balanced budget agreement represents major progress in restoring benefits to legal immigrants. The harsh welfare law passed last year wrongfully denied access by legal immigrants to most Federal assistance programs. It permanently banned them from SSI benefits and food stamps. It banned them for 5 years from AFDC, Medicaid, and other programs. And it gave the States the option of permanently banning them from these programs. 
Americans across the country were rightly concerned about these unfair provisions, and Congress soon agreed that the legislation had gone too far. 
If the provisions of last year's welfare law remain in effect, many elderly legal immigrants would be forced out of nursing homes. Legal immigrants injured on the job and those with disabled children would lose assistance. Some 500,000 legal immigrants who were already living in the United States would have been affected. In Massachusetts, 15,000 elderly and disabled legal immigrants would have lost their SSI benefits. 
Some said in last year's welfare debate, `Let the immigrant's sponsor support them.' But, Congress now realizes that legal immigrants often do not have sponsors. Refugees, for example, do not have sponsors. In cases of many older immigrants, their sponsor has died or is no longer able to provide support. 
Immigrants affected by last year's harsh cuts are individuals who came to this country legally. Many are close family members of American citizens. They play by the rules, pay their taxes, and serve in our Armed Forces. They are future citizens trying to make their way in this country. 
The $12 billion restored for legal immigrant assistance over the next 5 years in this bill is urgently needed. It will allow most legal immigrants who currently receive SSI benefits to stay on the rolls. In addition, legal immigrants who were in the United States at this time last year's welfare bill was enacted in August 1996 can receive SSI in the future if they become disabled. These changes will help a very large number of people hurt by the welfare law. 
Unfortunately, those who are too disabled to go through the process of naturalization to become citizens are left out of the final bill. I proposed an amendment, which was accepted by the Senate, to receive SSI benefits after their first 5 years in the United States, and I hope we can revisit this important issue in the near future. 
I had also hoped the final budget agreement would allow legal immigrant children to continue to receive Medicaid. Currently, they are banned from Medicaid for 5 years. Some States may even act to ban legal immigrant children from Medicaid forever. The Senate bill included a Chafee-Graham amendment to enable these children to receive Medicaid benefits, and I regret that it was dropped from the first bill. 
There is still much more to be done to correct the problems created for legal immigrants by last year's welfare bill. The Senate version of this bill restored less than 50 percent of the cuts made last year in their benefits. We are making worthwhile progress in this legislation, and I intend to do all I can to see that additional progress is made in future legislation. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for the past 2 days, 6,500 workers have been on strike at the Shaw's Supermarket chain in southeastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island. These workers are members of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. For months, they negotiated in good faith with their employer in an effort to reach a collective bargaining agreement fair to both sides. 
But no agreement could be reached. The company insisted on cutting health care benefits and requiring the employees to pay part of the premium. The company also proposed to reduce sick leave and cut back on job security protections. In addition, the company would not even consider the wage increase that the workers are seeking. 
The company left workers no choice but to go on strike when their current contract expired--and at midnight last Sunday they did so. 
Many of the affected employees earn less than $6 an hour. All of them count on health benefits for themselves and their families. These employees include Marilyn and Donnie Henderson, a husband and wife from Methuen, MA. They began working at Shaw's over 15 years ago, when the company was a family-owned business. Now it is owned by a corporation based in Britain. Donnie Henderson suffers from emphysema. He needs the health insurance. So do the couple's children, one of whom is disabled. 
The Hendersons and thousands like them are hardworking, dedicated employees of Shaw's. They went on strike only as a last resort, because they can't afford to take the cuts the company demanded. 
Today, it appears that the company and union have reached a tentative settlement of their dispute. Union members will vote tomorrow on whether to ratify the agreement. Employees could be back on the job by this weekend. 
All of us agree that labor disputes are best resolved when the parties themselves can reach agreement. I am hopeful that this is what has happened between Shaw's and its employees. 
But, if the matter is not resolved, and workers are forced to continue to walk picket lines, I am concerned that the company might again turn to the use of replacement workers. Shaw's used replacements from the beginning of this strike, and I regret that. This tactic is hostile to loyal workers like the Hendersons, and hostile to the collective bargaining process. In strikes where permanent replacements are used, workers lost the most, but studies show that everyone else loses as well. Employers suffer, too, because strikes are prolonged. 
According to a study of the period from 1935 to 1973, the average duration of a strike was seven times longer in cases where permanent replacements were used. 
Another study found that, where employers neither announced an intention to hire permanent replacements nor actually hired them, the average length of strikes was 27 days, but it soared to 84 days when permanent replacements were hired. 
The ability to hire permanent replacements tilts the balance unfairly in favor of 
businesses in labor-management relations. Hiring permanent replacements encourages management intransigence in negotiating with labor. That practice encourages employers to replace current workers with new workers willing to settle for less--to accept smaller paychecks and other benefits. 
This tradeoff is unacceptable for the 6,500 striking workers at Shaw's Supermarkets, and it is unacceptable for working men and women across the country. Therefore, if the tentative settlement between Shaw's and its employees breaks down, and Shaw's tries to hire replacement workers again, I intend to offer legislation to prohibit this practice. The Workplace Fairness Act will ensure that the right to join a union and bargain over wages and employment conditions remains a meaningful right, instead of a hollow promise. The bill reaffirms our commitment to the collective bargaining process, and to a fair balance between labor and management. 
I am hopeful that employees and Shaw's management will resolve all their differences this week. But if they do not, and replacement workers appear at the supermarkets again, I intend to offer a bill to outlaw that tactic, and will urge my colleagues to approve it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, It is a privilege to join in introducing the Crime Victims Empowerment Act. I commend Senator Leahy and Congresswoman McCarthy for their effective leadership on this important issue, and the many organizations who share our concern, especially the National Network to End Domestic Violence, the National Clearinghouse for the Defense of Battered Women, and the NOW Legal Defense Fund. 
Too often in the past, the victims of crime have been the forgotten citizens in the criminal justice system. The legislation we are introducing today is an attempt to redress the balance and to guarantee that victims of crime are not victimized a second time by the criminal justice system. 
First, the bill establishes new statutory rights for victims of Federal crimes, including expanded rights to participate in all phases of the criminal justice process, from trial through sentencing. Expanded rights are created for victims during trial proceedings. 
Second, the bill includes a number of important measures to assist victims of crimes under State laws. A key step here is to provide additional training and resources to State officials. Although most State judges and prosecutors are conscientious, there are too many cases in which the rights and needs of victims are ignored. 
Too often, for example, victims of assaults or other violent crimes learn about developments in their case by reading the newspaper, or watching the news on television. Victims should not have to learn about the release of their assailants in these ways. Our bill offers resources to local authorities to take this step and other basic steps to ensure that victims are not left out of the criminal justice provisions in obvious ways like this. 
To take another example, there is a critical shortage of victim advocates to provide services and support to crime victims. Our bill addresses this shortage by authorizing the hiring of additional personnel. 
These initiatives will not raise the deficit. They are financed by civil penalties paid under the False Claims Act. 
There is no need to amend the Constitution to protect the rights of victims of crime. We can accomplish our goal by statute, and ensure that victims are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. I look forward to early action on this legislation, and to taking the long overdue steps to improve the quality of justice in our society by protecting the rights of victims.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Mack and Senator Graham in introducing the Immigration Reform Transition Act of 1997 proposed by President Clinton. 
Without this legislation, thousands of Central American refugee families who fled death squads and persecution in their native lands would be forced to return. Republican and Democratic administrations alike promised them repeatedly that they will get their day in court to make their claims before an immigration judge to remain in the United States. 
But last year's immigration law turned its back on that commitment and closed the door on these families. This legislation reinstates the promise and guarantees these families the day in court they deserve. 
Virtually all of these families fled to the United States in the 1980's from El Salvador, Nicaragua, or Guatemala. Many were targeted by death squads and faced persecution at the hands of rogue militias. They came to America to seek safe haven and freedom for themselves and their children. 
The Reagan administration, the Bush administration, and the Clinton administration assured them that they could apply to remain permanently in the United States under our immigration laws. If they have lived here for at least 7 years and are of good moral character, and if a return to Central America will be an unusual hardship, they are allowed to remain. 
Last year's immigration law eliminated this opportunity for these families by changing the standard for humanitarian relief. 
President Clinton has promised to find a fair and reasonable solution for these families, and the administration will use its authority to help as many of them as possible. But Congress must do its part too, by enacting this corrective legislation. 
These families are law-abiding, taxpaying members of communities in all parts of America. Their children have grown up here. In fact, many of their children were born here and are U.S. citizens by birth. They deserve this chance. 
Mr. President, it is my hope not only that we can move on this legislation--and move quickly--but also that certain issues can be addressed as the Senate considers it. In particular, I believe that the limitations on judicial review contained in the administration's bill are both unnecessary and unwise. There are already substantial limitations on judicial review contained in last year's immigration law that would also apply in this instance. We should not add to them in this legislation. Instead, we should ensure that, if mistakes are made, the courts can correct them. 
Again, I commend the administration for this important initiative and am pleased to join Senator Mack and Senator Graham in cosponsoring the legislation.

 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend my colleague, Senator Mikulski, for her leadership yesterday in seeking $20 million for President Clinton's America Reads initiative. This amendment supports 1,300 AmeriCorps members who will serve as literacy tutors to help children learn to read--and read well--by the end of the third grade. 
Reading is a fundamental skill for learning, but too many children have trouble learning how to read. If students don't learn to read in the early elementary school years, it is virtually impossible for them to keep up later. According to a recent study, 40 percent of fourth grade students don't attain the basic level of reading, and 70 percent don't attain the proficient level. 
Research shows that reading skills are developed not only in the home and in the classroom, but also in communities and libraries. Sustained, reading opportunities outside the regular school day and during the summer can raise reading levels when combined with other instruction. Only 30 minutes a day of reading aloud with an adult can enable a young child to make real gains in reading. Adults also serve as role models for young children. 
I commend Senator Mikulski for her effective leadership in the extremely important area of community service and childhood literacy. Every child can learn to read well, and every child deserves that chance. No child should be left out or left behind.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as the Clinton administration and the conferees on the tax cut bill work out their differences, we need to do all we can to guarantee that fair tax relief is delivered to the American people. The last thing Congress should do is enact a tax relief bill that offers plums to the wealthy and crumbs to everyone else. 
Who deserves the tax relief? Is it the average hard-working family on Main Street, or the wealthy millionaire on Wall Street? Is it the rookie policeman walking the beat? Or is it the heirs of fortunes worth millions of dollars? Is it the nurse trying to raise a family on $27,000 a year? Or is it the financier buying and selling stocks and bonds? 
That is what is at stake this week and next week, nothing less. There are two key questions: will Congress target the scarce funds available for tax cuts to working Americans in blue-collar shirts or to tycoons in designer suits? Will the amount of tax relief be responsible, or will it explode in the out-years and unbalance the budget we are trying so hard to balance? 
Everyone at the negotiating table now agrees that $85 billion is a realistic figure for tax relief over the next 5 years. The debate is no longer about how much tax relief we should enact for that period. Now the debate is over who should benefit from that tax relief, and how much they should benefit. 
Our Republican friends want to target the vast majority of the benefits of tax relief on those who have already benefited the most from the Nation's soaring economic growth--the wealthiest individuals and corporations in our society. 
Clearly, this tax bill cannot close the widening income gap in our society. But just as clearly, it should not make the gap wider. 
Over the last two decades, the rich have gotten richer, and everyone else has fallen behind. During the 1950's and 1960's, all income groups in the population participated in the economy's growth. We all advanced together. But, in the 1980's and 1990's, we grew apart. The benefits of economic growth have tilted heavily toward the rich. 
Instead of reducing this inequality, the Republicans would add to it. Their tax cuts are weighted heavily to the rich. According to the Treasury Department, the House Republican tax plan would give two thirds--two-thirds--of its benefits to the richest fifth of the population. 
And that estimate is conservative. Citizens for Tax Justice included the estate tax cuts and corporate tax cuts in their analysis and calculates that the richest fifth 
would get 80 percent of the benefits. 
By contrast, under the President's proposal 83 percent of the tax cuts would go to working families and the middle class, and only 10 percent would go to the wealthy. 
The largest tax breaks in the Republican plan are the lower tax rate on capital gains, the indexing of capital gains for inflation, the estate tax cuts, and the expansion of IRAs and other tax-preferred savings accounts. All of these provisions benefit the wealthy, not average Americans. 
In addition, the Republican proposal opens the way for more tax loopholes and other special interest tax breaks. The changes to the corporate alternative minimum tax alone will make it easier for large corporations to earn billions of dollars in profits but pay little or no taxes. 
The most unbalanced giveaway in the Republican bill is the capital gains tax cut. Under the Republican bill the rich will see their capital gains tax rate cut in half. The lowest bracket taxpayers will only see a reduction of one-third. 
The Republican tax break on capital gains will be worth all of $6 to the average family with median income. But it will be worth over $7,000 to those in the top 1 percent of the population. 
By contrast, under the President's proposal, everyone will get the same tax break of 30 percent on their capital gains. The President's proposal ensures that the same breaks granted to the rich are also given to every taxpayer. It is simple fairness that everyone should receive the same treatment. 
Another unbalanced provision in the Republican proposal is the estate tax reduction. The Republican provisions are aimed at the top 2 percent of all estates. They help those who have done extremely well in recent years. Median income taxpayers will see no tax reduction at all from these provisions. 
The Republicans claim that they are helping families with the $500 children's tax credit. But most families earning under $30,000 will not be eligible to receive the full benefits of the credit under the Republican plan, and many of these hard-working, tax-paying Americans will receive no benefit from the credit at all. The President's proposal is far fairer in enabling these families to take advantage of the credit. 
Furthermore, no tax bill can be considered fair if it does not address the needs of low and moderate income families for affordable health insurance coverage for their children. Ninety percent of uninsured children are members of working families. These parents work hard--40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year--but all their hard work does not buy the insurance their children need for a healthy start in life. 
The Senate bill offered a downpayment on this problem by providing $24 billion to help such families purchase affordable coverage. This coverage was financed, in part, by a 20-cent-per-pack increase in the cigarette tax. Whether to include this cigarette tax increase, and the additional $8 billion in funding for child health insurance it will buy, in the final tax bill is now in dispute. In view of the immense costs that smoking inflicts on society and the critical need for children's health insurance for low and moderate income families, it would be a travesty if big tobacco prevails and eliminates these provisions from the final legislation. 
Finally, the Republican proposal has serious defects in the long run that make it irresponsible and that will cause the deficit to explode in future years. According to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, the Republican proposal will increase the deficit by $500 billion to $600 billion in the 10 years after 2007. 
We went down this deficit road once before, with the excessive Reagan tax cuts of the 1980's. We should learn from that history, not repeat it. It is a pyrrhic victory if the budget is in balance in 2002, and then grossly unbalanced in the years that follow. 
Democrats are proud to stand for responsible tax relief that is fair to the American people. The Republican alternative flunks the test of fairness, and it flunks the test of responsibility. The choice is clear and the people will judge Congress by how we respond. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Harkin amendment to the Agriculture appropriations bill. The illegal sale of tobacco products to teenagers is a serious national problem. Each year, it is estimated that a half a billion cigarettes are sold to Americans under the age of 18. 
The Harkin amendment is an important test of the genuineness of the Senate's commitment to reducing teenage smoking by fully funding the enforcement of the FDA tobacco regulations. These FDA rules prohibit the sale of tobacco to minors, and require retailers to check the photo identification of consumers who purchase tobacco products if they appear to be 27 years old or younger. Of the $34 million, $24 million will go to the States for enforcement. 
The Harkin amendment also represents an important test of the Senate's resolve to support FDA regulation of tobacco. Three months ago, a federal court in Greensboro, NC upheld FDA's authority to issue the youth access regulations. But rather than strengthening the FDA's hand by providing the agency with the necessary funds to enforce the rules, the current bill shamefully weakens the FDA's authority appropriating only $5 million for enforcement, or just one-seventh of the President's request for $34 million. 
Some argue that the Senate should wait until the so-called global tobacco settlement is enacted into law before funding the regulations, despite the fact that serious concerns have been raised that the settlement doesn't adequately protect the public health. Even if some version of the settlement is approved, it will not be in time for the current budget cycle. In addition, 33 of the State attorneys general who negotiated the settlement support the $34 million funding level. 
Each day we delay in funding the FDA regulations, 3,000 new smokers between the ages of 12 and 17 will take up smoking--or 1 million a year. 
According to a spring 1996 survey conducted by the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research, the prevalence of youth tobacco use in America has been on the increase over the last 5 years. It rose by nearly 50 percent among 8th and 10th graders, and by nearly 20 percent among high school seniors between 1991 and 1996. 
When children are hooked on cigarette smoking at a young age, it is especially hard for them to quit. Ninety percent of current adult smokers began to smoke before they reached the age of 18. Ninety-five percent of teenage smokers say they intend to quit in the near future--but only a quarter of them will actually do so within the first 8 years of beginning to smoke. 
Tobacco companies have known this fact for years--and used it cynically to their advantage. Many experts believe that if the industry cannot persuade children to take up smoking, the industry will collapse within a generation. 
That's why `Big Tobacco' targets children with billions of dollars in advertising and promotional giveaways, promising popularity, excitement, and success for those who take up smoking. 
Because of these marketing practices, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 5 million of today's children will die prematurely from smoking-caused illnesses. 
In addition, the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University has found that smoking is a gateway to the use of illegal drugs. Children between the ages of 12 and 17 who smoke are 12 times more likely to use heroin and 19 times more likely to use cocaine than nonsmokers. The younger a person begins to use tobacco, the higher the likelihood of regular drug use as adults. 
By providing the full $34 million that President Clinton requested to implement photo I.D. checks for the purchase of tobacco products by anyone under the age of 27, the Senate can make an important difference in reducing tobacco use among the Nation's youth. 
The additional Federal funds in the Harkin amendment to enforce the FDA tobacco regulations are clearly needed, and I urge the Senate to approve the amendment. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Jeffords and Senator Frist as a sponsor of the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1997. This bipartisan legislation looks to the future by strengthening our national commitment to research and development. It also ensures the continued success of NSF's teacher training and professional development programs. In addition, it will improve science and math education from kindergarten to graduate school, and maintain America's competitive edge into the 21st century. 
Few Federal agencies deliver as much bang for the buck as the National Science Foundation. The NSF funds 19,000 peer-reviewed science and education projects at more than 2,000 colleges, universities, schools, businesses, and research facilities in the United States. 
NSF accounts for only 4 percent of total Federal research and development funding, yet it provides 25 percent of basic research support at academic institutions, and as much as half of all Federal funding for research in fields such as mathematics, computer science, environmental science, and the social sciences. 
The NSF also plays an important role in training teachers and developing math and science curricula to prepare students for tomorrow's challenges. It has promoted innovative education programs in partnership with colleges, universities, elementary and secondary schools, science museums, and state and local governments. These programs encourage the discovery of new knowledge and its application to real-world problems. 
NSF support for basic research and science education has played an important role in encouraging economic growth over the last 50 years. According to a recent study, each dollar that the Federal Government has spent on basic research has contributed 50 cents or more to the national output. These economic benefits are spread throughout the economy, enhancing the productivity of the Nation's work force and improving the quality of life of all Americans. 
At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for example, NSF funds have encouraged scientists to explore the commercial applications of their research. Technology developed at MIT had a role in the launching of 13 companies in 1995. They manufacture products ranging from computer chips to communication networks. These enterprises have bolstered the State and local economies, and provided jobs and opportunities for many citizens. 
In Massachusetts, the National Science Foundation is funding a wide range of projects on the cutting edge of research. NSF grants have been instrumental in building the State's biotechnology industry, mapping the oceans at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, developing new superconductors at Harvard University's Material Research Science and Education Center, and fostering cooperative partnerships with schools, parents, businesses, and community organizations to strengthen math and science education programs. 
Nationwide, NSF grants also cover a broad range of projects from health care to crime-fighting to protecting the environment. Specific grants are improving the treatment of arrythmia, facilitating the accurate identification of crime suspects, developing new biotechnology techniques to clean hazardous waste sites, and analyzing an Antarctic meteorite to determine whether or not life existed on Mars. 
NSF funds benefit the humanities as well. The Next Generation Internet project will give researchers access to information from the world's libraries and museums at rates that are 100 to 1,000 times faster than today's Internet. 
Recent budget projections by the American Association for the Advancement of Science paint a bleak picture for future funding of research and development. Discretionary spending, which funds all R&D programs including NSF grant support, is expected to shrink from one-sixth to one-seventh of the Federal budget by the year 2000. As a result, funds for NSF research and development will likely face reductions of 18 percent. At the same time, Germany, Japan, and France are projected to begin to overtake the United States in R&D expenditures. These developments will jeopardize America's leadership in science and technology as the 21st century approaches. 
The impact of these cuts will be felt heavily in Massachusetts, which ranks third among States in NSF funding. Nearly 1,400 projects at over 140 sites in Massachusetts are funded at more than $224 million annually, and an 18-percent decrease in grant support would adversely affect students, scientists, researchers, and citizens in all 50 States. 
The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1997 that we are sponsoring will place research and development on a more secure footing over the next 2 years. It will increase NSF funding by 7.2 percent in fiscal year 1998 and 3.7 percent in fiscal year 1999. The legislation also strengthens efforts to improve science, mathematics, engineering, and technology training for teachers and students, and will enable NSF to continue to play an important role in developing a faster and more powerful Internet. In addition, it authorizes the Office of Science and Technology Policy to prepare a report analyzing indirect costs, which play a vital but poorly understood part of Federal R&D spending. 
The National Science Foundation is doing an outstanding job of fulfilling their missions, and I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I give my strong support to Joel Klein's nomination to serve as Assistant Attorney General of the Antitrust Division at the Department of Justice. Mr. Klein's background and experience have prepared him well to serve the country in this capacity. 
After graduating magna cum laude from Columbia University and Harvard Law School, Mr. Klein served as a law clerk for both D.C. Circuit Judge David Bazelon and Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell. He later served with great distinction as a public interest lawyer, Deputy White House Counsel, and Principal Deputy of the Antitrust Division where he is now the Acting Assistant Attorney General. 
Mr. Klein's work in the Antitrust Division has earned wide praise. Leading economists, including two former Chief Economists of the Federal Communications Commission, believe that he will be an excellent Assistant Attorney General who is `dedicated to enforcing our antitrust laws and promoting competition in our economy.' Mr. Klein wins similar high praise from State and Federal officials and many members of the American Bar Association active in the Section of Antitrust Law. 
This praise is well deserved. Mr. Klein has won substantial criminal fines against large companies guilty of price-fixing. He has challenged anticompetitive practices and anticompetitive mergers that harm consumers. He has given new emphasis to antitrust enforcement overseas to help open more markets for U.S. businesses. 
I have had the opportunity to work closely with Mr. Klein on several issues, including a recent `East-West Initiative,' which brought together business leaders, government officials, and Republican and Democratic Senators from Massachusetts, North Carolina, Washington, Utah, and California to discuss cooperative efforts by government and business to help consumers. Mr. Klein's participation in this effort was key to its success, and I have the greatest respect for his ability and his commitment to public service. 
I urge the Senate to approve his nomination. His outstanding record makes him an excellent nominee for this position. I hope that the strong bipartisan support already expressed by many Senators on both sides of the aisle will lead to further cooperation in expediting action on other nominees for the Department of Justice, and for long overdue bipartisan action on judicial nominations as well.

 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, half a billion people throughout the world have disabilities, and 85 percent of them live in poverty. In many countries, disability can be a barrier to the many aspects of life that those of us without disabilities often take for granted. It has been 15 years since the United Nations World Programme of Action Concerning Disabled Persons was adopted to improve the lives of citizens with disabilities in their nations. As a result, many countries are responding to the United Nations challenge and doing more to help citizens with disabilities live fuller and more productive lives. 
In 1996, the World Committee on Disability, an organization dedicated to supporting the U.N. Programme, initiated an annual award named for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to honor nations that make significant progress toward meeting the United Nations goals. On September 15, 1996, the first FDR International Disability Award went to President Kim Young Sam of South Korea. The award is a bust of FDR and a $50,000 donation to a Korean non-governmental disability organization, and it recognizes South Korea's impressive strides in improving the lives of its citizens with disabilities. South Korea has taken steps to legislate needed protections and to provide physical and employment rehabilitation services. Buildings, education, and employment are being made accessible to those with disabilities. President Kim is also waging a public awareness campaign to involve more nondisabled South Koreans in the lives of those with disabilities. 
I commend South Korea for the progress it is making. The 1996 award is a great honor for that country, and an example for other nations. Already, President Kim has created a fellowship fund to provide assistance to 10 outstanding Koreans with disabilities each year, and other nations are following South Korea's leadership. 
This international award is also a reminder that there is still much more to do to ensure that persons with disabilities have the opportunity to become independent and productive citizens and lead fulfilling lives. I commend the World Committee on Disability for its leadership. I look forward to this year's award and to continuing to make worldwide progress on this extremely important issue.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I'm honored to be a sponsor of Senator Lautenberg's amendment to withhold 5 percent of United States assistance from any country which, in the future, violates the United Nations sanctions against Libya. 
It is nearly 9 years since December 1988, when Pan Am flight 103 was bombed out of the sky over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people, including 189 Americans. In 1991, after an extensive international investigation, two Libyans were indicted for that terrorist bombing, but they have never been brought to trial because the Government of Libya continues to defy the international community. 
United Nations sanctions against Libya were first adopted in 1992. These sanctions prohibit international flights to and from Libya, the supply to Libya of aircraft, aircraft parts, military equipment and certain oil equipment. They also freeze funds of the Libyan Government and reduce the size of Libyan diplomatic missions abroad. 
It is obvious that the current sanctions are too mild to bring about the surrender of the suspects by Libya. Senator Lautenberg and I, and many of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle, have repeatedly called for stronger sanctions, including an international oil embargo against Libya, because additional sanctions are clearly necessary to achieve their goal and see that justice is done. Regrettably, many of our European allies buy Libyan oil, and have been unwilling to take this step. 
Even the current mild sanctions against Libya are not being enforced. According to the Department of State, numerous violations of the sanctions have occurred. But when the United States brings such cases to the attention of the sanctions committee at the United Nations, the committee refuses to investigate them. 
Recently, for example, the United States provided evidence to the Security Council sanctions committee, involving attempts by Libya to import aircraft parts, via Belgrade, in violation of the U.N. sanctions. The sanctions committee refused to investigate this violation. 
There have also been several instances in which other countries have permitted Libyan planes to land in their territory, despite the U.N. prohibition on such landings. 
If there are no consequences for violating the U.N. sanctions then the sanctions are useless. If the United Nations is unwilling to enforce its own sanctions, the United States is left with no other choice but to impose unilateral measures. 
In this unsatisfactory situation, the Lautenberg amendment is a modest but necessary step for the United States to take. Its provisions are not retroactive, but it puts other countries on notice for the future. If they violate the U.N. sanctions against Libya, their action will cost them part of the U.S. aid they receive. 
I urge the Senate to approve the amendment, and to take this reasonable step to see that justice is done for the victims of the Pan Am flight 103 terrorist atrocity.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this opportunity to recognize the impressive accomplishments of students at Chatham High School in Massachusetts. A team of these students excelled recently against other teams representing schools in all 50 States and the District of Columbia in the nationwide finals of the `We the People.* * * The Citizen and the Constitution' competition. This talented and knowledgeable group of students demonstrated their expertise on the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and were recognized above other teams for their superior knowledge on this topic. 
These issues are at the heart of our democracy and our constitutional system of government. It is gratifying that so many students across the country are learning about these issues at an early age. 
The Bill of Rights, in particular, teaches important values about individual freedom and responsibility, and is the basis for our most precious liberties. 
The students at Chatham High School deserve great credit for their achievement. I commend them for their skill and dedication. Massachusetts is so proud of them all--Heather Baker, Taylor Brown, Jonathan Buck, Lauren D'Elia, Hannah Farnham, Casey Jordan, Joshua Lamoureux, Jill Matteson, Nathan Miller, Allison Morris, Nalinee Murphy, Douglas Smith-Elion, Rebecca Spencer, and Joseph Thonus. Also, I commend the superb leadership of their teacher, Tom Flaherty.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to be a sponsor of this 5-year reauthorization of the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities. I commend Chairman Jeffords for his leadership in support of these two important Endowments. We intend to do all we can to support them and keep them active because of their well-known success in enhancing the cultural life of the Nation. 
The arts and humanities have, and deserve to have, a central role in the life of America. The National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities have contributed immensely to that role. They encourage the growth and development of the arts and humanities in communities across the Nation, giving new emphasis and vitality to American creativity and scholarship, and to the cultural diversity that is one of America's greatest strengths. 
Americans have a great deal to celebrate--and also to learn--about our extraordinary cultural traditions, our complex modern society, and our country's many possibilities for the future. The arts and humanities are essential parts of this experience. If we shortchange the arts and humanities, we shortchange America itself. 
There are critics who continue to seek the elimination of the Endowments--despite the fact that the American people themselves want the arts to be an active and significant part of their lives, and despite the recognized need for greater support to enable people from all walks of life to have realistic opportunities to enjoy America's artistic and scholarly traditions and innovations. 
Unfortunately, the critics gained undeserved strength with the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994. The Arts Endowment is currently under intense ideological attack by Republican leaders in the House of Representatives who are bent on eliminating the agency. 
One of the few gratifying aspects of the current debate is the outrage the House assault has created in communities across the country. As last week's 217 to 216 vote demonstrated, the House Republican leadership was forced into an embarrassing public display of arm-twisting to salvage its untenable position. The reason is obvious. Angry citizens are contacting Congress. Editorials and opinion pieces supporting the Endowment are proliferating in newspapers large and small across the country, labeling this threat for what it is--a frontal assault on the arts in America. 
These citizens and these communities understand the importance and the success of the Arts Endowment. As a result of its leadership over the past three decades, the country now has double the number of community orchestras, 11 times the number of community dance companies, and 50 times the number of community arts agencies. Clearly, the crass Republican attempt to mug the Arts Endowment is doomed to fail. I am confident that sanity will return to the House of Representatives before the debate is ultimately over. There is simply too much at stake. 
The arts and humanities are vital and essential parts of our national experience, and Congress has an obligation to ensure that they are more accessible, not less accessible, to all Americans in every community. 
The current legislation which we introduce today to reauthorize the Endowments is well designed to increase access to arts programs and cultural programs in underserved communities and areas that do not yet have such access on a regular or widespread basis, but that would be greatly enriched by these programs. 
In addition, under the legislation, arts education grants will provide funds to make the arts more accessible in schools, where they are increasingly becoming an effective way to strengthen education. Young people deserve to have music, theater, dance, poetry, and the other arts as basic parts of their school years. These investments in students and schools will bring major long-term benefits to the nation. 
Students receive short-term benefits too. According to a recent study, high school students who took an arts course in each year of high school scored 59 points higher on the verbal portion of the SAT and 44 points higher on the math portion than students with no courses in the arts. 
Unfortunately, in spite of these obvious and very tangible benefits, the arts and humanities must now exist in an environment where there are fewer public dollars and greater competition for private support. Adequate Federal funding for the Endowments is more important than ever. Our bill, therefore, authorizes $175 million for the Arts Endowment and $175 million for the Humanities Endowment for the next fiscal year, compared to appropriations of $99.5 million for the Arts Endowment and $110 million for the Humanities Endowment in the current fiscal year. Authorizations for the following 4 fiscal years are open-ended; our bill specifies `such sums as may be necessary.' 
President Kennedy understood the importance of the arts in our daily lives. As he said in 1963: 
I look forward to an America which will reward achievement in the arts as we reward achievement in business or statecraft. I look forward to an American which will steadily raise the standard of artistic accomplishment and which will steadily enlarge cultural opportunities for all of our citizens. And I look forward to an America which commands respect throughout the world not only for its strength but also for its civilization as well. 
Preserving and supporting the Arts and Humanities Endowments are among one of the most important and effective ways that Congress can help to make this vision a reality. 
Throughout history, governments have recognized their responsibility to support and encourage the arts and humanities. In times of rapid change, it is particularly important for us to find effective ways to celebrate our common American community and our shared cultural heritage and values. 
Again, I commend Chairman Jeffords for his commitment to the Endowments. This legislation deserves broad bipartisan support in Congress, and I look forward to its enactment.

Mr. President, the matter that is before us is of importance, and I know we all want to continue the discussion on our defense authorization bill, but there is another matter that is also under consideration as we are meeting here this morning, and that is the reconciliation, the proposal to bring together those elements of the House and Senate bills that will relate to the economy and relate to child health, education, Medicare, and other matters that really define where we are going as a country over the period of the next 5 years. And as we are getting into that particular issue, I want to address one other item that is not unrelated to that and is related to the issues of fairness in our economy and fairness in our society.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my amendment would authorize an additional $5 million for the DOD's Counter-Terrorism Technical Support Program, to fund the development of facial recognition access control technology. FRAC technology is an innovative means of positively identifying individuals, either singularly or in a crowd, for a range of security purposes. The Eigenface method of facial recognition is the core technology of a new system that quickly recognizes and identifies a person by capturing his or her face on a quickly scanning camera. This new biometric identification method computes in each face a characteristic set of component images, or Eigenfaces, which can be used to positively identify an individual. 
This rapid-scanning capability is superior to traditional ID cards, authorization keypads, palm readers, and most retinal scanners. Unlike conventional systems, it can scan a crowd and pick out individual faces, rather than require individuals to position themselves before a scanner. It is perfect for use at airports, border crossings, or wherever large numbers of people pass through for entry and time-consuming identification procedures are not practical. This technology will support the counter-terrorism effort the Congress established last year, addressing one of the most pressing national security threats we face.

Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to thank the Senator from New Hampshire for his support of this important funding. The technology is inexpensive, well-understood, and uses off-the-shelf-equipment. The Defense Department, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Department of Justice have all acknowledged the potential benefit of Eigenface identification systems for their security needs. I am grateful for your support of the important provision. 
I also want to mention that the source of the offset for this funding increase is $5 million provided for travel and transportation of personnel in the Army's Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation account. This reduction brings the account down to the same level provided in fiscal year 1997. All of the other services have requested and been provided the same level of funding for this function in fiscal year 1998 as they were provided in fiscal year 1997.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, we renew the battle for a fair minimum wage. Last year, after an unacceptable lag of 5 years, Congress enacted legislation to raise the minimum wage, which had shamefully been allowed to fall below acceptable levels and was no longer a living wage for the 10 million Americans who rely on it for their income. 
We all remember the battle in the last Congress. For over 18 months, Republican Senators, newly in the majority, stalled action on any increase. The irresponsibility and unfairness of that obstruction became increasingly obvious, and the opponents became increasingly nervous about their position. Public support for a fair increase in the minimum wage finally became overwhelming. As the 1996 elections came closer, the obstructionists surrendered--and a fair two-step increase was signed into law by President Clinton last August. Under that legislation, the minimum wage rose from $4.25 an hour to $4.75 an hour on October 1, 1996, and it will rise to $5.15 an hour on September 1 this year. 
Current law stops there. No further increases will take effect unless Congress acts again. It is time for us to do so now, in order to guarantee that further fair increases take place in the years ahead. 
Today, therefore, I am introducing legislation to provide increases of 50 cents an hour in each of the next 3 years and increases of 30 cents an hour in each of the following 2 years--to $5.65 an hour on September 1, 1998, to $6.15 an hour on September 1, 1999, to $6.65 an hour on September 1, 2000, to $6.95 an hour on September 1, 2001, and to $7.25 an hour on September 1, 2002. 
At a time when Congress is making many other decisions on taxing and spending over the next 5 years, it is entirely appropriate that we act on the minimum wage over the 5-year budget period, too. 
The increases I am proposing are based on a simple principle. Intense Republican opposition to raising the minimum wage during the 8 years of the Reagan administration, and periodic opposition during the past 7 years, have left the real value of the minimum wage far below the levels it had in the previous 40 years. The bill introduced today will restore the purchasing power of the minimum wage to the level it had when the Reagan administration came to power. 
The experience with the 50-cent increase that went into effect for the minimum wage last October refutes the doomsday predictions that opponents have always raised whenever Congress considers a fair increase. A study released today by the Economic Policy Institute sums up the experience of the past 9 months. As the title of the study states, `The Sky Hasn't Fallen' because of the increase. 
The study documents several clear facts about last year's increase: It raised wages for 4 million workers; 66 percent of these are adults, and 58 percent are women. 
Some 40 percent of the increase went to families in the bottom 20 percent of the income scale, whose earnings average $14,000 a year; 55 percent of the increase went to families in the bottom 40 percent of the income scale, who earn $30,000 a year or less. 
Contrary to opponents' claims, the increase did not primarily go to teenagers in part-time jobs after school. 
There was no significant effect on employment of adults, minorities, teenagers or anyone else. The crocodile tears shed for these groups by opponents of the minimum wage have no basis in fact. 
The bottom line is clear. Employment does not go down because the minimum wage goes up. The overall conditions of the economy determine the levels of employment for all sectors of the work force. Reasonable increases in the minimum wage have no significant effect on these levels. 
Even the Wall Street Journal threw in the towel, and it did so soon after the increase last October took effect. An article published on November 20, 1996 was headlined `Fears Over Raising the Minimum Wage Appear Unfounded.' And the facts since then have amply verified that statement. 
Raising the minimum wage was the right thing for Congress to do last year, and it's the right thing for Congress to do this year. No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty. Everyone who works for a living deserves a living wage. I urge the Senate and the House to act expeditiously on the legislation I am introducing today.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly urge the Senate to support the amendment offered by Senator Murray. This provision would take the long overdue step of repealing the current ban on privately funded abortions at U.S. military facilities abroad. This measure will ensure that women in the Armed Forces serving overseas can exercise their constitutionally guaranteed right to choose safe abortion services. 
This is an issue of fairness to the women who make significant sacrifices to serve the Nation. They are assigned to military bases around the world to protect our freedoms, and they serve with great distinction. But when they get there, they are denied access to the kind of medical care available to all women in the United States. Military women should be able to depend on their base hospitals for all their medical services. This amendment gives them access to the same range and quality of health care services that they could obtain in the United States. 
It is not fair for Congress to force women who serve the Nation overseas to face the choice of accepting medical care that may be below the quality they can obtain in the United States, or else returning to the United States for care in a nonmilitary facility. Without a sufficient level of care, abortion can be a life-threatening or permanently disabling procedure. This danger is an unacceptable burden for us to impose on the Nation's servicewomen. 
Congress has a responsibility to provide safe options in these situations. Opponents of this amendment are exposing servicewomen to substantial risks of infection, illness, infertility, and even death. The amendment does not ask that these procedures be paid for with Federal funds. It simply asks that the appropriate care be made available. It is the only responsible thing to do. 
In addition to the health risks of the current policy, there is a significant financial penalty on servicewomen and their families who have arrived at the difficult conclusion to seek an abortion. The cost of returning to the United States from far-off bases in other parts of the world to obtain adequate health care can often involve significant financial hardship for young enlisted women. Yet, this is a cost that servicewomen based in the United States do not have to bear, since nonmilitary facilities are readily available. 
If our military personnel do not have the financial means to travel privately to the United States for an abortion, they will face significant delays waiting for military transportation. The health risks increase each week, and if the delays in military flights are long, the women may well be forced to rely on questionable medical facilities in their host countries. As a practical matter, women in uniform are being denied their constitutionally protected right to choose. 
A women's decision on abortion is a very difficult and extremely personal one. It is unfair to increase the burden on the women who proudly serve our country overseas. 
Every woman in America has a constitutionally guaranteed right to choose to terminate her pregnancy. It is time for Congress to stop denying this right to military women serving abroad. It is time for Congress to stop treating these women as second-class citizens. I urge the Senate to support the Murray amendment and end this flagrant injustice under current law.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend President Clinton for his impressive Presidential initiative on race, which he announced in his recent commencement address at the University of California, San Diego. 
This initiative combines constructive dialog, study and action. It carries forward the President's longstanding concern that the country must remain One America, and that all Americans must have an opportunity to share in the American dream. 
Too often, the race issue is used as a wedge to divide America. 
President Clinton's goal is to unite America by examining where we have been, and where we need to go, in order to achieve lasting racial reconciliation. President Clinton correctly recognizes that our Nation's diversity is our greatest strength, and that we must improve the ability of all Americans to realize their full potential. 
Civil rights is still the unfinished business of America. We have come a long way toward the goal of equal justice and opportunity. But as the church arson epidemic, the Texaco debacle, the O.J. Simpson trial and the Good Ol' Boys Roundup demonstrate, we are not there yet. 
Incredibly, there appear to be some who believe that discrimination is a thing of the past, and that the playing field is now level for women, for people of color, and for other victims of discrimination. The facts clearly belie this claim. 
The unemployment rate for African-Americans is twice that of whites. Women still earn only 72 percent as much as men. 
The average income of a Latina woman with a college degree is far less than that of a white man with a high school degree. The Glass Ceiling Commission reported that 97 percent of the top executive positions in Fortune 500 companies are held by white men, although they are just 43 percent of the work force. In the Nation's largest companies, only 1 percent--1 percent--of senior management positions are held by Latinos or African-Americans. 
Hate crimes continue to occur at alarming rates. 
The scales of justice are supposed to be blind, but these figures demonstrate that race and gender discrimination are distorting the balance. 
Yet, there are those who want to eliminate all affirmative action programs, claiming that they have outlived their usefulness. It's time to dispel the barrage of misinformation about affirmative action. 
Affirmative action is not about promoting or hiring unqualified women and minorities, admitting unqualified students, or awarding contracts to unqualified businesses. 
Affirmative action has clearly worked in the Armed Forces. Does anybody doubt the qualifications of Gen. Colin Powell? 
Affirmative action has clearly worked in education. College admissions practices that allow universities to consider race as a factor--not the main factor or the controlling factor--have a positive impact on the ability of minorities to escape the cycle of poverty through education. 
The overwhelming majority of educators feel that colleges and universities are failing in their mission if they ignore the diversity that is the essence of the American experience. 
Done right, affirmative action works. President Clinton's impressive and exhaustive review concluded that affirmative action is still an effective tool to expand economic and educational opportunities, and to combat bigotry, exclusion and ignorance. I strongly support President Clinton's `mend it, don't end it' prescription for affirmative action. 
There has always been bipartisan support for affirmative action. From President Kennedy to President Nixon to President Clinton, there has been bipartisan support in the White House and Congress, because no one can say with a straight face that the playing field is level for women and minorities. 
In addition, President Clinton's nomination of Bill Lee to head the Civil Rights Division is also significant step in ensuring equal justice for all Americans. Bill Lee has dedicated his entire career to finding real-life solutions to real life problems of discrimination. The son of Chinese immigrants, Bill Lee grew up dirt poor in New York City. His parents operated a laundry in a poor section of New York. Bill Lee and his family suffered discrimination first hand, and know how it feels to be taunted and excluded simply because of one's appearance. 
But he overcame their barriers and graduated from Yale University and Columbia Law School with honors. 
For the past 22 years, he has worked on behalf of all victims of discrimination --African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, women, and the poor. He has won remedies that have aided them financially, and given them hope that they too can be part of America. 
His ability to forge consensus has earned him the respect of all Americans. Republicans and Democrats alike, including Mayor Richard Riordan, and Senators Warner and Thurmond, have written letters of support on his behalf. I hope that he will be confirmed expeditiously so that he can help lead the effort to ensure that civil rights guarantees do not remain hollow promises. 
The issue of discrimination is too important to become a political football in Congress. As we continue the discussion of race and gender, I urge my colleagues to support President Clinton's initiative, and continue the tradition of bipartisan support that has served this country well in recent decades. Our goal is still to guarantee equal opportunity for all Americans. Let us be sure that when we say `all,' we mean `all.'

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this week the House of Representatives will take up the Department of Interior appropriations bill, which includes funding for the National Endowment for the Arts. 
It will be a watershed debate in Congress, because Republican extremists in the House are trying to eliminate Federal support for this important agency. The House Appropriations Committee has recommended only $10 million for the Endowment, and these funds would be used only to phase out the agency. The misguided Republican goal is to eliminate direct Federal support for music, dance, symphonies, and other arts in communities across America. 
The Republican position is so weak on the merits that the House leadership is attempting to use the parliamentary rules to block an up-or-down vote on the merits of this important issue. 
Clearly, this unacceptable attack on the Arts Endowment deserves to be rejected. The Endowment has raised the quality of the arts in America. It has also strengthened support for the arts and interest in the arts by Americans in all walks of life in cities, towns, and villages in all parts of America. 
For example, under the Endowment's tenure the number of orchestras in America has doubled and the number of dance companies has increased tenfold. Other arts have witnessed similar expansions and earned broad public approval.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to and will speak briefly on an issue that I think is of significance and importance as we are addressing the defense authorization bill, and that is the amendment of the Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar. 
I urge that the Senate support his amendment to restore the cuts made in the Nunn-Lugar cooperative threat reduction programs in the Department of Defense and related nuclear material security programs in the Department of Energy. The funds spent on these programs are the most important cost-effective contribution to our national security that we can make. 
Today, and for the foreseeable future, the greatest threat to national security involves potential terrorist acts using weapons of mass destruction. And it is ironic that after living for 40 years under the specter of a cold war nuclear holocaust, the prospect of a nuclear explosion taking place within the United States has actually increased since the dissolution of the former Soviet Union. This is the ominous view of both the intelligence community and the Department of Defense. Any defense bill we enact must deal responsibly with this threat. 
We have taken significant steps to do so in recent years. In 1991, Senator Nunn and Senator Lugar initiated the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. The basic concept of that program and the nuclear materials safety programs at the Department of Energy is that paying for the destruction and safeguarding of nuclear weapons in the states of the former Soviet Union increases the security of America itself. 
The accomplishments of these programs offer convincing evidence that the Nunn-Lugar program works. The Defense Department has already helped to fund the elimination of 6,000 nuclear warheads in nations of the former Soviet Union. Never again will these weapons threaten the United States. 
The funds for the Nunn-Lugar and related programs are the most cost-effective dollars spent in the entire defense budget. 
They support the complete destruction of nuclear weapons in the nations of the former Soviet Union. 
They strengthen border controls to prevent the illegal transport of nuclear bomb-making materials. 
They support efforts to protect these materials from theft at their storage sites or during transport. 
They provide employment and economic incentives for former Soviet weapons scientists to avoid the temptation that they will sell their know-how to buyers from nations and organizations that support international terrorism. 
They fund cooperative efforts to match U.S. commercial applications with the Russian defense industry. 
Since these programs began, Congress has fully funded the administration's budget requests until this year. The current committee bill reduces the President's request by $135 million. The bill takes $60 million from the Defense Department's Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, which the department intended to use to help Ukraine destroy its SS-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles. 
We specifically encouraged the new Government of Ukraine to take this step because these missiles pose a clear and present danger to our national security. It is a costly operation, but few are more worthwhile. It is imperative that we maintain fully funded and well-structured programs to deal with all aspects of this serious threat. 
The initiatives undertaken in this area by the Department of Energy are equally essential. The International Nuclear Safety Program upgrades safety devices on Chernobyl-era nuclear reactors. Yet, its funding has been cut by $50 million. 
The Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting Program supports efforts to identify and store the nuclear materials that are most likely to be stolen. Yet, its funding is cut by $25 million. 
Under these two programs, the Department of Energy has succeeded in making tons of nuclear weapons materials secure, primarily plutonium and highly enriched uranium. Previously, these materials had not been protected by even the most elementary security precautions. These materials posed grave threats to our national security, and they still do. 
Alarming public reports in recent years have mentioned cases where nuclear materials were intercepted at border crossings. We can only wonder how many shipments have gone undetected at border crossings and whether terrorists even now have custody of these materials. 
The National Research Council released a report this spring on U.S. proliferation policy and the former Soviet Union. Its first and strongest recommendation is full funding for the Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting Program. 
The report goes on to express strong support for the overall Departments of Defense and Energy CTR Programs. But the 
material protection program was specifically singled out as the most important area for additional funding. 
The reason is clear. Bomb-grade nuclear weapon material poses so great a threat to national security that the United States should do all we can to work with Russia to guarantee these materials are safely stored--no ifs, ands, or buts. There is no margin for error, none whatsoever. 
The design and manufacture of a crude homemade nuclear weapon is a relatively easy task if the needed uranium or plutonium is available. It takes just 10 pounds of plutonium--about a single handful--to utterly destroy any American city. 
Without a major ongoing effort to identify, catalog, transport, store, and eventually reprocess or destroy Russia's nuclear material, it is just a matter of time before some terrorist group becomes a nuclear power. That is why these programs are so important. That is what restoring these funds is all about. The last thing we need is to look the other way as the next Timothy McVeigh prepares to destroy an entire American city. 
Over the years we have spent billions of dollars building our nuclear weapons and implementing strategies to prevent nuclear war. Now when a relatively small sum of money can deal with this current threat, how can we afford not to? If a terrorist explodes a nuclear weapon in the United States, we may well never know who to retaliate against. 
It may already be too late. But we hope and pray it is not. We must do more--much more--to see that the current loose controls over nuclear weapons and bomb-making materials in the nations of the former Soviet Union do not result in a nuclear terrorist attack on the United States or any other nation. 
There will be no comfort in saying the morning after, `If only we had done more.' Now is the time to do more. Restoring these funds is the indispensable first step toward doing more, doing it, and doing it as soon as possible. 
I commend the Senator from Indiana for his leadership on this issue. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing two important education bills on behalf of Secretary Riley and the administration. One is designed to meet the changing needs of students in vocational education programs. The other outlines a comprehensive strategy for enhancing adult education and literacy services. Creating effective educational opportunities for these two student populations is essential if we are to make the American dream a reality for all our citizens. 
The Career Preparation Education Reform Act restructures Perkins Act programs to promote student achievement in academic and technical skills. Only with both a strong academic background and training in an employable skill will students be fully prepared to compete in the 21st-century job market. Recognizing this core principle, the legislation supports broad-based career preparation education which meets high academic standards and links vocational education with wider educational reform efforts. It encourages learning in both classroom and workplace settings. This proposal also contains strong accountability provisions to ensure that local programs are actually achieving these goals. 
The Adult Basic Education and Literacy for the Twenty-First Century Act recognizes that adult education is an integral component of our work force development system. Nearly 27 percent of the adult population has not earned a high school diploma or its equivalent. Their chances for career success are increasingly limited. Adult education programs open doors for those who successfully participate in them. They help participants to advance in the working world and to fully participate in every aspect of community life. This legislation streamlines existing adult education and literacy programs to maximize both access to educational opportunities and to enhance the quality of services. It seeks to target resources on those areas where the greatest need exists. 
One of the highest priorities for the Labor and Human Resources Committee this year is the development of a comprehensive work force development strategy for our Nation. Effective vocational education and adult education programs must be major components of such a plan. These innovative proposals put forth by Secretary Riley should help us to achieve that goal.

 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as Congress considers an increase in the Federal cigarette tax in the budget reconciliation bill, I urge my coleagues to read an excellent article by economists Michael Grossman and Frank J. Chaloupka, both of whom have written extensively on the impact of tobacco taxes on teenage smoking. 
The article is entitled `Cigarette Taxes: The Straw to Break the Camel's Back,' and is published in the July/August 1997 edition of Public Health Reports. It finds that raising tobacco taxes would be a powerful weapon against youth smoking, since children have less income to spend on cigarettes than adults. According to Grossman and Chaloupka, the 43 cents per pack cigarette tax increase in the legislation that Senator Hatch and I introduced earlier this year would reduce teenage smoking by 16 percent, saving the lives of over 830,000 children. In addition, the proceeds from the tobacco tax increase would be used to provide health insurance for millions of American children who are uninsured today.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment adds $12 billion to the child health insurance program. It is financed by an additional 23-cents-a-pack increase in the tobacco tax. This amount is necessary to ensure that all children not eligible for Medicare, but not able to afford private insurance, will have access the health coverage. 
CBO says that the current bill, a proposal that is before the Senate, will not do the job. The administration strongly supports the amendment. So do 72 percent of the American people. 
I will just take 15 seconds to read a letter from the American Academy of Pediatrics: 
53,000 primary care pediatricians, pediatric medical subspecialists, pediatric surgeons and specialists dedicated to the health, safety, and well-being of infants, children, adolescents and young adults strongly support your amendment to increase the tax by 23 cents for use in financing the children's health care legislation. 
I hope that with this amendment we will be able to complete the job for working families in this country that are unable to afford insurance today.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Republican leadership has been willing to accept a tobacco tax which the Republican leadership said was going to violate the budget agreement which the President previously supported. Now the President and the Republican leadership have accepted a 20 cent tobacco tax. The only trouble with the Senator from Oklahoma's mathematics is he does not include the $14 billion that they were instructed to reduce Medicaid. 
So, this is necessary, according to the Republican's own CBO. This is necessary to cover insurance. Let's turn our backs on big tobacco and put our faith in little children. 
Mr. President, this amendment reduces the deficit, and I move to waive the Budget Act.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose this bill, and I hope that it will be vetoed by the President if it emerges from the House-Senate conference in this unacceptable form. The last thing the American people need is a trickle-down tax relief bill that offers plums to the wealthiest individuals and corporations in our society, and crumbs for everyone else. 
Clearly, we need to give tax relief to families, we need to encourage investment in education, we need to encourage investment in small businesses, we need to grant relief from the hardships that are sometimes caused by the estate tax. 
The Republican plan takes each of these legitimate points and misuses them as excuses to give enormous tax cuts to the well-heeled and the powerful and it does so as far as the eye can see. This plan violates the fundamental principles that any tax bill must meet: tax fairness and fiscal responsibility. 
The Republican bill claims that it will give fair tax relief to families, but the Republican child credit is designed to exclude large numbers of low- and middle-income working families. Forty-seven percent of all American children would not be eligible for the child credit under the Republican proposal. An additional 8 million children would be eligible for only a partial benefit. Clearly, the Republicans have gerrymandered their credit to save money by denying it to as many working families as possible. Yet these are the families who need help the most. Our Democratic proposal offers all of these families an honest tax break. The Republican proposal is a let them eat cake tax break. 
I also oppose the education provisions of the Republican bill because they are skewed toward the highest income taxpayers. These Republican provisions clearly violate the firm commitment made under the budget agreement on tax benefits for higher education. The letter signed by Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott specifically states that tax relief of `roughly $35 billion' will be provided over 5 years for post-secondary education, and that the education tax package `should be consistent with the objectives put forward in the HOPE scholarship and tuition tax proposals contained in the administration's fiscal year 1998 budget to assist middle-class parents.' 
The administration's proposal had two goals: to help middle-class families during the critical years while students are in college, and to encourage lifelong learning. Students and families across the Nation are concerned about escalating tuition, and this bill does not do enough to help them. 
The Republican bill is flawed in another major respect in this area--it utterly fails to address the need to help workers expand their skills and education. We need to give a real benefit to teachers, nurses, auto mechanics, and all others in jobs that need continual upgrading of skills. The workplace depends more and more on highly trained workers. To sustain a strong economy, we must invest in ongoing education throughout life. 
The bill also provides a disproportionate education benefit to high income families. It contains three separate provisions to encourage savings for college, at a total cost of over $7 billion over the next 5 years. Lower income families do not have the luxury to save as much as higher income families do, and will not be able to take advantage of these provisions. 
I also strongly support funding for crumbling schools. The deterioration of hundreds of schools across the United States is a disgrace. But the Republican bill provides only token help. It offers only Band-Aids to put over leaking roofs. 
Similarly, the massive capital gains tax breaks and massive estate tax breaks are also tilted heavily to the wealthy. Largely because of these provisions, more of the benefits of the Republican plan go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers than go to the bottom 60 percent of the taxpayers. Under the Republican plan those who are already well-off are given tens of billions of dollars in unwarranted tax breaks, while those who are struggling are ignored. 
Finally, the amount of the Republican tax cuts will explode in the years after 2002, and the deficit will increase enormously. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has estimated that the cost of the Republican proposal will increase by between $500 and $600 billion in the 10 years following the current budget period. It will be nearly impossible to balance the budget in those years if this Republican tax giveaway is enacted into law. 
The Republican plan is a Trojan horse for giving tax breaks to the wealthy. If we had no tax bill, it would be better than this trickle-down bill.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish my good friend and colleague from Montana had been on our side, and it would have been appropriate, obviously, for the other side to move ahead. But he made his decision and made his presentation, and now I would like to respond. 
Mr. President, I will have the opportunity later on this evening to talk about really where we are in terms of the child care program. 
The fact of the matter is that $16 billion that was put in the bill was suggested by the administration's proposal which had a $14 billion cut. The Finance Committee added $8 billion. I commend my colleague and friend, Senator Hatch, for making that effort and for making that fight. Without his efforts, that would not have taken place. So we are farther down the road than we were prior to the time of that particular markup. 
But the fact of the matter is--and later on this evening I will have a chance to talk about where we really are in terms of the funding that has been allocated for children and the number of children that still remain. I find it interesting that this provision that the members of the Finance Committee took and accepted deals with accelerated depreciation, deals with airline tickets, a small amount of EITC, and the child care. I find it interesting that the Finance Committee was willing to accept the cigarette tax but use it for those non-child-related issues, even though the Republican leadership had opposed our cigarette tax. 
I tried, with all respect, to understand this enormous sense of unity and deep moral commitment to this particular proposal when on its face it is difficult to really understand, given the fact that the originators of the tobacco tax were those Senators--Senator Hatch and myself--devoted toward addressing the needs of children in this country, the sons and daughters of working families who can't afford it. We got a part of it. But evidently the members of the Finance Committee swore in blood that depreciation on buildings as well as airline tickets was basically more important than the children. I am always interested in why that should be such a high moral issue and purpose. I have difficulty in understanding it. 
But, Mr. President, the issue today with the particular recommendation before the Senate is whether this proposal really meets the test of fairness for all Americans. That should be the test. Will this really be fair to the taxpayers in this country, or are we tipping the scales in a very important and special way to the wealthier individuals and corporations of this country? 
Senator Daschle has taken an enormous amount of time and painstaking diligence to fashion a proposal that fundamentally meets the agreement that was reached with the President in terms of what would be the tax adjustments. Senator Daschle has put forward a proposal that will be much fairer for all Americans. 
We sometimes rail in this body about how the particular proposal really is fairer and more just, but I do think in any fair examination the overwhelming evidence shows that the proposal of Senator Daschle is fairer to the working families of this country, and decisively so. This should to be the test. 
It is interesting, as we come closer and closer to the final conclusion, that the overwhelming majority of Americans understand this. Even prior to this debate on the various surveys--and I just saw this morning on the early morning shows--the American people understand the difference. They have not seen this debate or heard about this debate. They are out there working even while we are in the debate and discussion. But they understand fundamentally who is going to be on their side and who is going to be on the side of the working families. They are correct. 
Senator Daschle, I believe, deserves great credit for his leadership in offering to the Senate a proposal that is fairer for working families and for many Americans who have in too many instances been left out farther and farther behind in the period of the last 20 years. Sixty or sixty-five percent of Americans are farther behind and are working harder. Their family members are working harder, and they are working longer in terms of total hours of the week, in terms of families and just being able to keep their heads above water. The reason is the increase in the payroll taxes they have been paying, as described by my friend and colleague, 
Senator Wellstone. 
So we have an opportunity--one of the few opportunities that we have--for the 65 to 70 percent of the American families who have been working longer, who have really been the ones who have brought this economy back. We have a stronger economy today because working families have been out there working harder, longer, and smarter in terms of the American economy. They have benefited very little in terms of their own standard of living. 
We have an opportunity this afternoon and tomorrow to make some difference in that. The real issue is, are we going to make that kind of a commitment to those working families, whether it is on the child credit programs, or whether it is the education programs, or whether it is basically the overall rate programs, or whether we are going to reward the smaller enterprises that are going to be innovative and creative and expand employment by giving them some adjustment in terms of capital gains? Yes; and whether we are going to make sure that those who are going to get some break in terms of estate planning are going to be those who are going to continue to work the farms and be a part of the American primarily heartland of this nation in terms of producing the food and fiber which we eat. 
Those are the issues, Mr. President, and the issue is which way will the Senate of the United States go? Are we going to say to those 60 or 70 percent of the Americans, `We care about your kids, we care about education. We fashioned the particular program in terms of the HOPE scholarship, and we are going to arrange the other provisions of the Tax Code so that you have a better opportunity, middle-income families, lower-income families, with a modest expansion of the Pell provisions'? Are we going to do that? Our answer is yes, and the Daschle proposal does so. 
Are we going to really look out for the sons and daughters of working families? To Senator Daschle's credit, it is more expansive and more targeted in reaching the sons and daughters of working families. 
So, if we are talking about fairness, if we are talking about equity, if we are talking about how we are adjusting the various rates, including the children's tax credit and the payroll tax, and adjusting those in ways so that we are saying, `While you may not have been paying a great deal more out of your income tax, you surely are in terms of your payroll tax. We are going to provide some degree of relief.' 
So that is the issue. We need to understand that. We can all say, `We are for education.' However, you have to look at the proposal. Whose proposal really meets the central challenge that working families and middle-income families are facing in sending their kids to school? It is the Daschle proposal. Whose proposal really does the most in terms of the children? It is the Daschle proposal. Who does the most in terms of trying to make sure that we are going to provide important incentives to smaller, modest, middle-income families who are trying to get started with smaller new businesses by providing enhanced job opportunities? It is the Daschle proposal. 
So, Mr. President, I am just proud to support this proposal. It doesn't incorporate all of the kinds of factors that perhaps some of us would like to have. However, it is a serious and very important proposal that deserves the overwhelming support of the Members of this body. 
Let me just finally point this out: On the overall issue of tax equity, the Democratic alternative is clearly fairer. More of the benefits of the Republican plan go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers than go to the bottom 60 percent of taxpayers--13.1 percent versus 12.7 percent. 
In the Democratic alternative, only 1.4 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers and the top 20 percent of taxpayers only receive 20 percent of the benefits. The vast majority of the benefits go to taxpayers who have incomes in the middle 60 percent of the income distribution; 71 percent of the 
benefits. The Democratic alternative is vastly preferable to the regressive Republican bill because it is fairer to lower and middle-income taxpayers. 
Mr. President, this Republican proposal is going to give a green light to all those individuals who have been doing extremely well--extremely well in terms of the stock market. We have seen that go right up through the roof. But who has been out there making those stocks go up, making those businesses work? It is hard-working men and women. 
If we accept the Republican proposal, we are saying to all of those who have been able to make very substantial amounts of money that they are going to provide additional kinds of opportunities for them to be able to keep that money while we are saying to those who are working and have worked hard that you are going to get the crumbs. That is what the distribution issue is really all about. 
I am not the only one making these observations. We have seen the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimate that the cost of the Republican proposal will increase by between $500 and $600 million in the 10 years following the current budget period. 
I was 1 of 11 Senators who voted against the economic proposal in 1981 because we were going to balloon the deficit. Only 11 of us at that time voted against it. We are going to see the same kind of balloon now in the outyears. 
Who is going to be out here at that time to try to make those adjustments and make those changes when Members of the Senate are going to say, `Well, we had better close some of those tax loopholes?' You know what will happen. They will cut back further in education. They will cut further back in children's program. They will cut further back on day care support--on all of the programs that have been continually cut back, or at least attempted to be cut back, in these past 3 years. 
The Democratic alternative does not engage in these accounting tricks to balance the budget. The Democratic alternative is honest with the American people, fair to American taxpayers, and it deserves to be adopted. 
Republicans make many arguments in favor of their proposal, and many of their concerns are valid. The current system is not perfect. There are many things to improve. We need to give tax relief to families, we need to encourage investment in education, and we need to grant relief from the hardships that are sometimes caused by the estate tax. 
On all these general points, Republicans and Democrats agree. 
However, the Republican plan uses these arguments as excuses to give enormous tax cuts to the well-heeled and the powerful and it does so as far as the eye can see. It therefore violates the fundamental principles that any tax bill must meet: tax fairness and fiscal responsibility. 
The Democratic alternative, on the other hand, is true to both of these principles. It allocates the tax relief fairly among all income brackets. And it guarantees that the amount of the tax relief is responsible, so that we will have a balanced budget not only in the year 2002, but in the years after as well. 
Both, the Republican proposal and the Democratic alternative have a child tax credit. On their face, the two proposals appear similar. However, the Republican credit will not benefit lower and many middle income people, while the Democratic proposal will. The Republican proposal will not benefit families who do not earn enough income to claim the full credit. This cut-off applies not only to the extremely poor, but also to families earning up to $30,000 a year. 
Under the Democratic alternative, the credit is refundable against both income taxes and payroll taxes. Many more working families will be able to obtain the full benefit of the credit under the Democratic plan. This point is critical for those who earn less than $30,000 a year because their payroll taxes are larger then their income taxes. They deserve tax relief too. 
In addition, the Democratic tax credit for children has another significant advantage. It is calculated or stacked prior to the earned income tax credit. Under the Republican plan, the credit is stacked after the earned income tax credit. This means that the working poor who are eligible for the earned income tax credit many not be able to obtain the full benefit of both credits. 
If their income tax after taking the earned income tax credit is too small, then they will not benefit from the Republican child credit. 
The Democratic alternative will enable these working families to benefit from the child credit too. 47 percent of American children would not be eligible for the child credit under the Republicans proposal. An additional 8 million children would be eligible for only a partial benefit. Clearly, the Republicans have gerrymandered their credit to save money by denying it to as many working families as possible. 
Because the Democratic plan allows the credit to be offset against both payroll and income taxes, and allows families the full benefit of both the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, the Democratic plan will reach 7 million more children than the Republican proposal. 
In addition, the Republican child credit is not indexed for inflation. The effect of the credit will drop every year as inflation decreases its value. The Democratic alternative will index the child credit for inflation. We are serious about giving tax relief for families. The Republican proposal is designed to appear generous, but in reality it offers little to lower and middle income persons. Even those middle class and upper income families who receive the credit under the Republican version are better off in the long run under the Democratic version, because their credit is indexed for inflation as well. 
The Democratic plan is not welfare. If a family does not work, and does not pay any federal taxes, they will not get the benefit of the credit. 
The Democratic alternative gives the credit only to working families. It will help those who need this credit the most, the working poor. The Republican proposal will not help them at all. The Democratic alternative offers an honest tax break. The Republican proposal is a let-them-eat-cake tax break. 
The Democratic proposal also does a better job of encouraging investment in education. 
The education provisions of the Republican bill are skewed toward higher-income taxpayers. The bill provides only $20 billion for the HOPE scholarship and nothing at all for the tuition deduction. But it provides over $7 billion for other savings provisions that help higher income families. 
The bill's allocation of only $20 billion to HOPE scholarship falls far short of the commitment made under the budget agreement to provide $35 billion for tax benefits for higher education. The letter signed by Newt Gingrich and Trent Lott on the budget agreement specifically states that tax relief of roughly $35 billion will be provided over 5 years for post-secondary education, and that the education tax package should be consistent with the objectives put forward in the HOPE scholarship and tuition tax proposals contained in the Administration's fiscal year 1998 budget to assist middle-class parents. 
The administration's proposal had two goals: to help middle class families during the critical years while students are in college, and to encourage lifelong learning. 
Students and families across the nation are concerned about escalating tuition, and this bill does not do enough to help them. The Republican bill is flawed in other major respect in this area--it utterly fails to address the need to help workers expand their skills and education. 
The Daschle alternative addresses these problems. It provides a broader HOPE scholarship, and a valuable tuition tax credit for lifelong learning. This credit will enable taxpayers to recover 20 percent of their tuition costs up to a maximum of $10,000, for learning after the HOPE credit expires. This provision can give real benefit to teachers, nurses, auto mechanics and all others in jobs that need continual upgrading of skills. The workplace depends more and more on highly trained workers. To sustain a strong economy, we must invest in ongoing education throughout life. 
The bill also provides a disproportionate education benefit to high income families. It contains three separate provisions to encourage savings for college, at a total cost of over $7 billion over the next 5 years. Lower income families do not have the luxury to save as much as higher income families do, and will not be able to take advantage of these provisions. 
The Democratic alternative provides some additional benefits for students that are also in the bill, and I support these provisions. Specifically, I support the permanent extension of section 127, the provision for employer-provided tuition, including graduate students. I also support the elimination of the $150 million cap for institutions of higher education, and the restoration of the deduction of student loan interest. 
I also strongly support funding for crumbling schools. The deterioration of hundreds of schools across the United States is a disgrace. But this bill offers only a token help on this problem. This bill allocates only $360 million over 5 years by making changes in bond rules. The Democratic bill, on the contrary, will result in a real commitment to improving our schools. It also encourages States to allocate that money to school districts with the greatest needs. The Republican bill offers only band-aids to put over leaking roofs. The Democratic bill provides real relief for school districts to repair their crumbling schools. 
The Democratic bill provides for these benefits--the crumbling schools, the section 127 aid, the student loan interest--in addition to HOPE and a tuition tax credit. 
In contrast, the Republican bill provides the additional benefits by taking away from HOPE and eliminating a tuition tax break. It pits student against student, giving these additional benefits to some students only at the expense of students who could benefit from HOPE and the tuition credit. 
Investing in education is investment in the future. We must do more to help all needy students. The tax benefits need to be targeted to those who need them, and not wasted on those who can afford to save and pay for college on their own. 
The Democratic proposal also better addresses the problem with the current estate tax, without creating a give-away to the rich. 
In the current tax system, the estate tax often creates real hardships for families who have just lost a loved one. When the owner of a family business or farm dies, there can be a large estate tax bill at one of the worst times possible. There may well be many other expenses such as funeral costs and legal bills. The estate tax could force the family to sell the business or farm. 
Relief is appropriate in these situations, and the Democratic alternative provides it. There would be special estate tax treatment when 50 percent or more of an estate consists of a family business or farm. In these cases, the first $900,000 of the estate is exempt from estate tax, as long as the children or grandchildren continue to actively operate the business or farm for 10 years. 
The Democratic alternative is targeted to cases where families may not be able to easily liquidate their holdings to pay the tax. The Republican bill gives relief to all estates. Even if the estate is that of a rich person who invested in stocks and other investments which are easily liquidated, the Republicans still give tax relief. The problems that deserve to be addressed occur only in approximately 1.4 percent of all estates. Instead of extending justifiable relief to these 1.4 percent of estates, they extend relief to all estates. Clearly the Republicans are using rare cases of hardships for family farms and businesses as a fig leaf to cover a massive estate tax break for the wealthy. 
Finally, the 20-cent increase in the tobacco tax contained in this amendment is a critical element in tax fairness--and for achieving priority public health goals as well. I am pleased that it is not only a feature of this amendment but of the bill reported by the Finance Committee with a strong bipartisan vote. 
Tobacco is one of our most undertaxed industries. Even with the 20 cents per pack cigarette tax increase, the tobacco industry remains grossly undertaxed--whether the standard is historical tax levels, comparison to other countries, or the costs that smoking inflicts on our society and on non-smoking taxpayers. 
In 1965, Federal and State tobacco taxes accounted for 51 percent of the retail price of a pack of cigarettes. By 1996, the figure had fallen to just 31 percent. Even with the 20-cents per pack increase, the share of the cost of a pack of cigarettes going to federal and state taxes will be 39 percent--still far below the 1965 level. 
Raising the cigarette tax by 20 cents will being our tobacco taxes more in line with the rest of the industrialized world. Our current 24 cent per pack cigarette tax is one of the lowest among all industrialized nations--and it will still be one of the lowest, even with the 20 cent per pack increase in the bill. 
The costs that smoking inflicts on our society and on non-smoking taxpayers are immense. It kills more than 400,000 Americans a year. It costs the nation $50 billion a year in direct health costs, and another $50 billion in lost productivity. The average pack of cigarettes sells for $1.80 today--and it costs the nation $3.90 in smoking-related expenses. 
It is time that the tobacco companies paid a fairer share of these costs--and this bill is the time to start. Not only is a higher tax on tobacco products the fair thing to do, it is the most important single step we can take to stop the epidemic of youth smoking--an epidemic that will ultimately claim the lives of 5 million of today's children if we do nothing. One million young people between the ages of 12 and 17 take up this deadly habit every year--3,000 new smokers a day. The average smoker begins smoking at age 13, and becomes a daily smoker before age 15. Raising the tobacco tax by 20 cents a pack will save the lives of 400,000 of these children. The fact is that a twenty cent a pack increase is only a starting place. We should do more--much more. 
Eight billion dollars of the funds raised by the tobacco tax increase over the next 5 years are earmarked for children's health insurance. Here, too, we need to do more. Even with the combination of these funds and the $16 billion in the budget agreement, at least four and a half million uninsured children will still be left out and left behind. Without the tobacco tax funds, 6.7 million children will remain uninsured. A tobacco tax increase devoted to children's health is the right policy at the right time. 
These facts are bad enough. But the problem is growing worse. 
According to a Spring 1996 survey conducted by the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research, the prevalence of teenage smoking in America has been on the increase over the last five years. It rose by nearly one-half among eighth and tenth graders, and by nearly a fifth among high school seniors between 1991 and 1996. 
Once children are hooked on cigarette smoking at a young age, it becomes increasingly hard for them to quit. Ninety percent of current adult smokers began to smoke before they reached the age of 18. Ninety-five percent of teenage smokers say they intend to quit in the near future--but only a quarter of them will actually do so within the first eight years of beginning to smoke. 
If nothing is done to reverse this trend in adolescent smoking, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that five million of today's children will die prematurely from smoking-caused illnesses. 
Increasing the federal cigarette tax is one of the most effective ways to reduce teenage smoking. Study after study has shown that the cigarette tax is the most powerful weapon in reducing cigarette use among children, since they have less income to spend on tobacco. 
Philip Morris, the nation's largest tobacco company, conceded as much in an internal memorandum as far back as 1981, which noted that `it is clear that price has a pronounced effect on the smoking prevalence of teenagers, and that the goals of reducing teenage smoking and balancing the budget would both be served by increasing the federal excise tax on cigarettes.' 
Frank Chaloupka, an economist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, found that an increase in the federal cigarette tax by 20 cents will reduce teenage smoking by 7 percent, saving the lives of almost 400,000 children. 
Finally, on the overall issue of tax equity, the Democratic Alternative is clearly fairer. More of the benefits of the Republican plan go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers than go to the bottom 60 percent of the taxpayers (13.1 percent vs. 12.7 percent). In the Democratic alternative, only 1.4 percent of the benefits go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers, and the top 20 percent of taxpayers only receive 20 percent of benefits. The vast majority of the benefits go to taxpayers who have income in the middle 60 percent of the income distribution (71.6 percent of the benefits). The Democratic alternative is vastly preferable to the regressive Republican bill, because it is fair to lower and middle income taxpayers. 
The Democratic alternative is honest to the American people. The Republican bill states that it will result in a balanced budget by the year 2002. In fact, it might accomplish this. 
But in future years, the amount of Republican tax cuts will explode, and the deficit will increase enormously. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has estimated that the cost of the Republican proposal will increase by between $500 billion and $600 billion in the 10 years following the current budget period. It will be nearly impossible to balance the budget in those years if this Republican tax giveaway is enacted into law. 
The Democratic alternative does not engage in these accounting tricks to balance the budget. The Democratic alternative is honest with American people and fair to American taxpayers, and it deserves to be adopted. 
I withhold the remainder of my time.

So, effectively, we are saying to the States, as I understand it, that they are going to get a funding stream for 5 years. At the end of that, at least in this proposal, there will be no further funding.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am certainly going to support the proposal that is recommended by the committee itself. I want to commend my friend and colleague, Senator Hatch, for his perseverance and persistence and tough-mindedness in moving us as far down the road as we are. But I think we are receiving numbers, even as we are here, about those that will be covered and, also, for example, by CBO--the number that they believe will be covered is considerably less than has been estimated by the Finance Committee. 
It just seems to me that the great concerns that have been so well-articulated by the chairman of the committee and my friend and colleague from New York, Senator Moynihan, Senator Chafee, and Senator Hatch, about the numbers of uninsured, and the fact that they are at the margin in terms of their income, being able to have to provide approximately after-tax income of almost maybe $800 or so, in that range, it is still a very heavy burden. I certainly hope that we can find--with the strong health implications of raising the tobacco tax and the importance of this particular national need, we welcome the fact that now it is an accepted 
Senate position that we are going to have a 20-cent increase, but that we can get about the business of assuring that all of those children are going to be covered. So I want to thank those Senators, Senator Hatch in particular and our other colleagues, for being willing to accept the concept and framework of the Hatch proposal. I also indicate that I think we have an opportunity to take care of the other remaining uninsured children. I don't know why we would take care of one child and not take care of another when they are all basically the sons and daughters of working families. 
So I hope the Senate will accept this proposal. I want to make it very clear that we are preserving our right to make sure we are going to get coverage for the other children as well.

Mr. KENNEDY. That is correct. I thank the chairman of the committee for his consideration. It is a serious issue and a heartrending issue for many different individuals. The willingness to accept this amendment is something we are very, very appreciative of. If I might just say a few words about it. 
Under the budget reconciliation bill, legal immigrants who are already in this country can keep their SSI benefits. But for those who come in the future, SSI is only for citizens. They have to become citizens to qualify in the future, so your sponsor must take care of you until then. 
This amendment creates a small exception to that rule. It enables immigrants who are too disabled to qualify for citizenship to retain their SSI eligibility. 
Some immigrants and refugees--though not many--become too disabled to qualify for citizenship. Under this bill, their sponsors have to care for them for life. If they don't have sponsors, they have nowhere to turn. 
One example is Vien Vu. His family fled Vietnam after years of serving side-by-side with the United States Armed Forces. But Vien Vu has Downs syndrome. He is 34 years old. The rest of his family has become American citizens but Vien will never qualify for citizenship. His family needs SSI to care for him for the rest of his life. 
Mendel Tsadovich is a Latvian Holocaust survivor who is too mentally retarded to qualify for naturalization. In 1992, he and his family escaped as refugees from the anti-Semitism of the former Soviet Union. He is now 61 and living in New York. He is the only surviving member of his family, and depends on SSI for assistance. He has no sponsor. 
Vien and Mendel are the lucky ones. They arrived before passage of last year's welfare law. So the reconciliation bill will continue their SSI coverage. But what about the Viens and Mendels who arrive in the future? 
With the passage of the Lautenberg amendment this morning, my amendment costs almost nothing. CBO scores it as having little budget impact. So, we can help all those like Vien and Mendel and still balance the budget by 2002. 
The number of immigrants this amendment affects is small, perhaps only a few thousand people a year. But these immigrants often depend on SSI benefits for their survival. If they do not have the ability to become citizens, Congress should not deny them the SSI benefits they need.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 40 seconds, 20 seconds to my colleague, Senator Dodd. We offered this together. 
This amendment is supported by the American Council on Education and virtually all of the higher education agencies and organizations, as well as the student organizations. Effectively, it will reduce tuitions by $1.4 billion over the next 5 years, and it is fully paid for by the reduction in terms of the guarantees to the guaranty agencies from 98 to 95 percent of the loans. There are offsets there. The process that we have done in terms of the offsets is virtually identical to what was done by the Republican initiative in the reconciliation bill. I hope it will be successful. It will reduce student tuitions by at least $70.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment would speed up the agreed-upon transfer of a portion of the Medicare home health benefit from part A to part B. This acceleration would extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund by 2 years. It would not affect the deficit or seniors' premiums. We have maintained in our amendment that the premiums that have been agreed to would be maintained, or it would not affect the total amount of the benefit ultimately transferred. 
It is strictly a bookkeeping transaction, but it will help save Medicare. It extends the solvency of the Medicare Program by 2 years. It was in the President's budget. It is a desired outcome for those who are interested in the financial security of the Medicare trust fund. We debated the stability and the security of the Medicare trust fund at length yesterday. This is a way of extending it by 2 years.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I call up our amendment dealing with the special health needs of children. I call up the amendment on behalf of myself and Senator Harkin. 
First of all, I commend the Senators for getting us where we are in terms of the new health benefits package for children, but there are some very critical needs for children, children with disabilities, children who are developmentally delayed and children with special needs. 
Those needs are not attended to, and that is why this amendment is supported by the Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Association of Retarded Citizens and the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. 
This will ensure that, in those particular areas, the children will receive what is medically necessary. The Federal employees program is targeted to adults and not toward children. This recognizes that there are special needs for children in these areas, and it permits what is medically necessary. It is a limited program, but it is vital in terms of the special needs of those children. I hope that it will be agreed to.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I continue to be concerned about actions by Congress that hurt legal immigrants. 
Last year, Congress passed a so-called welfare reform bill. This harsh bill cut off legal immigrants from most Federal assistance programs for the first time in history. It permanently banned legal immigrants from SSI and food stamps. It banned them for 5 years from AFDC, Medicaid, and other programs. And, it gave the States the option of permanently banning them from these programs. 
We quickly saw the effect of these extreme provisions. Panic spread through the immigrant community. The Social Security Administration sentnotices to legal elderly and disabled immigrants that they would soon lose their SSI benefits. Numerous reports in the press told of legal immigrants who would be turned out of nursing homes, or cut off from disability payments. Some legal immigrants took their own lives, rather than burden their families. Thankfully, many Members of Congress realized that these provisions went too far. 
This budget reconciliation bill corrects many of those mistakes. Members of the Finance Committee and Budget Committee showed impressive leadership in developing this bill. They recognized that the immigrants affected by last year's harsh cuts are individuals and families who came here legally. By and large, they are family members--mothers, fathers, and sons, daughters--of American citizens. They play by the rules, pay their taxes, and serve in the Armed Forces. They can be drafted. They can volunteer. We have hundreds of them in Bosnia today. They are future citizens trying to make new lives for themselves and their families in this country. I commend the committees for working so hard to come up with a bipartisan proposal. 
This bill allows legal immigrants who are already receiving SSI to continue their SSI payments. It preserves SSI coverage for immigrants already in the United States who become disabled in the future, and for future immigrants who are too severely disabled to go through the process of naturalization to become citizens. It extends the exemption for refugees from 5 to 7 years. It exempts children from the 5-year ban on Medicaid eligibility. 
There is still much more to be done to correct the problems created for immigrants by last year's welfare reform law. But, overall, this bill makes worthwhile progress toward restoring a safety net for immigrants who fall on hard times. I hope that Senators will do all they can to see that the immigrant provisions in this bill are retained in the Senate-House conference and final bill.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the provisions in this bill to ensure the continuation of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement for secular nursing services in religious nonmedical health care institutions. These provisions ensure that strong religious beliefs are not a barrier to Medicare and Medicaid benefits. 
When Medicaid and Medicare were enacted over 30 years ago, Congress included a special provision granting a religious accommodation for members of the church, so that they could receive benefits for care in their facilities comparable to the benefits available to others for similar cases. 
For 30 years, the Christian Science Church relied on Medicare and Medicaid benefits and built a health care system that assists thousands of men and women. At a time when the Health Care Finance Administration has expressed increasing concerns about fraud and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid, there are no complaints about the Christian Science Church. Members of the church only ask to practice their religion without unnecessary interference. 
Last summer, however, a Minnesota district court determined that the provisions in the Medicare and Medicaid statutes onto the Christian Science Church are unconstitutional. As Judge Kyle stated in his opinion, `legislative accommodation of religious beliefs is a valuable and worthy enterprise, but here * * * the accommodation has gone too far and too strongly favors the convictions of one particular sect.' 
However, the court also recognized the fundamental injustice that Christian Scientists were required to pay the taxes for Medicare and Medicaid, but could not receive the benefits of these programs. The court also recognized the purpose underlying the original statutes. The court clearly identified the statutory language referring to the church as the problem, not the goal of providing comparable benefits to those who disavow traditional medical treatment because of their religious beliefs. 
The provision in the reconciliation bill meets this goal without undermining the Constitution. All references to the Christian Science Church are eliminated. The provision will grant reimbursement for secular nonmedical nursing services to any person who, because of religious beliefs, does not believe in medical care and relies on faith healing in a religious nonmedical health care institution. As with other aspects of this health care system, the Health Care Finance Administration will closely monitor the provision for fraud, abuse, and public health concerns. 
The chairmen of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and I have worked closely to ensure the constitutionality of this provision. 
This provision meets the worthwhile goals of the original Medicare and Medicaid laws, while meeting constitutional concerns. It deserves to be enacted into law so that the needed benefits will continue to be available.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think there are some important points to make in response to the presentation of the chairman of the Finance Committee. 
The first point to be made is that $5 billion that are going to be collected from our senior citizens was never considered to be an essential part of the balanced budget program. When the Senate voted for a balanced budget, there was no comment that we were going to have to raise the copays for our elderly citizens for nursing home care. 
So this is something that has just been added by the Finance Committee in order, as they say, to discourage the utilization of home health care services. That is first. 
So this is not part of the whole budget agreement. It was a decision by the Finance Committee to pick up $5 billion that will be paid by the frailest elderly citizens of this country, most of them between 75 and 80 years old, and primarily individuals that are on about $11,000 or $12,000 income, and primarily women. That is the profile of those that will be affected by this increase in the copay. That is first. 
Second, as anyone who has ever gone through and reviewed, or had hearings on overutilization, they will find out that it isn't the patient that is overutilizing the system. 
Of the groups in our society, by and large, if it is the patients that are overutilizing the system, it is the more affluent. They have the time to go down and overutilize the system. But, by and large, when you are talking about the frail elderly, it is very difficult for them to get out of their particular home, if they are in this situation, and utilize the systems. And so they are the ones who do not. But it is the doctors who are the ones that are prescribing these services. It is the doctors who are saying these home services are necessary. It is not just the elderly saying I want the services. It is the doctors who are saying these are important. 
Now, we had a wonderful citizen yesterday from our neighboring area of Maryland, Marian, who makes about $7,600 a year. She said, I get home health services three times a week. It is going to be $15 a week, and I am going to run up against the limit at the end of the year. Are we in the Senate going to say that Marian should not be washed during the course of the week? She will have to reduce it to one treatment over the course of the week? Are we going to here say that we have to add the $5 billion that is going to be used for tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals? Are we going to say to that elderly person, you are not going to get washed; you are not going to be able to have your legs stretched; you are not going to be able, because you are too old and have a hip problem, to be able to wash your feet? 
That is what we are talking about here. These are the kinds of services that are being provided. 
Now, I was here in 1972. It was the judgment of the Congress of the United States and the administration that we wanted to encourage home health services, to try and keep people in their homes if they wanted to stay there. They have maybe an option to go to a nursing home, but if they want to stay in their homes with their friends in a neighborhood and a community, they ought to have the opportunity and the ability to do so. And so it was the judgment at that time, in order to encourage home services that provide actual savings in the total health expenditures, that we ought to do so. That is the basis for it. 
Now, that is what we are running up against, Mr. President, and I am really surprised that the Finance Committee would take this step, particularly when there are other steps that are included in this legislation to restrain the doctors from prescribing this. Do we understand? There are already provisions in the legislation that we are considering in the Finance Committee to discourage the doctors from prescribing this. But, no, the Finance Committee said, that isn't enough; we are going to discourage the doctors from sending you home, but if you get home or are going to be home, then you are going to pay that 5 extra dollars. 
We have the interim payment system, which is an agency-specific per capita cap, which before was limitless. Now it is limited. You have already put that in, Senators of the Finance Committee, which is going to be a further restraint. And that is to discourage the growth in the utilization of services. And you have a lump-sum percentage of payment systems like the hospitals which will be effective in 1999 that is going to further discourage this. 
Our point is we have already written into the Finance Committee the targeting, where the target ought to be, and that is with doctors to provide some limitation on home health services. We are not even in the position of having tried those provisions. No, we are already saying we are going to also put the burden on the senior citizens who are receiving the home health care services. It makes no sense. It is grossly unfair. It is bad health policy. There is absolutely no reason in our attempt to achieve the balanced budget that we ought to be taking it out on the most frail individuals who are receiving, under Medicare, home health care services, Mr. President. So I hope that this measure would be struck. 
I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 4 minutes. 
Mr. President, I will take a moment to include in the Record a letter from former Senator Frank Moss from the State of Utah, and I will just read the relevant sections of it. 
Dear Senator Kennedy. 
I was the author in 1965 of the amendment which included home health care coverage under Medicare. Congressman Claude Pepper introduced the legislation in the House. Our original legislation required seniors to pay some portion of their home health care costs out of pocket. However, the studies done by the Senate Committee on Aging and the General Accounting Office persuaded me in 1972 to work with Senator Muskie and Senator Nelson to delete the copayment provision. Our studies clearly indicated that copayments-- 
Now listen to this-- cost Medicare more to collect in administrative costs than they saved in the program; 2. Denied access to care and fell more heavily on those who could least afford it; 3. Pushed families into poverty and loved ones unnecessarily into institutions, resulting in increased costs to the States and  Federal Government through the Medicaid Programs; and, 4, increased costs to Medicare because people put off care until they had to be hospitalized. I am writing to urge you not to repeat the mistakes that we made in the past. 
Now, what has escaped in this debate, Mr. President, is the estimated budgetary impacts of this particular provision. Now, listen to this, our colleagues who are concerned about unfunded mandates. The chairman of the Finance Committee has pointed out it hits the very, very poor, frail elderly; those who qualify for Medicaid will be able to receive it and the States will pick it up. True. That is true. And that amount will be $700 million. We are putting an unfunded mandate on the States to pick up the costs of this copayment, and it is going to cost the States $700 million. And in terms of the Federal Government, because we participate in the Medicaid Program, $900 million. 
That is what it is going to be just under Medicaid. So on the one hand, supposedly we are taking in the $5 billion. On the other hand, you are losing, effectively, $1.6 billion that the States and the Federal Government are providing. 
Now, Mr. President, this makes absolutely no sense. They had the extensive hearings by the committee in charge, the Aging Committee, and you could have those same hearings today and you would find exactly the same results, exactly the same results. It unfairly falls on the frail elderly, and it is going to discourage people from using home health care services and go into institutions and Medicaid eventually ending up paying more and people will delay getting the kind of care they need. 
Why shouldn't we first try to find out about the provisions that have been included by the Finance Committee which are going to provide for the providers the kind of prospective budgeting which we are using today for the hospitals. That is going to discourage this service. Why are we putting an additional burden that was never part of the agreement on the frailest of our society--$5 billion to use for tax cuts, tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals. 
It is absolutely outrageous, Mr. President, that in the course of this week, we will be out here on Thursday or Friday providing those kinds of tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals and the people who will be paying for them are going to be the seniors, the frailest, the elderly, the widowed individuals in our society. It is bad health policy. It is unfair. And it is just a continuation evidently of the kinds of assaults that we have seen on the Medicare system. We find the Finance Committee refusing to fund the $1.5 billion that they had agreed would be funded and putting on $5 billion that was never indicated in terms of the balanced budget. That is wrong, Mr. President, and every senior knows it. Every senior will know about that.

Briefly, I am wondering, as a Senator who has been strongly against unfunded mandates, with the recognition here it is going to cost the States some $700 million to pick up the Medicaid portion and we are not providing that to the States, how the Senator justifies that requirement that we are placing on the States to carry this proposal through?

Mr. KENNEDY. On Medicaid--excuse me. The position of the chairman of the committee is that, for those who are going to fall into Medicaid, the State is going to pick up that premium and it is going to, according to the CBO, amount to some $700 million on the States. We are not providing that additional help to the States. 
I am asking the Senator how he justifies that particular unfunded mandate? We heard a lot about unfunded mandates, and I want to know how the Senator responds to that.

Mr. KENNEDY. This is the only point I make. That amounts to $700 million for the States. That amounts to a $700 million unfunded mandate; $700 million unfunded mandate to the States, according to the CBO. 
I have listened to the Senator very eloquently talk about unfunded mandates, and here we are finding, according to the chairman of the Finance Committee, that for individuals who are going to fall below the poverty line, the State is going to pick that premium up, and that, according to CBO, amounts to $700 million. It will amount to $900 million by the Federal Government but $700 million to the States. I am just interested in listening to the Senator, who speaks about unfunded mandates and about the Federal Government imposing requirements on the States, here we have a beauty, $700 million you are putting on the States. That is according to CBO, because that is going to be the cost, over 5 years, for them to pick up the $5 copay.

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes of the 15 minutes of Senator Lautenberg's time to myself. 
Mr. President, if we have to deal with the overutilization of the home care services, let's address that issue. We understand that the person who suggests the kind of medical procedure is the doctor. We, the Finance Committee, are not making this statement in a vacuum. They have already included interim payment systems to deal with this issue for the elderly people. They already have prospective payments. They have made important changes already to address this issue. 
I would think that those Members who are standing on the floor of the U.S. Senate and saying, `Well, this is just a very modest kind of a program, and we ought to be able to afford it,' also ought to be there to tell us how they are using the $5 billion to strengthen Medicare instead of using it for tax cuts. But, no, you haven't heard one of them say that. You haven't heard one of them say, `We're going to reduce the overutilization so we can treat our elderly people better by additional kinds of services.' Absolutely not. They are silent on that issue--silent on that issue. 
The President of the United States had a more generous preventive program than the Finance Committee, and it was paid for without copayments. You can't have it both ways, I say to my colleagues. The President of the United States had a more generous preventive health care program for our senior citizens without the copay in the Finance Committee. No, no, they want to juggle the numbers, and that is what they have done. They have taken those billions of dollars, put an unfunded mandate on the States, required the Federal Government to max the Medicaid with $900 million and are putting that kind of $5 burden on the seniors. 
Who are these people? Just about half of them earn less than $10,000; 25 percent of them are over the age of 85; two-thirds of them are women; one-third of them live alone. As any profile shows, these are the most vulnerable in our society. Mr. President, $5 might not be much when we are talking about the size of these budget items, but it is a key factor, certainly it was in the marvelous testimony that we had from a wonderful resident who talked about what $5 meant for her ability to receive services at home. 
As we say, the doctors are the ones who are making those decisions. It is just amazing to me, as we are beginning this debate, to say we are going to put the $5 copay in there that the Senate made a decision not to put there as a result of extensive hearings. It was reported bipartisan, with bipartisan leadership. So they say that we are going to just wipe that out, that was never talked about during the time we were talking about a balanced budget. 
The final point that I will make is that we are going to require taking $5 billion out of the pocketbooks primarily of elderly women and putting it right over here for tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals, which we will be voting on. That is what is out there. If we are going to change the process of procedures in terms of treatment of people at home, let's do it, but let's do it in sunlight, let's do it as a result of hearings, let's do it as part of the overall Medicare debate rather than the one that was done by the Senate Finance Committee. 
Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we are moving through this debate, we have to recognize that in the proposal before us, we have a number of attacks on Medicare, with all due respect to our colleagues. We addressed one earlier today. Collecting $5 billion under Medicare. You are going to permit double billing, which this body has long refused to do in order to protect our senior citizens. Now we are going to permit doubling billings. 
The Finance Committee failed to make up the $1.5 billion that was part of the budget agreement. It refused to do that, and now we have a proposal to change the eligibility age from 65 to 67. 
I thought we had a commission that was going to study the long-term implications of Medicare. The President submitted a program that provides for the financial stability of Medicare for 10 years. We can consider a variety of different options. I daresay that I don't happen to be one who thinks you should just increase the age of eligibility or otherwise increase the taxes as some have suggested. We know that 90 percent of Medicare recipients cost $1,400 a year, the other 10 percent more than $36,000. You do something about that 10 percent to reduce disability, and chronic illness, and you are going to have a dramatic impact in terms of Medicare spending. 
That has not even been considered here, Mr. President. Why should we, at a time when we are increasing the total number of Americans who are uninsured, take action in the Senate that is going to add to that problem. The idea that this can be compared to Social Security makes no sense, and the Senator from Louisiana understands that. You can retire now at 62 and get some benefits, but you can't with regard to Medicare. It is basically a lifeline to our senior citizens. The Finance Committee failed to give any assurance to those millions of people who are watching today that they are not going to be sent right off the cliff. 
With all of the signed contracts containing terms to terminate health insurance in corporate America now at 65, all the workers across this country whose contracts end health care coverage at 65, and nothing from the Finance Committee gives them any kind of assurances that there has been any attention to what is going to happen to them. 
Sure, pull up the ladder. We can make this Medicare financially secure by just continuing increase the age from 65 to 67 to 69. Let us look at this over the long term, not the short term, and let us stop this wholesale assault on Medicare that is part of this whole proposal. It makes no sense.

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 6 minutes, Mr. President. 
This is what I consider another real assault on the Medicare-health care concept that has served the American people so well. I think the two great experiments we have seen that have taken place since the 1930's have been Social Security and also Medicare. We understand now that the Medicare trust fund needs attention. The President has made the recommendation that we have a period where we would have the opportunity to have a thorough discussion and debate about what steps must be taken in order to remedy the long-term financial needs of Medicare. 
That was what was recommended to go to conference and come back with recommendations to work that process through. What we have here in this particular Medicare proposal is not really dissimilar in many respects to some of the other proposals, and that is it has a very fundamental change in the whole Medicare system. It has this important change. 
For years, under the Medicare system, it was a universal system in the sense that people would pay in all across this Nation, needy people, poor people paid in and wealthy people paid in and people received the benefits under the Medicare system. Now that concept is being challenged and I believe undermined in a very important way for this reason. We are using under the recommendation of the Finance Committee effectively a means test for those of certain incomes--above the $50,000 as individuals or $75,000 up to $100,000 and up to $125,000. That means that there will be an increase in the various premiums and the ability to pay. 
Now, that will go into effect in another year. First of all, what is the message that this sends to hundreds and thousands, millions of Americans who are earning $50,000 a year and just about to go on Medicare? We are saying to them that their premiums are going to rise from $64 a month--it will rise in the current proposal by $2,000. It can rise under this proposal from $259.60 a month up to $3,100 a year for those at $100,000. We are saying to senior citizens this is going to be put upon you. They had little time to prepare for it, little time to plan for it. 
Mr. President, $50,000 is a lot of money but for many Americans it is right there in the heart of working families with two members of the family working. So we are saying--and this is the fundamental point--the first means test that we are going to provide on health care is going to be Medicare. We are not providing means tests for the deductibility of health 
insurance for the self-employed, the doctors and professional personnel, as well as some others in our society. We are not saying we are going to means test your particular health benefits. We are not saying to the wealthiest individuals who are going to be able to use the tax system to provide a deduction for their health benefits, we are not saying we are going to means test you. No. The only people we are going to means test are those under Medicare. That is the only group. We do not do it to those individuals who are self-employed. We do not do it to individuals who are deducting under much more costly health care programs. We are saying it's all right for you to go ahead and deduct and let the taxpayers pick up your deduction. We are saying, with regard to the self-insured, the same thing, but not with regard to Medicare--not with regard to Medicare. 
Now, what is going to be the result of this? Mr. President, what you are going to find out is that the wealthy individuals who participate in the Medicare system--listen to this. Those with the highest incomes, the top 25 percent under Medicare will pay about $159,000 more than they will collect in benefits. Do we understand that? The top 25 percent--that is what you are looking at in this particular amendment--they pay in $159,000 more than they collect in benefits. In contrast, those in the lowest income category, the bottom 25 percent collect $72,000 more in benefits than they will pay in taxes. 
That is the current system. So it would seem to me that we ought to give some consideration to those individuals from $50,000 to $100,000 who have been paying into Medicare, because they have been paying in more than they are paying out. 
What are the financial implications of that loss? What we are going to see, when any individual is going to be paying $3,100 a year in terms of premiums, they are going to leave the system. They are going to leave the system. We don't have any studies on that. We have no guidance, no professional advice as to the extent they are going to leave the system, how fast they are going to leave the system, but they are going to leave the system.

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 2 more minutes. 
So we are taking a high-risk kind of approach on something which is very basic and fundamental, and that is the integrity of the Medicare system. 
By means testing this premium, we are endangering the total Medicare system, because those who are contributing the most and adding to the Medicare system which needs those funds are going to leave the health care system. We have not had 5 minutes of hearings on the implication of this program to the Medicare trust fund. 
Beyond that, what we are saying is, of all the people in this country who are going to be means tested, it is going to be those individuals, working families, men and women who played by the rules, contributed to Medicare over the course of their lives, depending on the Medicare system, they are going to find that they are the first beneficiaries to whom the means test is applied. 
It is wrong in terms of the Medicare system. It is wrong in terms of a health care policy. I don't know what it is about the Senate Finance Committee. They are trying to drive more and more people out of Medicare health care coverage. They are doing it by raising the age of eligibility, and they are doing it with regard to this particular program. I can understand why some would want to do it, because they want to ship people out of Medicare and into the private insurance market so they can make profits in Medicare. We are endangering Medicare and taking a high risk. It is the wrong economic policy. It is the wrong health policy. I hope the amendment will be accepted. 
I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
The material that the Senator from Texas was quoting was not focused on this particular amendment. It was talking generally about the problems of the Medicare. 
The Senator has not responded to one of the principal criticisms of this amendment and that is that the top 25 percent of the Medicare recipients are paying into the Medicare system some $132,000 more than they are taking out over a lifetime. You are raising their part B premiums to $3,100 and you are talking about it being voluntary. 
How many of those individuals in the top 25 percent will leave Medicare? And what will the economic implications on the trust fund be then? You have not had any hearings or any testimony. The answer that I hear is, `Well, the very wealthy get 75 percent of their part B paid by general revenues.' Yes, they do, and I can give you the studies that show that the top 25 percent pay more into part B than they get back in terms of whatever services or assistance they get under part B. 
So you are going to take steps here on means testing premiums for the first time, on a program that is working, and has no financial problems under the proposal of President Clinton --$115 billion of savings. We will make sure we have 10 years to set up that commission and to consider a variety of different alternatives in terms of the Medicare trust fund. But no, no, we have the answers to these problems today in the Finance Committee. They were marking up these measures with 5-minute time limitations on discussion for each of the various amendments. 
Mr. President, this is not the way to treat senior citizens. I know the Senator is against the Medicare system. I have listened to him oppose it. I know he was part of a program in the last Congress to cut it by $256 million and use the money to pay for billions of dollars in tax breaks for wealthy individuals. 
The Senator asked me what I am for. I am for preserving the Medicare system and not destroying it. And I am for giving careful consideration and study to the different alternatives, in the light of day. I am not for having a seat-of-the-pants recommendation which can threaten the Medicare system. We are fast-tracking these proposals. We are debating these issues on Medicare with a time limit of 1 hour. 
I was here when the Senate debated Medicare for days and weeks, and now it reverses itself over a period of 3 years. We are now asked here to make judgments and decisions in just a few moments. It is a disservice to senior citizens. It is a disservice to all the men and women in this country who believe in a retirement that they can plan, knowing what they could expect in terms of the Medicare premium. 
Finally, HCFA, which is the principle organization that is going to be working through the process of administering this, keeps no income records. What is going to happen to an individual that makes $49,500 and somebody that makes $50,500? What happens when they make a certain amount 1 year but not the second year? What if they make it in the third quarter and not the fourth quarter? How do you administer this? Who will make those decisions? You are going to set up a massive bureaucracy. The Senator has not commented on that. 
We were here debating just the other day a children's health bill, talking about doing a cigarette tax and we already collect a cigarette tax. We were talking about distributing that money to the States through the agreement that Senator Hatch and I proposed, and we heard `Wow, a totally new administration will have to be set up.' 
What the Senators in the Finance Committee are proposing will require the grandaddy of all bureaucracies to be set up. A set up in a way that I think will seriously threaten the long-term security of the Medicare system.

<TEXT>
Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes. I listened to my friend and colleague from Rhode Island talking about how Part B of the Medicare system is subsidized by 75 percent from the general funds. Well, of course, the health insurance of every Member of the U.S. Senate is also subsidized by roughly the same amount. When he talks about how bad it is for upper-income seniors to pay only 25 percent of their Part B costs, it should be clear that Senators--whose incomes are all above the maximum threshold they have set for senior citizens--also pay only 25 percent of the health insurance premium. 
This is the point, Mr. President. Under family coverage for Blue Cross, we only $108.40 per month, while the taxpayers spend $292 a month on our coverage. So that is what happens right here in the U.S. Senate. If we are going to begin to means-test taxpayer-subsidized health insurance benefits, why are we starting with Medicare? 
The third part of our amendment changes this by requiring Senators whose annual income is over $100,000 to pay for 100 percent of their health insurance premiums. As we have seen under the Lewin-VHI study commissioned by the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, the top 25 percent of wage earners of this country pay $159,000 more into the Medicare system than they take out. By contrast, those in the lowest income category--the bottom 25 percent--will collect about $72,000 more in benefits than they pay in taxes. 
You cannot assure us that higher income group is going to choose to stay enrolled in Medicare under these new conditions. Studies have demonstrated that those in the top 25 percent pay more into part B than they receive back. All we are asking for is a hearing on this issue. Those are the figures. I have the studies right here to demonstrate that. Now, if that is true, we don't want to lose this group because they are providing help and assistance for other needy workers. I must remind my colleagues that health status generally rises with income, which means wealthier senior citizens are generally healthier. If they choose to leave Medicare, they take their premium dollars with them. 
So I believe that it is true, and we have the testimony to provide it. We ought to at least explore this proposals impact on Medicare enrollment before blindly voting for it.

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself another minute. The fact is, if that is true--and I believe it is--we have to make a calculation of how many people are we going to drive out of the part B, because we are raising their annual premiums to well over $3,000. You can't tell us different here this afternoon. So, Mr. President, I think that this measure ought to be given more consideration. 
A final point. Ten years ago, Medicare recipients spent on average 18 percent of their income on out-of-pocket health care expenses. It is now up to 21 percent.

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 1 additional minute. The elderly already spend a disproportionate share of their income on health 
care. While those under age 65 spend only about 8 percent of their income on health care, Medicare beneficiaries spend an average of 21 percent. This amendment will only increase that disparity. It poses, I believe, a serious threat to the Medicare system and it should be given much more thought and consideration than it has here today. Medicare's success is based in part on the fact that all groups are treated equally -- poor, rich, younger, older, sick, healthy. This provision undermines the fundamental promise of Medicare that says you will all contribute an equal amount and you shall all be guaranteed equal benefits. 
I withhold the remainder of my time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, under the current bill approximately 2 million Medicare recipients will, starting in January of next year, pay more for their Medicare premiums. They did not know that yesterday. They did not know that this morning. They did not know that at noon today, and they did not know it until just a few moments ago when the Senate made its decision to retain this provision. 
This particular amendment asks the Senate to postpone the effective date of this amendment for 2 years to permit the commission to review the effect of the means-testing proposal and to allow the retirees affected by this increase to make changes in their family budgets to accommodate the significantly higher premiums that will otherwise go into effect in just 6 months. Unless Congress takes other action during this time, the provision would take effect in January 2000. 
This time would give us an opportunity to fully discuss and debate this landmark decision. 
That is the practical effect of waiving the point of order. This is a matter of great importance to the Medicare system and the 
2 million beneficiaries who will be affected by the proposal, and we ought to be able grant a reasonable period of time for its assessment and for seniors to prepare to pay more.

Mr. KENNEDY. We believe this is in order. But we will have an opportunity to address that issue at the appropriate time. 
Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to offer an amendment to strike the new copayment for Medicare's home health patients. Without warning, the Finance Committee has imposed a tax on America's seniors of nearly $5 billion in new copayments for part B home health services. 
This cruel and unexpected provision, which was not debated or voted on in the committee and is not necessary to meet the committee's reconciliation targets, will fall primarily on the oldest, poorest, and sickest Medicare beneficiaries. 
Let me repeat that. The nearly $5 billion that is raised by this provision is not necessary to meet the requirements of the budget agreement. Nonetheless, it was put into the agreement. Why? The best estimate is that those will be used for tax reductions, perhaps for the wealthier individuals. 
I am sure that some in the Senate will justify to the American people this change and the other dangerous proposals in this bill by claiming they are needed to preserve Medicare for future generations. This could not be further from the truth. 
As I understand, the agreement worked out in the bipartisan budget negotiations was to stabilize the Medicare trust fund for at least 10 years and to establish a commission that will make recommendations to preserve Medicare for the future. 
The proposal we are debating now does neither of these things. It establishes a $5 copay that will affect the oldest, the sickest, and the poorest senior citizens. This provision preys primarily on the elderly women who are dependent upon Medicare and the home health care system. 
The assault on Medicaid that began last Congress is continuing with full force. Congress should reject this just as we rejected it last year. There is no rationalization, none whatsoever, for Congress to rush forward with ill-considered changes in Medicare under the thinly veiled pretext of balancing the Federal budget. None of these basic changes in Medicare were part of the budget agreement. 
It is the height of hypocrisy for those who voted against including the Hatch-Kennedy children's health plan in the agreement last month to make this assault on Medicare part of the agreement this month. 
When we brought that measure up here, we were told that this is going to break the budget agreement, even though it is completely paid for. Now, we have before us a plan to collect $5 billion in copays from elderly widows and the poorest in our society. Under this proposal, we would collect $5 billion that is not even necessary to meet the terms of the budget agreement. 
In 1996, Mr. President, Medicare beneficiaries spent an average of $2,605 on health care. However, the sicker seniors spent $5,600 out of their own pockets for cost-sharing related only to Medicare coverage services. Now the Senate Finance Committee is asking them to spend up to $760 more. 
I understand that some of my colleagues are interested in increasing cost sharing because they feel it would lead to a reduction in utilization and, therefore, a reduction in Medicare spending. It is important to note, however, that cost-sharing is a blunt tool to express change. It may reduce utilization but the goal is to reduce unnecessary utilization. It is almost certain this policy will fail to meet this objective. 
Let me remind my colleagues that home health services were exempted from part B coinsurance in 1972 to encourage use of less costly noninstitutionalized services. Reimposing a copayment will undermine that effort. We removed cost-sharing requirements on home health care in 1972 specifically to reduce utilization, to the extent that we could in an appropriate health context, of services in acute hospitals and in high-cost medical delivery systems. We wanted to encourage the provision of home health care, which provides very important services and does so less expensively than in acute care settings. 
It was the belief at that time, and it is my belief now, that burdensome cost-sharing can seriously threaten the health of the frail elderly, particularly those who are hard pressed to make ends meet. Imposing a $5 new copayment will reduce access for those who need the services the most. If we are interested in reducing home health care utilization we ought to first look at ways to alter the behavior of providers, as we have done in the bill's proposed payment reform, before forcing the sickest beneficiaries to pay more. 
Mr. President, just a few moments ago we had some excellent commentary from Marian Brown, an 82-year-old widow who lives independently in Marlow Heights, MD. She has numerous health ailments and is confined to a wheelchair. She is treated three times a week by a home health aide who tends to her physical troubles, spending 2 to 3 hours in her home on each visit. Her annual income is $6,786. She simply cannot afford to spend an additional $15 a week, $60 a month, or $720 a year on copayments for these necessary visits. She spoke articulately and compellingly about what this particular proposal would mean to her. She has difficulty with her hip, but doctors do not want to operate because of a serious heart condition. Yet her hip prevents her from being able to move in and out of the bathtub. It prevents her from being able to wash her own feet. 
She is a very proud individual who takes great delight in living where she does with her friends and associates, and has a great sense of joy about her and in her optimism about the future. She is not asking for very much. She is just saying, `I can just about make ends meet now, but, if you pass this copayment, I will have to give up stretching exercises to keep me from further disability, or the ability to be able to get out of bed and get dressed and cleaned up in a manner that allows me to retain my sense of respect and dignity and self-value and joy, or cut back on prescription drugs or food or heating of my apartment during the winter.' She makes that case, Mr. President. 
We have to ask ourselves what was the sense of urgency in this legislation. Those funds were not even needed in terms of balancing the budget. We ought to look at all the provisions--not only of this bill, which is the cutting of the spending programs--but also in the tax bill, to see who will benefit, where the pain is coming, where the fairness is. 
I daresay I think those in the majority will be hard pressed at the end of the day to think that this kind of financial burden and anxiety--even though these are only $5 payments that the individual will have to pay--that ought to be used to balance the budget. The amendment that I offer, joined by Senator Wellstone, will give the opportunity for the Senate to go on record opposing this proposal. 
Finally, Mr. President, this new copayment will be an unfunded mandate on the States. I ask for the attention of our colleagues who are so concerned about unfunded mandates on the States. Medicare beneficiaries who qualify for assistance from State 
Medicaid programs have higher use of home health care services. In fact, the very poorest, who are eligible for Medicare and Medicaid, are twice as likely as other Medicare beneficiaries to use the home health benefits. As a result, State Medicaid programs will have to absorb the new copayments for these beneficiaries. 
CBO estimates, Mr. President, that the additional State and local costs of home health copayment would amount to $700 million over the next 5 years. I hope we are going to have the time and opportunity to hear the rationale and justification for this misguided proposal. States are usually quite clear in their opposition to unfunded mandates. 
Mr. President, Medicare is still one of the most successful social programs ever enacted. It has brought health care and health security to tens of millions of senior citizens. We can deal with the financial problems of Medicare but we must do it the right way, not the wrong way. 
Our goal is to save Medicare, not destroy it. Our priority should be to keep the promise of medical and financial security for senior citizens that Medicare provides. We are the guardians of that promise and we should oppose any schemes that violate it. 
There is no question that Medicare will face serious challenges in the next century as a result of the retirement of the baby-boom generation. Today there are nearly four adults of working age for every senior citizen. By the year 2030, that ratio will be down to two workers for every senior citizen. There is a right way and a wrong way to respond to that challenge, and the wrong way is to destroy the program under the guise of saving it. 
I urge my colleagues to vote to strike these unfair and unnecessary provisions from the reconciliation bill.

Mr. KENNEDY. If I could, and I see Senator Wellstone ready to speak on this, but just before the Senator sits down, does the Senator understand what the Finance Committee was doing since this is a benefit that comes from part B. They are using the deductible limit in A which is $760, which is a lot more, obviously, than part B which is just $100. 
Here they are taking something which is basically a benefit, they are tying it to the higher deductible to make the seniors pay more. I find that somewhat troublesome, as well. It is just a way of maneuvering the system. 
I am just wondering if the Senator also is struck by the fact that States are going to be involved in collecting this? Even in the poorest of the circumstances, they are going to have a requirement to do so. We will not be helping any of the States to do it. We hear a great deal about mandates around here, I would have thought this would be a matter of concern to some of those that were troubled by unfunded mandates.

It was added on in the Finance Committee, as I understand, without even an up-or-down vote, and here we are faced with the fact that millions of our seniors will be faced with this issue unless we move to strike it on the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. So this bill has short-changed low-income senior citizens $1.5 billion, and then asked them to pay $5 billion on top of that. And then created an MSA demonstration, which is going to cost about $400 million. We already have an MSA demonstration project.

Mr. KENNEDY. My point exactly. The Kassebaum-Kennedy bill created a demonstration for those in the private market. We ought to first evaluate that proposal, on which we are already spending nearly $1.5 billion, before doling out scarce Medicare funds in a wild experiment sure to benefit only insurance companies and the healthy and wealthy. 
And then we are going to return to the days of balanced billing. Certain private plan options will allow doctors to overcharge, or balance bill. We have, over a long period of time, prohibited Medicare providers from balanced billing and encouraged them to take Medicare payment as payment in full. Releasing these important consumer protections will undoubtably force seniors to pay more. It doesn't take any stretch of the imagination--and I ask my friend and colleague if he would agree with me--to envision doctors moving out of Medicare to form one of these private plans and invite their Medicare patients to `come into our program.' Seniors will follow their doctors and find themselves being overcharged in those circumstances. That is what happened in the past. Is the Senator concerned about that?

Mr. KENNEDY. Was that in the budget agreement? Balanced billing was debated last year, in the last Congress here, and we were given assurances that it wasn't going to be part of the budget agreement when we were talking then. I don't remember much discussion about that prior to the time that we voted on this issue here. I think that what is important here--we have not even talked about the issue of the part B deductible and what that will mean to seniors and the additional out-of-pocket expenses they will have in that area--is that these provisions are going to have a dramatic adverse impact on seniors, and it was not mandated in the budget agreement. This is all in anticipation of a commission that the bill sets up to try and review the Medicare system for the future.

Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate that. We will have a chance to address these in accordance with the way the amendment process goes during the next couple of days. I am very grateful for the Senator's comments because I think it is important, as we address 
these issues, not to confuse what is necessary to preserve the financial integrity of the Medicare system--as this bill does for at least 10 years--with these other proposals that could destroy it. I daresay that those additional costs to seniors will reflect themselves by the end of the week, along with the additional tax relief for very wealthy individuals and corporations. 
I daresay I was so interested when my friend, the majority leader, was talking about how the amendment that Senator Hatch and I offered to extend health insurance to children would be a budget buster because it is financed by an increase on the cigarette tax. And then the Finance Committee, with his support, turned right around and offered a 20-cent per pack cigarette tax increase. It's only a small part of it, but it is amazing the way all of this is being proposed. 
I thank my colleague and friend from New Jersey for his response. He has been a leader in terms of responsible economic policy and has a challenging position in representing our side through these negotiations. We have great respect for someone who understands this process so well. I am grateful for his response.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senators respond that there has been an increase in the utilization of home health care. Well, it isn't the patient who says, `Look, I want to go home instead of going to the hospital.' The person that does that is the doctor. 
If you have problems with overutilization, do something about the provider but not the patient. The patient follows what the doctor recommends. If the provider says either you have to go to 
the hospital or we can take care of this back home, it isn't the patient that is overutilizing. They are responding to options prescribed by the medical profession. So we shouldn't penalize our senior citizens and our frail senior citizens for behavior they can't necessarily modify. 
There are those who say, `Look, Medicaid will take care of the costs of the poorest seniors.' That may be true, first of all, if the beneficiaries know about the financial assistance. But we see many people fall through the cracks because they are not aware of this assistance. Some estimates indicate that only 10 percent of eligible senior citizens take advantage of this offer. And, basically, you are talking about individuals whose income rests near $7,700. So, even if those in poverty may be taken care of by Medicaid, what do we do about the near poor? 
What about the senior citizen whose income is $8,000? What about the senior citizen whose income is $9,000, $10,000, $11,000, $12,000? We are asking them to pay up to $760 more this year, and the cap will rise each year according to the rise in the inpatient hospital deductible. For what reason? It was never explained to us. It was never voted on. 
With all respect to the deliberations of the Finance Committee, this wasn't even debated. 
Here we are on the floor of the U.S. Senate at 5 o'clock, with an hour's debate on something that is going to affect millions of elderly, frail senior citizens, many of whom are widows between 75 and 80 years old. Look at the profile of who is going to be affected by this. 
It wasn't even discussed. We weren't voting and saying, `Look, vote for this because we are going to collect $5 on the frail elderly.' To help pay for what? For a tax break. 
We wouldn't be having this debate if it were not for the tax break for wealthy individuals. The reason we are having this is because of the next bill that we are going to consider provides tax breaks for wealthy individuals. The Finance Committee has said `We need to squeeze the elderly.' Otherwise, we wouldn't have this debate. 
No one was saying at the beginning of the session, we really have to go out and stop our elderly from overutilizing health care services. No one said, by God, one of the real problems we are facing in this country is to get those frail seniors to pay more so they won't use it. No, no, no. That wasn't even talked about by the proponents of the balanced budget. 
Who are the people now that use the home health services? Sixty-six percent are over 75 years of age. Almost half of them have incomes below $10,000. Sixty-six percent are women, and 33 percent live alone. 
So there you have it. You are talking about women 75 to 80 years old. You are talking about those with incomes of $7,000, $8,000, $9,000, or $10,000, that need these home health services to stay out of the hospital. That saves our health care system a great deal. 
This comes at the same time that the Finance Committee ignored instructions to honor a clear commitment to provide $1.5 billion in premium assistance for low-income elderly. 
Time is not going to erase this injustice. You can say that the clock will be tolled at noontime on Wednesday, but it is not going to erase the fact that in that bill tonight frail seniors are required to pay $5 billion more, that the $1.5 billion to defray premiums for low-income seniors is nowhere to be found, and that the bill costs Medicare $400 million in trial MSA's. 
This is where we are. This is where we come in order to have a balanced budget? In order to have tax breaks of billions of dollars--billions of dollars--just 3 days from now. 
That is the dichotomy here. This is the light Republican effort. Last year, we had the major Medicare cuts for major tax breaks and now we have smaller cuts to see how much they can get away with. You only have 20 hours on the floor of the Senate for this bill. The majority has decided to see what it can get away with in this first bill, and then move to provide the goodies later in the week. 
This is a bad deal. This is a bad deal for senior citizens. It is a bad deal for parents. It is a bad deal for aunts and uncles. It is a bad deal for children. And at the end of the week, we are going to see the distribution of these tax breaks going, again, to the upper incomes. 
It is absolutely, fundamentally wrong, and we are not going to let this go along without getting rollcall votes and having Members make a judgment and decision on those items so that they will hear it when they go back to their constituents and the elderly people and answer to them why they wanted to move ahead in that direction. It is wrong. 
We will continue this debate tomorrow. Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of my time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know we are going to have a statement by the Senator from West Virginia, but the point is that the preventive services, which I commend, were included in the President's proposal and are paid for under the budget that had been submitted by the President. 
So this investment, while I support it, does not quite jell, because the preventive programs that have been mentioned now were already included prior to the creation of this new copayment. 
Second, I did not think we were looking at the overall long-term changes in Medicare. We wanted to get the 10 years of solvency that had been supported by the President and other Members of the Congress and then deal with the long-term issues. I think if the Senator wanted to, we could spend some time looking at the increase of home health care and the decrease in hospitalization. 
But the bottom line is patients go, by and large, in the health care system where the doctor tells them. If the doctor tells them, you need to get to that hospital tonight, by and large, patients go there. If the doctor says, you need to have those services, by and large, the patients get them. When we are talking about individuals who have incomes of roughly $7,700 being told they can get an offset in the State. We know the number of children, for example, that fall under the Medicaid proposals that are not covered by Medicaid. And the seniors are facing the same thing. 
So I just think that, let alone, as the chairman has pointed out, the very poor can get some of this offset or will get it offset in terms of the Medicaid that is requiring the States to collect it. We have heard a great deal about putting additional burdens on the States, but it seems we are willing to do so as long as we get the additional funds for the tax cuts. 
I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for his response, and I appreciate his courtesy in responding to these questions. I will be glad to yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the reconciliation bill before us today seeks to raise the age of eligibility for Medicare from 65 to 67. If we allow this increase to remain in the bill, we will be breaking a compact made with millions of future beneficiaries. For 32 years, we have said to working Americans `pay into this program and we will provide you with health security at age 65.' During the drafting of this bill, however, this promise was callously and capriciously cast aside. 
Proponents will claim that they are merely conforming the eligibility age for Medicare to that of its sister program, Social Security. Yet, the manner in which we are approaching this change and the final outcome differ dramatically and dangerously. 
First, it is important to note that the change in the age of eligibility for Social Security, which begins to rise in 2003, was enacted in 1983. Therefore, individuals affected by the Social Security change will have had a minimum of 20 years to adjust their retirement planning. By changing Medicare at this late date, we are giving future beneficiaries only 6 years notice to absorb in their retirement planning a change that could eat up a significant portion of their retirement income, should they actually be able to purchase insurance. It could also bankrupt them, if they are forced to go without insurance and suffer a devastating illness. 
Second, under Social Security, individuals will still be able to receive reduced benefits at age 62, the age of early retirement, if they choose to retire before they are eligible for full benefits. Under this proposal, however, senior citizens will be unable to receive any Medicare benefits until they reach the new age of eligibility. 
A delay in eligibility for Medicare could throw millions of senior citizens into the ranks of the uninsured. Unless we are willing to enact simultaneous insurance reforms to guarantee access to affordable and comprehensive coverage for this group, these senior citizens will be forced to forgo health security in their retirement. 
In 1992, employer-related retiree health plans paid for only 6 percent of health expenditures for persons over age 65. There is no reason to expect this number to increase. In fact, many employers are now reducing or canceling retiree health coverage for both early retirees and Medicare-eligible retirees. According to one study, in 1988, 62 percent of firms offered retiree coverage to those under age 65, and 55 percent offered benefits to those eligible for Medicare. In just 4 years, by 1992, the numbers of firms offering retiree health coverage had dropped nearly 10 percent in both categories--to 52 and 46 percent, respectively. 
Members of the Corporate Health Care Coalition have ominously issued a warning that this provision could hasten the loss of employer-sponsored coverage. In a letter of June 16, 1997, they state that raising the eligibility age `. . . could cause many [companies] to move to limit or eliminate their commitment to retirees.' 
It is difficult to know why the Finance Committee proposed this step, since it does not contribute a single penny toward their reconciliation instructions. A change of this magnitude deserves careful study and planning. The age of eligibility is precisely the type of issue that ought to be considered by the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, which this bill will create. To change the age of eligibility suddenly, on the spur of the moment, on this reconciliation bill, is an unwise, unfortunate, and unnecessary attack on all senior citizens. 
The provision also violates the Byrd rule because it does not affect spending within the budget window. We eliminated this proposal 2 years ago, and Senator Durbin's point of order should strike it from the bill again.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Finance Committee yesterday reported a bill that will tragically undermine Medicare as we know it. I'm sure that some will tell the American people that these changes are needed to preserve Medicare for future generations. I say, hogwash. The assault on Medicare that began in the last Congress is continuing with full force, and Congress should reject it this year, just as we rejected it last year. 
There is no justification--none whatever--for Congress to rush forward with ill-considered changes in Medicare under the thinly veiled pretext of balancing the Federal budget. None of these basic changes in Medicare were part of the budget agreement. It is the height of hypocrisy for these who voted against including the Hatch-Kennedy children's health plan in the agreement last month to make this assault on Medicare part of the agreement this month. 
In the last Congress, the assault on Medicare came in two steps. The first step was to make deep cuts in Medicare--$270 billion over 7 years, three times the amount necessary to restore the solvency of Medicare. The second step was to inflict enough damage to Medicare that it would wither away over time. 
This year, the amount of cuts in Medicare is lower--$115 billion over 5 years--and was locked-in by the budget agreement. But the budget agreement was not strong enough to prevent the second part of the anti-Medicare strategy. 
Medicare is still one of the most successful social programs ever enacted. It has brought health care and health security to tens of millions of senior citizens. We can deal with the financial problems of Medicare, but we must do it the right way, not the wrong way. Our goal is to save Medicare, not destroy it. 
The proposal coming to the floor next week will raise the age of eligibility for Medicare from 65 to 67. If this increase passes, we will be breaking a compact made with millions of working Americans. Despite what supporters of this proposal claim, Medicare is not the same as Social Security on the age of eligibility. 
A delay in eligibility for Social Security may result in delayed benefits or lower benefits, but people can still retire when they choose. By contrast, a delay in eligibility for Medicare will throw millions of seniors into the ranks of the uninsured. Unless we are willing to enact simultaneous insurance reforms to guarantee access to affordable and comprehensive coverage for this group, these senior citizens will be forced to go without the health security promised to them for the past 32 years. 
The age of eligibility is precisely the type of issue that ought to be considered by the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare. To change the age of eligibility suddenly, on the spur of the moment, in this reconciliation bill, is an unnecessary slap in the face of future beneficiaries. This shift should also concern big business, since the serious problems created by this dangerous policy will undoubtedly rest in part on its shoulders. 
We must not undermine the foundation and structure of Medicare. Yet this bill would turn Medicare over to private sector insurers and managed care companies, pushing millions of elderly Americans into giving up their own doctors and joining private insurance plans. 
If just half of all seniors leave Medicare and join private plans, insurance company premium revenues will increase by over $625 billion in 7 years. The increased profits for insurance companies will amount to almost $20 billion. The motive for the craven change is clear--to pad the profits of private insurance companies at the expense of the health security of millions of elderly Americans. 
The claim is made that the plan offers seniors more choice. But the plan tips the scales heavily in favor of private insurers. It reduces payments to doctors under traditional Medicare, inducing them to either limit the number of Medicare patients they treat or leave the program. At the same time, it allows doctors in some private plans to charge fees far above what current law allows. 
During the budget negotiations, Republicans and Democrats jointly agreed to set aside $1.5 billion to provide premium assistance for senior citizens with annual incomes between $9,500 and $11,800. Yet--despite this clear commitment--this needed assistance is not included in the Senate bill, and the House bill provides only one-third of the money under a proposal that is likely to be ineffective. More than 3 million beneficiaries fall into this category, most of whom are older women who live alone. 
Where did this money go? At least a portion went to pay for an unnecessary test of medical savings accounts. Proponents claim that these high-deductible private plans will help Medicare by encouraging seniors to take responsibility for their own health care. But we know that MSA's are just another gift for the wealthy and the healthy. They will encourage the wealthiest beneficiaries to opt-out of Medicare and take their premiums with them, leaving the Government with the sickest patients and fewer dollars to pay for their care. Again, the real reason for this change is MSA's cost the taxpayers money while benefiting private insurers. The private insurance industry has been itching for 30 years to get its hands on Medicare, but that is no reason for this Congress to scratch that itch. 
We are already spending approximately $1.5 billion between 1997-2002 to review the effect of MSA's in the private insurance market under last year's Kassebaum-Kennedy health insurance reform law. There is no need to gamble with scarce Medicare funds before an adequate evaluation of the current test is obtained. This additional demonstration program serves only to put another foot in the door in the misguided effort to turn Medicare into a private insurance plan. 
Unfortunately, it is the low and moderate-income elderly who will suffer most from these proposals. Senior citizens already spend, on average, more than 20 percent of their income on health expenses. Ignoring this fact, the committee proposal also includes a new $5 per visit copayment for home health services under Medicare. This copayment alone will raise nearly $5 billion. It is a tax on the very senior citizens who are sick, and can least afford to pay it. It will fall disproportionately on the very old, the very ill and those with modest income. 
Another extremely serious change for beneficiaries is the proposal to means-test the Medicare deductible. Unlike proposals to means-test the premium, which would apply to all beneficiaries, means-testing the deductible affects only those who actually use health services. It therefore imposes a sickness tax that undermines Medicare's fundamental policy of spreading risks and costs across all beneficiaries. 
Supporters justify this step by claiming that most beneficiaries have supplemental insurance policies--called Medigap--which will cover the increase. But insurance companies do not set their rates based on income. So the additional costs will be reflected in higher Medigap premiums paid by all--unconscionably forcing lower income beneficiaries to subsidize the higher deductibles of the wealthier beneficiaries. 
No one should be under any illusions about the impact of these provisions on Medicare. The issue is clear. On the question of whether senior citizens deserve decent health care in their retirement years, the answer of this bill is a resounding `no.' 
Taken together, the proposals in this plan give upper income beneficiaries no need to stay in Medicare--and every incentive to leave. This plan will destroy the successful social compact that if rich and poor alike contribute to the program, rich and poor alike will receive the same benefits. 
Our priority should be to keep the promise of medical and financial security for senior citizens that Medicare provides. We are the guardians of that promise and we should oppose any schemes that violate it. 
There is no question that Medicare will face serious challenges in the next century as a result of the retirement of the baby-boom generation. Today, there are nearly four adults of working age for every senior citizen. By the year 2030, that ratio will be only two workers for every senior citizen. But there is a right way and a wrong way to respond to that challenge. The wrong way is to destroy the program under the guise of saving it. 
One right way that Congress should carefully explore has been suggested by a recent study at Duke University. It shows that the most important factor driving Medicare costs is not how many seniors are in the program, but how sick they are. The chronically ill, those who are disabled, account for the overwhelming majority of Medicare costs. In 1995, the average disabled senior citizen cost the program seven times as much as a nondisabled beneficiary. Saving just one senior citizen from disability saves Medicare an incredible $18,000 a year in costs on the average. 
Over the last 12 years, the rate of disability dropped by an average of 1.3 percent per year. Maintaining and slightly raising that rate of decline to 1.5 percent a year could make the Medicare Program solvent far into the 21st century--without destructive benefit cuts or major tax increases. This is a far better way to save Medicare for the long haul. It will put Medicare's fiscal house in order, and enable all Americans to live longer and healthier lives. It is unacceptable for Congress to make deep and excessive cuts in Medicare without exploring this alternative. 
In fact, we need to do more, not less, to provide good health care to senior citizens. We need to double our investment in biomedical research over the next 5 years. 
It has been a bipartisan effort. Senator Mack has been a leader. Senator Specter, Senator Harkin, and many others on both sides of the aisle have provided leadership in this area. We need to make sure that every senior citizen receives the best and most up to date medical care. We need to encourage every American--and especially senior citizens--to follow healthier lifestyles and receive good preventive medicine. I am pleased that one of the positive parts of this reconciliation bill is its expansion of preventive benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, including annual mammograms, colorectal cancer screening, and diabetes self-management. But this is one of the few bright spots in an otherwise destructive approach to the long-term health of Medicare and its beneficiaries. 
Today the Finance Committee will also mark-up its tax proposal. There is little reason to expect that the result will be any fairer than the assault on Medicare. Our goal next week is clear. 
Next week also as an amendment to the reconciliation bill Senator Hatch and I intend to offer our proposal for children's health insurance, paid for by an increase in the tobacco tax. Clearly the provisions in the Finance Committee plan, which will cover fewer than one out of three of America's uninsured children, fall far short of any responsible initiative to deal with the urgent health needs of our children. We were encouraged that a strong bipartisan majority of the Finance Committee voted to include our legislation in their bill. Now we have a realistic opportunity on the floor to guarantee every American child a healthy start in life. I urge the Senate to support it. 
Congress can balance the budget with fairer Medicare changes to protect senior citizens, expanded health care for children fully paid for by an increased tobacco tax, and we can still balance the budget with fairer tax cuts to help working families. As those major battles reach the Senate floor, we will have a chance to correct the many serious injustices in the current proposals, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to do so. 
Mr. President, I have a chart about the average Medicare outlays per beneficiary. If you take the healthiest 90 percent of Medicare beneficiaries, we only spend $1,444; the sickest, 10 percent; on which we spend $36,960 a year. If we are able to reduce the sickest and those that have chronic disabilities, we can have a dramatic impact on the financial stability of our Medicare system. And we certainly ought to take a hard look at that before we start cutting the benefits, and raising copays and deductibles for those on Medicare in the way that the Finance Committee has done so in the last few days. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to join Senator Moseley-Braun and Senator Snowe as an original cosponsor of the Fair Play Act of 1997. Our goal is to ensure that women applying to college have the information they need to make decisions about sports opportunities at their colleges. This information will also enable the Department of Education to do a better job of enforcing title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination in college sports programs. 
We've made progress in the quarter century since title IX became law. But we can do better. 
Nancy Hogshead is an outstanding example of what we can accomplish. After suffering a great tragedy, she used sports to heal her body and spirit. That determination led to several Olympic medals, and Nancy gives title IX the credit for her success. 
Many other women have excelled because title IX opened the door to opportunity. Who can forget the final home run that clinched the gold medal for the women's softball team? Or the medal-winning efforts of the women's soccer team--so many stars of that team were college athletes. And, each of us watched in awe as Kerry Strug landed her vault on one foot to secure a gold medal for the women's gymnastics team. 
And we will do even better in the years ahead by ensuring that more young women in colleges in communities through across the country will have the opportunity they deserve to participate in sports. 
Title IX is an essential part of our civil rights laws. But, it is often undermined by those who still believe that women and girls should be spectators in the grandstand, not participants on the playing field. From the school gym to the Olympic stadium, if genuinely equal opportunities are available, women will take advantage of them and excel. And wherever they go from college, whatever their career, the lessons they learn in sports will serve them all their lives. 
That is why this legislation is so important. The Fair Play Act of 1997 provides students interested in sports with the information they need about the colleges and universities they will attend. As a result, more and more schools will take greater steps more rapidly to provide equal opportunities. And the Department of Education will have greater ability to assure full compliance with the law. 
The Department of Education relies on many factors to determine whether colleges and universities are meeting the standards. But additional information will help to identify problems sooner and lead to their earlier resolution. 
I look forward to working closely my colleagues in the Senate and the House to see that this legislation becomes law. Equal opportunity women in sports is an achievable goal. We know we can do a better job on this important issue, and now is the time to start doing it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, section 1314 of the State Department authorization bill reauthorizes the Au Pair Cultural Exchange Program in the United States Information Agency. 
Over the years, this program has won broad support in Congress and across the country, helping working families with their child care needs while providing valuable experience of life in America for young men and women from overseas. 
However, earlier this year, the people of Massachusetts were stunned by the tragic death of a child in Newton at the hands of a participant in the program. I wrote to USIA immediately, requesting an urgent review of current procedures for screening participants in the program and requesting USIA's recommendations for strengthening them. 
As the Senate votes today to approve this legislation, USIA is in the process of promulgating new regulations for the au pair program which will be published in the next few days. I believe that these regulations will provide greater assurance to the thousands of American families who have come to rely on this program that the au pairs who participate are better trained and better screened. I understand that the new rules will enhance the training and experience requirements for au pairs to qualify for the program. The regulations should enhance the involvement of American families in selecting the au pairs to care for their children. In addition, new regulations will ensure that au pairs are not overworked and are able to participate in educational programs that strengthens the cultural and educational exchanges at the heart of this important program. 
Finally, this program will remain under periodic review. In fact, every fifth year, a comprehensive re-examination of the program is required to determine whether the program will be continued. 
These are welcome improvements in the au pair program. They will benefit American families with child care needs, and benefit the cultural exchange programs that are such an important aspect of ours with other countries. This reauthorization is a key part of this overall bill, and I urge members of the Senate to support it.

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 7 minutes. 
Mr. President, I want to join other Members of the Senate in commending Senator Bond for his work in developing this legislation and for his strong commitment to this program. He has been interested in and committed to children over a long period of time--both in the Senate and as a Governor. I think all of us are very much aware of his leadership in the family and medical leave program a number of years ago, and in working closely with Senator Dodd and me. This legislation is another indication of his strong commitment in terms of the most vulnerable in our society--the children, and particularly those that have some very special needs in the form of defects. 
I join with him, too, in commending the March of Dimes and all of the organizations and all of the volunteers. The individuals who are part of these organizations spend hours and hours doing the hard and difficult work--knocking on doors, spending many hours away from their families in this volunteer commitment to make a difference to children. We too often forget about all of their dedication, hard work and commitment. 
I think of the families in this country whose lives in one way or another have been touched by the March of Dimes and the voluntary organizations who have been supportive of the birth defects legislation. I join in thanking them. This is really their achievement, but most importantly the achievement for children; those that are born now and those that are yet to be born in the future whose lives will be enhanced and who will be enriched and will have healthier lives because of this legislation. Also, the parents of those children who will be relieved of a great deal of the anxiety and the concern as they love those children and see these children struggling to deal with some of the really serious kinds of birth defects that affect too many in our country. 
As the good Senator has pointed out, so many of these defects are preventable. It would be one thing if they were unavoidable, but they are avoidable. If we develop the kind of approach that I think this legislation provides, we can really see an important difference made for many, many of our children. 
As Senator Bond has pointed out, more than 150,000 infants are born with serious birth defects, making birth defects the leading cause of infant mortality in the United States. Families from all racial, ethnic, and economic groups share the risk of having a child born with a serious defect. It makes no difference from what part of this country you come. The danger is there of developing the kind of defects this legislation is focused to try to prevent. 
Birth defects are also a leading cause of childhood morbidity and disability. Medical care and special education made necessary by these defects cost families and the Government billions of dollars a year and consume a disproportionate share of our health care resources. 
Large numbers, as I mentioned, of these birth defects are preventable. For most, the cause is unknown. But each year thousands of children are born with defects such as spina bifida and fetal alcohol syndrome that are largely preventable. Fetal alcohol syndrome is a leading cause of mental retardation, and it affects approximately 8,000 infants per year, yet all of these case are preventable. 
We can do much more to help States to develop surveillance programs which count the number of babies born with birth defects and identify communities and populations at higher risk. Currently, only about half the States have some kind of birth defects surveillance system in place. 
We must also develop new and effective types of early intervention which can be integrated into our public health and medical care systems. Preventing birth defects will dramatically reduce the costs of medical care, for special education, and for social services for affected individuals and families. 
The Birth Defect Prevention Act is a major step toward a national priority for surveillance, research, and prevention. The act will be overseen by the Centers for Disease Control and will provide grants to the States to establish a State-based birth defect surveillance program and establish regional centers for birth defect prevention research. 
It will provide the States with funding for demonstration projects aimed at birth defect prevention as well as technical assistance to implement programs of proven effectiveness. There will be shared information when we find out that some programs have been very effective. We will be able to get that information out to other communities. This will be powerful in terms of enhancing local communities with information that will show the advantages of some of the programs that are proven effective. 
It will broaden public and professional awareness of birth defects and prevention opportunities. There is enormous impact this can have in terms of sensitizing the whole medical profession about these needs and that can have a powerful effect in developing opportunities and modalities for prevention. 
In this congressional session we have an unprecedented opportunity to prioritize children and children's health. Along with the Hatch and Kennedy legislation that expands health insurance coverage to uninsured children and improves access to prenatal care, this act will serve to improve health, prevent disease, and enhance the lives of children and families. 
Even as we are meeting this afternoon, the Finance Committee is working through how to provide resources to the States to provide help and assistance to millions of American children that would qualify under the Medicare programs to make sure their health care needs are attended to. Senator Hatch and I are hopeful that before long we will have an opportunity again to address the Senate on our program which would ensure that good, comprehensive coverage for children in all of our States is fully funded and financed by an increase in the cigarette tax. 
We will have the additional advantage of discouraging young teenagers from smoking. 
So I again thank the Senator for his leadership and commend him for his efforts in this area. He has taken a concept and put it into legislation and passed it in a very, very short time. But it is certainly consistent with his longstanding interest with children, and we look forward to work with him on other issues as well that affect children in this country.  
Mr DODD. Mr. President, I rise to support the Birth Defects Prevention Act. I commend Senator Bond for his work on this legislation, and I am pleased to have been one of its cosponsors. I am confident that this legislation will significantly enhance our understanding of birth defects and lower the frequency with which they occur. 
Birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality in this country, and in many cases, children with birth defects face a lifetime of disability. 
The efforts of these children to cope with and overcome their disabilities are an inspiration to all of us. It is tragic, however, to think that, for so many, their struggles could have been prevented. With better education and health care for mothers, many birth defects can be avoided entirely. Yet, our country still has no national strategy for reducing the incidence of birth defects. That is why I am rising today in support of this legislation. 
At the root of our prevention efforts is the need to increase the flow of information regarding birth defects. Without well-coordinated research efforts and surveillance, outbreaks of birth defects may go undetected. 
This bill would provide Federal grants to State health authorities for the purpose of collecting and researching birth defects statistics. These grants are necessary since many States have no system in place for the monitoring of birth defects. 
This bill would also establish at least five regional research programs that would collect and analyze information on the number, incidence, and causes of birth defects. In addition, it would institute the Center for Disease Control as the coordinating agency for birth defects prevention activities by establishing a clearinghouse within the CDC to collect and store data on birth defects. The CDC would also be responsible for facilitating the coordination of research and policy development to prevent birth defects. 
But while efforts to prevent birth defects begin with education, the task of changing the behavioral patterns is far more difficult. While progress is being made in this struggle, there remains a great deal of work to be done. The findings of a March of Dimes study that was released this week provides a great illustration of this point. 
A simple 400 mg daily dose of the B vitamin folic acid could prevent 50 to 70 percent of all cases of spina bifida and anencephaly. The recent March of Dimes survey found that 66 percent of all women know the value of folic acid in fetal development, marking a 14 percent increase over the past 2 years. However, just 23 percent of all women reported taking a multivitamin before their pregnancy began. Women are learning about folic acid but not changing their behavior. 
As we all know, behavioral patterns do not change overnight, but if we continue to educate the population changes will occur, as evidenced by the fact that the number of women who smoke during pregnancy has dropped 29 percent since 1989. 
While there is nothing that can be done to prevent most birth defects, it is unconscionable that every day in America children are being born with illnesses that we could prevent, and in the most severe cases, children are dying. I urge my colleagues to make a commitment to fighting the problem of birth defects, and I ask that they join me in supporting the Birth Defects Prevention Act of 1997.

Mr. KENNEDY. Since this is the time for commendation, I would just, if I could, note that Governor Bond, then, in 1981, was effective in developing a long-range prevention, screening and health care initiative in response to Missouri's infant death rate being among the highest in the Nation, and in the 1989-90 period the Better Child Care Act that was developed here in legislation. Just looking through the Senator's achievements--and, as I mentioned earlier, his work on family and medical leave--it is a very clear indication of the Senator's very strong commitment to children. It is something all of us know here, but I think it is well worthwhile having that referenced at the time that we pass this very important piece of legislation. 
Again, I commend him and will try to find, if we can, other ways of working on children's issues as well. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in paying tribute to the nation of Israel and its courageous people on the 30th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem. 
Today, this remarkable city, with its proud history in both the ancient and the modern worlds, stands as a center of diverse religious and cultural interests. Three of the world's great religions--Christianity, Islam, and Judaism--consider Jerusalem to be a holy city, and all three have holy sites in the city. 
In 1967, following 20 years of division, Israel reunited Jerusalem during the course of its heroic victory in the Six-Day War. As the capital of Israel, Jerusalem today is a haven for persons of all ethnic and religious groups. As we join in commending Israel on this important anniversary, we also reaffirm our commitment to an undivided Jerusalem.

Mr. KENNEDY. I would inquire of the Senator from New Jersey and the ranking Democratic Senator for the Budget Committee, as he knows, on a vote of 51-49, the Senate passed the Coverdell amendment to the budget resolution, increasing aggregate budget authority in the year 2000 by $2.539 billion and function 500 budget authority in the year 2000 by the same amount. The stated purpose of the amendment was to permit States and local education agencies to create voucher programs that would take Federal dollars away from public schools and divert those Federal dollars to support private schools and religious schools. It is my understanding that the entire Coverdell amendment has now been dropped. Is that correct?

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I was listening to the comments of our friend and our majority leader with regard to the cooperative effort on the IDEA legislation, and he has correctly characterized that. He himself deserves great credit. This was worked out in a strong, bipartisan way. 
I am hopeful that we can have that same kind of cooperative effort on our children's health insurance proposal, which Senator Hatch has introduced and which I have cosponsored, which has such broad Republican and Democratic support across the country and which I believe a majority of the Members of this body, Republican and Democrat, support as well. 
The Senator made a very eloquent statement about how we want to be family friendly. I would like to see some progress for the sons and daughters of working families who are making $20,000 to $25,000. I would like to see some progress for the single heads of households with two children who are unable to afford the premium for their health insurance. Those Americans need to have what I would consider to be one of the most, if not the most important, family friendly protection, and that is to make sure that their children can have the same healthy start as do children of so many of the Members of this Congress and Senate. 
So, I know that the next business before the Senate is the cloture motion on S. 4. But I am very hopeful that we will find an opportunity to address this important proposal. The majority leader felt our amendment on the budget was inconsistent with other terms in that agreement. Yet, I would say to my friend and colleague, it was interesting yesterday when the House Members went down to see the President that they introduced a new concept, a medical savings account, which Republicans and Democrats had agreed to last year on the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, for 750,000 people. And the Republicans also proposed a limitation on punitive damages to protect doctors, even though we have some 50,000 Americans who die in hospitals every year from preventable injuries. Yet I didn't hear that that proposal was part of the budget deal. 
So, I hope, as we move forward, we will be able to gain the attention of the majority leader on the issues of children's health. The majority leader knows very well the administration is trying to help children covered by Medicaid, who are the poorest of the poor. We commend that. The Rockefeller-Chafee proposal is a bipartisan effort to target resources to make sure those children who are eligible for Medicaid will continue to be covered. We believe that proposal will cover about 3 million poor children. But we cannot forget the other 7.5 million children. Our proposal is paid for in its entirety--so we would not interfere with the general outlines that have been agreed to in the budget--with a cigarette tax, which has the added benefit of discouraging teenagers from smoking. 
I know, when the Senator was talking about the areas where there has been cooperation, I want to commend him for the great leadership he provided on IDEA. He also referenced the progress that was made last year and commended Senator Kassebaum. I look forward this year, when we pass the Hatch-Kennedy bill, to commending a similar bipartisan effort. I believe if we just had a little more favorable view from our majority leader, that proposal could go through here in incredibly rapid time. 
But I see our leader on the floor at this time, so I will withhold further comments to permit him to speak.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I join in the urging of our distinguished leader in hopes that there can be some resolution to this enormous human tragedy in the Dakotas and in parts of the Midwest. Massachusetts is not affected, Madam President, but it was not long ago that we had hurricanes that came across the Massachusetts coast, that traveled through New England and brought devastation, hardship, and plight to many communities. Many New Englanders lost their homes, their businesses, and their property. And, when the hurricanes went through South Carolina, I remember the words of our friend and colleague, Senator Hollings, who spoke on that issue so passionately. And I remember how this institution responded so quickly. I think all of us remember the tragedies caused by the recent hurricanes in Florida. Homestead Air Force Base was devastated and many of the communities in the surrounding areas were destroyed. And all of us must remember how we in the Congress reacted. 
Every American has been touched by what has happened in the Midwest. When the Senator from South Dakota speaks about this issue, as the Senator from Minnesota did yesterday, and the Senators from North Dakota did in the past few days, they are really speaking for all Americans. This is not just a regional issue, it is a national issue, and it is of national importance. I think all of us who have watched the courage and the strength of those families as they have faced this extraordinary human tragedy are challenged to say why not now? Why not take the action now? This is special. It is unique. It is a crisis. It is affecting children. It is affecting families. It is affecting elderly people. It is affecting them in many different ways, and we should be able to respond. 
I commend our colleagues from those areas, who know it best, for their very constructive recommendations. We have given them assurances from all parts of the country that we stand behind them. As we are about to use the last of the time before the cloture vote, I join with the Democratic leader in being troubled by the earlier statement that we would not see any further action on this measure today. I was unable to speak on this issue yesterday. We have other Members on the floor who want to address the Senate on S. 4, but I see the Senator from South Dakota.

Mr. KENNEDY. I will take 2 minutes, and then I will yield to our colleagues. 
On the issue, Madam President, of the so-called Family Friendly Workplace Act, I believe it is basically a cruel hoax on American workers. It is really a one-sided bill that provides maximum flexibility for employers and no flexibility for employees. It deserves no support from any Senator. It received none from any Democrat on the first cloture vote 3 weeks ago. In fact, two Republicans broke with their party to oppose cloture, and I encourage my colleagues to oppose cloture again today. 
Some have suggested that with this second cloture vote, the Republican proponents of S. 4 are simply playing out an elaborate charade. By forcing further debate on S. 4 in this way, they hope that the Ballenger bill in the House will seem less extreme. 
That strategy will fail. Less extreme is still extreme. Our Democratic alternative--and I pay tribute to Senator Baucus, Senator Landrieu, and Senator Kerrey for the development of that alternative--remedies the gross defects of both the Ashcroft Senate bill and the Ballenger House bill. It is a realistic approach to comptime that is not slanted in favor of employers and against employees. It is the only comptime bill that is worth the name and it deserves to pass. 
The Democratic alternative is superior in many ways. First, it protects the 40-hour week, while the Ashcroft bill abolishes that fundamental principle. 
Second, our alternative forbids discrimination against workers who need overtime pay and cannot afford to take the time off instead. The Ashcroft bill permits employers to assign all the overtime work to employees who will accept comptime. 
Third, the Democratic alternative guarantees employees the right to use comptime when they need it the most. That is the key element. The employees have the right, that is the key in any evaluation of which bill deserves support. The alternative provides that the employees have the right to use the time when they need it. The Ashcroft bill does not give employees a right to use the comptime even in the most serious family or medical emergencies. 
Finally, the Democratic alternative imposes no pay cut on working families, while the Ashcroft bill would reduce workers' wages substantially. 
For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture. The Ashcroft paycheck reduction act does nothing for working women. It does nothing for working men. It does nothing for working families. It should be rejected out of hand, and I urge my colleagues to do so.

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 2 1/2 minutes. 
Madam President, I want to just end up this debate by talking about women in our work force. 
Madam President, 38 percent of hourly workers earning overtime pay are women; 11.6 million women work over 40 hours each week. This is 22 percent of all working women. Why do they work more than 40 hours a week? Because they need the overtime pay. 
And 6.2 million women work over 48 hours a week each week. This is 12 percent of all working women. Why? Because they need the overtime. They need the pay. 
And 3.6 million multiple job holders are women. This is 47 percent of all job holders. More women are getting second jobs. Why? Because they need the overtime pay. 
And 1.8 million women hold two or more jobs and work over 44 hours each week. This is half of all women with two or more jobs. Why? Because they need the money. 
The Ashcroft proposal abolishes the 40-hour week. Those women would not get the overtime because this bill abolishes the 40-hour week. 
Under the Ashcroft proposal, the decision about whether employees will be able to take the time off is left to the employer. This is not the case under the Landrieu and Baucus and Kerrey bill, where the employee makes the decision. This is not the case under the Murray amendment, where the employee makes the decision whether to take a maximum of 24 hours over the course of the year. That amendment was defeated in our committee. Why? Because the employee makes the decision. 
This bill is a pay reduction act for those women. That is why every women's organization that has fought for economic opportunity and progress for women--whether it be the minimum wage, the day-care program, pay equity, right across the board--every women's organization has condemned this bill because of what it would mean for working women. 
Madam President, I hope that the cloture vote will fail. This bill does not deserve the support of this body. We have an alternative that will address those issues. And with the leadership of Senators Landrieu, Baucus, and Kerrey, that is the way we should go. 
I yield the balance of my time.

Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator would not share my regret to Senator Thurmond for being unable to make these comments, I was unable to because of Senate business on the floor earlier today and intended to make these comments this afternoon. I hope he would understand that they are included in the Record, and I regret that I am denied the opportunity to make them here on the floor. It is a very unusual process of procedure in terms of senatorial courtesy. But if that is the way that is going to be, so be it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join in these tributes to our distinguished colleague, Senator Thurmond and his extraordinary record of service to the people of South Carolina and the Nation. 
In a very real sense, Senator Thurmond is the Cal Ripken of the Senate. He has set a record of longevity in the Senate that few if any of us ever thought would be broken. His service to the Senate extends over four decades, and we honor him today for that remarkable record of success in public service and his enduring commitment to the Nation's highest ideals. 
Senator Thurmond and I have served together for many of these years on both the Judiciary Committee and the Armed Services Committee. He was chairman of the Judiciary Committee for 6 years in the 1980's and the ranking Republican on the committee for many other years, and he was always impressive and fair in dealing with all aspects of the committee's work. 
Although we have often disagreed on the issues, we have also worked closely together on many important challenges. I think particularly of our decade-long effort together on the Judiciary Committee to achieve Federal criminal law reform, especially with respect to laws on bail and sentencing. Our success in that important effort is an excellent example of the ability of Democrats and Republicans to achieve common ground and deal effectively with major problems facing the Nation. 
In recent years, when South Carolina bore the brunt of the tragic epidemic of church arsons, Congress enacted bipartisan legislation to deal with these shocking crimes, and Senator Thurmond played a vital role in obtaining the resources needed for an effective response. 
We have also worked closely on a wide range of immigration and refugee issues on the Judiciary Committee. His leadership was indispensable for the enactment of the landmark Refugee Act of 1980--the Nation's first comprehensive refugee law. its passage would not have been possible without him. 
Senator Thurmond has also dedicated his life, both in and out of the Senate, to protecting our national security, and I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to his personal courage, heroism, and patriotism. Even though he was a sitting circuit court judge in South Carolina, he did not hesitate to enlist in the Army on the very day that the United States declared war against Germany in 1941. He served in Europe with great distinction, parachuting into Normandy with the 82d Airborne Division during the D-day invasion. He earned five battle stars and numerous other medals and awards, including the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star, and the Purple Heart. 
Like President Kennedy, he is a member of the generation that went to distant lands to preserve America's freedom in World War II, and his public service here at home has been dedicated to preserving that freedom ever since. 
As a member and now chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, he continues to demonstrate his strong commitment to providing our Armed Forces with the equipment, training, leadership, and quality of life that they need to make the Nation's military the world's finest. 
On this auspicious occasion, I commend Senator Thurmond for his leadership and statesmanship and unparalleled record of public service, and I extend my warmest congratulations to the Senator and his family. I value his friendship, and I look forward to continuing to work closely with him in the years to come.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is privilege to take this opportunity to commend Superintendent Bill Shields for his 32 years of distinguished leadership in the National Park Service. His service has been renowned in many different aspects of the park system, and every region of the country is in his debt. 
One of the biggest challenges Bill has faced has been managing national parks in urban settings. In fact, Bill spent the majority of his career in urban park environments, and he has met special needs of these parks with great skill, wisdom, and understanding. As superintendent of Rock Creek Park, he had jurisdiction over 95 separate local parks which are prized by communities throughout the Washington area. He has skillfully balanced the needs of the parks with the needs of the general public and park neighborhoods. With parks such as Meridian Hill and Montrose and Dumbarton Oaks, he has dealt with many complex issues with diplomacy and exceptional judgment. 
Bill Shield's retirement after 32 years with the Park Service will be a great loss. But because of his guidance and leadership, many parks in the Nation, and especially in the Nation's Capital, will be enhanced and preserved for future generations.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we start off today on this issue, I remind our colleagues and friends, there was really no effort on anyone's part to delay the consideration of this legislation. If you go back and review the amount of time we have taken on the legislation, you will find no more than 4 or 6 hours of debate in total on the Senate floor. 
We are being faced now with the bill is being brought up this afternoon with a cloture motion. We have already been notified there will be no time tomorrow morning as the Senate will pause to pay tribute to an outstanding Senator, our good friend and colleague, Senator Thurmond, who has had a long record in the Senate. We also know that we will be displaced tomorrow afternoon should the budget report come back before the Senate. 
So we are in a situation where this legislation is put in the Chamber, pulled back, put in, pulled back, put in, and then a cloture petition is filed. We had a series of amendments that were offered in the Labor Committee. These amendments have been filed on the floor as well. I will address the purposes of these amendments later. We voted on this bill in the committee, and there was no effort to delay. There were only, I believe, six or eight amendments, and I think there have been just about that number that Senators on this side of the aisle have filed on the legislation. So we should be under no illusion that there is any interest in undue delay on the measure. 
Madam President, it is very difficult to disagree with the needs of the parents in the situations described by my good friend and colleague from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, or my friend from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft. They discuss cases where the parent needs a little extra time for the meeting with the schoolteachers or for the dental appointment or for other kinds of activities. We are all in agreement on the importance of those needs. 
But that is not what this bill is all about. That is what the Federal employees protections are all about, which we support, but that is not what this legislation is all about. I will just take a few minutes to review what this bill provides. 
I would think reasonable people could say that we should not abolish the 40-hour workweek, which has been in effect for nearly 60 years to protect workers from exploitation--that is why it was put into effect. We all understand the need to look at the new global economy and consider new programs, but I do not think we ought to get away from old values. The old values were that 40 hours of hard work for men and women in this country is enough over the course of the week if workers are going to have any time at all for their families. If employees need to work overtime, they should be compensated at time-and-a-half in order to provide additional income for the family, particularly because they are going to be denied the opportunity to be with that family. 
So, if we are going to abolish the 40-hour workweek, I think 
we need to understand where we are going. That has been a protection for many, many years. If we are going to abolish overtime pay in a 2-week period, as this bill does, I think we ought to be able to discuss that. I think it is fair to review once again who really has the whip hand in deciding whether that worker is going to be able to get time off to participate in that teacher conference or see that school play. Is it the employee? Or can the employer just say, no, you are not going to be able to do that. Then what recourse is available to that employee? You would think that two people sitting down would be able to work out an accommodation so that one person would be able to go to that teacher conference, but if the employer is able to say, no, you cannot go, how does that benefit the employee? There is virtually no hindrance to that employer simply saying, well, you are just not getting off next week or the week after for that basketball game or for that teacher conference. There is no remedy. If the employee had the decision, then we would be talking about an entirely different bill. 
That is not what is before us in S.4. That is not what is before us. That is why I think we ought to be cautious when we talk about ending the 40-hour workweek, when we talk about ending any premium pay for overtime with the flexible credit hours in this legislation, and when we skew the decisionmaking process in favor of the employer rather than the employee. It seems to me that we ought to examine this and try to address it. That is what I want to speak about this afternoon, about the different amendments that have been advanced and which I hope will be included in the bill. Then I hope the legislation will move forward. I would like just to mention those this afternoon to the Senate. 
Prior to the recess, the sponsors of S. 4 attempted to invoke cloture, and they failed badly, not by one or two votes but by seven votes. Every Democrat opposed cloture because the provisions of S. 4 are clearly hostile to working men and women. Two courageous Republicans broke with their party and joined with us in opposing cloture. That vote should have sent a strong signal to the Republican leadership that their bill contains provisions which are unacceptable to a great many Senators. 
Those 47 Senators who opposed cloture will not allow the advocates of S. 4 to eliminate the 40-hour workweek. Those Senators will not allow the sponsors of S. 4 to impose a pay cut on American workers, and that is what this legislation is really all about. Those Senators will insist upon a comptime bill which is fair to working men and women, one which allows employees--employees--to make the real decisions and choices. 
Whether we take 1 more cloture vote or 10 more cloture votes, the result, I believe, will be the same. It should be clear to all Senators that the extreme provisions of S. 4 will never be approved by the Senate and they will never become law. 
That is why many of us had hoped by now the advocates of S. 4 would have moved away from their extreme position toward a more moderate, reasonable comptime proposal. 
The real debate in the Senate has never been about whether workers needed more flexible schedules. All 100 Senators could concur in that goal. What this debate has been about is how best to provide that flexibility, how to design a system which genuinely empowers workers rather than enhancing the control of their bosses. It is time to turn to the real issues. What are the standards by which we should evaluate a comptime proposal? I think it would be useful if we could establish fairness as the criterion and then make the decision as to what legislation advances that goal. I believe there are certain basic questions of fairness which should be asked about each of the pending comptime proposals. Does the proposal prevent an employer from discriminating in allocating overtime work between those workers who choose time off and those who choose overtime pay? Will it reduce the pay of employees who are currently working overtime and want to continue to receive overtime pay? Is the proposal designed to ensure that those workers who choose comptime actually get a net 
increase in time off to spend with their families? Does the plan protect employees who use comptime from any reduction in their health or retirement benefits? Does the legislation contain strong penalties to deter employer misconduct in the operation of the comptime program? Is the value of an employee's accrued comptime protected if the employer should become insolvent? 
The answers to these questions will tell us whether a particular version of comptime will truly empower workers. The Republican bill flunks this simple test. S. 4 does not give the workers real choices. It gives the employer the final say on when employees can use their accrued comptime. It will result in a pay cut, and it jeopardizes the health and retirement benefits of many workers. It will not even guarantee that those who use comptime get a net increase in the amount of time off they have to spend with their families. And the Ashcroft bill would abolish the 40-hour workweek, one of the most fundamental principles of American labor law for nearly 60 years. 
Fortunately for American working men and women, there is a comptime proposal which passes this fairness test. The Democratic comptime proposal offered by Senator Baucus, Senator Kerrey, and Senator Landrieu guarantees the genuine employee choice, which the Republican bill fails to provide. 
The substitute corrects the most serious defects in the Ashcroft bill. It incorporates many of the ideas proposed by the Democratic members of the Labor Committee as amendments during the markup. Unfortunately, each was rejected on a party line vote. Let me highlight the key improvements. 
First, the 40-hour week is preserved. This bedrock principle would be eliminated by the Republican bill. The Democratic alternative preserves the 40-hour workweek and ensures that every hourly employee who works more than 40 hours will receive time-and-a-half in either pay or comptime. If the real purpose of comptime legislation is to provide employees with the option of additional time off in lieu of extra pay, it should not reduce the historic standard of compensation for overtime worked. The Republican bill would result in both lower pay and less time off for workers than the Democratic alternative. It is easy to see which piece of legislation is truly family friendly. 
Second, the Democratic proposal makes it illegal for employers to discriminate in allocating overtime work. Employers would have to make overtime work equally available to those employees who want to receive overtime pay and those who want to receive comptime. This is an essential protection for workers who have been receiving overtime pay and need the money. Nearly half of the hourly workers earn $16,000 a year or less; 80 percent of them earn less than $28,000. Overtime pay on average constitutes 10 or 15 percent of their annual income. Their families need those dollars to make ends meet. The Republican bill would allow an employer to offer all the overtime work to those employees who choose comptime and none to those who choose extra pay. In many businesses, S. 4 would mean the end of overtime pay. Such discrimination is terribly wrong, yet the Ashcroft bill would allow it. The Democratic alternative makes this discrimination illegal, and it is easy to see which legislation is truly family friendly. 
On that point, we offered an amendment in the committee to try to address that issue and it was rejected on a straight party line vote.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, thirdly, any creditable proposal to deal with employees' desire for more time off to spend with their families must ensure the employee can take the time when he or she needs it most. A working mother needs a particular day off so she can accompany her child to a school event or doctor's appointment, not a day when it is convenient for her boss. Nothing in the Republican proposal requires the employer to give her the day she requests. He can deny her request and she has no effective recourse. The Democratic alternative provides for real employee choice in using accrued comptime. 
If the time off is needed to care for a sick child or other family member, the employee has an absolute right to take the time. When the time is being used for other reasons, the employee can take the time if he or she has given 2 weeks notice and the absence will not cause substantial and grievous injury to the business. The difference between the Democratic and the Republican positions on this crucial issue is dramatic. Under the Democratic plan, employees can take the time when they need the time, and it is easy to see which proposal is truly family friendly. 
We saw the resistance of our Republican friends to the very modest amendment of our friend and colleague, Senator Murray from the State of Washington, that said let's just have a 24-hour guarantee that a mother or father who is working would be able to take up to 24 hours to go to a parent-teacher conference or go to a school event--just 24 hours. That was rejected. And why? The reason it was rejected, I believe, is because it provided for the employees' protection. 
You can say all you want that this legislation leaves it up to the employee, but the fact is, it does not. If those who support S. 4 say that it does, we have the clarifying language to make sure it does do that. But they resisted that in the markup; they resisted the very reasonable proposal of the Senator from Washington for a 24-hour period over the course of a year. That would have given the discretion to the employee. Republicans resisted it because, under their proposal, the employer is going to be the one who makes that decision. That, I believe, is a very important and significant difference. 
Fourth, if employees are really going to be able to increase the amount of time spent with their families, comptime hours must count as hours worked. The way the Ashcroft bill is drafted, if an employee uses earned comptime to take Monday off, she can still be required to work 40 hours during that week. The boss can require her to work on Saturday and not even have it count as overtime. 
I want my colleagues to understand that the boss can say, `OK, you can take comptime off on Monday,' and then can say, `Well, you will work on Saturday,' and not even have it count as overtime pay. That can be 48 hours during that one week. Of course, the bill eliminates the 40-hour workweek in any event, so there are any number of hours that employees can be forced to work. Or, the employer can require the employee to work 10 hours a day Tuesday through Friday and not have it count as overtime. Thus, under the Republican comptime scheme, she would not even gain extra time to be with her child. The hours gained on Monday would be lost by Saturday. There would be no net benefit in time off to the employee. This absurd result is due to the fact that the authors of S. 4 have refused to count hours of comptime as hours worked. That little change, comptime as hours worked, would avoid that. We offered that as an amendment. It was rejected. My Republican colleagues rejected an amendment to give the employees the ability to make the decision about the time off. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle rejected our amendment to count comptime hours when used as hours worked, which would provide that protection from exploitation. That was rejected by the supporters of S. 4. Thus, the employees using the comptime will enjoy no increase in their free time. Our Democratic alternative provides that protection. Again, it is easy to see which proposal is truly family friendly. 
The Baucus-Kerrey-Landrieu legislation corrects a number of other flaws in S. 4 as well. It shows how hollow the promise of the Ashcroft bill really is. This debate has never been about whether employees needed the option of more time off. We all agree, as I mentioned earlier, that they deserve more time to spend with their families. The debate has always been about how to make that opportunity real. It is about how to truly empower workers, not how to give increased control to their bosses. The Democratic alternative achieves the goal of empowering workers; the Republican bill falls dramatically short. 
Madam President, with those kinds of alterations or changes, we would have legislation that would be out of here in very short order. It seems to me that if we are going to do what is the stated purpose of this legislation--to give the employees the power to be able to make those decisions, to make sure they are protected in terms of hourly pay--then we need to provide those protections. We need to prevent discrimination against workers where the employer says, `I'm always going to give overtime work to Jimmy here because he always takes the comptime, and I'm not going to give any to Sally because she always takes the overtime and I don't want to pay that out.' We just need to provide some protection so we don't have that kind of discrimination. 
These are basic elements of protection for employees. Every one of these proposals that I have mentioned provides additional power to the employee. As I understand it, having listened to the debate, giving employees some power is the primary reason at least some say they support this legislation. 
I think it is important to emphasize the extent of flexibility in the 40-hour workweek at the present time. If employers--and this is today--genuinely want to provide family friendly arrangements, they can do so under current law. The key is the 40-hour week. Normally, employees work five 8-hour days a week, but more flexible arrangements are possible. Employers can schedule workers for four 10-hour days a week with the 5th day off and pay them the regular hourly rate for each hour. No time-and-a-half is required. They can arrange a work schedule of four 9-hour days plus a 4-hour day on the 5th day so they can have Friday afternoons off, again without paying a dime of overtime. That can be worked out today without a dime of overtime. 
Under the current law, some employees can even vary their hours enough to have a 3-day weekend every other week. Once again, the employer does not have to pay a dime of overtime. That flexibility is totally legal under current law. 
Employers can also offer genuine flextime. This allows employers to schedule an 8-hour day around core hours of, say, from 10 to 3. Let employees decide whether they want to work from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. or from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. This is a very popular option for Federal employees. This, too, costs employers not a penny more. But only a tiny fraction of employers use these or many other flexible arrangements available under the current law. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found that only 10 percent of hourly employees are allowed to use these or other flexible schedules. Only 10 percent. We hear S. 4's proponents say, `Let's give them half the day off on Friday, let's give them more flexibility during the course of the week, let's let them have an extra day off every other week'--all that is possible today, without a dime of overtime. You know something? Only 10 percent of employees are permitted to do that at the present time. Current law offers a host of family friendly flexible schedules, yet virtually no employers provide them.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, this isn't just my own conclusion. The observations made today reflect a wide range of different groups, those groups primarily that have been fighting for the working men and women of this country. The groups opposing this bill include not only the League of Women Voters, but the National Women's Political Caucus, the National Council of Senior Citizens, the National Council of Churches, and the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund. The list goes on and on, for these reasons: this bill, S. 4, gives the ultimate decision to the employer rather than the employee. 
This isn't Federal employees where the employee has the right to take the time off. This is a different arrangement which, under any fair reading, would give the employer the control. Without the protections that I have mentioned, this would be the result. 
We have to ask today whether we want to risk abolishing the 40-hour workweek, effectively abolishing overtime pay for workers who are on the lower rungs of the economic ladder. Some 60 percent of those workers earn $16,000 a year; 65 percent of them have no college education. In so many instances, they are working not just one job but two or three jobs in order to make ends meet. Those are people who are struggling at the bottom rung of the ladder and depend upon the overtime just to get those resources to be able to try to bring up a family. Sure, they would like to spend more time with their family and, sure, they ought to have some opportunity to do that. We support that. But we are going to make sure that when that judgment is made, that that employee is the one who is going to make the judgment, not the employer because they want to see a pay cut for hard-working Americans. 
That is basically what the issue is before us in the U.S. Senate. Without these kinds of protections that we have talked about today, that would be the result, a significant pay cut for those that are working on the bottom economic rungs of the ladder. That is wrong. That is unfair. 
The measure that has been introduced by the Democrats as a substitute provides protections to deal with those issues. But we have been unable to be able to get acceptance of that proposal. Therefore, we stand in opposition to S. 4.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I was very interested in the comments that the good Senator was making, saying this is a completely voluntary provision. Let me point this out. If an individual worker says, `Well, if I'm going to work overtime, I want my time and a half. And, therefore, since the system is completely voluntary, I'm not going to sign up for the comptime. I'm not going to sign up for flextime. I'm going to maintain the 
40-hour week, and anybody who thinks that this is going to allow discrimination just doesn't understand it because I'm going to be able to maintain my rights.' 
Well, that is a wonderful rhetorical statement, but it just does not take into account what is happening out in the workplace. Because you have Johnny over here who says, `I'm going to maintain my rights, I'm not going to let the employer decide when I can take comptime or flextime. I'm going to take the overtime pay after 40 hours a week.' The employer says, `OK, if you do that, I'm going to give the work to Bill and Harry over here. So you, Johnny, you're not going to get any overtime work because Bill and Harry are going to take comptime and they're going to take flextime. So you'll never get overtime work as you get today.' 
That is the reality of the workplace. You can stand up here all day long--and I have heard Senators say, `This is completely voluntary, because if I don't want to participate I don't have to. I'll be protected by the 40-hour week. I'll be able to get my overtime.' But that does not reflect what is happening out there in the workplace today. 
You have the three workers. He says, `I'm going to stick with the 40-hour week. And I want my overtime pay.' The others say, `I'll do the flextime. 
I will not take the overtime,' The flexible credit hour provision provides what they call straight time, which means they will work overtime but they will still get paid the same amount they got for the first 40 hours. That is in the bill. Or the next one says, `I will take that in comptime and I will take that time off next week.' 
Now, who is the employer going to choose when it comes to awarding overtime work? What the Democrats said is, `OK, if you are going for these programs, we want a provision in there that you will not discriminate against that person who needs the overtime pay.' Were the Republicans willing to take that? Absolutely not. Absolutely not. The Republicans claim that workers are going to be able to make a decision on their own, without coercion. But the fact is that they are going to be discriminated against in the workplace because they are not going along. When we tried to remedy that situation with an amendment, the Republicans said no. 
Now, I find it difficult to believe that this is really voluntary and it really will not affect those workers who do not want to participate. Of course it will affect those workers. They will have their pay cut because they will never get the overtime work. Those who need the overtime pay the most will never be assigned overtime work again. They will be hurt the worst. 
That is why we are trying to bring in that provision, so we will not discriminate. This bill allows that. I think it demonstrates what the bill's real purpose is. 
This is, basically, Madam President, about reducing overtime pay. That is the testimony we had before the committee. The National Federation of Independent Business, one of the prime organizations that supports this told our committee that `Small businesses can't afford to pay overtime.' That was the National Federation of Independent Businesses's explanation of why they support this bill. 
Who are the people affected by this legislation? To understand the real-world impact of the bill, you have to look at the workers currently depending on overtime pay to make ends meet. Forty-four percent of those who depend on overtime earn $16,000 a year or less. More than 80 percent have annual earnings of less than $28,000 a year. That is, 80 percent of them earn less than $28,000 a year. A single mom with two children, $28,000 a year. That is at the top level of those who are working overtime. These are people who need every dollar they can earn just to make ends meet, men and women supporting families. 
If this bill passes, many will lose the overtime dollars they need so badly. Employers will give all the work to the employees who agree to take the comptime. There will not be overtime work for those who insist on being paid. 
Under the Ashcroft bill, discrimination in awarding overtime work will be perfectly legal. Does anyone honestly believe it will not happen? Does anyone honestly believe if the employer has the choice between paying someone 1 1/2 times or paying someone in flexible credit hours, which is straight time, does anybody believe the employer will not choose the less expensive option?

Mr. KENNEDY. Then why do you not add the word `discrimination'? If you added that this afternoon, that would be real progress. I think there is a difference between coercion and discrimination. Without coercing somebody, I can say I will not give overtime work to that person. That is not coercing that person, as I interpret it. That is discriminating against that person because they will not take comptime or they will not go along with the flexible credit hours, which is straight time. I call that discrimination, not coercion.

Mr. KENNEDY. I would be more than glad to offer that amendment this afternoon to make that clear, and we could accept that this afternoon and move ahead. I would consider that very important. 
With all respect to the Senator, I find an important difference in the definitions of coercion and discrimination. If the Senator believes that other parts of the bill's definition of coercion somehow prohibit discrimination, and therefore employers cannot discriminate, perhaps we could clarify that issue by using those words, discrimination. If we could achieve that, we would have made very important progress. I offered an amendment to accomplish precisely this. My amendment made it unlawful for an employer `to qualify the availability of work for which monetary overtime compensation is required upon the request of an employee for acceptance of compensatory time off in lieu of monetary overtime pay.' So if you are willing to include those words, I think we would have made some very important progress. That is one of the important improvements that we are trying to achieve.

Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate the Senator's position on that. I do feel that has to be spelled out in the legislation because of the types of industries that we have been talking about here, for those individuals working in those industries have been subject to a great deal of exploitation, as the Senator knows--I will not take the time now, because I mentioned it earlier--both in terms of meeting minimum wage standards and also in terms of overtime 
standards. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of workers every single year. 
I certainly appreciate what the Senator says about his desire to make sure that the legislation is not going to lend itself to exploitation. It is my own experience, and I think the experience of many others, particularly those people who are working in those working conditions, that there would be, in too many instances, a contrary result. I am sure there will be many employers who would not abuse this system, but I think we need to provide those kinds of protections. We will welcome the chance to work on this. 
I was addressing, Madam President, the overtime provisions. I will not be long. It does reflect the vulnerability of these individuals in the work force. We are talking about these individuals who do not have the protection of any of the unions and are subject to, in too many instances, harsh working conditions. 
As I mentioned, the people who will be hurt the most are the most vulnerable workers. Fifty-six percent have only a high school diploma or less. You know how hard it is to get ahead, no matter how hard you work, without more education. Millions who rely on overtime earn only the minimum wage. Sixty percent of them are women. One-third of them are the sole breadwinner in their families, and 2.3 million children rely on parents who earn the minimum wage, parents who hope their children will not get sick because they cannot afford a doctor and cannot afford the health insurance. 
Interviews conducted by the Women's Legal Defense Fund demonstrate the sacrifice American women make in support of corporate flexibility, such as a waitress who is involuntarily changed to a night shift despite the fact she has no child care for evening hours. One working mom says, `My life feels I am wearing shoes two sizes too small.' Thousands of these workers already work two jobs to make ends meet, and they need to work every hour they can. 
Let me give a few examples of these people: 400,000, half of them women, work two jobs in the food service industry; 200,000 are cleaning and building maintenance workers. These are classic low-wage jobs. These employees really need the money they earn from overtime. 
We discussed in our committee how the new economy, Madam President, was creating two categories of workers. The highly educated people are doing well, but those with limited education are struggling, and it is increasingly difficult for them to earn a good living. They depend on overtime. Their jobs are hard, but they perform them with dignity and commitment. They are doing their best to provide for their families. We cannot pass a bill to allow employers to cut the pay those workers receive now. 
Madam President, I think if we were to go across the face of this country, we would find that most workers feel they are working longer hours. They are working longer hours than they were 20 years ago, about 200 hours a year more than they were working 20 years ago. Most of them feel they are working longer, they are working harder, and they are not making much progress toward reaching the American dream. 
I saw the National Association of Business Economists was talking about poll results that for the first time found that more than half of the American people believe that the future for their children is not going to be as good as their own standard of living. We have always, as a country and a society, believed that future generations were going to have better opportunities for success, and there are a variety of measures that impact the well-being of those workers. Obviously, there are wages, the key element; the education of their children; decent health care; whether they will have any kind of pension system down the road. Of course, very, very few of these workers, ever have any kind of pension. That does not exist for the kind of workers we are talking about here today. The challenges they are facing in terms of inner cities, of rural communities, in terms of safety and security, wondering about the air they breathe, the water they drink, all of those issues are out there. They are facing an extraordinarily challenging time for themselves and for their families, working harder and not getting very far ahead. 
Now we are asking them to roll the dice on legislation. Will we offer them legislation that will abolish what protection those workers have under the 40-hour week, and allow employers to tell them they will work 60 hours 1 week and 20 hours the next? Or will we give workers the right to decide whether they want to work longer and maybe get that additional money, maybe not see their children as much, but at the least offer their children a better quality of life? 
Sixty hours of work in one week--where are workers going to get the day care under such a schedule? Where are they going to be during that week if their child gets sick? How does it help them to work 20 hours the next week? 
The key to this legislation is very clear. What is the power of the employee? Is the employee going to be making the judgment, as provided in the Democratic alternative bill, as to when that time can be taken off? Or is it going to be the employer who will choose, as S. 4 provides? The Ashcroft bill says that, when an employee has accrued the comp time and wants to use it, the employee `shall be permitted by the employer of the employee to use it within a reasonable period of time.' 
Does that mean workers are going to be guaranteed the ability to go to that school meeting next Monday afternoon, or go to the dentist a week from Wednesday, or go to that school play, or go to that athletic event in the middle of next week? It says, `shall be permitted by the employer of the employee to use such time within a reasonable period after making the request, if the use of the time does not unduly disrupt.' What is unduly disrupt? The employer says, `I have to get those products out to the market. We can't have you leaving in the middle of next week.' That is the end of the story. Is there any opportunity for this employee to say, `Wait a minute; let someone else, a neutral person, make a decision on this?' Absolutely not. The employer makes that judgment. It is stated here. 
If the employer makes that judgment that the employee's use of comptime will unduly disrupt, he will give the time off 3 weeks from now rather than the time when that individual wants and needs it. Those are the provisions of the legislation. It does not give the choice to the employee. 
That is the dramatic difference between this bill and the bill that has been proposed by the Democrats. The Democratic alternative would provide for the employee to be able to take that time. It would guarantee that workers could take that time if they needed it to take care of a sick child or a family member. That is an absolute right. And when the time is being used for the other reasons; that is, the ball game, the parent-teacher conference, the employee can take the time off if she has given at least 2 weeks notice and the use of the time will not cause grievous injury to the business. That is the difference. 
Are we going to risk abolishing the 40-hour week, or are we willing to give the employee greater flexibility to be able to do the kinds of things that have been identified which parents want to do and need to do for their children's upbringing? That is the basic question. 
I think we ought to at least be able to consider the Democratic alternative before we obtain cloture. I understand that we would not be able to consider the Democratic alternative prior to cloture. 
It is my understanding that we will be having a cloture motion filed this afternoon.

Mr. KENNEDY. I listened with great interest to my friend and colleague. I will be glad over the evening to examine further that 4 percent of the workers, if I quote the Senator right, who regularly get overtime and are women. We debated the increase in the minimum wage last year going from $4.25 an hour up to $5.15 an hour, and we found out that two-thirds of them were women. I cannot believe that these are not individuals who are working the overtime. Maybe we have a semantic disagreement, but it is difficult for me to believe at this time that only 4 percent of the overtime is being made by women in this country.

Mr. KENNEDY. I have heard that and I will try to review over the evening what we have in terms of those regularly working overtime, how those matters are defined, because it is virtually impossible for me to believe that the majority of the hourly workers are not women in our society. It is just very, very difficult. And that the majority of overtime hours worked is not worked by women. 
Now, Mr. President, I am someone who was here strongly in support of the Family and Medical Leave Act. I supported the leadership that was provided by my friend and colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, who is the real leader on this issue. When we proposed that legislation, we tried to start out with a limited program that provided pay for people who used family and medical leave. Every other industrialized country in the world provides paid leave. We were absolutely stopped in our tracks by Republican opposition. Now we hear on the floor this afternoon, can you imagine, that someone who uses family and medical leave is going to have to go on welfare to use it. I wish we did provide some financial help when workers use leave for the type of family emergency that the Senator has pointed out. Every other industrialized society provides that kind of reimbursement. But we met total Republican opposition to that proposal. And American workers do not get paid family and medical leave. 
It is difficult for me to understand, with all respect to my colleague, why it is worth more to that worker to work for compensatory time so that they will be able to take the time off, should they be given the chance to use it, in looking after a sick child rather than getting time and a half and putting the money in their pocket and having it in their pocket when that medical emergency happens. It seems to me that ought to be the choice that people would want to have. The Senator is saying, well, we are giving them a new opportunity. They can work and not even put that money in their pocket. 
I don't find that very convincing. 
Mr. President, as the Senator has pointed out, we have mentioned Federal employees a number of times. I will just read the statute governing Federal employees. In this instance, the statute refers to flexible credit hours. In the Federal program, `Credit hours means flexible schedule which are in excess of the employee's basic . . . and which the employee elects to work.' The employee elects to work. 
In the Senator's bill, it is the employer and the employee who jointly designate hours. That is a big difference. I am all for Federal employees making the decision, but I am not for S. 4, which provides that the time off shall be permitted by the employer instead of the employee. That is what it says. Time off shall be permitted by the employer instead of the employee, for the employee to use within a reasonable period of time after making the request. The example that was given by Senator Ashcroft is actually protected by the Democratic substitute bill. 
In the substitute bill, it provides that if the time off is needed to care for a sick child or other family member, the employee has an absolute right to take the time. Put that in your bill, I say to the Senator; put that in your bill. Put it in this afternoon; put it in right now. We just heard that story. Put it in right now. Put in the other provision on nondiscrimination that you mentioned. Discrimination, is it the same as coercion? Yes, it is; no, it isn't. Put in those words. Put in now just what I read here from my amendment; put that right in. If the time off is needed to care for a sick child or other family member, the employee has an absolute right to take the time. That is not in the Ashcroft bill. That is not in the Ashcroft bill, and he cannot stand up on the floor of the U.S. Senate this afternoon and say it is. 
So that parent out there who may be listening to this debate, read what is in the bill. You don't have the guarantee under his bill to use the time for your desperately ill children. You do under the Democratic alternative. It is written right in there. If the time off is needed to care for a sick child or other family member, the employee has an absolute right to take the time. When the time is being used for other reasons, the employee can take the time if he or she has given 2 weeks advance notice and the absence will not cause grievous injury to the business. The presumption is in favor of the employee. That is not in the Ashcroft bill. 
That is the essence of this, after all is said and done, Mr. President. Those are really essential parts: whether we are going to risk abolishing the 40-hour week, and the dangers that will take place without specifying that the employer cannot discriminate against those workers who refuse to play ball with the employer, and that makes the decision primarily a decision to be made by the employer. I think that is really the essence of the difference in our approaches. 
I commend my colleagues on our side for studying this issue, for providing the protection for all employees, giving the employee the kind of protections that they need to assure that comp time hours when used will be considered hours worked so they are not going to be shortchanged at the end of the week. These are the kind of protections that exist for Federal employees. That protection was in our amendment. That was rejected. That was rejected by our Republican friends in the markup. We have offered it. We will offer it again. We will have a chance to do that. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the chance for this debate and discussion. The conditions affecting working families in this country are enormously important. We have seen the assaults that have been made on the earned-income tax credit. 
We have seen the assaults that have been made with regard to increasing the minimum wage. 
We have seen assaults made in terms of some of the education programs in the last Congress. 
And we have seen the assaults made in terms of the pay that goes to those who work in the construction trades, who average 
$28,000 a year, protections in terms of the prevailing wage not being undermined. 
These are all working families in this country. It doesn't seem they have too much protection. They have, in many instances, too little. I believe that this proposal will substantially reduce the amount of overtime that is paid to workers who are willing to work hard, play by the rules, and try to make that little extra money to be able to provide for their families.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with reluctance, I oppose this budget resolution. It has many worthwhile features, and I am hopeful that as the process continues, it can be significantly improved. In its current version, it has too many obvious defects. 
It contains excessive tax cuts that are likely to balloon in the future and lead to massive new deficits that make the pledge of a genuinely balanced budget a hollow promise. It fails to ask the rich to make a fair contribution to reducing the deficit, and rewards them with massive tax breaks instead. It threatens the system that delivers health care to the elderly. It contains excessive reductions in the needed level of public investment. And it does not do enough to provide health insurance coverage to the 10 million children without such coverage today. 
The last time a budget promised balance and large, ballooning tax cuts at the same time was the Reagan budget of 1981. And the tax cuts in this budget do balloon in the future. As a May 21 study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities shows, the tax cuts in the budget are growing at a rate of 32 percent in the final 2 years of the first 10-year period. That study also indicated that the tax cuts are likely to cost about $650 billion, nearly two-thirds of a trillion dollars in the second 10-year period, from 2008 through 2017. 
The budget also asks too little sacrifice from corporate tax subsidies. 
Our recent budget history should teach us that we only have so much money for tax cuts. We should target those scarce tax cut dollars to working families and the middle class. But too many of the tax cuts that the Republican majority brags about in this budget would benefit the very wealthiest individuals and corporations. 
As part of the bipartisan budget agreement, Speaker Gingrich and Senator Lott wrote to the President, `We believe these levels provide enough room for * * * broad-based permanent capital gains reductions, significant death tax relief, * * * and expansion of IRAs.' President Clinton will be hard-pressed to preserve his important tax cuts for education if the Republican majority in Congress holds to its present course. 
The capital gains tax cuts in S. 2, the Republican leadership tax bill, would cost $33 billion in the first 5 years and fully $96 billion in the second 5 years. More than 85 percent of its benefits would go to those with incomes greater than $100,000 a year, according to an analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice. Fully two-thirds of the benefits from lowering the capital gains tax rate would go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers--those with incomes above $241,000. This wealthy elite would get an average tax cut of about $6,800 from the capital gains tax cut, while families in the middle fifth of the population would get an average tax cut of $4. 
The estate tax cuts in S. 2, the Republican leadership tax bill, would cost $18 billion in the first 5 years and $48 billion in the second 5 years. All of the benefits of these tax cuts would go to the 1 percent of estates larger than $600,000 in value. 
A 1989 Joint Tax Committee analysis of an IRA provision similar to that in the Republican leadership tax bill found that 95 percent of the benefits went to the top fifth of taxpayers. 
Reasonable restrictions on the tax cuts for capital gains and estate tax relief place much less of a burden on the deficit. The Democratic leader, for example, has introduced targeted capital gains tax cuts that cost $4.5 billion, and estate tax cuts that cost $3 billion over the next 5 years. 
In addition, this budget takes only modest steps to control the massive subsidies that the tax laws now bestow on the wealthy. It has been estimated that over four-fifths of tax subsidies go to the richest fifth of the population. At a time when billions of dollars of budget cuts are being proposed in health benefits for the elderly, it makes no sense to provide tax breaks to billionaires who renounce their citizenship. 
The tax expenditures listed in a December 1996 Senate Budget Committee report add up to more than $2.7 trillion over the next 5 years. That's more than 30 percent of the cost of running the entire Federal Government over the same time period. These tax entitlements represent a larger share of the Federal budget than Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, or any spending program. 
Together with Senator John McCain and other Senators, I have joined in a bipartisan effort to reduce corporate subsidies using a base-closing type Federal commission. Cutting corporate subsidies would introduce a needed element of fairness in the budget. When so many individuals and families are being asked to bear a heavy burden of budget cuts, there should be no free rides for special interest groups and their cozy subsidies. 
Medicare cuts, at $115 billion, make up nearly two-fifths of the total spending cuts in this budget. These Medicare cuts grow to $155 billion over 6 years, and $215 billion over 7 years. Even though this budget does not ask as much of beneficiaries as did the Republican budgets of the last 2 years, cuts of this size raise serious questions about the continued willingness of Medicare providers to participate in the system. 
Defense did not sacrifice to make its contribution. The levels in the budget are essentially the higher of either the President's or the Republicans' proposals. The Republicans' levels were higher in the short run, and the President's levels were higher in the long run. 
Domestic appropriations contribute $61 billion over 5 years and are assumed to contribute $273 billion over 10 years to keep the budget in balance. Coming after the 1990 budget, which essentially froze total appropriations, these cuts seriously reduce the pool of money from which education, research, and other needed investments are made to ensure the future growth of the economy. 
The budget does make a worthwhile start for children's health, by allotting $16 billion--$3.2 billion a year on average--over the next 5 years. But the budget also takes $14 billion out of Medicaid at the same time, leaving doubts about how much net funding will actually reach children in need. 
We should be realistic about what $3.2 billion a year can and cannot do. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the Federal cost of providing Medicaid coverage to one child in 1997 will be $860. At $860 per child, $3.2 billion dollars a year will cover about 3.7 million children. This level is only one-third of the number of uninsured, just enough to cover those children below poverty with a little left over. If we stop at the $16 billion in the budget agreement, we will be leaving out almost 7 million children in working families who earn too much for Medicaid but not enough to buy the health insurance their children need. 
The $20 billion over the next five years in the Hatch-Kennedy CHILD amendment was designed to help these families, and I regret that it was narrowly defeated. Senator Hatch and I continue to believe that is should be included in the budget, and we intend to offer it as part of the reconciliation bill later this year. 
The debates ahead will offer realistic opportunities to improve the budget package in all of these areas and eliminate its worst provisions. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact a balanced budget that truly reflects the Nation's needs and priorities.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my colleague and friend from Illinois, Senator Moseley-Braun, and commend her for bringing this matter to the U.S. Senate. Her amendment addresses basic and fundamental needs to help children get a good education, and to offset that by closing some of the tax loopholes. 
In reviewing the agreements that were made in the balanced budget amendment, it is clear that almost every program is going to bear the brunt of belt tightening--with the exception of tax expenditures. There are over $430 billion in tax expenditures this current year, and that number will increase as we move to enact the tax breaks. We have still not closed the billionaire's tax loophole that permits Americans who have accumulated large amounts of wealth to renounce their citizenship and take their wealth overseas. I think we can afford to close that particular loophole and pay for this particular amendment. There are others that are just as outrageous that, with any fair evaluation of those loopholes, would clearly be closed. 
It is entirely appropriate that we give favorable consideration to this measure. 
Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment by Senator Moseley-Braun to provide the $5 billion for improving America's school facilities. 
Good education begins with decent places to learn. Yet, in too many public schools across the Nation, children have to run an obstacle course to learn, and that is wrong. 
Schools across the country are facing enormous problems with crumbling facilities. Fourteen million children in one-third of the schools are learning in substandard school buildings. Over half of all schools report at least one major building in disrepair, with cracked foundations, leaking roofs and other major problems. 
Yet, student enrollments are at an all-time high and will continue to rise, causing even greater overcrowding in many schools. We cannot tolerate a situation in which facilities deteriorate while enrollments escalate. 
Massachusetts is no exception. Forty-one percent of Massachusetts schools report that at least one building needs extensive repair or should be replaced; 75 percent report serious problems, such as plumbing or heating defects; 80 percent have at least one unsatisfactory environmental factor. 
Faulty boilers and leaky pipes are responsible for sewage leaks and backups at many schools in Springfield. Sixty percent of Springfield schools do not have power outlets and electric wiring needed to accommodate computers and multimedia equipment. 
At the Washington School in Springfield, windows are falling out, so they cannot keep the school well heated. At Chestnut school, an entire floor was closed due to disrepair and has not been reopened. To add to the problem, enrollment in Springfield schools has increased by 1,500 students, or 6 percent, over the past 2 years. Facilities are not large enough to accommodate the number of students in the schools, forcing teachers to hold classes in storage rooms, large closets and basements. 
In Boston, nearly half the schools need major upgrades in their ventilation systems to meet current air quality standards. 
It is interesting, Mr. President, that over half of the schools in my home city of Boston are still not handicapped accessible. 
Schools in the city cannot keep their heating systems functioning properly. On a given day, 15 to 30 schools report that their heating systems are not working. Of Boston's 120 school buildings, 90 do not have adequate power outlets and wiring to accommodate today's technology. Roofs are crumbling at the Dearborn School, Hyde Park High School, Dickerman High School, and the Trotter School. 
Of the 50 public schools in Worcester, 10 schools need new boilers for their heating systems. Almost every school needs windows replaced. Half of Worcester's schools are not equipped with the wiring and infrastructure to handle new technology, and the vocational high school risks losing its certification because the building is in such poor condition. Its outdated electrical wiring is especially dangerous. 
Worcester's schools are also becoming overcrowded. Forest Grove Middle School is at its full capacity of 750 students. They expect 150 additional students to enroll next year, forcing them to rent rooms at a local church to offset the overcrowding. 
At Holt School in Whitman, the foundation is cracked. Water damage has loosened the ceiling tiles in the cafeteria, and the ceiling of the boiler room is collapsing. 
At the Toy Town Elementary School in Winchendon, the roofs in the gymnasium are leaking, the window caulking is deteriorating, and there is asbestos in the cafeteria ceiling and floor tiles. 
It is difficult to teach or learn in dilapidated buildings and overcrowded classrooms. That is why this amendment is so important. It would provide $5 billion in funding over the next 5 years to help school districts meet their priorities for repair, renovation and modernization of their facilities, and it is fully offset by closing the tax loopholes and corporate subsidies in the budget resolution. The amendment does not bind anyone to one specific plan of how to provide support for school facilities. Those details will be worked out later. What the amendment does do is put priority on addressing the urgent needs of schools and the children who learn in them. 
It is preposterous to pretend that we can prepare students for the 21st century in dilapidated 19th century classrooms. I urge my colleagues to support Senator Moseley-Braun's amendment. 
This chart indicates, Mr. President, exactly what the conditions are, as pointed out by the Senator from Illinois: Fourteen million children in substandard schools; 7 million attend schools with asbestos and lead paint. This provides for mental retardation and slow developmental learning; radon in the ceilings and wall; 12 million children go to schools under leaking roofs; and one-third of American children study in classrooms without enough panel outlets and electrical wiring to accommodate computer and multimedia equipment. 
We are going to spend $7.2 million in the title I program to help children to get the basic math and reading skills they need. But if those children are in dilapidated buildings, we are not spending that money wisely. We are going to be spending about $491 million in Goals 2000, to help States and local communities establish standards so that they can measure the progress that children are making. If the Nation's classrooms are falling apart, When you have the kind of classrooms like this, how can we expect children to meet high academic standards? 
As the Senator from Illinois pointed out, we are going to be spending $1.8 billion for computers, electronics, and Internet access in the schools over the next 5 years. If you do not have the electrical outlets in which to plug in the computers, what difference will our technology investment make? We will spend hundreds of millions of dollars in upgrading professional training for teachers, but forcing them to teach in crumbling schools. So we are willing to get computers into the classroom, upgrade teaching, provide additional funding for literacy, and provide the additional funding for early interventions, but are going to ignore the deterioration of our schools? This is a national problem that must be addressed. GAO estimates that communities need $112 billion nationwide to repair their schools. It's a problem across the country--in urban areas, rural areas, and suburban areas. The places I talked about reflect a broad range of Massachusetts schools. Communities in every part of Massachusetts and across the country are facing urgent needs to repair dilapidated schools. You can go all over this Nation and find out this is true, and it is 
affecting the children of this Nation. 
So, Mr. President, this is not the first time that Senator Moseley-Braun has championed this issue in the Senate. She is not a member of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, but she made her case to us on this issue, and we addressed it. 
In 1994, we authorized a grant program in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. In appropriations, we were able to appropriate $100 million in fiscal year 1995 for the program. But, when the rescissions came, the School Infrastructure Improvement Act was one of the first targets of the Republican leadership--they rescinded 100 percent of the funding. Then we saw her amendment included in the initial budget agreement because individuals--Republicans and Democrats alike--understood the urgent need to repair the Nation's schools. Then overnight, it suddenly disappeared. It was in that proposal initially, and it should have been in it in the final agreement too. Now the good Senator is trying to just put back what was already in the initial draft to make a downpayment on helping to repair the Nation's schools. 
This very modest program will help school districts to develop funding mechanisms so that they can go ahead and meet this challenge themselves. There will be some help and assistance communities to subsidize some of the interest rates on bonds so that they can afford to repair their schools. We do not propose to have the Federal Government repair local schools. We propose to let the Federal Government lend a helping hand to those local communities that are hard pressed to do it themselves, to create decent, safe school buildings for their children. 
This is a national issue, Mr. President. I am strongly committed, and I know my other colleagues are too, to improving the quality of education of young people in this country. It starts right in the classroom and it starts by having a safe, modern classroom where a child can learn. Senator Moseley-Braun's amendment will move us in that direction. I commend her, and I hope the Senate will support her amendment.

Is the Senator saying that the Finance Committee ought to be able to find that $5 billion over 5 years out of $2.3 trillion--$2.3 trillion--in tax expenditures, which include the billionaire's tax loophole and other egregious violations? Does the Senator think we ought to be able to find $5 billion out of $2.3 trillion in tax expenditures over the next 5 years?

Mr. KENNEDY. Am I correct that this is not a partisan issue? Senator McCain has been a leader in trying to close down some of the tax loopholes. So the idea of closing them is not just something put forth by the Senator from Illinois. This has been recognized across partisan lines that we ought to be able to close some of the tax loopholes in the interest of the American taxpayers. 
Finally, I ask the Senator this question, and she touched on it so eloquently earlier: What is the message that we send to school children if we do not pass this amendment? We have been talking about the collapsing roofs, inadequate boilers, windows that have fallen out and haven't been replaced, schools in Boston whose heating systems frequently fail. But what does this say to the schoolchildren of this country about our commitment to them when we are trying to, either as parents or as community leaders, say that continued education, the quality of schoolteachers, and homework is important; that we want young people to apply themselves and develop their own skills to enhance their educational opportunities so that they will have good jobs in the future? What do we say when we impress on them that what the learn is what they are going to earn in the future? What message does it say to them every single day when they go to school to learn in dilapidated classrooms?

Mr. KENNEDY. Finally, how does the Senator address the question that this is going to be a budget buster, a deal breaker? We fully offset the amendment through corporate tax loopholes. If we pass this amendment of $5 billion with an offset of $5 billion, therefore making it revenue neutral, is it challenging to find $5 billion out of $2.3 trillion in tax expenditures to spend on the renovation and repair of the Nation's crumbling schools? That looking out for the children of this country is a deal breaker? I do not find that as a very persuasive argument.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I commend my friend and colleague, Senator Hatch, for explaining the thrust of this legislation and the range of support that we have for it and the importance of it for working families. Let me just continue in the presentation. 
Mr. President, I join Senator Hatch in offering this amendment to guarantee a healthy start in life for every American child. Our amendment to the budget poses a clear choice for every Senator. Whose interests do you care about--the interests of America's children--or the interests of the big tobacco companies? Are you for Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man, or millions of children who lack adequate health care? 
Our amendment will make the Hatch-Kennedy children's health insurance plan part of the budget. Our goal is to make health insurance accessible and affordable for every child. The plan is financed by an increase of 43 cents a pack in the cigarette tax. That increase has the additional important benefit of reducing smoking by children. 
Our plan has broad bipartisan support--because health care for children is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. It is a human issue. Six former Secretaries of the Department of Health and Human Services and four former Surgeon Generals have endorsed the plan. These leaders served under Presidents Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush. They all understand the importance of health insurance for children and decisive action to reduce smoking. They all understand that health care for children is an issue that should transcend political party and ideology. 
We all know the crisis we are facing in children's health. Ten and a half million children in this country--1 child in every 7--have no health insurance. Over a 2 year period, 23 million children--1 child in every 3--are without health insurance for substantial periods of time. 
Ninety percent of uninsured children are members of working families. Their families work hard--40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year--but all their hard work can't buy their children the health care they need, because they don't qualify for Medicaid and they can't afford to buy insurance on their own. 
Too many children are left out and left behind because they are uninsured. Too many parents face a cruel choice between putting food on the table, paying the rent, and giving their children the health care they need. 
For millions of children the only family doctor is the hospital emergency room. Each year 600,000 sick children do not receive any medical care, because they are uninsured. Each year, 400,000 children go without the medicine their doctors have prescribed because they have no insurance. Each year, 1 1/2 million children go without the dental care they need, because they have no insurance. Each year, 600,000 uninsured children suffer from asthma and less than half see a physician even once. 
Each month, 1 million uninsured children suffer from sore throats with high fever. If they have strep throats, it can lead to heart disease and kidney disease if it's not treated. Each year, 300,000 uninsured children have chronic, untreated ear infections. Uninsured children are 50 percent more likely to die in the hospital than other children because their parents couldn't afford the health insurance they needed. 
We all know our country's shameful record on infant mortality--we rank behind 17 other industrialized countries. 
The lack of health care for children plagues the education system too. Children who are sick can't study well in school. Children who cannot see the blackboard because they have no eyeglasses can't succeed in the classroom. Children who cannot hear the teacher are unlikely to learn. Children who do not get a healthy start in life are unlikely to have a healthy future. And without healthy children, our country won't have a healthy future either--because children are the country's future. 
Passage of this amendment, combined with the money already included in the budget agreement, can end this crisis and make this the Congress in which we guarantee every child the opportunity for the healthy start in life that should be the birthright of every child. 
A budget is about setting priorities. There is no more important priority than health care for our children. 
The amendment provides the additional funds necessary to achieve our goal. It includes in the instructions to the Finance Committee the necessary adjustments to provide for a 43-cent-a-pack increase in the cigarette tax to finance the coverage. And it includes in the instructions to the Finance and Labor and Human Resources Committee the spending to implement this program. 
The Hatch-Kennedy legislation includes provisions that were common to bills introduced two Congresses ago by Republicans and Democrats alike. It will make health insurance coverage more affordable for every working family with uninsured children. It does so without creating any new Government mandates--on the States, on the insurance industry, or on individuals. The program is purely voluntary. 
Our legislation creates no new entitlement. Instead, it encourages family responsibility, by offering parents the help they need to purchase affordable health insurance for their children. 
The bill does not create any new bureaucracies--either Federal or State. The Federal Government already collects tobacco taxes, and all States have agencies that run their Medicaid, public health, and children's health insurance programs. 
Our legislation builds on what the States are already doing. Fourteen States have their own public programs on which our proposal is modeled. Another 17 States have private programs to subsidize the cost of child-only coverage for low-income families. 
Finally, our proposal builds on the private insurance industry. States choosing to participate will contract with private insurers to provide child-only private coverage. Subsidies will be available to help families purchase the coverage for their children, or to participate in employment-based health plans. 
Even families not eligible for the financial assistance will be helped by this plan, since children's health insurance policies will be widely available in all States as a result of this proposal. 
Under our plan, $20 billion over the next 5 years will be available to expand health insurance for children, and an additional $10 billion will be available for deficit reduction beyond what is provided in the budget agreement. 
Paying for this program by an increase in the cigarette tax is both logical and practical. The link between smoking and children's health is obvious. If we do nothing, 5 million of today's children will die from smoking-related illnesses. 
For years, tobacco companies have cynically targeted the Nation's children. It is appropriate now to ask those companies and smokers to make a contribution to the cost of health insurance for children. By providing a specific financing source to cover the cost of the program we are doing the fiscally responsible thing. 
Some will oppose this legislation on the grounds that the $16 billion already included in the budget over the next 5 years is enough. But the fact is, the $16 billion is barely enough to cover the 3 million uninsured children already eligible for Medicaid but not participating. In total, it will cover only 3.7 million children of the 10 1/2 million who are uninsured. Let me repeat that: It will cover only 3.7 million children of the 10 million uninsured. 
The budget agreement is an important step forward. But that improvement is not enough to help the seven million other children in hard-working families whose parents will still make too much to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to buy the health care their children need. The Hatch-Kennedy plan fills that large gap. 
Some will oppose this legislation on the grounds that the budget agreement was designed to cut taxes, not increase them. But a cigarette tax increase is a user fee and affirmative step to improve health care. It is not like other taxes. If you don't smoke, you don't pay the tax. We all know the heavy costs that tobacco companies and smokers inflict on all taxpayers. The average pack of cigarettes sells for $1.80 today--and it costs the Nation $3.90 in smoking-related costs. This proposal helps in a modest way to offset those costs. 
Every poll shows that, unlike other tax increases, raising the cigarette tax has overwhelming public support. The only people who don't like this increase are the tobacco companies and their lobbyists. 
Some will claim that this program will displace existing private insurance coverage. But our bill has strong safeguards to prevent this from happening. In fact, it has not occurred in the States that have already acted to implement similar programs. 
Some will argue that this program creates new mandates on States or new entitlements. But anyone who reads the bill will see that it does not. Participation is voluntary for States. The requirements for participation are no greater than for other, typical Federal grants to States for health care. The bill states clearly that it creates no new individual entitlement. 
Obviously, we are not voting today on the specific provisions of our legislation. There will be plenty of time for adjustment and improvement as it moves through Congress. But this vote on the budget resolution is the key vote that determines whether the overall budget will contain room for this program, financed by a tobacco tax increase, that will guarantee every family affordable coverage for their children. 
Big tobacco opposes this legislation. They are powerful and well-funded, but they do not deserve to succeed in their effort to block our amendment. A vote for this amendment is a vote for children's health care and a vote against the insidious and shameful poisoning of generations of children by the tobacco industry. Enough is enough is enough. 
An extraordinary 72 percent of the American people support this program. Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives, low-income families and high-income families, North, South, East, and West--support is overwhelming. The question is whether democracy still works. The American people understand the choice we are making today--and Congress should listen to their views. How can any Senator say no? 
I would like to close by telling my colleagues the story of the children in two families. 
Sylvia Pierce of Everett, MA, didn't think twice about taking one of her four children to the doctor, when her husband was alive. The family medical bills were covered under her husband's health insurance that he got through his job. When one of the children needed a shot, Pierce took the child to the doctor; if the baby had an earache, Pierce got a prescription. `People don't realize what a luxury health insurance is,' Pierce said. `I know I didn't. I took it for granted. I never thought about it; I never worried about it.' That all changed October 6, 1993, when her husband was murdered. In an instant, Pierce's life was changed forever. Gone was the father of her children, the family's main breadwinner--and its health insurance, leaving her four children, 13-year-old Leonard, 8-year-old Brian, 6-year-old Alyssa, and the baby, Jillian, unprotected. `It was the middle of the winter, the worst time of year as far as kids and sickness are concerned,' Pierce said. `The kids were always catching something at school, and the baby had earaches and needed to have her immunizations. I kept postponing her shots because I didn't have the money. It was a very anxious time.' 
`I didn't choose to be in this situation * * * We've got to take care of our children. They can't speak for themselves so we have to speak for them.' 
Maria lives in California. Shortly after Maria entered a new school as a third grader, her progress reports indicated that she seemed to be performing far below her potential. A health examination arranged by her school revealed that Maria had suffered multiple ear infections--probably over a period of several years. Maria's father ran a small yard maintenance business, but was not able to afford health insurance for her. As a result, her parents were unable to obtain treatment for her ear infections. Without timely and thorough medical attention, scar tissue had built up, causing her to become deaf in one ear and have hearing loss in the other. Maria's inability to access affordable medical care affects not only her physical health but her educational development as well. 
Every day we delay means more children like Maria and like Leonard and Brian and Alyssa and Jillian suffer. It is time to say, `enough.' We have failed our children long enough. 
Children are the country's future. When we fail children, we also fail the country and its future. We all know what's at stake. For children, this vote is the most important vote we will cast in this entire Congress. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just to make it clear, in the budget is some $16 billion. The Medicaid costs are $860 per person. If you work that out, that covers 3.7 million. 
I think the President said `up to 5 million.' So, there is a major part of that group, particularly the working poor, who are not covered in that. 
I strongly support the point that the Senator has made in that we are going to see progress, and it is important progress. I think we ought to at least have an understanding. We have $16 billion and it costs $860 to cover each child. If you do the math, it is 3.7 million. The President, I think, said up to 5 million. I think, frankly, if you do the math, it is a little closer to 3.7 million.

There should be no question as to exactly what this legislation is about. It is about providing health insurance for working families who cannot afford it. This is spelled out in the purpose of the amendment, which also states that it will be * * * `financed by an increase in the tobacco tax.' What we are voting on ought to be very clear.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, third, using the figures of the Senator from Kentucky, a reduction of about 10 percent is 4.5 million Americans. By and large, the greatest reductions will be among children, because they become addicted at the earliest age. 
Finally, I want to address the issue as to whether this is consistent with the budget resolution. The budget resolution reduces the deficit. This program adds $10 billion in terms of deficit reduction. It strengthens the agreement itself. 
Second, it does not change spending with regard to potential capital gains, the estate taxes, the IRA's, the education programs--none of those will be altered or changed. 
This is effectively a user fee for those who smoke, and it will provide comprehensive coverage for the millions of children who are not covered. 
I pay tribute to my friend and colleague from Kentucky because he has been a champion of children the entire time he has been in the Senate, and no one in this Senate ought to doubt his strong commitment.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes. 
The Senator from New Hampshire is my friend and my colleague. However, as is sometimes seen around here, someone misstates what is in the bill and then differs with it. That is what has happened here. 
When I was listening to the Senator from New Hampshire describe the bill, I did not recognize it, because this is not an entitlement. No individual will ever be able to receive any kind of benefit on the basis of an entitlement. Participation is voluntary for the States and it is authorized for just 5 years. It is completely funded, and it provides the kind of flexibility to the States that will allow them to build on what thy are currently doing. 
Let us not lose sight of what the issue is before the Senate this afternoon: Will we support the Hatch-Kennedy bill that will provide the resources to ensure the sons and daughters of working families in this country? That is the issue. You can talk about other kinds of issues all you want, but every American understands this one. When you come right down to it, this is the issue. 
We are providing the opportunity. We are saying, `Let us stand up for the children of working families and pay for it with a tobacco tax, which is basically a user fee.' That is the way to address this issue, by building upon the agreement that has been spelled out here. Covering the Medicaid children will make a difference, but let's build on that and cover the children of working families. 
I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island. I see that he wants to speak about this issue.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we find that we have had a good discussion and a debate about this measure. 
Those of us who favor this measure have been trying to convince the Members of the Senate what the great majority of the American people already understand. This is a proposal that will cover the sons and daughters of working families that are on the lower two or three rungs of the economic ladder. This is something that the American people overwhelmingly support, and we pay for it with a modest increase in the tobacco tax of 43 cents per pack of cigarettes. This is supported across the country--North, South, East, West, Republicans, Democrats, independents. A majority of smokers all across the country favor this proposal. Rarely have we seen an issue that has such support. We have given life to that proposal with this amendment to the Budget Act. 
There have been comments about how this is drafted. This is drafted as other amendments have been drafted over the history of budget acts. It is consistent with our objective. 
We have placed in the Record the Joint Tax Committee report that justifies our proposal in recognizing that more than $30 billion will be raised. We have allocated $20 billion to go to the States, effectively as a block grant, to provide for those children whose parents are working and who need this kind of coverage because they are making $18,000, $19,000, $20,000, or $25,000 and they are unable to afford coverage for their children. We commend the fact that the budget agreement adds some $16 billion for children. But we also recognize that Medicaid has been cut $14 billion. Half of all those who are in Medicaid are children. We are not prepared to say that half of those cuts, dollar for dollar will necessarily affect children, but that $16 billion that is supposed to go for children is going to be diminished significantly given these cuts. We believe there will be more than 3 million children who currently have no health care who will be covered by the $16 billion, but we are still not reaching the core group of children who are the sons and daughters of working families. 
This is the issue before us. We know there are parliamentary measures that will be taken, and parliamentary issues raised to prevent us from having a straight up-and-down vote on the proposal. 
Every Member of the Senate understands this proposal. The American Academy of Pediatrics understands this proposal. `America's pediatricians strongly urge support for the Hatch-Kennedy budget amendment to increase tobacco taxes to help finance children's health care.' 
The American Association of Retired Persons understands this proposal. They care about their grandchildren: `AARP believes that the Hatch-Kennedy proposal is an important step in improving access to health care for children.' 
The National Council of the Churches of Christ in the U.S.A., comprised of the 33 national member communions of the National Council of Churches support it. They write, `We in the religious community will continue to hold Congress to a high standard as to what is required for the common good. Providing for the health care of children is simply basic social morality.' 
The list goes on; 150 organizations including the Parent-Teachers Association, and many others support this measure. 
Mr. President, this is ultimately a choice and a decision about whether we are going to support covering children who are uninsured or whether we are going to be for big tobacco. That is the issue. We have chosen the tobacco tax for health reasons, Mr. President. If you increase that kind of tax, you are going to discourage children from smoking and you are going to close a gateway to drug use and other kinds of substance abuse. 
Second, we want to make sure that that industry and the users of tobacco are going to pay their fair share of the health care costs; $68 billion a year, according to OTA, is paid by the common taxpayers because of smoking. 
We are saying that the tobacco industry ought to bear its fair share in covering poor children. That is the issue. 
Finally, Mr. President, we heard a great deal yesterday about the American Medical Association. Here is the letter from the 
American Medical Association that says: 
On behalf of 300,000 physician and medical students members of the American Medical Association, I am writing to express our support of your and Senator Orrin Hatch's efforts, as well as those of other Congressional leaders, to improve the health of American children. We also commend you for financing your legislation by a 43-cent increase in the Federal cigarette tax. The AMA is committed to eradicating the public health crisis caused by smoking and our House of Delegates policy strongly supports increasing the Federal tobacco excise tax for health care needs. 
Mr. President, from a medical standpoint, this is right. It is right in terms of fairness and equity. There is not a parent in this country, not a single parent in this country, who does not believe that all children ought to have a healthy start. That is what our amendment does, and I hope it will be accepted.  
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. I just want to say this. When the amendment is offered by the majority leader, we are going to urge everyone on our side to support it. Because we, as right from the beginning, have supported the $16 billion to take care of those needy children on Medicaid. So I would certainly urge all of our supporters to support it. Then I hope we will have an opportunity to come back on and have a vote on what we have offered here, to build on that. So that makes it--if the Senator wants to have a reaffirmation for that which has been agreed on, I hope we could get to an early vote on it, because we would have every intention, then, to come back in and have a vote on our particular measure.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with all due respect, I think the 
position of the chairman of the Budget Committee is to deny us an opportunity to get a vote on our particular measure. 
I listened with great interest to what he said. He said that, `I think three mature adults would be able to look at this amendment and make a judgment that it's inconsistent with the budget agreement.' We have more than that number here that are prepared to vote on that issue. We think that at least 100 adults ought to be able to vote on that issue and make a judgment. We have tried to address the concerns that were raised concerning the consistency of our amendment with the overall budget agreement, and we did address them earlier. 
I want to point out that the budget resolution is the right vehicle for this measure and I am sure that the Members are aware of this. I listened and watched how the Senator from New Mexico was looking over at the Senator from Utah saying with great fanfare, `You can raise these issues at any time. You're a member of the Finance Committee.' Of course, as the Senator from New Mexico knows, measures dealing with raising a tax must begin in the House of Representatives, not in the Senate Finance Committee. 
So to raise the tobacco tax, we need to amend the revenue bill. The Constitution requires tax bills to originate in the House, the reconciliation bill created by the budget resolution will probably be the only revenue measure considered this year. 
We ought to understand substance of this debate. This is not a case where we will be able to address this tomorrow, next week or 2 months from now--this is it. For the parents of children that need health insurance, this is the opportunity. Now is the moment. Today is the day in the U.S. Senate. Unless we provide for the tax in the budget resolution, we will not have an opportunity to offer the amendment later. This budget is not only the right place for this amendment, it is the only place for this amendment. That is why this debate is so important. 
We were prepared to vote a few moments ago, and we are prepared to move now to reach some conclusion. 
Given the reasons I outlined, I urge that we support the Domenici amendment. What that will do is restate what is in the budget agreement, which is the $16 billion in the restoration in terms of Medicaid. We agree with that. We would not council our Members not to vote for that. We agree with that. We hope we will have an opportunity after that amendment is completed to vote on our amendment. 
As I understand, the Senator from New Mexico will ask for recognition and he will put in another amendment. He can do that. That amendment will be accepted and we will be right back to a point where we can offer our amendment again. We can do that again and again and again and again and again. The question then becomes, why can we not have the vote on this particular measure? Why can we not go ahead and have the vote on this measure? We believe very sincerely that it is not inconsistent with the budget resolution. 
The Senator from New Mexico has not told us about how this would reduce the possibility of a capital gains tax. He has not stated that our amendment will eliminate the possibility of increasing the estate tax exemption. He has not said it will compromise our opportunity to do something about IRA's or the education tax. He has not said this will cut back on the issue of spending cuts, because, as he knows, the final amount as mentioned in the reported $138 billion, will be included in the first downpayment and installation. None of this is altered or changed by our amendment. 
Mr. President, we have to come back to the issue here. The issue is whether the Senate of the United States will go on record this afternoon in saying we will provide a very modest increase in the cost of cigarettes, 43 cents a pack, that will convey direct health benefits to millions and millions of children discouraging them from smoking and providing $20 billion over the next 5 years to help States pay for children's health coverage. States can then make the decision as to whether or not they want to participate. It will also provide a $10 billion deficit reduction. 
That does not do violence to the budget agreement. This is not an amendment that says we want this coverage, now you find the revenues. We are not taking the revenue out of any particular area. This amendment is self-funded. It is probably one of the few, or only, self funded initiatives that will be offered this session. Maybe others will come down. 
That is the issue. I hope the leadership would not deny us the opportunity for the Senate to express its will. It is 10 minutes to 2:00. We were scheduled to debate from 9:30 to 11:30. We had speakers ready to speak and we were ready to vote at 11:30, and now at 10 minutes to 2 o'clock we are told we will have one underlying vote and maybe another. I think the message that will come out of this debate is that the Republican leadership refuses to let the Senate of the United States vote on a children's health care issue. I think that would be very unfortunate--unfortunate to the children and unfortunate to the parents. 
I do not see why we should be denied the opportunity to let the Senate work its will. We are completely within our rights in 
offering it. We are within our rights to expect we would have a resolution. This is a matter of enormous importance and it has overwhelming support of the American people.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I just want to commend my friend from Utah for presenting what is the real issue before the U.S. Senate at this moment, and for making such a convincing case in 
support of this amendment which will provide health insurance for children. 
Mr. President, I am having trouble understanding why our majority leader is not willing to let us vote on health insurance for children financed by a cigarette tax. I am just wondering why he is hesitating. What are we afraid of? Why can't the Senate decide by a majority vote whether our national priority is to children or to tobacco companies? Why can't we vote on whether the Senate stands with children or with Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man? 
I think we ought to move ahead and have a vote. That is what the regular order would be. We don't take any satisfaction in just urging the Senate to accept the amendment of the Senator of New Mexico. The only thing we are trying to do is get a vote on our particular amendment. I certainly hope that cooler heads of leadership will at least permit us the opportunity to do so. 
Mr. President, my time has expired. I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico because it is a restatement of what is in the budget resolution bill--$16 billion for needy children. We are in strong support of that proposal.

Mr. KENNEDY. As Senator Hatch and I have pointed out, this is basically budget neutral. I included earlier in the Record the assessment of the Joint Economic Committee, and what we have demonstrated is that the expenditures that will be used in order to pay for the program will be raised by the increase in the cigarette tax. 
The opponents of this amendment cannot have it both ways. You cannot spend half the morning saying we are against the increase in the cigarette tax and then in the afternoon say, well, this is going to somehow diminish the whole budget agreement in terms of revenue. 
That is what they have been saying. That is what opponents have been saying. 
The fact is, as everyone in this body understands, this is revenue neutral. This is revenue neutral. I have said if they can 
come in and find out where our amendment is going to reduce the capability of the Finance Committee and the Ways and Means Committee to affect the estate taxes, capital gains, IRA's, student assistance, let them make that case. You cannot do it. You cannot do it. I listened to the rhetoric, and it still does not stand. 
Mr. President, the real issue I think is whether we in the Senate, on the one vehicle that can make the difference, are going to have an increase in the tobacco tax and have a children's health insurance program. That is what we are talking about. That is what we are talking about. 
I have increasing frustration with why the majority leader and the chairman of the Budget Committee are refusing to let us do so. We can make up our own minds. The case has been set. People have listened to the debate. Let them make up their own minds on it. 
It is our position that when it says in this budget agreement if bills, resolutions or conference reports are deemed to be consistent--I think our minority leader had indicated how it is consistent, because the budget points out we are taking $16 billion to look at the Medicaid. We are looking at those individuals who are just above the Medicaid, the working poor, looking at those children. A child is a child. We should not say, OK, it is all right, it is consistent with that. If you are going to be below a certain level of poverty, it will be 85 percent above the poverty, and say, well, that is completely inconsistent. The American people are not going to buy that. The American people are not buying that. That is an absolute phony, fake argument. 
This is consistent because it is looking after needy, poor children--that is the issue--paid for by a cigarette tax. If you do not want that and want to oppose it, at least say let us go ahead and vote and take that position. But we have been on it now since 9:30 this morning. It is 2:30. We are denied the opportunity to let the overwhelming majority of the American people have a vote on it. 
Seventy-five percent of the American people support this. And if they are watching television today, they are saying, why can't the Senate of the United States at least vote it yes or no? We are being denied that. Quite frankly, the children who have been denied that health insurance, unable to get it, have been very patient. Their parents have been very patient. They are very patient every single night when they are concerned about those children. They are spending all night, all day, every day. We can certainly be patient, too, if the parliamentary process is going to deny us that opportunity. The majority has the right of recognition, and they can put on another amendment; we are supporting this. Then they put on another. But eventually that slot is going to open up and Senator Hatch and I are going to be here to fill it. 
That is where we are, Mr. President. We just cannot understand why here, after all these hours, with this issue and debate, somehow some Members on that side are saying, if you pass a small health insurance program for needy children, 10 million children, that is paid for, it is going to end the whole budget deal. That is what they are saying. They are saying, if you provide enough money for 10 million children, the world is going to come to an end. We are ending the budget deal. We will never get to a balanced budget. 
Mr. President, they cannot be such strong defenders of Joe Camel. 
That is where we are, Mr. President. I hope we can move ahead. We are going to try to point this out all the way along the line, but I hope we can move ahead and get to some judgment.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this debate is reaching the ridiculous. To say that one-third of 1 percent--that is what we are talking about in the total budget agreement--the majority leader--this is going to take the budget deal down. We are talking about one-third of 1 percent spending, over the next 5 years; over one-third of 1 percent, paid for. 
They say `Oh, that is going to bring it down because it is inconsistent with the budget agreement.' 
Look, Mr. President, I am reading from the budget agreement under `children's health, paragraph 2.' The funding that is in the program here can be used for this purpose: 
A program of capped, mandatory grants to States to finance health insurance coverage for uninsured children. 
That is what our bill is. That is what our bill is. It is a capped grant to the States for uninsured children. It could not be any more specific than what is included in the budget agreement. That is what some of the $16 billion could be for. So we say: Well, let us add it for some of those who are the sons and daughters of working families that do not make sufficient kind of income to be able to do it. Now, when the majority leader gets up--all we are looking for is a vote. We are voting. It is quarter to 3 now, and we are being denied a chance to vote on this issue. He refuses. He says if this goes through, this one-third of 1 percent on an issue that relates to a grant to States to finance coverage for uninsured children--that is a good statement of what our bill is all about, included in the budget agreement, and he is trying to say this is so far removed--it is difficult for me to be able to accept. 
Finally, just on this point, I listened to my friend from Texas talk about the problems, how easy it is to cover all of these children. It is interesting, Texas has 1.4 million uninsured children 18 years of age or younger; nearly 1 in 4 children, 23 percent, is uninsured. It is the second-highest percentage and the second-highest total number in the country. Texas would receive, under our legislation, $2.6 billion to insure uninsured children with this particular program, an average of $655 million a year for the uninsured children. 
This is supported by close to three-quarters, 74 percent, of the State of Texas. 
I respect my colleague from Texas saying, `Well, there really isn't a problem out there,' but there is a problem out there. There is a problem across the country. All we are saying, all Senator Hatch is saying, is this is paid for; it is an issue of covering children which is paid for with a tobacco tax. 
Can we not in the U.S. Senate say, let us, on this issue, go forward with a vote? Evidently, we are being denied this. It is suggested that if we dare to go forward with a vote and we possibly are able to convince Republicans, as well as Democrats, that this is a national priority, a priority for families in America to provide insurance for uninsured children of the neediest families, that suddenly the whole economy and the Nation is in danger. This is a simple choice between children and the tobacco industry, Mr. President. That is what we are faced with. It seems to me we ought to be able to decide on children this afternoon.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we have said since early today that we are prepared to move ahead with a vote, if we are unable to get the assurances that we would go ahead with the vote on the underlying amendment, the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico, 
which we are supporting. 
I would just say to my friends that have spoken recently that we are in strong support of that amendment because that will provide the $16 billion to take care of some of the neediest children. But there is also the $14 million deficit that is going to be basically traded off against that. That represents the $14 billion on Medicaid. And half of all the Medicaid recipients are children. So it will be diminished in a very substantial degree. 
We heard again somewhat that this is spoiling the budget agreement. As I reiterated, this is one-fifth of 1 percent of the total budget over the period of the next 5 years. It is difficult for me to believe that one-fifth of 1 percent affecting one-fifth of 1 percent of our economy is going to be a budget buster, particularly when it is paid for. As we indicated, it is paid for. And, as I indicated in the former part of the debate, many of those who have spoken in opposition complain about it being paid for because it is going to increase the cigarette tax. But I want to say that those who wondered about whether this was really relevant in the budget agreement, as I have mentioned, under the children's health proposal they talk about that how that $16 billion for the 5 years could be spent. They said it could be spent in one of the following ways, or it mentioned other possibilities. It said one of the ways is a program cap of mandatory grants to States. That is what our program is. It caps grants to States to finance insurance coverage for uninsured children. 
So, Madam President, we believe that we should be entitled to a vote. 
Again, I am really amazed that it has taken this long a time to get to a vote with all of the kinds of complex issues that we have to debate and talk about here on the budget resolution. This is a very simple issue. Are we going to put the interests of children of working families, those that are on the bottom, second, third, fourth rung of the economic ladder--are we going to side with them on a selfsustaining financed program of health insurance through the States based upon what the States are doing through the private sector with the discretion of the State making those judgments or are we going to side with the tobacco interests? 
That is the issue. That is the question. It is not very difficult. We hope for those reasons--plus I thought the excellent statement that was made by the minority leader in terms of how he, too, believes that this is entirely appropriate--that we could move ahead and get some action. 
I thank the Chair. I withhold the balance of the time.  
Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think we made a great deal of progress in this debate. We knew it would be an uphill battle because we knew the power of the tobacco industry. And we intend at the next available opportunity to offer this proposal again. And we shall offer it again and again until we prevail. 
It is more important to protect children than to protect the tobacco industry. Every child deserves a healthy start. We who support this amendment are not afraid to debate it on its merits. We are willing to stand to be counted for our children. We are willing to stand for our children's health. And we are willing to stand in favor of the single most important means of reducing teenage smoking--the tobacco tax. 
On both of those issues, this will be the most important vote of the year. We will stand with children. And I hope our colleagues will stand with us.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, every year the respected U.S. Committee for Refugees issues a review of the state of the world's refugees. This yearly review has earned worldwide respect as the most authoritative compilation of analyses, data, and thought-provoking information on refugees. The 1997 World Refugee Survey, released yesterday is especially troubling. The Committee finds that many countries which were once considered safe havens for refugees and asylum seekers are beginning to turn their backs on persons fleeing persecution. 
The report estimates that the number of refugees and asylum-seekers decreased last year to about 14.5 million worldwide. But this apparent decrease is misleading. The Committee attributes it in part to the higher barriers to asylum erected in many countries last year, including the United States. In addition, some countries have begun to forcibly repatriate refugees back to their home countries, even if conditions in those countries have not improved. For example, Thailand has recently begun to forcibly return Burmese refugees to their persecutors in Burma. 
There is some good news. Several countries, including Guatemala, Haiti, Mozambique, and Cambodia, have improved their human rights situations, so that some refugees have been able to return to their homes. 
Sadly, the overall message of the report is that basic long-standing international principles of asylum and refugee protection are in trouble. As this report points out, the United States bears a share of responsibility for this problem. The summary exclusion provisions of last year's immigration law, and the continued detention of asylum-seekers sets a poor example for other countries which look to the United States for guidance on asylum and refugee protection.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Mack for introducing this amendment. He has consistently fought for the increases at NIH over a long period of time. This makes eminent sense for the reasons he and others have outlined. I hope that his amendment will be accepted and that we could move ahead on this extraordinary opportunity to support breakthroughs in health care, in so many different areas affecting so many different families in America. He deserves great credit, and I am proud and privileged to cosponsor the amendment. 
Our amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the Federal commitment to the National Institutes of Health should be doubled over the next 5 years, increasing the current NIH budget of $13 billion to $26 billion by the year 2002. 
This increase is critical to fulfilling our hope for healthy lives for all Americans. Every family is touched by the scourge of disease. This amendment will be a step toward reducing that burden. It is vital to maintaining the investment we've already made and to moving forward to improve the health of the American people. It can also be a key strategy in our efforts to save Medicare. 
NIH began in 1887 as a one-room Laboratory of Hygiene. It has grown in the past century into the premier biomedical research facility in the world, for the benefit of literally billions of citizens in this country and of many other lands. 
In the 1950's, NIH research found that fluoridated drinking water could prevent dental cavities in children. In the 1960's, NIH scientists helped crack the genetic code, beginning the studies that would lead to recombinant DNA technology and gene therapy. In the 1970's, NIH-sponsored research began to unravel the mysteries of the genetic origin of cancer. 
The promise of new medical research is boundless. As impressive as the progress of the past has been, it pales in comparison to the opportunities for the future. We stand on the threshold of stunning advances in medicine through deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of the cell, through mapping of human genes, through biotechnology, and through a host of advances that are already on the horizon. 
But instead of moving toward that horizon, we are in danger of standing still. The proportion of worthwhile projects that NIH is able to fund has declined steadily over the past 15 years. Today, they can fund only about one in four such projects. That means, for example, that in 1996 the NIH had to turn away about 18,000 applications. 
Every unfunded application represents a missed opportunity. As funding sources dry up, the best young minds are discouraged from entering the field of biomedical research. The situation is growing dire. In 1994, the National Academy of Sciences warned that we have too few clinical investigators to conduct the research that is most needed. 
In recent years, medical research has changed the world we live in, revising much of what we know about life, about diseases afflicting citizens of all ages. It has led to a breathtaking array of new technologies and therapies which have improved the health of Americans of all ages and walks of life. 
From vaccines against childhood diseases, to treatments for spinal cord injury, from chemotherapy for cancer to medication for mental illness, medical research is improving the lives, and health of people everywhere. 
Since we began to immunize small children with the Hib vaccine, which was developed by NIH scientists in the 1970's and 1980's, cases of deadly spinal meningitis have dropped by more than 98 percent. Diseases like mumps, whooping cough, and chickenpox, all common in the past, have dropped to their lowest levels in history. We are on the verge of eradicating polio from the world. 
Spinal cord injury affects thousands of Americans, often striking in the prime of active lives. A recent NIH study found that a new drug, given within 8 hours of the injury, improves recovery by 20 percent, and gives patients greater independence and better health. 
Chemotherapy for testicular cancer, the most common form of cancer in men aged 15 to 35, can bring a cure rate of 60 to 65 percent. 
Researchers have identified genes linked to certain forms of breast cancer, and have developed new treatments for colon cancer. Improved detection and treatment methods like these have increased the 5-year survival rate for cancer victims to 52 percent. The gain since the 1960's represents over 80,000 additional cancer survivors each year. 
For the first time, we have effective prescription drug treatments for series mental health conditions, such as major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. Many of these medications were developed by NIH-supported research. 
We are also making progress against other intractable and debilitating diseases. Diabetes affects more than 16 million Americans. Recent research has improved treatment and offers the possibility of a cure. 
Research on heart disease has made important advances. Since 1971, deaths from heart disease have dropped by 41 percent. NIH-funded research showed that one aspirin a day can reduce early mortality from heart attacks by 23 percent, and reduce subsequent nonfatal heart attacks by almost 50 percent. 
Estrogen therapy in women has been shown to have a wide range of benefits, including reduced heart disease, osteoporosis, and Alzheimer's disease. 
Dramatic progress is taking place in the treatment of stroke, which affects 3 million Americans each year. Victims who receive a new clot-dissolving drug in the first hours after a stroke recover more fully and more quickly than other patients. Half of the patients receiving this treatment recover completely. Other advances have reduced death from stroke by 59 percent since 1971. 
Parkinson's disease affects more than half a million Americans. Doctors can now identify the area of the brain causing the tremor, and destroy it with a procedure that has been successful in over a thousand patients. Patients require fewer physician visits and less medication. The treatment reduces the number of falls leading to hip fracture and the need for hospitalization, nursing homes, and physical therapy. 
Recent research on Alzheimer's disease suggests that preventing small, silent strokes can help those at risk delay the onset of the disease. 
Research on the cutting edge of molecular biology, immunology, and neuroscience are making advances. In the early 1980's, AIDS was virtually untreatable. Today, new drugs are maintaining health in people with HIV for longer and longer periods. 
Biomedical research is cost-effective. Research costs for the Hib vaccine were about $30 million. Today, the vaccine saves $70 to $150 million a year in direct medical costs. The spinal cord injury study cost very little. If the medication comes into widespread use, the potential savings are in the billions of dollars. Estrogen therapy costs less than a dollar a day; cost savings in money and human suffering are huge. 
We all know that Medicare is one of the most successful social programs ever enacted, but it is threatened today by demographic changes and the retirement of the baby boomers that lie ahead. Rather than saving the program by raised premiums of cutting reimbursements, there may be a better way.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment and commend my colleagues for bringing this important issue before the Senate. 
We have discovered an unintended gap in the budget agreement with regard to SSI coverage for disabled immigrants. If this budget agreement is adopted, elderly immigrants dependent on SSI assistance who are also disabled will continue to receive that assistance. However, the Social Security Administration states that it may take 6 months for the agency to review the current SSI caseload and make that determination. In the meantime, many elderly immigrants will lose their assistance, only to requalify later on the basis of their disability. 
Clearly, this was not intended under the budget agreement, and I commend Senator Domenici, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Chafee, Senator Feinstein, and my other colleagues for their commitment to resolve this problem and cover this gap. 
I also join many of my colleagues in expressing my hope that more can be done. As we proceed with legislation to implement this agreement, I hope that we can find ways to ensure that immigrants who fall on hard times and have no sponsors to fall back on can still get help. I am particularly concerned about elderly immigrants and immigrant children. 
So I commend my colleagues for their leaderhip in bringing this amendment before the Senate. We have made progress in restoring assistance to immigrants under this budget agreement, and I look forward to working with them on this important issue in the days ahead.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Col. Robert Francis Leary, who died on April 27 at his home in Concord, MA. 
Colonel Leary served in the U.S. Army for 34 years, retiring in 1987. His tours of duty included positions as executive officer of the 373rd General Hospital, and chief of staff of the 804th Medical Brigade, coordinating the medical readiness of Army Medical Units in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany. He also served as commandant at Fort Devens, MA, successfully conducting this course the first time it was exported outside of Fort Sam Houston, TX. Colonel Leary was the recipient of numerous military awards for distinguished service, including Meritorious Service Medals, the U.S. Army Commendation Medal, and the Legion of Merit. 
Colonel Leary also had a distinguished civilian career. He was employed by the Department of Veterans Affairs in Bedford, MA as coordinator and supervisor in the Social Work Service Department. Most recently, he was program manager of the Veterans Homestead transitional housing program in Leominster, MA. In addition, he served as an equal employment opportunity Officer at Veteran Affairs Central Office in Washington, DC, and in several capacities in private practice as a licensed independent clinical social worker. 
Colonel Leary shared his many wide-ranging interests with his family and friends including politics, travel, golf, hockey, baseball, and soccer. He was constantly involved in youth sport activities and was his children's most avid fan. To all who knew him, he was a model citizen and family member. His patriotism and commitment to service are an example to us all, and I am honored to pay tribute to him today.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to respond to a few points made on the floor this morning concerning the so-called Family Friendly Workplace Act. My colleagues from Georgia and Missouri said this morning that Democrats were filibustering this bill. They complained that working Americans are crying out for flexibility, and that Democrats are arbitrarily standing in the way of progress. 
I would like to set the record straight. We began debate on this bill Tuesday morning, May 13, and spent just over 2 hours discussing the legislation. Then the Republican leadership filed a petition to cut off debate. There was no filibuster. There were no Senators on the floor reading from irrelevant materials in an effort to thwart the will of the majority. 
We had no more discussion on the bill on Tuesday afternoon, or on Wednesday the 14th. Yesterday morning, May 15, we had 45 minutes of debate, followed immediately by a vote on the cloture petition. By a vote of 53 to 47, the Senate refused to cut off debate on the bill. 
I do not think that 3 hours of debate is enough. This bill would fundamentally alter the Fair Labor Standards Act, a law that has been on the books for almost 60 years. Three hours of debate simply is not enough time for adequate discussion on changes in so basic a protection for the Nation's workers. This is not a filibuster, Mr. President. We simply want full and fair consideration of this fundamental change in labor standards. 
My colleagues from Missouri and Kentucky also said this morning that the Fair Labor Standards Act forbids flexible work schedules for hourly employees. This, too, is false. If employers genuinely want to provide family-friendly arrangements, they are free to do so under current law. The key is the 40-hour week. Employers can schedule workers for four 10-hour days a week with the fifth day off, and pay them the regular hourly rate for each hour. No overtime pay is required. 
Employers can also arrange a work schedule of four 9-hour days plus a 4-hour day on the fifth day--again, without paying a dime of overtime. Under current law, some employees can even vary their hours enough to have a 3-day weekend every other week. 
Employers also can offer genuine flex time. This allows employers to schedule an 8-hour day around core hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., and let employees decide whether they want to work 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. or 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. This, too, costs employers not a penny more. 
But only a tiny fraction of employers use these or the many other flexible arrangements available under current law. The Bureau of Labor Statistics found in 1991 that only 10 percent of hourly employees are offered flexible schedules. 
Current law permits a host of family friendly, flexible schedules, but virtually no employers provide them. S. 4 has a different purpose. It would cut workers' wages. That is why employer groups support it unanimously. Obviously it is not just small businesses that wish to cut pay and substitute some less expensive benefit instead. 
My colleagues made another point that cries out for response. They contend that S. 4 gives employees the choice when to use accumulated compensatory hours. Once again, this is incorrect. Under S. 4, the employer could deny a worker's request to take comptime and the employee would have no redress. Even if the employer failed to comply with the bill's stated standards governing the use of compensatory time, the employee would have no right to protest, and no remedy for any protest that was lodged nonetheless. 
Contrary to my colleagues' contentions, the Democratic alternative that was offered on May 14 by Senators Baucus, Kerrey, and Landrieu actually gives the employee the choice of when to use accrued compensatory time. My colleagues' statements to the contrary notwithstanding, it is not the Government that would make that decision under our alternative, nor is it the Secretary of Labor. 
Instead, the Baucus-Kerrey-Landrieu amendment gives the worker the choice. If an employee wants to use compensatory time for any reason that would qualify for leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, the employee has an absolute right to do so. This simply gives employees the ability to be paid for leave that they already have a right to take on an unpaid basis. Thus, an employee could in fact use comptime to care for a seriously ill child, or deal with a newborn or newly adopted child. Supporters of S. 4 claim this is what they want their bill to accomplish. The Democratic alternative actually achieves that goal. 
Under the Baucus-Kerrey-Landrieu amendment, if an employee gives more than 2 weeks' notice, the employee can use comptime for any reason as long as it does not cause substantial and grievous injury to the employer's operations. Thus, if a worker wants to use comptime 3 weeks from today to attend the school play, he or she can do so unless the business would suffer this acute level of disruption. Again, the proponents of S.4 allege that they want to give employees the ability to do this. But only the Democratic alternative actually gives employees the choice. 
If an employee gives less than 2 weeks notice of a request to use comptime, under the Democratic alternative the employer must grant the request unless it would substantially disrupt the business. Once again, this supplies real choice to employees while protecting employers' ability to run their businesses. Flexibility in the workplace must run in both directions. The Republican bill gives all the flexibility to the employer, and gives the employee nothing but a pay cut. 
One final point requires a response. My colleague from Missouri contends that S. 4 simply gives hourly employees the same benefits that State and local government workers have enjoyed since 1985. He argues that Democratic support for that earlier legislation is inconsistent with our opposition to S. 4. 
But the facts belie this contention. As the Senator from Missouri well knows, the Fair Labor Standards Act was amended in 1985 to allow public sector comptime principally to allow State and local governments to avoid the costs of overtime pay. The Senator from Missouri was Governor of that State in 1985, and he testified in support of the changes before the Senate Labor Subcommittee. 
Historically, State and local governments had not been subject to the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act. When that was reversed by a Supreme Court decision, those governments were faced with substantial new costs. They immediately sought relief from Congress so that they could avoid the costs of overtime pay. 
For example, the National League of Cities claimed that, without relief, `the cost of complying with the overtime provisions of the FLSA * * * will be in excess of $1 billion for local governments.' The National Association of Counties reported that `It will cost States and localities in the billions of dollars to maintain current service levels under this ruling. * * * We need flexibility to use compensatory time and volunteers as alternatives to meeting the public's demand for increased services when we are faced with budget shortfalls.' 
Such estimates, along with similar dire warnings from other States, led to the enactment of comptime legislation for State and local government employees in 1985. As Senator Hatch put it, that legislation was meant `to prevent the taxpayers in every single city in America from suffering reduced services and higher taxes.' 
Deny it as they will, supporters of S. 4 have precisely the same motive. Saving money is precisely what the supporters of S. 4 want to accomplish. A representative of the National Federation of Independent Businesses testified before the Labor Committee in February that small businesses support S. 4 because they `cannot afford to pay their employees overtime.' Cutting workers' wages is unacceptable to those on this side of the aisle. That is why we oppose S. 4.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes. 
Mr. President, I listened to my good friend from Texas make a very eloquent statement and, of course, if that was the bill that we had before us, there would be an entirely different result than the vote that is going to take place at a little after 10 this morning. But that is not the bill we have before us. 
I'd like just to mention that on page 9 of the bill, the decision about whether an employee will be permitted to take the time off will be made, as line 18 says, by the employer, not by the employee. 
If, the good Senator from Texas said wants to change that, so that the employee makes the decision, instead of the employer, we have an entirely different bill here. If you want to give the choice to the workers, so that the employee can make that judgment and decision, you would have an entirely different outcome. 
But that is not what the legislation says. This bill says the employer will make the decision--the employer will make it. And as I have said, if the employer decides not to grant an employee's request to use comptime on a particular date, because the employer makes the decision that the employee has not given sufficient notice, or the use of the comptime would disrupt the employer's operations, the employee has no ability to appeal it. Even if the employer fails to adhere to this standard, the employee has no remedy. There is no remedy if the employer is being unreasonable or harsh. 
So that is really the difference. The difference between this bill and the Federal employee program is that the Federal employee makes the decision about when to take the time off. That is the difference between this bill and the Family and Medical Leave Act, too--the employee makes the decision. Under this bill, it is the employer that makes the decision. And that is the major difference between this bill and those existing programs. 
I would just mention to my friend again, who objects because the unions are opposed to this even though they are not affected by it. Sometimes we have groups in our country that fight for the rights of people who are not necessarily members of those groups. That is why just about every woman's group that has fought for economic justice has also opposed this legislation, because they believe it is a major step back, particularly for lower income workers. And they know that, while those lower income workers are primarily women, they are not all women. 
It is interesting that all the organizations that supported the increase in the minimum wage, all the ones who supported the Family and Medical Leave Act, all the ones who supported the WARN Act, which requires an employer to give employees 60 days' notice before closing a factory--all are opposed to this bill. And all the organizations that opposed all those provisions that would have enhanced the rights of working families are for this bill. So we ought to look at the bill very closely. 
Those organizations that support this bill do so for a very fundamental reason. 
Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture on S. 4, which its supporters call the Family Friendly Workplace Act. This is a bill with an appealing title but appalling substance. We should not rush to final passage. 
This bill would make a fundamental change in the Fair Labor Standards Act, a law that has well served American workers and 
their families for 60 years. The law requires that employees be paid no less than the minimum wage. Does that sound unreasonable to the American people? Have we changed so much in the 60 years since that Act was passed that we do not want to permit hard-working men and women to be paid the minimum wage? The law requires the payments of the minimum wage, currently at $4.75 an hour. And the law also requires that employees be paid at least time-and-a-half when they work more than 40 hours a week. 
Contrary to what the Senator from Texas said, if workers want to work 10 hours a day for 4 days and have Friday off, they can do it under existing law. They can do that under the existing law. If the employer wants to juggle work schedules so that employees can work half a day on Friday, and work longer days in the earlier part of the week, they can do that under existing law. Only 10 percent of hourly employees are offered these or other flexible arrangements available under current law. Part of our complaint about this bill is, why don't employers first demonstrate that the existing law does not work for them? We do not believe the law should be changed until employers show that existing law does not provide adequate flexibility. 
The Fair Labor Standards Act requires employers to pay the minimum wage, and to give employees time-and-a-half for hours worked over 40 in a week. That principle is part of the fabric of the employer-employee relations in this Nation. It has been so since 1938. But this bill would radically change that principle. 
Under Senator Ashcroft's proposal, employees could be required--listen to this, Mr. President--could be required to work up to 80 hours in a single week without being paid a penny of overtime. 
Under this bill, employers could require workers to work extra hours in one week, then give them an equal number of hours off at a later time without paying time-and-a-half. 
This is what it says, Mr. President. Right here on page 11: 
`In general, notwithstanding any other provision of the law'--that eliminates the 40-hour workweek--`an employer may establish biweekly work programs that allow the use of biweekly work schedules that consist of a basic work requirement of not more than 80 hours over a 2-week period in which more than 40 hours of the work requirement may occur in a week of the period.' Well, that says it. `More than 40 hours of the work requirement may occur' in 1 of the 2 weeks. 
Further: `The employee shall be compensated for each hour in such biweekly work schedule at a rate not less than the regular rate at which the employee is employed.' That is straight time. Do we all understand that? It is left to the employer to decide whether that employee will work not just 40 hours, but 50, 60, 70, or even 80 hours a week. And every single one of those hours will be paid at straight time. This is the abolition of the 40-hour workweek. 
We hear, `Well, times have changed. We do not want to be restricted by the traditions of the past.' I agree with that. We are not committed to unnecessary programs, but we are committed to values, the values that men and women ought to work 40 hours a week, and if they are going to work longer than 40 hours a week, they get paid time and a half. I think that concept is as real today as it ever was--but the Ashcroft proposal disagrees.

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 additional minutes. 
The Ashcroft proposal says that the idea of the 40-hour workweek is out; it can be 50, 60, 70 hours a week, all paid at straight time. 
I have discussed who makes the decision under this bill--it is the employer, not the employee. It is not the employee who says, `My child has a school play,' or `I have a meeting with the child's teacher.' Under this bill, the employee has no right to use comptime for these important purposes. The employee has no right to use any time for these purposes--paid or unpaid. 
That is the Murray amendment. That amendment provides employees just 24 hours a year to attend school conferences and participate in family literacy programs. Those 24 hours are within the 12 weeks of family leave provided by the Family and Medical Leave Act. We will see how many votes we get from the other side of the aisle when we consider the Murray amendment. We will see how many votes we will get on that. 
I say to the Senator from Texas that I hope she makes that very eloquent statement when Senator Murray offers the amendment. 
Mr. President, we are talking about abolishing the 40-hour workweek and giving the employers the whip hand. The changes proposed by this bill go to the heart of our labor standards laws and would alter the basic rules covering 65 million Americans. 
But this has been debated on the floor for only a little over 2 hours. We began debate on the bill 2 days ago and spent only a morning discussing it before the Republicans filed this petition--2 hours and they filed this petition. Since that time, we have not had a moment of debate on the bill on the floor of the Senate. This issue deserves much fuller consideration than that. We should not be contemplating such significant changes with so little discussion. 
These changes are so powerful and the debate has been so short, I wonder why the bill's proponents are in such a rush? What do they have to fear from developing or talking about or debating these issues? Those who support this legislation must recognize the bill cannot withstand close scrutiny. They know that full and fair consideration of the legislation will reveal fatal flaws. Serious defects are built into the bill, and the proponents know it. That is why they want to ram this legislation through without adequate opportunity for discussion. 
That is exactly why we should oppose this petition. This bill cries out for a closer look. The 65 million American workers deserve no less. 
A careful review of the bill demonstrates that it is nothing 
more than a pay cut for those hard-working Americans. In truth, the bill should be called the Paycheck Reduction Act. The bill is not designed to help employees juggle their work and family obligations. Instead, it is designed to help employers cut wages. 
The bill's proponents have admitted that small businesses cannot afford to pay their employees overtime. That is why they support this bill. This statement was made by the witness from the National Federation of Independent Businesses who testified in support of S. 4 before the Labor Committee in February. 
The bill has four major flaws. First, it makes good on the NFIB's characterization. It cuts workers' wages. Under the bill, an employer could force an employee to take an hour off in the future for every hour of overtime they work. Current law requires employers to pay time and a half for overtime hours. Substituting time off at a straight time rate is a pay cut, pure and simple. 
The bill also lets employers discriminate against workers who refuse to take comptime instead of overtime pay. Under S. 4, the employer is free to assign overtime work only to those workers who accept comptime. Workers who need the money the most, who cannot afford to take the time off, would be hurt the most. Their paychecks would be smaller. Giving the employer that power eliminates the worker's freedom of choice. We offered an amendment to address that issue. It was defeated in the Labor Committee--on a party line vote. 
Second, the bill cuts employees' benefits. Many industries link the size of employees' pension and health benefits to the number of hours they work. Under S. 4, when an employee uses comptime hours, they would not count towards pension and health benefits. The result is a reduction in employees' income after retirement and a cut in their health benefits while they are working. Once again, we offered an amendment on that issue in committee, and we were defeated along strict party lines. 
The bill also permits a perverse outcome. The way the bill is drafted, an employee would not be assured an increase in time off. If an employee takes 8 hours of comptime on Monday in order to spend time with his or her family, the employer is free to force the employee to work on Saturday to make up for lost time. The employer does not even have to pay time and a half for the hours worked on Saturday. That is really family friendly. The comptime hours used on Monday do not count toward the 40-hour workweek. Is this family friendly? We offered an amendment on this issue, too, and it was defeated along party lines in the committee. 
Third, as I mentioned, the bill abolishes the 40-hour week. The so-called biweekly work program allows employers to work employees up to 80 hours in a single week, without paying a penny of overtime. Or, the employer could impose a work schedule of 60 hours one week and 20 hours the next--again, without paying any overtime premium. Making child care arrangements for such shifting and irregular schedules wouldn't be family-friendly--it would be a nightmare. 
Finally, and most importantly, the bill does not give employees the choice about when to take comp hours that they have earned. Supporters of S. 4 claim that their bill is meant to give employees the option to use comptime to attend a child's graduation, take an elderly parent to the doctor, or deal with other family obligations. But nothing in this bill requires the employer to give the employee the day that he or she wants or needs. Instead, the bill gives the employer virtually unreviewable discretion to decide when the employee takes the time off. 
If the employer gets to choose when employees can take comptime, this bill provides no benefit. It does not help workers to give up overtime pay if the employer can deny their request to use comptime when they need it. Instead, the system becomes nothing more than a pay cut. 
For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture. Give us the opportunity to explore and discuss what this bill does to--not for--65 million working Americans. The hard-working families who depend on overtime pay to make ends meet deserve no less. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is unfortunate that the Republican leadership has chosen to force this debate on the same confrontational and unconstitutional legislation that President Clinton vetoed last year, when reasonable and constitutional alternatives are so obviously available. It is clear that the primary purpose of the Republican leaders is not to regulate late-term abortions, but to roll back the protections for women guaranteed by the Supreme Court. 
If the goal is to pass effective legislation, the sponsors of the Santorum bill know they must meet the constitutional requirments for protecting of a woman's right to choose. President Clinton has made clear that he cannot and will not accept a ban on any procedure that represents the best hope for a woman to avoid serious risks to her health. The bill vetoed last year and the bill before us today are identical, and they clearly fail to provide these needed protections for women. 
The Supreme Court rulings in the Roe and Casey decisions prohibit Congress and the States from imposing an `undue burden' on a woman's right to choose to have an abortion at any time up to the point where the developing fetus reaches the stage of viability. 
Governments can constitutionally limit abortions after the stage of viability, as long as the limitations contain exceptions to protect the life and the health of the woman. 
This bill flunks that clear constitutional test in two ways. It imposes an undue burden--a flat prohibition--on a woman's constitutional right to an abortion before fetal viability. And it impermissibly limits the right to an abortion after fetal viability, by excluding any protection whatsoever for the woman's health. 
Given the clear constitutional problems with this bill, it is fair to ask, why do Republicans insist that we send it to the President, for another certain veto, when reasonable alternatives are available. 
In fact, there is little need for any Federal legislation in this area because 41 States already ban late-term abortions. Massachusetts has prohibited these abortions except when the woman's life is in danger or `the continuation of the pregnancy would impose a substantial risk of grave impairment to the woman's physical or mental health.' Many other States have similar restrictions. There is no evidence that the States are not enforcing their laws. 
Supporters of the Republican bill also claim that the public and Congress were misled about the actual number of abortions performed by the procedure that would be banned by their bill. But very few, if any, of us in the last Congress were misled about the facts. Only a few hundred of these procedures are performed after viability, and they are performed in cases where the fetus cannot survive because of a severe medical abnormality, or where there is a serious threat to the life or the health of the woman. 
It was clearly reported during last year's debate that the procedure was also used before the stage of viability, and that the number of such cases was larger, probably amounting to several thousand a year. But all of us were also aware that Congress cannot constitutionally ban the procedure at that stage. 
We know that some doctors begin to use the particular procedure that would be banned by the Republican bill at about 20 weeks of gestation, which is well before the time when a fetus has the capacity for survival outside the womb. Most authorities place the time of viability at 24 to 26 weeks in a normal pregnancy. According to the best available statistics, 99 percent of all abortions are performed before 20 weeks. Only about 1 percent of all abortions are performed after that time, and two-thirds of those abortions are performed before the 23d week. 
This information is provided by the Alan Guttmacher Institute and used by the National Center for Health Statistics. It is the most accurate information available. 
Even so, it is difficult to draw a sharp dividing line on the viability of a particular pregnancy. A great deal depends on the prenatel care the woman is receiving. Low-birth weight babies reach viability at later stages of pregnancy. 
A further problem is that viability is to some extent a statistical concept. At 21 weeks of a normal pregnancy, few if any fetuses can survive. At 23 weeks about 25 percent survive. At 26 weeks about 50 percent survive. 
A physician's decision relies on best medical judgment, but it is hardly precise for a particular case. The real issue involves lives and the health of women. The so-called partial-birth abortion bill would not stop a single abortion. Instead, it would force women to use another, possibly more dangerous procedure if they must terminate their pregnancy to preserve their health. 
Of course, the sponsors of this bill continue to argue that there are no circumstances in which a procedure banned by the bill is necessary to preserve a woman's health. And, even worse, some supporters don't seem to care. Mark Crutcher, president of Life Dynamics, an antiabortion organization based in Denton TX, told the Detroit Free Press that the bill is `a scam being perpetrated by people on our side of the issue * * * for fund-raising purposes.' 
It doesn't seem to matter to the proponents of this defective Republican bill that women like Maureen Britell, Eileen Sullivan, Coreen Costello, Erica Fox, Vikki Stella, Tammy Watts, Viki Wilson, and others will be forced to risk serious health consequences if this bill becomes law. 
Doctor after doctor has told us that this procedure may be necessary to preserve a woman's health. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has said:  
An intact D&X may be the best or most appropriate procedure in a particular circumstance to save the life or preserve the health of a woman, and only the doctor, in consultation with the patient, based upon the woman's particular circumstances can make this decision. The intervention of legislative bodies into medical decisionmaking is inappropriate, ill-advised, and dangerous. 
Perhaps if the Republican men in Congress were the ones to get pregnant, they would show more compassion for the women who find themselves in these tragic circumstances. 
Take the case of Coreen Costello. After consulting numerous medical experts and doing everything possible to save her child, Coreen had the procedure that would be banned by this legislation. Based on that experience, she gave the following testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee last year: 
I hope you can put aside your political differences, your positions on abortion, and your party affiliations and just try to remember us. We are the ones who know. We are the families that ache to hold our babies, to love them, to nurture them. We are the families who will forever have a hole in our hearts. We are the families that had to choose how our babies would die * * * please put a stop to this terrible bill. Families like mine are counting on you. 
I oppose this legislation. Instead, I stand with Coreen Costello and others whose lives and health must be protected. The alternative proposed by Senator Snowe and Senator Daschle provides that protection, and so does the alternative proposed by Senator Feinstein, Senator Boxer and Senator Moseley-Braun. I intend to vote for these alternatives, because they respect the Constitution, and above all they respect the right of women and their doctors to make these difficult and tragic decisions.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Federal courts today suffer from far too many unfilled judgeships. There are at least 99 vacancies for judges in the appeals courts and district courts. Twenty-four of these vacancies--in the appellate courts and in the trial courts--are judicial emergencies according to the definition of the Judicial Conference of the United States. That is, the positions have been vacant for at least 18 months. 
As a result, caseloads are backlogged throughout the country, and the victims of this situation are the American people. Justice delayed is justice denied. Thousands of Americans with legitimate grievances cannot get their day in court, because there are few Federal judges to hear their cases. Citizens must wait excessive lengths of time to resolve disputes, answer constitutional questions, and obtain justice. 
We need strong courts to combat crime, to put criminals behind bars and make sure they serve their time. We need strong courts to protect families, jobs, and businesses. Where else can Americans go when they are treated unfairly on the job or when their small businesses are run over by larger corporations? 
Just this week, I received a letter from a lawyer in San Diego who is concerned that the Federal court serving the city has had two vacancies unfilled for over 2 years. 
He writes, 
Our federal court in San Diego is at the breaking point. For more than two years, the Court has valiantly struggled with a burgeoning case load and managed barely to keep its head above water by dedicated and innovative work on the part of our senior and active judges and our magistrate judges. But the system has been stretched as far as it can go. It desperately needs its two judges. 
In fact, President Clinton has submitted two qualified nominees to fill these vacancies, but the Senate has yet to take action on them. Jeffrey Miller was nominated last July. In March, he finally had a hearing and was approved unanimously by the Judiciary Committee in April. But his nomination has been languishing ever since, waiting for the Senate to act. The Republican leadership won't let the nomination come up for a vote. 
The problems in San Diego are being repeated in communities throughout the United States, and a major cause is the intentional stall by Congress in processing new judges. 
So far this year, the Republican-controlled Senate has approved only two judicial nominees. Three more have been approved by the Judiciary Committee, but the Republican leadership has made no effort to put them before the Senate for confirmation. 
Last year, in the Republican-controlled Senate, only 17 district court judges were approved, and no appeals court judges were approved--none--zero. 
Since 1980, the Senate confirmed an average of 51 judges per year. When measured against this standard of performance, today's Republican Senate gets a failing grade. 
Republicans shut down the Federal Government in 1995 and were rightly criticized for that unwise action. They say they will never do it again, and are even trying to pass a law that would put the Government on automatic pilot if a budget agreement is not reached. But at the same time, behind the scenes, there is a Republican scheme to shut down our Nation's courts. 
The issue is far more than a numbers game. What we are witnessing today is a direct assault on the President's constitutional power to nominate and appoint judges. 
Our Republican friends claim they want to move ahead on nominees. They say the current stall on judicial nominations is not an effort to force President Clinton to apply Republican litmus tests to nominees. We hear that the unwise plans proposed by Senator Gramm of Texas and Senator Gorton of Washington were defeated in the Republican caucus 2 weeks ago. 
But the facts speak for themselves. Republicans have shut down the courts and the American people are suffering the consequences. 
Republicans say they want to make sure that no activist judges are appointed to the courts. They've also begun to attack sitting judges. Judge Martha Daughtry of Tennessee is a case in point. She was nominated by President Clinton to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals and confirmed by the Senate in 1993 with broad bipartisan support. 
Later, a prominent State judge in her circuit was convicted of Federal civil rights offenses involving sexual assaults on court employees, job applicants, and female attorneys. A three-judge panel of the sixth circuit affirmed the conviction. But the en banc court, dominated by Reagan and Bush appointees overturned it. They ruled that the U.S. Constitution does not give Congress the power to protect women from sexual assaults by State officials. 
Judge Daughtry dissented. She said that the right of citizens to be free from physical harm by public officials who abuse their authority has been recognized `since the sealing of the Magna Carta.' 
But Presidential candidate Bob Dole attacked Judge Daughtry and placed her in his `Hall of Shame.' He cited her as an example of the liberal activist judges that President Clinton appointed to the bench. 
Judge Daughtry had the last laugh. Two months ago, the Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court not only reversed the sixth circuit decision, they reversed it unanimously, and cited Judge Daughtry's dissent in their opinion. 
Another case in point is Margaret Morrow, whose nomination is pending in the Judiciary Committee. There should be no doubt about her competence and judicial temperament. Her nomination received the American Bar Association's highest rating. She has numerous endorsements from her peers in California--both Democrats and Republicans. She is a corporate lawyer, hardly an activist by anyone's definition. She was the first woman president of the State Bar of California. She is a past president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association. She has received numerous awards from the Los Angeles Bar Association, the California Judicial Council, and other legal associations. In 1994, she was listed as one of the top 20 lawyers in Los Angeles in California Law Business. The Los Angeles Business Journal named her one of the top 100 business lawyers in Los Angeles in 1995 and 1996. 
Probably the greatest test of her temperament for the job is the manner in which she has responded to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Despite the fact that she was held over for a second hearing in the committee and the many questions addressed to her, she has responded thoroughly, professionally, efficiently, and appropriately to each one. That is exactly what we want in a Federal judge. 
An extremely well-qualified woman is being held up arbitrarily. There is no justification whatsoever for this unfair delay. 
I hope that our Republican friends will reconsider their stall on judicial nominations. The rule of law in America depends on a healthy judiciary. 
And if the Republican majority in the Senate does not move ahead to respond to the crisis in the courts, I hope that President Clinton will consider the only alternative he has left. In their wisdom, the Founding Fathers gave the President a useful additional power, the power of recess appointments. If the log jam doesn't break soon--very soon, the President should start using that power. The Memorial Day recess offers the next opportunity to make recess appointments, and the President should not hesitate to use it.

 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to cosponsor the Early Childhood Development Act and I commend Senator Kerry for introducing this important legislation. 
Recent research has clearly demonstrated what parents and others have intuitively known for generations: that experiences in the early childhood years lay the foundation for much of later development. Children thrive and grow on positive interactions with their parents and other adults. Quality child care, quality nutrition, and quality health care can make all the difference in enabling infants and children to reach their full potential and become contributing members of society. Ensuring that children have these experiences early in development is much easier and less expensive than coping with later crisis problems such as substance abuse, school dropout, and criminal behavior. 
The Early Childhood Development Act is a significant step toward helping children obtain the multiple supports they need to grow and thrive. It builds effectively on the White House summit in April that emphasized the very great importance of this issue. It will help State and local jurisdictions expand their efforts to assist young children and their families. It will strengthen Early Head Start, and increase resources for child care and nutrition. 
This initiative is extremely important for the Nation's children. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Kerry and others to provide children with the opportunities they need and deserve and must have in order to help our country for the generations to come.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in paying special tribute to Senator Frist. As a new Member, he took over the responsibilities in this area and has made an enormous contribution to bringing us where we are; also, Senator Coats, and, in particular, the chairman of the committee, Senator Jeffords, who has exercised leadership. 
I also thank Tom Harkin. This act was passed 22 years ago. I remember when 5 1/2 million children were pushed aside and lacked any kind of hope and opportunity. Senator Harkin has been a giant in the Senate for all those who have been disabled in our country. Today is a victory for children, it is a victory for the parents of these children, and it is a victory for our country. I think, quite frankly, it is the finest moment we have had in this session. I commend those who made it possible to make a difference for disabled children.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are on this legislation again today. I have a great appreciation for the leadership in attempting to try to juggle a variety of very important pieces of legislation. We have had the emergency appropriations which I think all of us would agree is the first order of business that we want to get passed. As to this legislation, we have been on again, off again. We are glad to debate these issues, but I understand some of the frustration of some of our colleagues during the course of this debate where the bill is on for an hour or two, and they try to begin to follow it, and then it is off again and we are uncertain when it will be be brought up again. That is something we have to deal with, but we will do the best that we can in attempting to deal with the on again, off again nature of this debate and respond to the questions which have been raised over this. 
As we continue this debate, I want again to outline for the Members, who it is who supports this legislation because there have been a variety of different observations about the degree of support, who is supporting it, and who is opposing it. Those of us who have concerns about this legislation have enormous empathy and sympathy for families. That has been the focus over time of our Labor and Human Resources Committee, as well as others here. It is not just Members on this side of the aisle. It is many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have made the cause of working families their cause. 
But nonetheless, as we deal with this issue, it is important to know who is supporting it and who is against. I want to say again at the outset that we believe working families have been hard pressed over the last 25 years since about 1972 when their incomes effectively became stagnant. In the last 5 to 7 years we have seen that families are working longer and harder to make ends meet and are very hard pressed to rise every morning and deal with their family's issues as well. And so at the outset this legislation has some appeal, and if it was exactly as has been described it might have some merit. But the concern that many of us have is that it really gives the whip hand, so to speak, to the employers and it does appear to many of us that this is really a subterfuge to permit employers to avoid paying overtime. 
We even had testimony from witnesses who were supporting the legislation who told the Labor and Human Resources Committee that 
that was the principal reason why they were supporting it. The National Federation of Independent Businesses told the Committee, `Small businesses can't afford to pay their employees overtime. This is something they can offer in exchange that gives them a benefit.' 
So we ought to understand right at the outset why many of those who do support comptime, also support the inclusion of Senator Murray's amendment. That amendment would have given absolute discretion to employees to take up to 24 hours a year to be able to attend a parents' meeting at school to consider the child's educational progress, or other such educational activities. Such an amendment was offered in the committee, but it was defeated along party lines. 
That amendment was offered. It was supported by the President, and supported overwhelmingly by the majority of the American people. Under the amendment, the decision was the employee's. But the committee rejected that amendment along straight party lines. It was rejected. It was rejected. It was rejected. 
We have also heard a great deal about the needs that families have to get some time off when they have a sick child. No employees in this country ought to have to make the choice between the job that they need and the child that they love. We passed the Family and Medical Leave Act to address those needs. That effort was achieved in a bipartisan way. But it was limited to those employers that had more than 50 employees. It has worked and worked well. And, under the Family and Medical Leave Act, if there is a medical emergency, if the need for treatment is not foreseeable, the employee has an absolute right to take time off. The employee has that right. If the medical condition is forseeable, then the employee has to make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment at a time that does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer. We offered an amendment in the committee to allow employees to use compensatory time under this same standard. That is, an employee has the right to use comptime at any time for reasons that would qualify under the Family and Medical Leave Act. But that amendment, too, was rejected along strict party lines. 
The Family and Medical Leave Act applies to firms with 50 and more. Senator Dodd offered an amendment in the committee to lower that threshold to 25 employees. That amendment, too, was rejected on party lines. 
That is why the real issue regarding comptime is who is going to make the decision. If it is going to be the employee, put my name on it. Put my name on it. And I bet you would get the overwhelming majority of the Members on this side. If the employers are the ones who are going to make the decision--certainly you are not going to have my support, and you are going to be hard pressed to get the support of those who have been championing workers' rights. 
That leads me to another point, and that is who are the supporters. Are these concerns just mine, or those of my good friend and colleague, Senator Wellstone, or Senator Dodd, Senator Harkin, Senator Moseley-Braun, and many others? No, that was a conclusion reached by the League of Women Voters, the National Women's Political Caucus, the National Women's Law Center, the Women's Legal Defense Fund. 
It is very interesting why these organizations which have been the champion of women's issues and women's rights oppose this bill. It is because many of the people who are going for the overtime are women, single moms. You would think these organizations that have been fighting for women's rights and workers' rights would be out here supporting it, saying why are you battling it? Why are you battling it? These organizations that day in and day have been championing the economic rights of women universally reject the conclusions that have been drawn by some of our friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle--that the employees are going to make all of these decisions, that it is going to benefit 
the single moms for employers to make the judgments about when they can be with their children. 
That is not my reading of this bill, and many others agree. It is the conclusion of those organizations--not that we have to be on the side always of these organizations; they are not always correct. But it is interesting that every one of the organizations that have been championing women's economic rights and rights for children are all opposed to it. Why? 
The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights: 
The legislation could reduce the income of many working families and make it more difficult for them to balance competing work and family responsibilities. 
That theme runs all the way through. I will include it in the Record, Mr. President. The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights draws the same conclusion that I and many others have drawn, and that is after all is said and done it is the employer that is going to make the judgment about whether employees choose whether to earn comptime and when to use it if they've earned it. So these wonderful speeches that I read over the course of the weekend in support of comptime, which were well stated and eloquently stated in many instances, beg the fundamental issue: that is, who is going to make the judgment about that sick child, about that sick relative, about the necessity for going to a teachers' conference or to a child's play. 
That has been the subject of debate here for more than 10 years. When we finally achieved it, in the Family and Medical Leave Act, it is the employee who has the right.

Mr. KENNEDY. I know there are others who want to speak. I see my friend, Senator Wellstone, in the Chamber. I commend Senator Harkin for making an excellent presentation. I hope the Senator will perhaps mention the coalition Members that are in support of this bill. The National Association of Manufacturers, the National Federation of Independent Businesses, the National Restaurant Association--they are not shrinking violets in terms of special interest groups. But the bottom line is, as I understand the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Minnesota, we oppose comptime where employees cannot make the decisions, as they can under the Family and Medical Leave Act and as Federal employees can. The situation might be different if the employee could genuinely make the choice, but, under this bill, there is no choice for the employee. Therefore, we oppose the bill. 
We draw the line where we say this is basically stacked against the employees. I tried to spell that out earlier. But I just welcome getting the Senator's reaction on that issue. 
We are for trying to get those kinds of protections. We were for it in the committee, as the Senator knows, when we tried to get the Murray amendment to give the 24 hours with the decision to be made by the employees. It was voted down by the Republicans unanimously. In terms of the Dodd amendment, it was voted down by them again--where the employee has it. When we get to the bottom line, is that not really the basic issue which is at stake?

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join today with my colleagues in solidarity with a courageous Chinese advocate of human rights, Wei Jingsheng. 
Each year, the family and friends of Robert F. Kennedy, and those who honor his legacy present a human rights award in my brothers name. In 1994, Wei Jingsheng won that award. 
Except for a brief period in late 1993 and early 1994, Wei has been imprisoned since 1979 because he dared to call for democracy and freedom of expression in his country. 
Wei never feared to tell the story of the abysmal conditions imposed on those who dare to speak for human rights, democracy, and freedom of expression in China. 
He was an electrician at the Beijing Zoo in 1979, when he earned international praise during the Democracy Wall movement for his courageous essays criticizing the Chinese leadership and calling for democratic reforms. 
In his 1978 journal, `Explorations,' he publicly exposed the torture of political prisoners. He later wrote one of the most famous essays of the democracy movement, arguing eloquently and powerfully that democracy and free speech were preconditions for China's economic and social growth. In another essay, he challenged China's leader at the time, Deng Xiaoping, saying: `We cannot help asking Deng what his idea of democracy is. If the people have no right to express freely their opinions or to enjoy freedom of speech and criticism, then how can one talk of democracy? * * * Only a genuine general election can create a government and leaders ready to serve the interests of the electorate.' 
For his refusal to remain quiet, he was arrested in 1979, tried secretly, and sentenced to 15 years in prison--most of which he spent in solitary confinement. He was repeatedly tortured. 
In September 1993, Wei was released as part of China's public relations attempt to win the opportunity to host the Olympic Games in the year 2000. Upon leaving prison, Wei immediately resumed his leading role in the democracy movement. 
On April 1, 1994, after Wei met with Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights, John Shattuck, he was arrested again and held incommunicado for 20 months. He was formally charged in November 1995 and, after a 1 day trial, was convicted of `engaging in activities in an attempt to overthrow the Chinese Government.' 
Wei is now in a prison cell serving a 14-year sentence. His health is poor, his conditions are deplorable, and he is repeatedly tortured. 
Today we celebrate the latest publication of his writings, `The Courage to Stand Alone.' Wei has often stood alone against the Chinese Government. But he does not stand alone, and he will not stand alone in the wider world. He will never stand alone, as long as there are those who care about human rights and who are willing to speak out on his behalf. We will go on doing so until Wei is released, all political prisoners in China are released, and the basic human rights he so bravely fights for are enjoyed by all the people of China.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last year Massachusetts was ranked 48th in the Nation in networked classrooms. Only 30 percent--700 out of our more than 2,400 schools--had adequate computer technology and wiring. In a State with such a critical mass of knowledge-based industries requiring a highly-trained, highly skilled work force, this was unacceptable. 
So in May 1996, we created the MassNetworks Educational Partnership as a nonprofit collaborative effort to assist our schools in becoming wired to the Internet, and to coordinate what are now called NetDays not only in Massachusetts but all across the country. 
We began this effort, to be sure, with an advantage over most other States. Our information technology industries have grown rapidly in recent years. We enjoy strong labor unions and highly dedicated teachers, principals and superintendents, which have combined their expertise to allow us to accomplish much in a brief amount of time. 
For our two State NetDays since last May, we have had more than 14,000 volunteers help wire over 800 additional schools in Massachusetts. These volunteers, aided by 15 million dollars' worth of donated and discounted goods, services, and technical support, already have had an enormous impact on the future of Massachusetts. We have truly become a model to the Nation. 
However, this effort is not limited to these two NetDays, and we are far from finished. All across the State, parents, children, educators, labor leaders, businesspeople, public servants, and others who care so deeply about education will be continuing to work together to wire more schools, train more teachers and install more hardware throughout the rest of the school year and summer. 
The investment we are making will continue to pay off in better results in our schools--students with sharper skills, improved grades, lower absenteeism, improved grades, reduced drop-out rates, and improved standards of living when they enter the work force. Studies show that in the year 2000, 70 percent all new jobs will require the type of high-technology skills that only 20 percent of our work force currently possess. If we are to succeed in our endeavor, we must prepare our children with the knowledge they need to be competitive in the next century. 
Toward that end, I will work to help Massachusetts be the first State in the Nation to meet President Clinton's goal of wiring all of America's schools to the Internet by the year 2000. 
The Internet is the ticket to the information superhighway. The effort taking place in Massachusetts is putting this incredible resource within reach of all students. I strongly commend all those involved. 
Education is one of the best investments we can make in the future of this State, and wiring students to the Internet is one of the wisest forms our investment can take. The Internet is the blackboard of the 21st century, and we should be prepared to use it to the fullest of our capability. The Internet is the newest world of information, and the newest frontier to conquer. Much like the shot heard around the world, our dedication to our students must be heard all over the globe. 
Ultimately, the strength of this effort comes not from computers and wire, but from our ability to help schools teach and help students learn in new ways. I am confident that we will make the most of the tremendous opportunity that is at hand.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was proud to serve on the committee that passed the original Individuals With Disabilities Education Act in 1975, and I am proud to support the current reauthorization. 
I commend Chairman Jeffords, Senator Coats, Senator Frist, and Senator Harkin for their leadership in negotiating this needed legislation to reauthorize IDEA. I commend the House Members who worked closely with us--Representative Goodling, Representative Riggs, Representative Castle, Representative Graham, Representative Martinez, Representative Scott, Representative Miller, and Representative Clay. I also especially commend our distinguished Senate majority leader, Senator Lott, for his effective leadership in bringing all sides together and making this needed compromise possible. 
For 22 years, IDEA has held out hope to young persons with disabilities that they too can learn, and that their learning will enable them to become independent and productive citizens, and live fulfilling lives. For millions of children with disabilities, IDEA has meant the difference between dependence and independence, between lost potential and productive careers. 
In 1975, 4 million handicapped children did not receive the help they needed to be successful in school. Few disabled preschoolers received services, and 1 million children with disabilities were excluded from public school. Now, IDEA serves 5.4 million children with disabilities from birth through age 21. Every State in the Nation offers public education and early intervention services to children with disabilities. 
Fewer than 6,000 children with disabilities are living in institutional settings away from their families today, compared to 95,000 children in 1969. This transformation represents a major accomplishment in keeping families together, and it also reflects a significant reduction in the cost to the Government and taxpayers of paying for institutional care, which averages $50,000 a year for each child. 
Students with disabilities are making great progress. The number of students with disabilities completing high school with a diploma or certificate increased from 55 percent in 1984 to 64 percent in 1992. 
Some 44 percent of all people with disabilities have some college education today, compared to only 29 percent in 1986. This dramatic increase demonstrates the success of the equal access provisions of IDEA; 47 percent of people without disabilities have some college education, so the gap has almost closed. 
For young people with disabilities, as for so many others, education leads to economic success; 57 percent of people with disabilities are competitively 
employed within 5 years of leaving school today, compared to an employment rate of only 33 percent for older people with disabilities who have not benefited from IDEA. With this reauthorization, we are taking needed additional steps to see that disabled children can grow up with the skills they need to get a job and live independently. 
This bill will direct the attention of teachers and schools away from paperwork and toward the academic progress of students with disabilities. The bill changes the Federal formula from one based on child counts to one based on census and poverty data. This revised formula in no way changes the commitment and obligation of education agencies to identify and serve children with disabilities. Changes in the Federal formula and in other areas of the bill are intended to help schools and school districts improve the quality of services the children receive. 
The bill strengthens the individualized education plan, by tying a child's education to the general curriculum and ensuring accountability for results. It also urges schools to see that students are not being referred to special education when their needs can be better met in regular classes. 
We also address another serious problem--the disproportional representation of minority students in special education. This bill makes States responsible for monitoring the impact of policies on identification and placement of minority students. Through the development of coordinated service systems in schools, prereferral intervention programs, including behavior management and academic skill development, will be more available to academically challenged students and help reduce the number of minority students wrongly referred to special education. It also gives parents better information about these issues so they can be more effective in helping their children. 
In addition, the bill continues and strengthens early intervention and preschool programs for disabled infants and toddlers. By establishing better relationships with other public and private programs, early childhood programs under IDEA can be a resource for young children with disabilities as well as for children at risk of disability. It will make it easier for schools and districts to collect funds from other agencies, without allowing schools to abdicate their responsibility for making sure that disabled students get the services they need. 
It also requires States to offer mediation, but makes it voluntary for both parties to determine whether they want to participate. In addition, the bill authorizes school districts to require parents to meet with representatives from parent training centers or other alternative dispute resolution experts to explain the benefits of mediation. 
Schools have asked for additional leeway to discipline students with disabilities to help guarantee a safe learning environment for all students. This bill gives schools 
more discretion in disciplining students with disabilities, while still protecting those students. The bill provides the authority for school personnel to remove children with disabilities from their current placement into an interim alternative educational setting for up to 45 days in two specific cases: First, if the child carries a weapon or knowingly possesses, uses, or sells illegal drugs of controlled substances; or second, if the school obtains such authority from a hearing officer after demonstrating that maintaining a child in the current placement is substantially likely to result in injury to the child or others. 
Although the bill provides more flexibility for schools to discipline students, discipline should never be used as an excuse to exclude or segregate children with disabilities because of the failure to design behavioral management plans, or the failure to provide support services and staff training. It is critical that schools use the new discretion with utmost care. Research tells us that suspension and expulsion are ineffective in changing the behavior of students in special education. When students with disabilities are suspended or expelled and their education is disrupted, they are likely to fall farther behind, become more frustrated, and drop out of school altogether. 
Children who leave school become a burden on society. Dropouts are three times more likely to be unemployed than high school graduates. Nearly half of the heads of households on welfare and half of the prison population did not finish high school. 
We have also made changes to see that the provisions of IDEA are more vigorously enforced by giving the U.S. Secretary of Education and State education agencies greater power to enforce the law, including greater discretion to withhold funds when violations are found and explicit statutory authority to refer cases of noncompliance to the Department of Justice for enforcement action. We expect the Department of Justice to act on such referrals in a timely and appropriate manner. This referral authority is particularly critical for instances when a State fails to implement corrective action within the time specified in the State monitoring plan. We expect the Secretary to use enforcement authorities when applicable to ensure that failure to comply with the law will not go without remedy. 
In addition, the Department of Education is expected to report annually on the status of State monitoring and compliance. We also expect the Department of Education to include parents more actively in the State and local monitoring process. 
We must never go back to the days when large numbers of school-age children with disabilities were excluded from public school, when few if any pre-school children with disabilities received services, and when most children in school did not get the help they deserve. The goal of public education is to give all children the opportunity to pursue their dreams. We must be committed to every child--even the 
ones who aren't easy to teach. 
I commend all the students, parents, teachers, and administrators who have left an indelible mark on this legislation. Their commitment to this law and their willingness to put aside the divisions of the past and find constructive compromises will improve the education of students with disabilities, and enable schools to implement the law as effectively as possible. 
I also commend and thank all the staff members of the working group for their skillful assistance in making this process successful: Pat Morrissey and Jim Downing of Senator Jeffords' staff; Townsend Lange of Senator Coats staff; Bobby Silverstein and Tom Irvin of Senator Harkin's staff; David Hoppe and Mark Hall of Senator Lott's staff; and Kate Powers, Connie Garner, and Danica Petroshius of my own staff. I also commend the hard work of the House staff on the working group, including Sally Lovejoy and Todd Jones of the House committee majority staff; Alex Nock of the House committee minority staff, Theresa Thompson of Representative Scott's staff, and Charlie Barone of Representative Miller's staff. 
This bill deserves the support of every Member of Congress. It means a new day of hope and opportunity for children with disabilities. 
I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I welcome the opportunity to make some brief comments on the measures which are before us here this morning, and that is on the legislation which is, allegedly, the family friendly workplace legislation. I will just take a brief time, but I want, just at the outset, to indicate where we are in terms of working families in this country. 
We have made important progress in the last Congress in increasing the minimum wage. 
It was not long ago that we made real progress in trying to provide employees who have worked over a long period of time in a plant or a factory with notification when there was going to be a plant closing, so that men and women who worked years, for some a lifetime, in a particular plant would not show up on Monday and find the doors boarded up. In the past, individuals like these were often virtually cast out into the dark without any kind of notification whatsoever. We tried to give, at least for the larger companies that were included in that legislation, notice to the employees so that they would be treated more respectfully and have more time to find a new job. That law has worked very well despite the dire predictions of some in the U.S. Senate. 
Then we had the battle on family and medical leave which gives parents who have a sick child the opportunity to take unpaid leave. Every other industrial nation in the world has paid leave under those circumstances, yet it took a lengthy battle in the U.S. Senate to get unpaid leave. We were able to pass it for employers with 50 or more employees. I will come back to that issue in just a few moments. That battle was led by our friend and colleague, Senator Dodd of Connecticut. I welcomed the chance to join with him on that. It was a 5-year battle in the Senate. Twelve million Americans have taken advantage of it, the law has worked very well and most Americans wonder why it took us so long. 
Those are just three examples of issues, Madam President, which we have fought for on behalf of working men and women. There have been many others. What is so interesting is that in each and every one of those battles, we faced opposition from the National Association of Manufacturers; the Labor Policy Association, which is comprised of many different companies and employers; the National Restaurant Association; and the NFIB. It is very interesting that now on the floor of the U.S. Senate, on legislation that is supposed to protect workers, those four organizations are trying to portray themselves as friends of the worker. 
It is very interesting that those groups, and many others that have opposed every single protection for workers in the past, are embracing S. 4 and are now suddenly going to protect all the employees in America. 
As we begin this debate, I think it is worthwhile to examine those that are for this legislation and those who are critical of this particular legislation. We should ask who has credibility as advocates for America's workers and who does not. This bill has been described by its authors as `a Mother's Day gift to America's working women.' Nothing could be further from the truth. It is a Mother's Day hoax. A more appropriate description would be the `Employer Choice and Paycheck Reduction Act,' and it has four fatal flaws. 
First, it would result in a pay cut for many working families. The bill eliminates the guarantee of pay for overtime work for 65 million employees. Many of them are already struggling to make ends meet. Nearly half of those who earn overtime pay have a total income of $16,000 a year or less. More than 80 percent of them earn under $28,000 a year. Employees could allocate all overtime work to employees who agree to accept time off instead of extra pay for working overtime. Those who insist on receiving overtime pay will no longer get overtime work. 
Second, the bill provides no employee choice. Let me repeat that, because that is the heart, I think, of this whole debate: Will the employee have the right to make the decision to take time off when he or she needs it, to go with a child to that school meeting or to that play or to the dentist appointment? Or will the employer have the ultimate authority and power to say no? 
Under the terms of S. 4, the employer is given the power to dictate when workers can use comptime. S. 4 would not let working mothers choose when to take their hard-earned comptime. That is the key to what is wrong with this bill. It is the heart of the debate: Where is the power, who determines when the employee can use the comptime which has been earned. This bill provides no 
employee choice. 
Third, the bill will cut benefits for many workers; because it does not count hours of comptime as hours worked. Health and retirement benefits are widely based on the number of hours worked by employees. But under the Republican bill, comptime hours do not count as hours worked. As a result, employees can lose eligibility for health coverage while they are working, and lose eligibility for pension benefits when they retire. 
And fourth, the Republican proposal effectively abolishes the 40-hour workweek. An employer can literally require employees to work up to 80 hours in a single week without overtime pay. As long as the 2-week total does not exceed 80 hours, the workers would not be entitled to extra pay. A company can schedule a worker for 60 hours in one week, and 20 in the next, all without a penny of overtime pay. That is hardly a gift to working mothers, forcing them to try to arrange child care to coincide with such an erratic work schedule. 
Madam President, I will just take a moment or two this morning to talk about the issue of employee choice. I have listened to the eloquent remarks of our friends and colleagues who are supporting this proposal. Talk is pretty cheap around here, and it is important that we look at the legislative language. 
The bill gives employees, as I mentioned, no right to use the comptime when he or she needs it. Instead, the bill makes it easy for employers to discourage the use of the comptime during the busy periods on the job. The bill says this, Madam President: `The employee shall be permitted to use comptime within a reasonable period after making the request if the use of comptime off does not unduly disrupt the operations of the employer.' 
The employer gets to decide what is a `reasonable period' and what `unduly disrupt' means. The bill does not define those terms. The employer, not the employee, makes those judgments. In practice, for example, the employee cannot use comptime to go to the school play the next afternoon if the employer decides that the employee has not asked far enough in advance. Another example, if the employee plans to take a child to a dentist appointment during a school vacation, the employer can refuse to let the employee use the comptime for that purpose on the grounds that the absence would unduly disrupt the employer's business. 
Madam President, the bill also provides no penalty, no enforcement. Unless you provide a remedy, you are not giving a right. We have seen that time and time again. The bill provides no penalty at all if the employer violates this reasonable period/unduly disrupt standard--none. 
If the employer unreasonably denies the employee's request to use the comptime, the employee has no recourse. We will hear how in the legislation there is going to be a balance between the employer and the employee, and the terms will have been agreed upon before the parties. But, in reality, that is not the case. We will get back to that in the course of the debate. 
One of the problems in the bill is that it can be an oral agreement. The employer can say, `Look, we had an agreement, this employee wanted to have time off later on. Don't you remember our conversation around the water cooler? You don't remember it? I remember it.' And the employee has the burden of challenging that representation. 
Contrast this with the Family and Medical Leave Act. Under that law, if the employer denies the worker's request to take family leave, the worker can recover damages, including money spent on child care, compensatory damages and the like. The supporters of S. 4 say the unduly disrupt standard comes from the Family and Medical Leave Act. That is what they say. `Senator, you don't really understand, the unduly disrupt standard is the same language as the Family and Medical Leave Act.' 
This is not true, Madam President. The FMLA has two types of medical leave, unforeseen serious illness and foreseeable medical treatment. For the unforeseen illness, such as hepatitis, pneumonia, or the like, the employee has a right to take up to 12 
weeks of unpaid medical leave. Any disruption to the employer's operation is irrelevant. The employee makes the judgment. 
For foreseeable medical treatment, such as elective surgery or removal of wisdom teeth, the employee retains the right to take the medical leave, but the employee must make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment at a time that does not unduly disrupt the employer's operation. If the employee's reasonable efforts fail, the worker can still take the time for the surgery. The decision is made by the employee under the Family and Medical Leave Act. It has worked and worked well. I will come back to that when we have more of a chance to debate this. We will go through family and medical leave act and the evaluations of it demonstrating that there have not been abuses. However, under S. 4 just the opposite is done. The employer makes the final judgment on when the comptime can be used. 
The Ashcroft unduly disrupt language differs from the Family and Medical Leave Act standard in critical ways. First of all, the Ashcroft language gives no right to the employee to take comptime under any circumstances, even for unforeseen illness or other uncontrollable events. The employer can deny a worker's request to use the comptime if a child's babysitter calls in sick at the last moment, docking the employee's pay even if she has comptime in the bank. This does not help the working families. 
Second, the Ashcroft language deletes the requirement that workers make only a reasonable effort to schedule time off so it will not unduly disrupt an employer's operation. 
For example, a waitress makes a reasonable effort to schedule her child's immunization for the week after Christmas when the restaurant business is slow, but the doctor is on vacation that week. The waitress wants to use comptime to get the immunization the week after New Year's. The employer says no, citing that it will be unduly disruptive. The worker does not use comptime, and the child does not get immunized. This is not family friendly. This is an outrage. 
Let's talk about who these hourly workers are. They are the workers at the lower rung of the economic ladder. Sixty percent of them have only a high school education. Eighty percent of them make less than $28,000. A great percentage of them are single mothers with children who are depending on that overtime. Many of them are already having trouble making ends meet. They need every dollar they can earn to support their families. 
The extraordinary comment which a witness from the NFIB made at the February 13, 1997 Labor Committee hearing proves that the real goal of the business advocates of this bill is to reduce the pay of these vulnerable workers:  
[Small businesses] can't afford to pay their employees overtime. This is something they can offer in exchange that gives them a benefit. 
This statement is so harsh and blunt that even supporters of the bill have been embarrassed by it, and they are attempting to retract it. 
That says it all, Madam President. When you take away all of the rhetoric, that says it all. They do not want to pay hard-working Americans who are at the lower rung of the economic ladder overtime. That is what this bill is about--not giving the employee the opportunity to make the choice, but giving it to the employer. The employer has the whip hand under the provisions of S. 4. 
There is a dramatic difference between the flexible credit hour provisions applicable to Federal employees in title 5, United States Code, and in the flexible credit hour provisions of S. 4. 
The credit hours mean any hours within a flexible schedule which are in excess of the employee's basic workweek which the employee elects to work so as to vary the length of the workweek or workday. 
With Federal employees, who makes the judgment? Is it the employee and the employer? It is the employee who makes it with regard to the Federal employees. But, that is not the case with S. 4's credit hour program. Under this provision, the final say as to when an employee can take the time off rests with the employer. 
The heart of the section, page 13, lines 12 through 17, these lines provide: `An employee shall be compensated for flexible hours at the employee's regular rate.' That is, an employee that works 45 hours in a week can take 5 hours of flexible credit time at some point in the future. 
This, too, is a pay cut. Current law would require the worker to get paid time-and-a-half for those 5 hours. But this bill would compensate a worker at the straight-time rate for those hours. 
That is another section we will have an opportunity, Madam President, to get into in greater detail. 
But the idea that this is giving to the working moms the kind of flexibility to meet responsibilities is a hoax. 
What would do it is Senator Murray's amendment to the Family and Medical Leave Act to give up to 24 hours of leave per year to be used at the employee's discretion. This would allow employees to go to a teacher's conference, take their child to the dentist, or go to the Christmas play that their children are involved in. 
But Senator Murray's amendment was defeated on a party-line vote in the committee. `No way we're going to take that, Senator Murray. No way we're going to let them have 24 hours where the employee--the employee--is going to make the decision. No. We're not going to do that. No way.' We are talking about only 24 hours a year. But the Republicans say no. We are not going to do that. That is not acceptable. We will not include that provision in this bill. We are not going to do that for those workers. 
The Republicans are not even going to say to the employees of smaller businesses--those with 25 to 50 employees--that they too are entitled to the benefits of family and medical leave. This applies to 13 million Americans not currently covered by FMLA. They must continue to choose between the needs of their family and the demands of their employer. No, said the majority, we are not going to give the employees that kind of right. Senator Dodd's amendment would lower the threshold of the FMLA to apply to employers with at least 25 employees. But the Repubicans said, `No.' Let us really do something today that can make a difference for these workers as it already has for more than 12 million Americans, mothers and fathers that have used the leave because they had a sick child. 
Everyone in this body knows that if you have a parent or a loved one that cares for a child who is ill, that child recovers at about 40 to 50 percent faster than if the child is just isolated and trying to recover on his or her own. That is one of the principal reasons for family and medical leave--unpaid family medical leave. 
But when we tried with Senator Dodd to reduce the eligibility threshold, the Republicans said no way. And they said no to the Murray amendment for 24 hours to give the employee the opportunity to attend a school event. 
We have to ask ourselves, Madam President, at the beginning of this debate, whose side are we on? Whose side are we on? Who are we going to say is really protecting the interests and the rights of workers? Is it those people who have stood up time and time again on plant closing legislation to protect workers, minimum wage, family and medical leave? Or are we going to believe that business groups and organizations that have opposed every one of 
those programs for workers are suddenly undergoing a conversion and are sincerely interested in employee well-being? 
Madam President, we will have a chance at a later time to examine in detail the other provisions of this legislation. I would just hope as we celebrate this Mother's Day, we will tell the truth to America's working mothers. S. 4 is a cruel hoax. It will not provide you the time off you need when you need it. 
Finally, I would just ask, Madam President, who are the ones that are really benefiting from the overtime? About 80 percent of those that receive overtime pay are employees that are making less than $28,000 a year, and trying to take care of their families. Most of them want to work overtime so they can earn the extra pay to look after their kids. Let us not lose sight of that. 
Madam President, this is a pay cut bill. This is a pay cut bill. 
Last year, we had 147,000 decisions made by the NLRB about violations of even paying overtime. Over $100 million in back wages awarded by the Labor Department to workers in 1996. You can imagine if we pass S. 4, what do you think they are going to do? You have half the garment shops in this country today who are not paying the minimum wage and not paying overtime. Industries with records like that cannot be trusted with the kind of power this bill would give them. 
So, Madam President, I look forward to this debate, because I believe what we have seen in recent years is a growing disparity between the resources of those at the top level versus those struggling Americans who are the heart and soul of the country--the men and women that clean these buildings, clean the companies, are teachers' aides and are working in nursing homes and health assistance. They are barely able to make it with overtime. We cannot in good conscience take that overtime pay away from them. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last Friday's Wall Street Journal published the results of an April 1997 poll it conducted with NBC News. One of the questions in the survey deserves special attention. 
The poll asked whether the American people support increasing the cigarette taxes by 43 cents a pack, and returning much of the revenues to the States to provide health care for the Nation's uninsured children. An overwhelming 72 percent of the respondents favored this proposal, which is contained in the legislation that Senator Hatch and I have introduced last month. 
The detailed breakdown of the responses shows that the plan has broad support among people of all ages, incomes, ethnicities, educational backgrounds, party affiliations, and geographical regions. Support is at least 2 to 1 in all 36 groups, and it is 3 to 1 or even 4 to 1 in 17 of the groups. North, south, east, west--the American people support the Hatch-Kennedy bill.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from West Virginia for yielding the time. Once again I commend him for bringing his amendment to the floor of the Senate. And for the reasons that I will outline, I hope that his position will be overwhelmingly accepted. 
Mr. President, this automatic budget proposal is a Trojan Horse, and the Senate should reject it. It would freeze the level of last year's spending on any appropriations bill where Congress and the President failed to agree. By creating the certainty of a particular result in the event of a deadlock, it creates the certainty of a deadlock. There will always be those who favor a freeze. They obstruct the process. This provision guarantees that they will get their way. 
Mr. President, by creating the certainty of a particular result in the event of a deadlock, it creates the certainty of a deadlock. There will always be those who desire a freeze. If they obstruct the process, this provision guarantees they will get their way. They will have many opportunities to obstruct. 
Already, continuing resolutions are a regular part of the congressional procedure. A forthcoming article by Professor Meyers of the University of Maryland calculates that since 1974, when the Congressional Budget Act set the October 1 deadline for enacting appropriations, more than two-thirds of appropriation bills have been enacted after that date. With this automatic budget provision tilting the outcome, it will be a rare case, indeed, when it is not used by our Republican friends to achieve their ideological goals. 
Our Republican friends seek to sell this Trojan horse as a way to prevent shutting down the Government. We all know the real target. This proposal would simply guarantee cutting back on funds for education, for health, safety, and the environment. 
This year, a freeze at last year's level would be $27 billion below President Clinton's request for total discretionary spending for 1998. It would yield a devastating cut in education, in health, and safety. We all remember the long and difficult struggle and battle that was held here on the floor of the U.S. Senate in making sure that those priorities, which are the priorities of the American people, were going to be achieved. It was only in the final days of the consideration in the Congress that we were able to do so. 
It would cost $330 million from Head Start, depriving 35,000 children of the chance they would have to participate in Head Start under the President's plan. 
It would slash $1.7 billion from Pell grants, denying crucial aid to 350,000 needy college students. 
It would cut $300 million from the education for disadvantaged children, denying 483,000 children the extra help they need to survive in school. 
It would cut $5 million from programs like Meals on Wheels, resulting in $2.8 million fewer home-delivered meals for senior citizens. 
It would cut $23 million from the President's budget for occupational safety and health, resulting in thousands of fewer health and safety inspections. 
It would cut $300 million from the President's budget for the National Institutes of Health, slashing the number of new research grants and contracts, dramatically jeopardizing the research on cancer, AIDS, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, and many other diseases. 
These are unacceptable results. This is unacceptable budget policy. It is a GOP Government shutdown on the installment plan. 
If we give the obstructionists and do-nothings this raw power, they will have carte blanche to do it every year. The cuts will grow like compound interest. Five years of a freeze would lead to cuts of $165 billion. The 2002 level for appropriated spending would be 9 percent below the President's budget. 
If you take inflation into account, the cuts would total $287 billion below the levels needed to maintain current services. The 2002 level would be 16 percent below the level needed to maintain current services. 
Appropriated spending is now its smallest share of the economy since 1938--7 percent, roughly half of its high of 13.6 percent in 1968. We are reducing spending, and we are doing it the right way, not the right-wing way. 
Under the President's budget and the budget agreement, spending will already decline further in inflation-adjusted terms. From this already shrinking pie, Congress has to fund education, health research, and other needed investments to keep our economy strong and growing. 
This proposal is extreme. Make no mistake about it. The Nation cannot afford a robot procedure that robs future generations and weakens the economy. Congress should not put the budget on an automatic shrinking pilot. We can work together, Republicans and Democrats, we can write a better budget than this provision will allow--and still meet any reasonable goals for restraining spending. 
I urge all Senators to support the amendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if you look at the cuts, for example, in the area of education, and you take the cuts plus what is happening in terms of inflation in education alone, it would be a 16-percent reduction in the real purchasing power of education programs--in all education programs. Those are the student loan programs which are such a lifeline for children, young people that are looking forward to funding their education with the help and assistance of the Pell grants. It would cut back on the title I programs that reach out to children and help to provide programs to advance math, science, and literacy in schools across the country. It would cut back on the Head Start Programs which provide the early kind of intervention in terms of developing self-confidence and character building among the children in this country. These are programs with proven results, Mr. President. 
The reality is that it is generally this appropriation, the HEW or HHS appropriation, which is the last one that comes through here. It is amazing to me, Mr. President, that after we have an agreement on the President's budget, bipartisan agreement on the President's budget, that there are still those in the Senate that want to continue to support this proposal. We are supposed to have an agreement on the President's budget, but nonetheless they want to insist on this continuing proposal. So we have to look at why they might want to continue with this proposal. You have to reach the conclusion that, given their record in the areas of education, in the areas of health, in the areas of Head Start Programs, Meals on Wheels, fuel assistance program, substance abuse programs to help young people free themselves from addiction, you can reach no other conclusion than they want further cutbacks than agreed to under the President's budget, or why would they insist on it? 
Are we going to see the day when, sure, we have a budget deal, a tall sign, people are prepared to deal with it, and then we come back to the appropriations process, and it just so happens that appropriations in the areas of education, training programs, or other programs affecting our senior citizens like Meals on Wheels conform to what was agreed on, but there are perhaps a handful of Senators who say, `We will not consider that appropriations bill. We are not going to bring it up.' 
All right, if we do not, we are back to running on the agreement that was in this particular supplemental bill. What is that going to mean? It will mean a very small and tiny minority can effectively renege on what has been agreed to by Republicans. If that is not their position, then there will be an overwhelming majority that will support the Senator from West Virginia, an overwhelming majority. It is a pretty clear indication of what the real intentions of Members of this body are with regard to that particular agreement. 
I think for all of these reasons, Mr. President, whether the agreement that was made last week between Republicans is really a true agreement, or whether there will be those who say, OK, we agreed on that particular day, but we will wait until the ink dries on this particular agreement, and next year, the year after or the following year, we will go ahead and put, in effect, a freeze that will mean lower kinds of support for funding, education, and health programs--programs that are a lifeline for our senior citizens, our children, those that too often have been left out and left behind. We will see those programs further threatened. 
Mr. President, I commend the Senator from West 
Virginia. He really, I think, in many respects, has by far the most important amendment that is going to affect the quality of life of millions of our fellow citizens. We have seen dramatic reduction in what has been termed the `domestic investment programs for the future,' a term that has been agreed to by GAO and by CBO, and talks about education, a training infrastructure and domestic research and development. That percent, which is so essential in terms of our Nation's future, has gone down and is on the slippery, slidy slope of going down further, and we endanger it more so if we do not accept the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia. 
I commend him for offering this amendment. I thank him for bringing this amendment to the attention of all the Members. This really is, I think, the heart and soul of this whole proposal. 
I join with those that regret, as we are trying to deal with the problems of those fellow citizens in North and South Dakota, and other flood State victims across this country, that we are having to face this particular issue.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Murray's amendment to give the Department of Agriculture the authority to sell food stamps to States, with all Federal costs fully reimbursed. 
The so-called welfare reform law enacted last year disqualifies large numbers of legal immigrants from the Federal Food Stamp program. This imposes represents a serious new cost on the States, if they decide to meet the food needs of these immigrants on their own. Many States, including Massachusetts, are now actively exploring ways to provide food aid using State and local funds. This amendment allows States to provide food aid to legal immigrants by buying-in to the Federal Food Stamp Program. 
Allowing States to do so will avoid the need for them to needlessly duplicate the Federal Food Stamp Program with State and local funds. It will save the States time and money, while enabling them to continue giving food aid to needy legal immigrants.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, yesterday Senator D'Amato offered an amendment, which I cosponsored, to delay implementation of certain provisions in the new welfare law which affect legal immigrants. 
Last year, Congress passed a so-called welfare reform bill that drastically restricts the ability of legal immigrants to participate in public assistance programs. It prohibits them from receiving food stamps, SSI benefits, and Federal nonemergency Medicaid benefits. 
In recent months, we have seen the harsh impact of this bill on legal immigrant families. Many fear being turned out of nursing homes and cut off from disability payments beginning on August 1, 1997. In recent weeks, some needy immigrants have taken their own lives, rather than burden their families. 
Last week's negotiations on the fiscal year 1998 budget produced more hopeful prospects on this issue. But, needy immigrants will begin to lose their SSI benefits on August 1, 2 months before the fiscal year 1998 begins. We need to extend the August 1 deadline while we get our act together and work out a satisfactory compromise. 
Senator D'Amato's amendment extends the effective date for certain parts of the welfare law which affect legal immigrants until the end of the 1997 fiscal year. This extension is fair and reasonable. We need to ensure that no one loses SSI benefits while the budget process works its course.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last Friday, the President and the congressional leadership announced that they had reached an agreement to balance the budget. I support the goal of balancing the budget by 2002, and I commend the President's emphasis on improving education, expanding health coverage for uninsured children, and extending the solvency of the Medicare trust fund. 
But as the administration and the congressional leadership continue to negotiate the specific provisions of the agreement, and as more information about the agreement becomes available, a number of questions arise about the agreement. 
First, what is the distribution of the benefits in the tax package over the first 5 years? The new and expanded tax breaks in the agreement raise the most troubling questions in this regard. The only beneficiaries of the agreement's reductions in the estate tax are the top 1 percent of households. Three-quarters of the benefits of the capital gains provisions will go to households with incomes in excess of $100,000. According to one tax expert, as much as 40 percent of the benefits of the tax cuts will go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers. 
We know that the wealthy will receive large tax breaks under this agreement. It is fair to ask, how much, if any, of the major sacrifices under this budget are the wealthy being asked to share? Are the wealthy corporations being asked to give up any of the massive subsidies they receive under the current spending and tax laws? I urge the administration and the congressional leadership to make a detailed analysis of the proposed tax cuts available as soon as possible, so that Congress and the country can judge their fairness. 
Second, what is the distribution of benefits in the tax package in the second 5 years? Because the capital gains tax break initially generates revenues as wealthy investors sell their assets to take advantage of the lower tax rate, an accurate assessment of its cost and fairness must examine a longer period of time. 
According to an analysis of the Senate Republican leadership's tax proposals introduced this January conducted by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Republican capital gains tax cut cost $33 billion in the first 5 years, and then nearly tripled to $96 billion in the second 5 years. And their estate tax provisions, which cost $18 billion in the first 5 years, ballooned to $48 billion in the second 5 years. We must do all that we can to ensure that Congress does not repeat the mistake of the excessive 1981 tax cuts that led to the massive Reagan-Bush budget deficits. 
Third, what spending cuts will pay for these increased tax cuts in the second 5 years? If the cost of the tax cuts in years 6 through 10 far exceeds the cost in years 1 through 5, will Congress face the impossible choice of making severe and unacceptable reductions in social programs, or doing nothing and acquiescing in a new round of deficits as far as the eye can see? 
Fourth, what are the even longer-term costs of the tax breaks? By one estimate, the net cost of the tax breaks will reach $45 billion a year by the 10th year. Projecting those rates into the second 10 years--years 2008 through 2017--the cost of these tax breaks could exceed half a trillion dollars for that period. 
The great danger is that these pressures on the deficit will explode exactly at the same time that the country faces the severe budget pressures caused by the retirement of the baby boom generation. We already know that we face intense long-run problems with Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The last thing that we should do in the current budget agreement is to make those long-run problems worse. 
Fifth, can the country realistically accept the increasingly tight caps on domestic investments even in the first 5 years? President Clinton correctly resisted deeper cuts sought by Republicans. 
But the agreement slashes domestic investments by at least $60 billion below the level needed to maintain the current level of services. That is roughly a 10-percent cut in real terms. Discretionary spending has remained relatively flat since 1991, and is already at its lowest level as a share of the economy in 60 years. These dramatic cuts will mean less for vital investments in areas such as research and development funded by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation, less for crime prevention and police officers on the street, less for repair and upgrading of our Nation's highways and bridges, less for education, health and safety, and the environment. 
Can the country afford to continue to shortchange the key public investments needed to keep our economy strong into the next century? It is only through investment that the Nation can sustain needed economic growth. Using the definition of public investment accepted by the General Accounting Office--including education and training, public infrastructure, and civilian research and development--public investment accounted for 2.5 percent of the economy under President Reagan. Today, it has fallen to 1.7 percent of the economy. How much lower is Congress prepared to see it go? 
Sixth, what is the distribution of domestic discretionary spending cuts under this agreement? After protecting high-priority spending items, the agreement will force deeper cuts in the unprotected areas. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities found that 34 percent of the cuts in nondefense discretionary spending in the last Congress came from programs for those with the lowest incomes, such as programs for fuel oil assistance, child care, senior nutrition and meals for senior shut-ins, vaccinations for children, school lunches, drug abuse prevention, and Head Start. Programs for low-income Americans have already borne a disproportionate burden of deficit reduction. They should not have to bear an unfair burden under this agreement. 
Seventh, will defense spending be able to live within this agreement? The Secretary of Defense is conducting a quadrennial defense review of strategy, force structure, and modernization needs. Is the spending anticipated in this agreement sufficient to meet the commitments that the Department feels are essential? If the defense spending levels in the agreement are not adequate to meet future security needs, how can we ensure that defense increases are offset by reductions in the tax breaks, and not by further reductions in needed domestic investments? 
Before we adopt this agreement as a budget resolution, we must do our best to obtain serious answers to these serious questions. Fairness is a fundamental issue. It will be fundamentally unfair if a handful of super-wealthy Americans benefit lavishly from this agreement, while millions of average Americans and their families take it on the chin. A fairly balanced budget is achievable. But a budget that fails to balance the Nation's basic needs will not be worth the paper on which it is printed.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Republican leadership is pushing its so-called compensatory time bill, but a better name for it is the Paycheck Reduction Act. The bill has four fatal flaws: 
First, it is a pay cut for large numbers of workers who don't deserve that harsh treatment from either Congress or their employers. The bill eliminates the guarantee of pay for overtime work for 65 million employees. The Republicans have openly admitted their pay-cut strategy. When the National Federation of Independent Businesses testified at the Senate Labor Committee hearing on the bill, they said `Small businesses can't afford to pay overtime.' That's why they support this legislation. 
Vast numbers of today's workers depend on overtime pay to make ends meet. Half of those who earn overtime take home $16,000 a year or less. More than 80 percent earn under $28,000 a year. American workers cannot afford this Republican pay cut. 
Second, the bill cuts other benefits. Health and retirement benefits are based on the number of hours worked by employees, and their benefits would be slashed too. Comptime hours do not count as hours worked, so employees will lost health coverage while they are working, and much-needed pension benefits after they retire. 
Third, the proposal abolishes the 40-hour week. Employers could require employees to work up to 80 hours in a week without receiving overtime pay. A company could schedule a worker for 60 hours in 1 week, and 20 in the next, all without a penny of overtime pay. This isn't a family-friendly bill--it's a family-enemy bill. 
Fourth, the bill provides no employee choice. The employer chooses who works overtime and when an employee can use comptime. The employer can assign all overtime work to employees who will accept comptime instead of overtime pay. Those who need overtime pay to make ends meet will no longer receive it. The bill also lets the employer decide when employees can use the comptime they have earned. If an employee wants to use comptime to take a child to the dentist, or attend a school play, the employer is free to deny the request. 
If the Republicans are genuinely interested in helping working Americans deal with family needs, they should support expansion of the Family and Medical Leave Act. That law has been a resounding success since its enactment in 1993. It gives employees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave a year to care for a newborn or newly-adopted child, or to deal with a serious medical condition of the employee or close relative. 
Two proposals to expand the act are now under consideration in Congress. Senator Dodd proposes to apply the law to all firms with 25 or more employees, instead of 50 or more employees under current law. This step would enable 15 million more workers to receive this important benefit. Senator Murray proposes to offer 24 hours of leave a year for employees to attend parent-teacher conferences and other school events. 
Those who support genuine family-friendly policies know that the Family and Medical Leave Act works well for working families. I urge my colleagues to support its expansion and to reject the Republican comptime Trojan horse. 
I know there is significant interest in the idea of legislation that would allow an employee to make a genuinely voluntary choice to be compensated for overtime work in time off rather than in pay. But, this is not that bill. Even those of you who support the concept of voluntary comptime should oppose S. 4. S. 4 contains four major provisions, each of which is designed not to help employees, but to allow employers to reduce the amount of money they must pay their workers. 
This bill isn't meant to help employees juggle their work and family obligations. Instead, it is designed to help employers cut workers' wages. Forcing employees to accept time off instead of overtime pay is a cut. 
While the legislation purports to let employees make the choice between overtime pay and comptime, it does not contain the protections which are necessary to ensure that employees are free to choose and are free from reprisal. 
Under S. 4, it is the employer, not the employee, who decides what forms of comptime and flextime will be available at the workplace. There is no freedom of choice for the worker. 
There is nothing in this bill which prevents an employer from discriminating against a worker who refuses to take comptime instead of overtime pay. Under S. 4, an employer could lawfully deny all overtime work to those employees who want to be paid and give overtime exclusively to workers who will accept comptime in lieu of pay. There is no freedom of choice for the worker. 
The employee may want a particular day off so that she can accompany her child to a special school event or to a medical examination at the pediatrician. However, nothing in this legislation requires the employer to give the employee the day she requests. This bill gives the employer virtually unreviewable discretion to determine when a worker can use her accrued comptime. Here, too, there is no freedom of choice for the worker.

Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 7 minutes at this time. 
Mr. President, first of all, I want to extend our appreciation to the majority and minority leaders for working out this agreement where within the hour the Senate will go on record by an overwhelming vote in behalf of an outstanding nominee for Secretary of Labor. I am grateful to them for working out this agreement. 
I thank especially the chairman of our committee, Senator Jeffords, for the way that he has handled this nomination. Nominations come and nominations go. But the fairness and thoroughness with which he handled this nominee I think reflects extremely well, not only on our committee but on the institution as a whole. It was exhaustive. It was extensive. It was probing. It was searching, as any review should be. And at the end of the day we were able to see the result of this very thorough review in the unanimous vote by the committee. That is the way that it should be done. 
All of us in this body, and I think all Americans, will be grateful for the fact that we will have a Secretary of Labor who will be at the President's elbow and will speak for working men and women in this country. But at this time, all of us in the Senate should know the outstanding job that she has done. 
Mr. President, I am delighted that we have freed ourselves from the position that was taken by some Members here on the floor who differed with the President's authority to issue an executive order encouraging the use of project labor agreements on Federal construction sites. 
I think, if we look back over the history of project labor agreements, we would see that they have been effective, they have worked, and they have saved resources. These are voluntary agreements. The Supreme Court has upheld their use on public sector construction sites. Clearly the President is justified in urging the use of those kinds of agreements when they are appropriate. 
This morning in the Labor Committee, we heard the outstanding testimony of John Dunlop, who is the former Secretary of Labor, under a Republican administration, who, as the architect of many project labor agreements, reviewed in some detail just how they work, how they function, and the reasons for them. He made a very powerful and convincing case for project labor agreements. But now we have worked out a satisfactory way in which the President will issue a memorandum on that issue which will encourage these project labor agreements to go forward where they are appropriate. And now we are moving ahead with the nominee. 
So I would also like to commend Senator Jeffords for outlining the challenges that are going to be there for the Secretary. When I arrived in the Senate, men and women were working down at the Fall River Shipyard, building ships in Quincy, MA. They worked there with a high school diploma. They had a good job, and a good income. Their father generally had worked at the Fall River Shipyard, and even their grandfathers worked there and built some of the best ships we had in World War II, and many outstanding commercial ships as well. It is an entirely different labor market today. Everyone who enters it will have seven different jobs over the period of their lifetime at least. 
The importance of having a well-trained and skilled work force is an enormous challenge for our country. We are looking forward to working with the members of our committee to try to play our role in making sure that we are going to see that those kinds of 
opportunities are going to be available to workers in the future. 
I would like to take, Mr. President, the remaining moments here today just to speak about this really extraordinary nominee. 
I see my colleague and friend, the good Senator from Illinois, has joined us, who has been such a strong supporter of the nominee, and will speak. My friend, Senator Wellstone, will speak as well. 
If we are looking at a success story, we are looking at the life of Alexis Herman. If we are looking for personal resolution, determination, and personal moral courage and physical courage, we are looking at the history of Alexis Herman who, with her mother--who taught her to read at a very early age, in Mobile, AL--traveled as her mother was involved in one of the early literacy programs. She attended a Catholic school in Mobile, AL, that was segregated, and brought the truth to power when she challenged that school to integrate. The school resisted those entreaties. And, finally, a year later they admitted blacks into that school as a result of the determination and perserverance of this extraordinary young woman. She traveled and worked to try to bring African-American women into the work force in many of the institutions and companies of this country with great, great success. 
Her life has been one of service. She has been an outstanding assistant to the President of the United States with outreach programs, trying to work to make sure that the message that was going to be coming from the White House was going to be an all-inclusive message, and one that was going to move the country along together and not at the expense of any individuals or any groups. 
She served with great distinction under Ray Marshall, who was Secretary of Labor under President Carter. And Ray Marshall is one of the country's most thoughtful leaders on all of the issues affecting the training of workers and upgrading their skills. And his support--his clear, eloquent comments about the work that Alexis Herman did when she worked with Ray Marshall constitute one of the most outstanding tributes that I have ever heard about any worker in any Cabinet position. 
So the President of the United States has nominated her to be the Secretary of Labor. We will, I think, have an extraordinary person, one who can bring innovation and creativity, one who can reach out to working families; one who has special insights into the challenges that are out there for workers in a changing world. 
Alexis Herman exemplifies many of our most important national values. She leads by example, and has a distinguished history of bringing others along. She grew up poor in the segregated South, and she succeeded through talent, energy, and commitment. She has had a lifelong commitment to the principle of helping others to help themselves. 
As I mentioned, her mother, who once was Alabama's Teacher of the Year, brought Alexis with her as she taught reading to children and adults. Alexis' first summer job was teaching reading at an inner-city housing project. 
After graduating from Xavier University in New Orleans, she returned to Mobile as a social worker. She counseled delinquent youths, helped place children in foster homes, and worked to assist families in dealing with issues such as teenage pregnancy. 
She saw that lack of skills and opportunities were keeping many of Mobile's black citizens from achieving their full potential. 
Alexis then spent several years running a pilot program in Atlanta to place African-American women in white collar positions. Included in the hundreds of letters the committee received in support of Ms. Herman's nomination were a number of letters from African-American female executives who credited Alexis with starting them on their careers. One woman who is now a vice president at the American Cancer Society wrote that she recalled that Alexis `advised the wisdom of getting my foot in the door first and foremost. From there, she said the rest would be up to me.' 
Another letter noted that the pilot project Alexis ran placed 
more African-American women in management positions in Atlanta during its first year in operation than the U.S. Employment Service had placed in its entire history in the city. 
As I mentioned, in 1977, when Ray Marshall became Secretary of Labor in President Carter's administration, he asked her to become head of the Department's Women's Bureau--the youngest Director ever. She worked on expanding opportunities for women in skilled trades, helped displaced homemakers obtain the tools necessary to succeed in the workplace, and co-chaired a Presidential task force to promote business ownership by women. 
When President Clinton took office in 1993, he named Alexis Herman to a senior White House position as Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of Public Liaison. In this capacity, she identified the concerns of individuals and families across the country on the issues, and communicated the President's priorities to them. 
In the many weeks since her nomination to be Secretary of Labor was announced last December, attempts have been made to generate controversy about various aspects of her career. However, Ms. Herman has responded to all the inquiries fully and completely. She received the unanimous support of the Labor Committee, and I anticipate that she will receive broad bipartisan support by the full Senate. 
All her life, as a young student, as a career woman, as a community leader and in public service, Alexis Herman has advanced America's ideals. Hard work, dedication to excellence and commitment to leadership are the hallmarks of her character. Her entire career is a profile in courage. 
She knows from her own life and firsthand experience the very real obstacles that too many Americans still face in trying to achieve the American dream. Most important, she is dedicated to the cause of improving the lives of all working families. She'll do an outstanding job as Secretary of Labor, and I look forward to working closely with her in the years ahead. 
Mr. President, how much time do I have?

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am delighted that this unconscionable delay has ended and Alexis Herman has, at long last, been confirmed as Secretary of Labor. It was a mistake for the Republican leadership to hold her nomination hostage on a separate labor issue. 
The compromise on that issue is entirely satisfactory. President Clinton gave up nothing substantial. Project labor agreements will be considered and given important new emphasis by all Federal agencies on appropriate Federal construction projects. 
I look forward to working closely with Secretary Herman on the wide range of issues important to working families and communities across America. 
The big winners today are these working families. Alexis Herman will do an excellent job speaking for them.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to introduce President Clinton's America Reads Challenge Act. Today is the closing day of the President's summit for America's future. The summit's organizers and participants have sent a clear call about the importance of volunteerism and community involvement. The America Reads Challenge Act responds to that call and will provide volunteer tutors to help all children read well by the end of the third grade. 
Reading is a fundamental skill for learning, but too many children have trouble learning how to read. If students don't learn to read in the early elementary school years, it is virtually impossible for them to keep up later. According to one study, 40 percent of fourth grade students don't attain the basic level of reading, and 70 percent don't attain the proficient level. 
Research shows that reading skills are developed not only in the home and in the classroom, but also in communities and libraries. Sustained, quality reading experiences outside the regular school day and during the summer can raise reading levels when combined with high quality instruction. Only 30 minutes a day of reading aloud with an adult can enable a child to make real gains in reading. Adults also serve as role models for young children. 
The America Reads Challenge Act is intended to help all students learn to read--and read well--by the end of the third grade. It would provide Parents as First Teachers challenge grants. Recognizing that parents are the best first teachers, it supports programs and activities that help parents increase the reading skills of their children. 
In addition, the act will provide America's Reading Corps grants to States and communities to help them establish or enhance literacy tutor programs. Some 25,000 reading specialists and tutor coordinators, including 11,000 AmeriCorps members, will participate in programs to mobilize 1 million volunteers to tutor 3 million children. 
The America Reads Challenge Act will provide $1.7 billion over the next 5 years to the Department of Education. It will also authorize the appropriation of $200 million a year from fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2002 to the Corporation for National Service. The act also builds on efforts of pre-school and elementary school programs, such as Head Start and title I, to help improve children's basic skills. 
I strongly support President Clinton's America Reads Challenge Act, and I hope it will receive the broad bipartisan support it deserves. Every child can learn to read, and every child deserves a chance to learn how to do it. No child should be left out or left behind.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I continue to be concerned about the failure of the Senate to act on the nomination of Alexis Herman to be the Secretary of Labor. President Clinton announced his intention to nominate Ms. Herman on December 20 last year, over 4 months ago. Her papers were officially received by the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources in early January. 
During the Labor Committee's review of the nomination, Ms. Herman answered over 150 written questions from committee members. She dealt thoroughly with all the questions put to her at a lengthy Labor Committee hearing on March 18. The committee voted unanimously to confirm Ms. Herman on April 10. Senate confirmation was expected soon after that. 
Instead, Ms. Herman's nomination has become a hostage in an exercise of political extortion that discredits the Senate. Those who are holding this nomination hostage admit that they are postponing a vote on Ms. Herman for reasons that have nothing to do with her qualifications for office. They object to President Clinton's intention to issue an Executive order on labor issues which they oppose. The proposed Executive order would direct Federal agencies to consider the use of so-called project labor agreements [PLA's] on Federal construction projects. 
Such agreements have been used on large-scale construction projects, in the public and private sectors, for decades. Examples of Federal projects carried out under PLA's include the Grand Coulee Dam in the 1930's; atomic energy plants in the 1940's; Cape Kennedy in the 1960's; and today, the Boston Harbor cleanup project. 
In the private sector, too, PLA's have been used on many projects across the Nation, including the construction of Disney World in Florida, the Toyota plant in Georgetown, KY, the trans-Alaska pipeline in Alaska, and the Saturn auto plant in Tennessee. 
State governments use PLA's as well. Governor Pataki of New York issued an Executive order similar to President Clinton's proposal in January 1997. The Governors of Nevada and New Jersey recently issued similar orders. 
What PLA's do is require contractors to comply with the terms of labor agreements for the duration of the project. The advantages of PLA's are numerous. Projects are more likely to be completed on time, because a skilled labor supply is always available. There are fewer cost overruns, because workplace disputes can be quickly resolved through grievance and arbitration procedures, instead of by strikes or lockouts. 
Projects built under PLA's have lower accident rates, because contractors can hire highly skilled and well-trained employees. Productivity increases as well, because of the higher skills of workers. 
Opponents of PLA's claim that such agreements unfairly deny contracts and jobs to nonunion firms and individuals. That charge is false. 
Nonunion contractors can and do bid on jobs where PLA's are in effect. In the Boston Harbor project, 40 percent of the subcontractors--over 100 firms--are nonunion. Similarly, on the Idaho National Engineering Labs PLA, with the Department of Energy, 30 percent of the subcontractors were nonunion. 
Nonunion workers can and do work on sites where PLA's are in place. Unions are required by law to refer nonmembers to jobs on the same basis as union members. 
The NLRB vigorously enforces this provision of the labor laws. Unions know how to comply, and do comply. In the 21 so-called right-to-work States, no worker can be required to give financial support to a union. In the other 29 States, if the particular contract provides it, workers can be required to pay a fee to the union while workers are employed at the job site. However, no employee can be forced to join the union, or to pay for union activities that are not related to collective bargaining. 
In all of these ways, PLA's are beneficial to project owners and workers alike. 
Further, it is clear that President Clinton has the authority to issue an Executive order dealing with Federal procurement practices. President Bush did just that in October 1992, when he issued an Executive order prohibiting Federal agencies from requiring PLA's on Federal construction projects. Republican attacks on President Clinton's power to issue an order directing the consideration of such agreements are hypocritical at best. 
President Clinton won the 1996 election. He is entitled to use his Presidential powers as he sees fit. It is unconscionable that Republican leaders in the Senate are holding Alexis Herman hostage to their antiworker bias. President Clinton has every right to issue his Executive order on Federal construction projects. The Herman nomination has nothing to do with that issue. Republicans should end this shameful tactic and let the Senate vote. 
The Senate cannot faithfully discharge its constitutional responsibility to conform nominees if the process grinds to a halt for reasons that are obviously extraneous. The time has come to end this unjustified delay. It is long past time for the Senate to vote on Alexis Herman's nomination. 
When a vote is taken, I am confident that Alexis Herman will be confirmed by the Senate and she will serve with distinction as our Labor Secretary. Ms. Herman's entire life has been dedicated to building coalitions and bringing people together, regardless of differences in race, class, or gender. She comes from a family of trail-blazers, and her own life, too, has been an extraordinary and inspirational story of commitment and achievement. 
From childhood, her parents taught her the importance of helping others. Her mother, who once was Alabama's Teacher of the Year, brought Alexis with her as she taught reading to children and adults. Alexis' first summer job was teaching reading at an inner-city housing project. 
Alexis also learned at home about the importance of standing up for your rights and participating in the political process. When she was only 5, her father faced down some members of the Ku Klux Klan who stopped the family car on Christmas Eve. In the 1940's, her father sued for the right to obtain an absentee ballot to vote in Mobile. Later, he was elected a Wardman of Mobile's 10th Ward, one of the first African-Americans elected in Alabama since Reconstruction. 
In the early 1960's, her hometown of Mobile was still segregated. As a high school sophomore, unable to reconcile her Catholic faith with the segregation in the parochial schools, she confronted the Bishop of Mobile. His response was to suspend her from school. Undaunted, she continued to press for change. The following year, the first African-Americans were admitted to the white Catholic schools in Mobile. 
After graduating from Xavier University, in New Orleans, she returned to Mobile as a social worker. She counseled delinquent youths, helped place children in foster homes, and worked to assist families in dealing with issues such as teenage pregnancy. 
She saw that lack of skills and opportunities were keeping many of Mobile's black citizens from achieving their full potential. Working with the AFL-CIO and Catholic Social Services, she undertook a project to find work for unemployed, unskilled young men in Mobile's housing projects. 
In the 1970's, with Professor Ray Marshall of the University of Texas, she began a pilot project in Atlanta to place African-American women in white collar positions. With grants from the Ford Foundation and the Department of Labor, she established and managed this highly successful program. As a result of her leadership, the first African-American women were hired in white collar jobs at Coca Cola and Delta Airlines. The pilot project was so successful that it was extended to 10 cities. 
Alexis Herman then added public service to her many achievements in the community and private enterprise. In 1977, when Ray Marshall became Secretary of Labor under President Carter, he asked her to become head of the Department's Women's Bureau--the youngest Director ever. She worked hard and well on expanding employment and training opportunities for women, and co-chaired a Presidential task force to promote business ownership by women. 
After returning to the private sector, she worked as a consultant for businesses seeking to hire, train, and keep minority employees. Once again, she demonstrated her life-long determination to extend opportunities to those who had long been denied jobs, careers, and, most important, hope. 
When President Clinton took office in 1993, he named Alexis Herman to a senior White House position as Assistant to the President and Director of the Office of Public Liaison. In this capacity, she identified the concerns of individuals and families across the country on the issues, and communicated the President's priorities to them. Few would deny that over the past 4 years, she fulfilled these difficult and important responsibilities with remarkable skill and success. 
All her life, as a young student, as a career woman, as a community leader and in public service, Alexis Herman has shown an extraordinary gift for bringing people together in a cooperative spirit. That skill will serve her well as Secretary of Labor. 
Alexis knows from her own life and first-hand experience the very real obstacles that too many Americans still face in trying to achieve the American dream. Most important, she is dedicated to the cause of improving the lives of all working families. I'm confident she'll do an outstanding job as Secretary of Labor. I urge the Senate to act quickly to approve her nomination, and I look forward to working closely with her in the years ahead.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in the short weeks since negotiations to settle litigation against the tobacco industry began on April 3, 28,000 more Americans have died from smoke-related illnesses and 69,000 children in the United States began smoking. One in three of these children will eventually die prematurely because of their tobacco addiction. That is the magnitude of the harm that cigarettes have caused in just 22 days. 
The well-documented history of deceit and misrepresentation by the tobacco companies should make any Member of Congress extremely skeptical about the industry's good faith in these negotiations. No industry in America has a worse reputation than tobacco, and no industry in America has done more to earn such a highly negative image. 
The tobacco industry has knowingly peddled an extraordinarily addictive drug to the American public for decades. It has targeted children with massive advertising and marketing schemes designed to hook them on smoking. It has concealed the harmful ingredients in their products. And it has repeatedly lied about its activities to Congress and the Nation. 
Just last week, we learned from one of the Liggett documents that the major tobacco companies knew as early as 1958--1958--that smoking caused lung cancer. Given this record of deceit and manipulation, our current skepticism of the industry is clearly warranted. 
Research by the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University has revealed that the harm the cigarette companies have done has extended even beyond the extraordinary death and destruction their product creates directly. Cigarettes are a very significant gateway drug leading to cocaine and heroin addiction. Children who smoke are 12 times more likely to use heroin. Children who smoke are 19 times more likely to use cocaine. Even worse, the younger the children are when they begin smoking, the more likely they are to move on to illegal drugs. 
It is not because their executives are suddenly experiencing pangs of conscience over their past behavior that the tobacco companies have initiated these settlement negotiations. The real reason is obvious. Big Tobacco desperately needs a strategy to avoid huge judgments for smoking victims in pending court cases, to evade massive public disclosure in those cases of the industry's scandalous behavior, and to prevent effective new Government regulation of the industry. 
The industry sees that the tide is finally turning against tobacco. The combined efforts of the Food and Drug Administration, State attorneys general, public interest litigators, and public health advocates have had a dramatic impact. The Liggett settlement has already exposed some of the industry's darkest secrets to public scrutiny. Each new public survey shows an overwhelming majority of Americans view the industry as evil. 
At long last, courts are about to hold tobacco companies financially accountable for decades of injury to individual smokers and the public treasury. We have crossed the Rubicon in the war against tobacco. And the industry knows it. That is why Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco have come to the table seeking a cease-fire. They want to purchase peace at the lowest possible price, with the smallest possible change in their malignant behavior. 
That does not mean we should be unwilling to talk. It does mean we should not loosen our grip on the regulatory and litigation steps which have brought the tobacco industry to the negotiation table. We should hold firm to our demands both for fundamental change in the way the tobacco industry operates and for financial compensation from the industry in a magnitude commensurate with the harm its misconduct has caused. 
The tobacco industry strategy is now to entice its adversaries into negotiations by making a series of quick concessions--especially their acquiescence in public health regulation. What is striking about their concessions is that most of them are within the power of the Federal Government to impose tomorrow. We do not need industry consent to implement most of these public health protections. All Congress needs is the will to act. What the industry is offering to do is merely call off its lobbyists. 
According to those participating in the negotiations, the tobacco industry will agree to abide by the current FDA rule, and will agree in principle to significant further restrictions on their marketing practices. As part of a settlement, the industry has said it is ready to accept the following things: 
First, much stronger warnings about the addictiveness and health dangers of smoking on each pack of cigarettes; 
Second, full disclosure of cigarette ingredients; 
Third, elimination of vending machines sales; 
Fourth, additional restrictions on the advertising it can engage in; and 
Fifth, expanded FDA jurisdiction over tobacco. 
In essence, after years of opposition, the industry has conceded that all of these restrictions are reasonable. These concessions will stand on the public record regardless of the outcome of the talks. The industry cannot credibly return to its former position. It is within Congress' power to enact each of these reforms now--and we should do so. Congress does not need the tobacco industry's consent before we legislate to protect the public health. 
What the tobacco industry has not agreed to--and what is essential to the public health--is full authority for the FDA to regulate nicotine as an addictive drug. Such authority would give the FDA the power to order cigarette manufacturers to reduce the level of nicotine in their products. 
The evidence strongly suggests that tobacco companies have been deliberately manipulating and strengthening the level of nicotine to make cigarettes more addictive. It is time to reverse the process and reduce nicotine levels. This too is within Congress' power to enact today. 
For a generation, the tobacco industry has been remarkably successful in evading such restrictions. No current settlement can anticipate every marketing trick the industry will use in the future. 
Therefore, Congress should accept no restriction on the authority of the FDA or State government agencies to impose additional restrictions on the industry as warranted by future events. 
If the tobacco industry is sincere in its promise not to target children, it should agree to a results test. Substantial financial penalties should be imposed on the industry each year that tobacco use by minors does not decline by a specific percentage. Industry dollars should be used to fund a national education campaign to publicize the addictiveness of tobacco and the health risks of smoking. 
The financial settlement reportedly offered by the tobacco industry--$300 billion over 25 years--sounds enormous at first blush. People hear the $300 billion and don't register the 25 years. They are offering $12 billion a year. That number pales in comparison to the harm the industry causes. According to the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, cigarettes cost the United States $68 billion a year in health care costs and lost productivity. 
Some 419,000 Americans die each year due to smoking-related illnesses. Smokers lose an average of 15 years of their life. At current smoking rates, 10.5 million people will die prematurely due to tobacco during those years. Collectively, they will have lost 157 million years of life. Suddenly the industry's settlement offer does not sound large anymore. 
If a financial settlement to compensate for past injuries is ever agreed to, payment should be made from the tobacco companies' profits, including the profits from their nontobacco subsidiaries. That would be the source of payment for any court judgment. It should similarly be the source of payment for any settlement. Compensation should come from the pockets of the wrongdoers. 
Any increase in the tax on tobacco products--and I believe there should be a substantial one--should be used to fund needed initiatives to improve the Nation's health. No settlement proposal should seek to limit or cap, either directly or indirectly, Congress' authority to enact future tobacco tax increases. The cost of treating smoking-related diseases and the cost of lost productivity caused by those illnesses amount to $2.59 for each pack of cigarettes sold in the United States. We have a long way to go to recover those costs. 
Such a tobacco tax increase should be large enough to discourage children from starting smoking. Higher tobacco taxes are one of the most effective weapons in reducing smoking amongst young people. 
For generations, tobacco companies have targeted teenagers for a lifetime of addiction. It is especially appropriate therefore that revenue from a tobacco tax increase should be used to provide affordable health insurance coverage for the Nation's 10 million uninsured children. Senator Hatch and I have proposed a plan to do that, and we intend to do all we can to see that this Congress enacts it. 
We also hear that the industry wants blanket immunity from suit for its decades of willful wrongdoing as the price of a settlement. If that is the price, there will be no settlement. It would be unconscionable to deny people poisoned by tobacco their day in court. Each year, millions of Americans learn that they have diseases caused by smoking. In too many cases, it is beyond our power to restore their health. We must never permit the tobacco industry to extinguish their right to justice as well. 
The industry's current settlement proposals are utterly inadequate. Whether measured by the scope of regulation to protect the public health or the amount of financial compensation for past wrongs, tobacco company proposals fall far short of a reasonable offer. I am confident that those representing the public interest will never accept such a lopsided settlement. Certainly, no one should think for even a moment that Congress will put its stamp of approval on such an outrageously inadequate plan.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this treaty, and I strongly urge the Senate to ratify it. 
In a sense, this debate is as old as America. Two centuries ago, with our independence newly won, the Founding Fathers urged us to beware of `entangling foreign alliances.' They wrote into the Constitution a requirement that any treaty with foreign nations must be confirmed by a two-thirds vote of the Senate. 
By any rational standard, this treaty meets that test. 
Nevertheless, the treaty is being opposed by an entrenched band of foreign policy ideologues and isolationists who think the United Nations is the enemy and who say the arms race should be escalated, not restricted. History proved their ilk wrong once before, when they sank the League of Nations in the 1920's. And it will prove them wrong again with far more drastic consequences than World War II, if they prevail today. 
We cannot let that happen. The Senate should reject the remaining killer amendments, and give this treaty the two-thirds vote it needs and deserves. 
The 29-year-old pursuit of a chemical weapons treaty has finally reached its moment of truth in the U.S. Senate. Few votes cast in this Congress or any Congress are likely to be more important. 
The effort to achieve this treaty was launched in 1968, and its history is genuinely bipartisan. It has moved forward under Republican and Democratic Presidents alike. In 1968, the final year of the Johnson administration, international negotiations began in Geneva to build on the 1925 Geneva Protocol and try to reduce the production of chemical weapons. 
In the 1970's, President Gerald Ford had the vision to take that initiative a major step forward during intense international negotiations. 
President Ronald Reagan advanced it to the next stage with his efforts on arms control in the 1980's. And President Bush deserves high praise for embracing the ideal of eliminating chemical weapons, for making it a serious worldwide effort, and at long last bringing it to the stage where it was ready to be signed. In one of his last acts in office, George Bush signed the treaty, on January 13, 1993. 
President Clinton formally submitted the Chemical Weapons Convention to the Senate for its advice and consent later that year. Now, it's our turn. Today, the Senate can and should join in this historic endeavor to rid the world of chemical weapons. We can bestow a precious gift on generations to come by freeing the world of an entire class of weapons of mass destruction. 
The chemical weapons treaty bans the development, production, stockpiling, and use of toxic chemicals as weapons. Previous agreements have merely limited weapons of mass destruction. But the Chemical Weapons Convention sets out to eliminate them from the face of the earth. 
The United States has already taken many steps unilaterally to implement a ban of our own. As long ago as 1968, this country ordered a moratorium on chemical weapons production. 
When President Bush signed the treaty on behalf of the United States, he also ordered the unilateral destruction of the U.S. stockpile of these weapons. Regardless of the treaty, the United States is destroying its chemical weapon stockpile. 
Today culminates many years of work and compromise. The Senate has held 17 hearings on the convention. Every issue has been exhaustively analyzed. The result is the shoot-out that the leadership has arranged today on this series of killer amendments. 
Bipartisan negotiations have achieved agreement on 28 amendments to the treaty, none of which go to the heart of the treaty and many of which help to clarify it. 
But five major issues have not yet been settled. The five amendments, on which we are voting today, seek to settle differences of opinion the wrong way. They are killer amendments. I hope the Senate will note `no' on all of them. If any of them passes, it will doom our participation in the treaty, and relegate us to the company of outlaw regimes like North Korea and Libya, who also reject the treaty. 
Two of the killer amendments condition our participation on whether other nations--Russia, Iran, Iraq, Syria, and China--have already become participants. Essentially, they would hand over U.S. security decisions to those nations. 
A third killer amendment arbitrarily excludes all representatives from certain other countries from participating in verification inspections. This amendment ignores the ability that the treaty already gives us to reject any inspectors we believe are not trustworthy. 
A fourth killer amendment omits and alters other key parts of the treaty that deal with the export of certain materials. Its proponents fear that rogue nations may gain valuable technology from us. 
Nothing in the convention requires the United States to weaken its export controls. Experts in the chemical industry, trade organizations, and government officials have worked to ensure that nothing in the treaty threatens our technology and industrial power. 
The fifth killer amendment places an unrealistically high standard of verification on the treaty. It requires the treaty verification procedures to accomplish the impossible, by being able to detect small, not militarily significant, amounts of dangerous chemical meterials. 
No international agreement can effectively police small amounts of raw materials that might possibly be used in chemical weapons production. Every effort is being made and will be made to make the detection procedures as effective as possible. It is hypocritical for opponents to attempt to scuttle this treaty because they feel it does not go far enough. 
The overwhelming majority of past and present foreign policy officials, military leaders, large and small businesses, Fortune 500 companies, Nobel laureates, veterans organizations, religious groups, environmentalists and public interest groups are united in their strong support of the convention. It is a practical international agreement with practical benefits for the United States, and the United States should be a part of it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today marks the 82nd anniversary of the beginning of one of the most tragic episodes in human history. Beginning in 1915, the Government of the Ottoman Turks waged a vicious campaign of genocide against the people of Armenia. One and a half million Armenians were killed in the following eight years. Over 500,000 more Armenians were forced into exile from their homeland and compelled to seek havens in other lands. 
The extraordinary resiliency of the Armenian people can be seen by what they have accomplished in their new lands. Nations around the world have benefited from the spirit and perseverance of the Armenians. No nation has benefited more from the contributions of the Armenian Diaspora than the United States. My own state of Massachusetts is blessed with a large and vigorous community of Armenians who have played an important role in all aspects of public and private life in our state. 
I commend the tireless efforts of the Armenian Assembly of America and the Armenian National Committee for their outstanding work in informing Americans about the history and culture of Armenia and its people. In honoring Armenians throughout the world today, we also pledge to do all we can to banish genocide against any peoples anywhere from the face of the earth.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier this week Sheldon Hackney, chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, announced that he would be leaving office and returning to teaching at the end of his term of office in August. Dr. Hackney came to the endowment in 1993, following a brilliant academic and administrative career, including service as president of the University of Pennsylvania. 
News of his retirement saddens all of us who know what a superb job he has done at the endowment for the past 4 years. Perhaps his most notable achievement has been in taming the intense political controversies that were swirling around the endowment when he arrived. The controversies persist, but fortunately, they are muted because of his leadership. The endowment has earned new bipartisan support because of the effective way he has explained its important mission to liberals and conservatives alike. He will be greatly missed, but I wish him well. 
Asked about his views on eliminating the endowment, Dr. Hackney responded with characteristic eloquence, 
The only legitimate argument against continuing it is from someone who believes in a minimalist government, that government shouldn't be in culture at all. The endowment does things that no one else would do but need to be done if we are to remember who we are and what the heritage of our nation is. 
I ask unanimous consent that an article from the New York Times about Dr. Hackney may be printed at this point in the Record. The humanity of the man shines through, and through him the humanities endowment has shone through as well.

 Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Congress has 100 days to restore urgently needed assistance to legal immigrants and refugees. 
On August 1, 100 days from today, legal immigrants who have worked hard, but were injured on the job, will lose their Federal benefits under last year's so-called welfare reform law. 
Refugees will lose their safety net. These are men and women who fled persecution in their own countries, only to find persecution now in America. 
They are people who fought with us in Southeast Asia, and this is the thanks they get from hawks who kept the war going long after it should have stopped. 
The Vietnam war and the cold war are finally over. But in the rush to forget, we cannot forget these brave families and their sacrifices, and treat them unfairly, because they are old or disabled. 
In recent weeks, some needy immigrants have taken their own lives, rather than burden their families.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this week marks the 13th annual observance of Tuftonia's Week by Tufts University in Medford, MA, in which many Tufts alumni from around the world return to honor their outstanding university. This celebration has special meaning for me. My daughter, Kara, is a graduate of Tufts, and I've worked closely with many scholars at Tufts for many years on a wide variety of public policy issues. I am proud to count myself as a member of the Tufts family. 
For the second year in a row, the theme of Tuftonia's Week is community service. Participants will honor the large number of Tufts graduates across the country who are volunteering in their communities and helping to improve the lives of others in their neighborhoods through the TuftServe Program. Last year, Tufts alumni contributed more than 218,000 volunteer hours. 
Tufts deserves great credit for its leadership among the Nation's universities in emphasizing service learning and providing opportunities for students to combine community service with their academic curriculum. Programs like TuftServe are the types of service initiatives that will be highlighted at the President's Summit for America's Future, beginning next Sunday, April 27. The summit will reaffirm our national commitment to community service. Every American should have the opportunity to participate in projects that help others and improve their community. 
I congratulate Tufts for giving their students that opportunity. I am honored to take this opportunity to commend Tufts' President, John DiBiaggio, and the many others in the Tufts community for their impressive accomplishments in enhancing education and service.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 
last Monday, President Clinton announced an agreement by the Apparel Industry Partnership that establishes a workplace code of conduct for the industry. I commend this agreement, which is the product of a presidential task force on the exploitation of garment industry workers by unscrupulous clothing manufacturers. The agreement is designed to encourage voluntary compliance with labor standards in all countries that manufacture clothing sold in the United States. 
Congress can build on this agreement by acting to abolish sweatshops in our own country. Last year, Congressman Bill Clay and I introduced the Stop the Sweatshops Act. Today I am introducing that legislation to help fulfill the promise of the Apparel Industry Partnership agreement. This bill will reinforce that agreement by making clothing manufacturers liable for sweatshop practices by contractors. This liability will help to ensure that honest employers who obey our laws will not lose out in competition with dishonest employers who do not. Without this bill, economic forces in the clothing industry make it unlikely that the Apparel Industry Partnership agreement will be fully effective in protecting American workers. 
Sweatshops continue to plague the garment industry. As important as the Apparel Industry Partnership agreement is, it has a significant deficiency. It has no enforcement mechanism. It applies only to manufacturers who agree to its terms and it does not specify how violations will be remedied or what penalties will be imposed. The Stop the Sweatshops Act remedies these deficiencies for all clothing manufacturing done in this country. 
This bill will require manufacturers to exert their considerable economic power to ensure fair treatment of garment workers. It will prevent manufacturers from playing one contractor against another, which drives down the prices of their goods. It is the cutthroat competition resulting from such practices that causes dangerous and unhealthy working conditions, brutally long hours, and inadequate pay. 
The record of worker exploitation in the garment industry shows that effective enforcement is crucial. Of the 22,000 manufacturers of clothing and accessories in the United States, the Department of Labor finds that more than half are paying wages substantially below the minimum wage, and a third are exposing their workers to serious safety and health risks. 
Sweatshops run by unscrupulous contractors have a long and sordid history in this country. In 1911, a tragic fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Co. on Lower East Side in New York City killed 146 young immigrant women. They suffocated or were burned to death because the exits had been locked or blocked. 
Eighty-six years later, we still find too often that conditions have not improved. In August 1996, four Brooklyn garment factories were closed and their owners were arrested for operating sweatshops. Serious fire code violations were found, including locked exit doors, obstructed aisles, and violations of sprinkler system requirements. In addition, the contractors maintained two sets of accounting records, one showing that workers were being paid as little as $2.67 per hour--far less than the minimum wage. The workers were all Asian immigrants making clothes for K-Mart. 
K-Mart requires its garment contractors to identify all subcontractors they employ, and to make `regular and surprise inspections' of manufacturing operations. But this requirement did not prevent the fire code violations, wage violations, and other illegal practices of the contractors arrested in Brooklyn last summer. This example shows that voluntary codes of conduct and monitoring programs, as the Apparel Industry Partnership agreement encourages, cannot, by themselves, eradicate the problem. 
Another sweatshop scandal came to light last spring, with respect to clothing made for Wal-Mart. It shows how far some manufacturers are willing to go to cut costs, and the terrible human toll that follows. In August 1995, Federal investigators raided a sewing factory outside Los Angeles. In a compound surrounded by barbed wire, agents found dozens of Thai and Mexican immigrant women working 20-hour days for as little as $1.00 per hour. The women were held captive at their sewing tables by guards who threatened them if they tried to escape. 
American consumers do not want their clothing produced in this way. A U.S. News and World Report poll showed that 6 in 10 Americans are concerned about working conditions in U.S. manufacturing firms. A poll reported in Newsday showed that 83 percent of consumers would be willing to pay an extra $1 on a $20 item if they knew the garment wasn't made in a sweatshop. 
Many law-abiding manufacturers already recognize the need to stamp out sweatshops in the United States. But, as these examples make clear, current law and voluntary codes of conduct are not adequate to prevent abuses. The 800 investigators of the Department of Labor who monitor compliance with wage and hour laws cannot do the job alone. Manufacturers have the economic muscle and market power to end these abuses. But, under the current system, the market power works in the wrong direction--it encourages contractors to inflict sweatshop conditions on employees, rather than pay fair wages and maintain proper working conditions. 
The most effective way to enlist manufacturers in the battle against sweatshops is to make them liable along with their contractors for violations of the law. Manufacturers who know they will face liability will take the steps necessary to ensure that their contractors comply with applicable laws. 
Our Stop the Sweatshops Act does just that. It amends the Fair Labor Standards Act to make manufacturers in the garment industry liable, along with their contractors, for violations of these laws. 
Manufacturers will be liable for injunctive relief and civil penalties assessed against a contractor found to have broken the law. They will also be liable for back pay owed to employees for such violations. Manufacturers will be liable only for violations committed on work done for that manufacturer. 
The bill also authorizes the Secretary of Labor to assess a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each employee in cases where contractors fail to keep required payroll records. If the records are fraudulent, the Secretary can assess penalties up to $10,000 for the first offense and $15,000 for further offenses. These penalties will give employers an incentive to keep proper records, and punish contractors who attempt to conceal abuses by maintaining two sets of records. 
This bill sends a clear message to garment industry employers. Exploitation of workers will not be tolerated. Sweatshops are unacceptable. We intend to do all we can to stamp them out, and this legislation will help us achieve that goal.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want just to commend the Senator from Maryland for an excellent presentation and one which I hope our friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle would hear and heed. I see my good friend from Nevada on the floor, who will address the Senate in a few moments as well about the labor nominee. 
I want to just underscore two different items, Mr. President. First, the Labor and Human Resources Committee had the opportunity to go through the hearings. These were extensive background hearings on the qualifications of Ms. Herman. I will have an opportunity, when the Senate finally comes to consider the nomination, to review the record on her background and experience, but Senator Mikulski has done so this afternoon in a very, very thorough way. This is really an extraordinary individual. 
In spite of many allegations and charges which have been responded to, we are in a situation where the one Cabinet office which is there to hold the spokesperson for working families is vacant--vacant--and the nomination is being held hostage because of a difference with the President of the United States signing an Executive Order regarding project labor agreements, or what they call PLA's. Those are arrangements and agreements that can be done voluntarily within States, that more often than not result in the saving of taxpayers' money and the reduction of accidents on the construction site. PLA's also allow for the relationships between workers and management to be worked out in a very constructive and positive way to make sure we have ontime results and achieve high quality outcomes. 
PLA's have been done under Republican Governors and Democratic Governors, in New York, New Jersey, and Nevada, among others. Now the President of the United States wishes to exercise his power to issue an Executive order. That is differed with by Members. But they have the right to go into court and challenge that at a later time. 
The point that Senator Mikulski, Senator Reid, others, and I will make is that if our Republican friends have a difference with the President on the issue of the PLA's, why hold up Alexis Herman, who is the spokesperson for working families in this country, from being able to assume the responsibilities of that particular position? 
It is a very important position. We have several pieces of legislation that are on the calendar which relate to the conditions of working families in this country, including the so-called TEAM Act, the so-called comptime bill, and others, which we will have an opportunity to debate at some time. These are pieces of legislation that will have a direct impact on working conditions and wages of working families. Still, we do not have a Secretary of Labor in place, who will speak for workers, and that is because there is a small group of Senators who are effectively holding her hostage. 
We understand today is the Passover holiday, which is a period of celebration and a very special time of contemplation and thought and prayer by many Americans, and therefore we are not doing the Senate's business, and we do not ask the Senate to consider the nomination today. We understand tomorrow we are considering the chemical weapons treaty. That is extremely important. 
Mr. President, this issue was allegedly agreed to be considered on the floor of the U.S. Senate last week. But Members on the other side of the aise reneged on that agreement, so that we were unable to come to completion on this nomination. Now, Mr. President, we are calling on the leadership on the other side to give us an opportunity to have Senate consideration of this nominee and to stop this attempt to play hostage with the President's nominee. She is someone who was reported out favorably by all the members of the committee. 
It is time to end these kinds of games. The American people want us to find ways of working together, not to be blocking the consideration of a nominee who has the support of Republicans and Democrats alike. 
Mr. President, I hope at the time that we are back into full session, that we will be able to set a time in the next very few days, on the completion, perhaps, of the chemical weapons convention, or perhaps even during the consideration of that there can be time found for a short discussion of the merits of this nominee. 
She is an outstanding nominee. She will perform her work well. It is wrong to hold up the President's nominee. The President, after all, won the election. When you win the election, you have the time-honored privilege of selecting your own advisers. There is one standard that is used for the President's advisers who come and go at the time the President is elected. There is a different set of criteria when we talk about those who have more extended terms, such as the Federal Reserve Board and some of the other agencies; those continue at the time of a particular administration and can lapse on to another administration. We have even a higher standard when we are talking about lifetime appointments, like Federal district judges and circuit court judges, and the highest standard for the Supreme Court. That is something we all understand. 
But we are at the point now where the President, who won the election, has indicated that he wants Alexis Herman as his adviser on labor for the country's working families. It is wrong to continue to hold her hostage, and I hope we move ahead with consideration of her nomination. 
Mr. President, the Republican leadership is holding the nomination of Alexis Herman hostage to an unrelated policy dispute. Ms. Herman was reported out of the Labor Committee unanimously 2 weeks ago. Republicans and Democrats alike voted in her favor. 
The Republican leadership had scheduled a floor vote on her confirmation last week, but in an abrupt about-face they reneged on that commitment. The reason was the leadership's disagreement with a proposed Executive order under consideration within the administration. 
That order would direct Federal agencies to consider--not mandate--the use of so-called project labor agreements on Federal construction projects. 
Such agreements have been used on large-scale construction projects, in the public and private sectors, for decades. Examples of Federal projects built under PLA's include the Grand Coulee Dam in the 1930's; atomic energy plants in the 1940's; Cape Kennedy in the 1960's; and today, on the Boston Harbor cleanup. Such agreements are also being used in the present decommissioning and decontamination of nuclear facilities at Oak Ridge, TN; Savannah River, SC; Fernald, OH; Hanford, WA; Idaho National Engineering Labs, ID; and Lawrence Livermore, CA, among others. 
In the private sector, too, PLA's have been used on many projects across the Nation, including the construction of Disney World in Florida, the Toyota plant in Georgetown, KY, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System in Alaska, and the Saturn auto plan in Tennessee. 
State governments use PLA's as well. Governor Pataki of New York issued an Executive order strikingly similar to the Clinton proposal in January 1997. The Nevada and New Jersey Governors recently issued similar orders. State projects constructed under PLA's include the Boston Harbor cleanup; modifications to the Tappan Zee Bridge in New York; the Southern Nevada Water System improvements project outside Las Vegas; and many others. 
What PLA's do is require contractors to comply with the terms of labor agreements for the duration of the project. The advantages of such PLA's are many. Projects are more often completed on time, because a skilled labor supply is always available. There are fewer cost overruns, because workplace disputes are resolved through grievance-arbitration procedures, instead of by strikes or lockouts, which cost valuable work time for employers and employees alike. Projects built under PLA's have lower accident rates, because contractors can hire highly skilled and trained employees. Productivity increases as well, because of the higher skill level of workers. 
Opponents of PLA's claim that such agreement unfairly deny contracts and jobs to nonunion firms and individuals. This is simply not true. 
Nonunion contractors can and do bid on jobs where PLA's are in effect. For example, in the Boston Harbor project, fully 40 percent of the subcontractors--over 100 firms--are nonunion. Similarly, on the Idaho National Engineering Labs PLA with the Department of Energy, 30 percent of the subcontractors were nonunion. 
Similarly, nonunion workers can and do work on sites where PLAs are in place. Unions are required by law to refer nonmembers to jobs on the same basis as union members. The NLRB vigorously enforces this provision of the labor laws, and unions know how to and do comply. Furthermore, in the 21 so-called `right-to-work' States, no worker can ever be required to give financial support to a union. In the other 29 States, if the particular contract provides it, workers can be required to pay a fee to the union while workers are employed on the job site. However, no employee can ever be forced to join the union, or to pay for union activities that are not related to collective bargaining. 
PLA's thus are beneficial to project owners and workers alike. Further, it's clear that the President has the authority to issue an Executive order dealing with Federal procurement practices. President Bush did just that, when, in October 1992, he issued an Executive order forbidding Federal agencies to require PLA's on Federal construction projects. Republican attacks on President Clinton's power to issue an order directing the consideration of such agreements thus are disingenuous at best. 
It's particularly unconscionable to hold up Alexis Herman's nomination on this basis. The country's working families deserve a representative, and the Republicans know it. It's time for the political extortion to stop, and for the Republicans to give up their hostage. Free Alexis Herman, and free her now.  
Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to S. 606, the so-called Open Competition Act of 1997, introduced this afternoon by Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas. As I understand the proposal, it would forbid the Federal Government from entering into so-called project labor agreements on any Federal construction project. What prompted the bill is a proposed Executive order under consideration by the administration. 
That Executive order would permit Federal agencies to consider requiring contractors on certain large Federal construction projects to comply with labor contracts for the duration of the project. The Executive order would not mandate this procedure for any contract. It would simply direct the agencies to consider such agreements in appropriate circumstances. 
These so-called project labor agreements have been used with great success on numerous large-scale construction projects in the past. They were used on large flood control and hydroelectric projects in the 1930's. They were used when Disney World was being built in the 1970's. They were used on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System in the 1970's and 1980's. 
These agreements have also been used on Federal projects for decades. In the late 1940's, the agreements were used regularly for construction at atomic energy facilities. 
And the agreements continued to be used today. Across the country, nuclear sites are being decontaminated and decommissioned. The Department of Energy has entered into project labor agreements at the Oak Ridge facility in Tennessee; the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory in Idaho; the Savannah River site in South Carolina; the Fernald facility in Ohio; the Hanford/Richland site in Washington State; and the Lawrence Livermore facility in California--just to name a few. 
The agreements are also being used by State governments. In the Boston Harbor cleanup, for example, the State of Massachusetts required contractors to comply with such labor agreements for the duration of the work. That was a very large project, which is taking years to complete. The labor agreement is helping to ensure that the project is carried out efficiently and safely. 
According to an October 4, 1996, letter from the manager of industrial relations on that project, the Boston Harbor cleanup was originally projected to cost $6.1 billion. Now, the estimated total cost of the project is $3.4 billion. Accident rates are significantly lower than for projects of similar size and duration. And, during the nearly 7 1/2 years that the project has been underway, `there have been approximately 20 million craft hours worked without lost time due to strike or lock-out.' Anti-union contractors challenged the requirement in the Boston Harbor case, and in 1993 the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously upheld the State's ability to issue the requirement. 
Other States have taken the same approach. In January 1997, Governor Pataki of New York issued an Executive order strikingly similar to that under consideration by the President. Governor Pataki's order directed that `Each state agency shall establish procedures to consider, in its proprietary capacity, the utilization of one or more project labor agreements with respect to individual public construction projects.' The Governors of New Jersey and Nevada have recently issued similar orders. 
Despite the very clear advantages that such agreements can provide, the proponents of this bill that has been introduced this afternoon, contend that Government agencies should not enter into them because they deny nonunion contractors and workers the opportunity to bid and work on federally funded projects. This is false. Nonunion contractors are completely free to bid on projects subject to project labor agreements--and many do. In the Boston Harbor cleanup, for example, 40 percent of the subcontractors are nonunion firms. 
Nor is it true that project labor agreements restrict jobs only to labor union members. No such agreement requires that an individual join the union to be referred for a job. In fact, the National Labor Relations Act forbids unions from discriminating against nonmembers when making job referrals. 
Obviously, some of our Republican colleagues disagree strongly with such labor agreements. Many of us support them as sensible Federal contracting policy and needed protection for working families. 
At the very least, the Federal Government should not be denied the opportunity to gain the substantial benefits and savings that such agreements can supply, and that is why I hope that legislation introduced to prohibit those agreements will not be favorably considered by the Senate.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Reconstructive Breast Surgery Benefits Act of 1997. An identical bill is being introduced by Representative Anna Eshoo in the House of Representatives. Our purpose in introducing this legislation is to improve the lives of thousands of women who suffer from breast cancer. 
Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in American women, affecting one woman out of every nine. Nearly three million American women are living with the disease, and 46,000 die from it each year. Over 180,000 more women will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year, and nearly half of the women will suffer the loss of one or both breasts in order to survive. 
Reconstructive surgery or use of a prothesis can help women cope with the consequences of this deadly illness. Every woman deserves the opportunity to have these important options available if breast cancer strikes. It is also a distressing fact that some women avoid early detection procedures, for fear that it may result in the loss of a breast if cancer is detected. For these women, breast reconstruction surgery should be available as a part of treatment, since its availability can alleviate fears about the disease and encourage life-saving early detection and treatment. 
Many insurers classify this important medical procedure as cosmetic, however, and deny coverage for it. In addition, as many as 25 percent of women who undergo breast cancer treatments are affected by lymphedema, a complication resulting from mastectomy. Many insurers also refuse to cover treatment and management of this condition. This legislation will end these types of discrimination. 
Currently, 12 States have laws that require coverage for breast reconstruction following mastectomy. Nine States require coverage for prosthesis. This legislation will extend these protections to all women. 
This bill will amend the Public Health Service Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act in order to accomplish the following important actions: 
It requires insurers and companies that provide coverage for mastectomy to provide coverage for reconstructive breast surgery, prosthesis and other treatments which may be necessary as a result of surgical complications, including lymphedema; 
It prohibits monetary payments or rebates that encourage a woman to accept less than the minimum medical protection available; and 
Finally, it prohibits insurers using penalties or incentives to encourage providers to furnish levels of care inconsistent with this legislation. 
This bill has been endorsed by major national organizations involved in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, including the American Cancer Society, the National Breast Cancer Coalition, the National Women's Health Network, and the national medical and nursing groups concerned with this disease. 
Our goal is to end the cruel and arbitrary practice that unfairly discriminates against breast cancer patients and their needs. I look forward to early action by Congress, and I hope that it will receive the overwhelming bipartisan support it deserves.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the ban on the use of Federal funds for assisted suicide, and I commend Senator Dorgan and Senator Ashcroft for their leadership on this issue. 
The disabled, the elderly, low-income and other Americans in need are often totally reliant on federally financed health care. Allowing Federal funds to be used for assisted suicide, euthanasia, or mercy killing could lead to situations in which terminally ill or seriously ill individuals are coerced into choosing assisted suicide over traditional medical treatments or pain management therapies. In addition, many seriously ill people who suffer transient depression could choose suicide, when, if their depression were treated, they would not make this irrevocable choice. 
I also support the intent of the legislation to exclude certain medical treatments and procedures from the provisions of the ban. Evidence of this intent is found in both the language of the Senate bill and the language contained in the House report concerning section 3(b). This subsection clarifies the exact nature of the medical procedures and services which are not intended to be covered by the prohibition on the use of Federal funds. It is important to emphasize that the ban does not cover individuals who do not want their lives prolonged by heroic medical treatments or the other specific treatments identified in the language of the House report on this subsection.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, tomorrow, the White House is hosting an extraordinary conference on `Early Childhood Development and Learning: What the newest research on the brain tells us about our youngest children.' It is the first time a President has focused national attention on this issue. Experts from across America will explore the implications of new scientific research on the intellectual development of young children. In their early years, children have an ability to assimilate far more knowledge than at any other time in their lives. If a child's curiosity is encouraged and his or her mind regularly stimulated, the capacity to learn can be substantially expanded. 
If, conversely, a child receives little interaction and stimulation, that capacity declines just as an unexercised muscle atrophies. These findings dramatically reinforce the urgency of programs which will provide parents with the support they need to enrich their children's early years. 
There is no more important responsibility which we in the Senate have than to provide a secure foundation on which America's children can build their futures. Now that we have a far greater understanding of the significance of the early childhood years in an individual's development, we know the extraordinary impact which the quality of care and nurturing in those years can have on a child's intellectual and emotional growth. Does a child have access to good preventive medical care? Are parents able to spend time with their child or are they unable to leave work? Do the hours spent in child care provide a real learning experience? 
Does the child have access to a quality preschool education program? The answers to questions like these will have a substantial effect on a child's long-term ability to reach his or her full potential. The opportunity lost cannot be recaptured. Making these basic opportunities the birthright of every child should be our national agenda for young children. It should be our highest priority. 
Congressional action this year could bring the essential elements of sound early childhood development within the reach of every child. Such an agenda for young children has four key elements: First, providing affordable child health insurance coverage for working families. The Hatch-Kennedy bill will make health care more accessible for the 10 million children whose families cannot afford insurance. Many of these children currently see a doctor only when they are acutely ill. They never receive the preventive health care which is so essential to proper growth and development. 
Second, extending the Family and Medical Leave Act to 13 million more employees so that they have the same opportunity to spend precious time with a newborn child or to care for a seriously ill child. Giving each employee 24 hours of leave a year to accompany their child to a school event or on a visit to the pediatrician would also strengthen parental involvement. 
Third, improving the quality of child care for infants and toddlers by providing incentive grants to States to make child care programs early learning opportunities. Programs that encourage a child's curiosity and stimulate communication skills can enhance long-term educational development. 
Fourth, fully funding Head Start and expanding the Early Start initiative for younger children. 
This program is widely recognized for its success in providing children from low-income families with a firm educational foundation. Yet, funding levels currently limit access to only 40 percent of the eligible 4- and 5-year-olds and a much smaller percentage of young children. 
In the words of the Carnegie Task Force on Meeting the Needs of Young Children: `The earliest years of a child's life * * * lay the foundation for all that follows.' It calls for a comprehensive strategy to `move the nation toward the goal of giving all children the early experiences they need to reach their full potential.' 
Collectively, these four legislative initiatives will provide all parents with the tools they require to enrich their children's early years. 
Each element--medical care, parental involvement, quality child care, and early learning opportunity--is essential to maximizing a child's potential. Let me explain how each of these programs would work:  
CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE 
Today, more than 10.5 million children have no health insurance. That is 1 child in every 7. The number has been increasing in recent years. Every day, 3,000 more children are dropped from private health insurance. If the total continues to rise at the current rate, 12.6 million children will have no medical coverage by the year 2000. 
Ninety percent of these children are members of working families. Two-thirds are in two-parent families. Most of these families have incomes above the Medicaid eligibility line, but well below the income it takes to afford private health insurance today. 
Too many young children are not receiving the preventive medical care they need. Uninsured children are twice as likely to go without medical care for conditions such as asthma, sore throats, ear infections, and injuries. One child in four is not receiving basic childhood vaccines on a timely basis. Periodic physical exams are out of reach for millions of children, even though such exams can identify and correct conditions that can cause a lifetime of pain and disability. Preventive care is not only the key to a healthy child, it also is an investment for society. Every dollar in childhood immunizations, for example, saves $10 in hospital and other treatment costs. 
Every American child deserves an opportunity for a healthy start in life. No family should have to fear that the loss of a job or a hike in their insurance premium will leave their children without health care. 
Children and adolescents are so inexpensive to cover. That's why we can and will cover them this year--in this Congress. The cost is affordable--and the positive benefits for children are undeniable. 
The legislation that Senator Hatch and I have introduced will make health insurance coverage more affordable for every working family with uninsured children. It does so without imposing new Government mandates. It encourages family responsibility, by offering parents the help they need to purchase affordable health insurance for their children. 
Under our plan, $20 billion over the next 5 years will be available to expand health insurance coverage to children. When fully phased in, it will provide direct financial assistance to as many as 5 million children annually. Millions more will benefit because their families will be able to buy good quality coverage for their children. 
The plan will be administered by the States, under Federal guidelines to guarantee that the coverage is adequate and meets the special needs of children, including good preventive care and good prenatal care. States will contract with private insurance companies to provide child-only health coverage to families not eligible for Medicaid. Eligible families will receive a subsidy through their State to help pay the cost of private insurance coverage for their children. Funding will also be available to help provide prenatal services to uninsured pregnant women. 
For the youngest children, this medical care is the most vital. It can prevent serious illnesses and long-term developmental problems. 
It is the first priority if we are to help children grow to their full potential.

Mr. KENNEDY. As tax day is here, it is worth considering the contributions of legal immigrants to Uncle Sam. 
A new study by the Library of Congress highlights the extraordinary level of Federal taxes paid by legal immigrants. Recent immigrants--including both those who have not yet naturalized and those who have become citizens--paid an estimated $55 billion in Federal income taxes in 1995. Without immigration, the Government would have had $55 billion less to pay for key services or deficit reduction. 
We have long known of the major contributions of immigrants in developing innovative technologies, creating jobs for American workers, vitalizing our inner cities, serving in our Armed Forces, and in many other ways. But this report also shows that immigrants pay their way in Federal taxes. 
The $55 billion that recent immigrants contributed is almost three times what the Federal Government will spend this year on law enforcement to deal with crime. It is twice what the Federal Government will invest in education. It is nine times the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency. 
Often in recent years, Congress has been too quick to engage in immigrant-bashing, or too slow to recognize the immense contributions of immigrants to the Nation's heritage and history. Studies like this help to redress the balance, by demonstrating the continuing important role of immigration in our modern society.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in commending Senator Moynihan and the other bipartisan sponsors for their leadership on this important issue. The stakes are very high. The strength of our economy is directly tied to the quality of our transportation. This is no time to turn back the clock on ISTEA and its well-balanced commitment to seven key points: Highways; public transit; environmental protection; bikeways, recreational trails, and historic preservation; computerized traffic management; safety; and a strong voice for local communities in the allocation of funds. 
In all of these areas, ISTEA has worked well and deserves to be continued. 
This is our reply to the STEP 21 coalition and the Western coalition. Their proposals are blatant schemes to gerrymander the funding formula against our States and undermine other key aspects of ISTEA, and they're not acceptable. 
They say their States should get back from the Treasury in ISTEA funds what they pay into the Treasury in gas tax revenues. But that kind of tunnel vision is distorting this debate. It's wrong to focus narrowly just on transportation spending versus gas tax revenues. The only fair comparison is between overall Federal spending that goes into a State, and the overall Federal tax revenues that come from that State. 
By that standard, our States are donor States. We send more to Washington than we get back in return. The States complaining the loudest about not getting their fair share of Federal transportation dollars are huge net winners in the overall picture. They get back far more in Federal spending than they pay into the Treasury. And they're trying to grab even more through ISTEA. I say, they should keep their hands out of the ISTEA cookie jar. 
We have enormous transportation needs in our States, and those needs deserve strong Federal support. Working together, we intend to do all we can to chart a fair transportation course for the coming years. I look forward to that challenge and to our successful efforts together.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I give my strong support to President Clinton's HOPE and Opportunity for Postsecondary Education Act of 1997, introduced today by Senator Daschle and myself. 
Education must continue to be a top priority in Congress. We need to do more to make college accessible and affordable for all students. It is not enough to maintain current spending levels for education. Targeted increases are essential to help students, and also to help colleges deal with increasing enrollments. 
Today, college is priced out of reach for many families. From 1980 to 1990, the cost of college rose by 126 percent, while family income increased by only 73 percent. To meet that rising cost, students are going deeper and deeper into debt. In 1993 alone, students borrowed $30 billion--a 65-percent increase since 1993. Since 1988, borrowing in the Federal student loan program has increased by more than 100 percent, while starting salaries for college graduates have failed to increase at all. Many students and their families are fearful of the mounting debt burdens that await college graduates. 
The President's bill will help students pay for college in two ways: through tax relief and through increased direct financial aid. With the tax relief, students and their families will be able to choose between a $1,500 HOPE tax credit and a $10,000 tax deduction to pay annual tuition expenses for the first 2 years of postsecondary education, including graduate school The tax deduction is also available to help reduce the cost of further years of education, including graduate school. These two changes will make a college education more affordable for thousands of middle and lower income families. 
The bill also provides tax relief for students whose loans are forgiven in return for community service or for low-income wage earners under the income-contingent repayment plan. In addition, the bill provides tax incentives to encourage employers to pay for the further education of their employees. 
In the area of direct financial aid, the bill broadens the reach of Pell grants to help the neediest students pay for higher education. It increases the maximum Pell grant from $2,700 to $3,000. It also changes the needs analysis for some independent students by increasing the income protection allowance to make it comparable with that allowance for other categories of students. 
The bill also decreases the cost of student loans by reducing interest rates, and by lowering the initial fees charged to students. Borrowing has become an essential part of financing education for millions of students. These provisions will benefit them while they are in college by reducing the initial fees, and after college by lowering the interest rates on the amount they owe. 
It is fitting that this bill is being introduced today, because many members of the United States Student Association are here on Capitol Hill this week to urge Congress to give education the high priority it deserves. These students want a better education. They know they need it. And they are worried about how to pay for it. They want Congress to work together to provide the financial assistance they need to pursue their dreams. The presence of these intelligent and committed students reminds us that the future of our country depends on the education they receive. This Congress can open the door of higher education for many more of them. 
The President's proposal deserves broad bipartisan support. It is vital for the country that higher education be truly open to all qualified students, without monetary barriers. Investing in education is investing in a stronger America here at home and around the world. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to renew and extend our commitment to higher education.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Hatch for his leadership on this important issue affecting our Nation's children. 
Those of us in the Senate have noted that Senator Hatch was instrumental a number of years ago, working with Senator Dodd and myself, on the child care block grant program, which still is in existence. It has been evaluated as an extremely effective program for providing child care for the working poor. 
A number of years ago we also worked closely together in the summer jobs initiative that included continuing education programs. 
In the area of children, I think Senator Hatch and I as well as many others understand that this is neither a Democratic issue nor a Republican issue. Nor is it a North or South issue. It is an American family issue. 
For every American family children come first, as well they should. They are our greatest asset and they represent our Nation's future. When we invest in our children, we are investing in America's future. That is why this effort is of such importance and why Senator Hatch and I are now working closely together to make sure that this legislation becomes law. 
Mr. President, it is reasonable to ask, why now? Why children? 
The fact of the matter is 3,000 children every single day lose their health insurance. Nine out of ten of those who are losing their health insurance in this country are children. 
The number of uninsured children is growing. It will rise to 5 million by the year 2000, making it increasingly urgent that we address the fact that more and more children are becoming uninsured. 
We are talking about the sons and daughters of working families--families that are working 52 weeks of the year, 40 hours a week, trying to make ends meet and play by the rules. One of the things they are unable to do is provide health care coverage for their children. 
Their children require this coverage, which is why Senator Hatch and I and many others want to make health insurance accessible and affordable for all of America's children. We know the number of children who have ear infections and never see a primary care doctor. We know the number of children who are in school at this very hour and have difficulty seeing the blackboard or reading a book and are humiliated in their classroom because they have not had their eyes tested. 
This crisis is occuring all over the country. It is happening in urban areas and in rural communities. But we can do something about it, and that is why the legislation is of such importance. 
Ten million children are uninsured. Their parents are working hard trying to make ends meet, and the one thing they cannot afford are the premiums to provide health care coverage for their children. 
As Senator Hatch has pointed out, our legislation will build on existing programs in the States, and the States by and large are overwhelmingly using the voucher system. I know there are those who favor a tax credit program, but it has been tried and did not work in the past. 
We are also building on the private sector because the insurance that will be provided and distributed is going to be as a result of competition in the States. 
Finally, we are paying for the program with a 43-cents-per-pack increase in the Federal tobacco tax. 
Some say, isn't this unfair and unjustified? We say that tobacco costs the Nation $50 billion a year in direct medical costs--$50 billion a year. By adding 43 cents on a pack of cigarettes, we will have even less than the proportion of tax--Federal, State, and sales tax--for a pack of cigarettes than we had in the early 1960's. 
When we look at where we are in comparison to where other countries around the world--our cigarette taxes are well below every other industrial country in the world. With our 43-cents-per-pack increase in the Federal cigarette tax, it will still be among the lowest of all industrial nations. 
Mr. President, we strongly support this increase in the cigarette tax because it can do more to stop children from smoking than any other action we could possibly undertake. This will have a dramatic impact on reducing addiction among teenagers, who have less income than adults to spend on cigarettes. That is when the smoking really starts and where the child becomes addicted. 
We say that not only because that has been the history of pricing over the period of the last 30 years, but it is there in the documents and statements of the tobacco companies as we have seen in the Liggett story recently. 
Mr. President, this is legislation which the American people support. It makes sense from a health point of view. It makes sense from their family point of view. It makes sense for the future in terms of having children who are going to have good quality health care. It makes sense because it will save the lives of over 800,000 children who would otherwise have died from a smoking-caused illness. And it will also provide a modest reduction in terms of the deficit. 
This is a win-win-win for the American people. It should be a bipartisan effort. I want to commend Senator Hatch for his leadership and I thank all of our Democratic colleagues for joining in our efforts. 
I am honored to join Senator Hatch in introducing the Child Health Insurance and Lower Deficit Act of 1997, which will be a major step toward making health insurance accessible and affordable for all of America's children. I am hopeful that the legislation we are introducing today will be approved by this Congress, and signed by President Clinton. It shows that Democrats and Republicans can work together to solve this national problem. 
One of the most urgent needs of children is health insurance coverage. Insurance is the best possible ticket to adequate health care--and every child deserves such care. 
Today, however, more than 10 million children have no health insurance--1 child in every 7--and the number has been increasing in recent years. Every day, 3,000 more children lose their private health insurance. If the total continues to rise at the current rate, 13 million children will have no insurance coverage by the year 2000. 
Almost 90 percent of these uninsured children are members of working families. Two-thirds are in two-parent families. Most of these families have incomes above the Medicaid eligibility line, but well below the income level it takes to afford private health insurance today. 
The children's health care crisis begins at the beginning--with inadequate prenatal care. Some 17 industrial countries have lower infant mortality rates than the United States. Every day, 636 infants are born to mothers in this country who did not have proper prenatal care; 56 die before they are 1 month old. And 110 die before the age of 1. Many more grow up with permanent disabilities that could have been avoided with prenatal care. Uninsured pregnant mothers have sicker babies, and these babies are at greater risk--low birth weight, miscarriage, and infant mortality. 
Too many young children are not receiving the preventive medical care they need. Uninsured children are twice as likely to go without medical care for conditions such as asthma, sore throats, ear infections, and injuries. One child in four is not receiving basic childhood vaccines on a timely basis. Periodic physical examinations are out of reach for millions of children, even though such exams can identify and correct conditions before they cause a lifetime of pain and disability. 
Preventive care is the key to a healthy childhood, and it also is a cost-effective investment for society. Every dollar invested in childhood immunizations saves $10 in later hospital and other treatment costs. 
Some say there is no health care crisis for children. But I reply, tell that to the hard-working parents who cannot afford coverage for their families or whose employers won't provide it. 
Tell it to the hospital emergency room physicians who are often the only family doctor these children know, and who have to treat them for heart-breaking conditions that could have been prevented or easily cured with timely care. 
Tell it to school teachers struggling to teach children too sick to learn. Tell it to children's advocates across the country, who see children every day with health care needs neglected for too long. Between 30 and 40 percent of children in the child protective system suffer from significant health problems. 
For all these reasons and many more--10 million more--the children's health care crisis is real, and the time to address it is now. Every child deserves a healthy start in life. No family should have to fear that the loss of a job, or an employer's decision to drop coverage or hike the insurance premium will leave their children without health care. 
The current neglect is all the more unconscionable, because children and adolescents are so inexpensive to cover. That is why we can and must cover them this year--in this Congress. The cost is affordable--and the benefits for children are undeniable. 
The legislation that Senator Hatch and I are introducing will make health insurance coverage more affordable for every working family with uninsured children. It does so without imposing new Government mandates. It encourages family responsibility, by offering parents the help they need to purchase affordable health insurance for their children. 
Under our plan, $20 billion over the next 5 years will be available to expand health insurance coverage for children, and $10 billion will be available for deficit reduction. I share Senator Hatch's commitment to balancing the Federal budget by the year 2002. As our plan today suggests, we believe we can do it, and do it fairly. 
When fully phased in, our legislation will provide direct financial assistance to approximately 5 million children annually. Every family with an uninsured child will have access to more affordable coverage. Combined with efforts to enroll more eligible children in Medicaid, this plan is a giant step toward the day when every American child has health insurance coverage. This bill is the most important single step the Congress can take this year to provide a better life for every American child. 
States choosing to participate in the program will contract with private insurers to provide child-only private coverage. These subsidies will be available to help eligible families purchase coverage for their children, or participate in employment-based health plans. Coverage will be available for every child, including children in families not eligible for financial assistance. The program also allows States to allocate up to 5 percent of total program costs to provide preventive care and primary care to pregnant women. Participating States must contribute to the cost of the program, and must maintain their current levels of Medicaid coverage for children. 
The basic principles of this proposal are neither novel nor untested. Fourteen States already have similar programs for children. In Massachusetts, an existing program was expanded last year, so that families up to 400 percent of the poverty level are now eligible for financial assistance to buy insurance. In 17 additional States, Blue Cross/Blue Shield offers children's-only coverage, with subsidies for low-income families. These State initiatives provide a solid base on which to build an effective Federal-State-private partnership to get the job done for all children. 
Senator Hatch and I propose to pay for this program of children's health insurance and deficit reduction with an increase of 43 cents a pack in the Federal cigarette tax, from its current level of 24 cents. It makes sense to finance the coverage this way, because of the higher costs for health care and premature deaths caused by smoking. 
Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. It kills more than 400,000 Americans a year. It costs the Nation $50 billion a year in direct health costs, and another $50 billion in lost productivity. A cigarette pack sold for $1.80 costs the Nation $3.90 cents in smoking-related expenses. 
Even with our proposed increase, cigarette taxes as a percent of the product price will still be lower than they were in 1965 and will be far below the levels in almost every other industrialized country. 
A higher cigarette tax will have the added benefit of reducing smoking among teenagers. If we do nothing to reduce such smoking, 5 million deaths from smoking-related diseases will occur over the lifetime of the current generation of children. 
Raising tobacco taxes to finance health insurance for children has the support of an overwhelming 73 percent of the public. If the tobacco tax is raised, an even higher 87 percent support using the revenue to expand health services for children. 
I look forward to early action by Congress on this issue. Every day we delay means more children fail to get the healthy start in life they need. When we fail our children, we also fail our country and its future. 
I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd.  
Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce the Equal Remedies Act of 1997, for myself and 13 other sponsors. The purpose of our legislation is to end a glaring inequality in the current Federal antidiscrimination laws. 
The Civil Rights Act of 1991 gave women, religious minorities, and disabled persons the right to recover compensatory and punitive damages for intentional employment discrimination, but only up to specified monetary limits. By contrast, victims of such discrimination on the basis of race or national origin can recover damages without such limitations. 
The Equal Remedies Act of 1997 will end this double standard by removing the caps on damages for victims of intentional job discrimination on the basis of sex, religion, or disability. No one should be subject to second-class remedies under our civil rights laws. Victims of discrimination who suffer injuries deserve a full remedy for those injuries, without arbitrary limits. 
The caps serve no justifiable purpose. The standard of proof and the definition of intentional discrimination are identical under the Civil Rights Act of 1991 and the longstanding race discrimination statute. There is no reason to expect significantly more litigation, or significantly larger jury awards if the caps are removed. 
For the vast majority of victims of intentional discrimination, the caps do not affect the amount of damages. But, for others--victims with the most serious injuries from intentional discrimination--the caps are an unfair barrier to recovering full damages for their injuries. Employers who have committed the most outrageous acts of discrimination will no longer be shielded from full responsibility. 
The double standard in current law protects the worst lawbreakers and denies relief to those who have been harmed the most. By enacting the Equal Remedies Act of 1997, Congress will be affirming the basic principle of equal justice for all Americans.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last week, the Boston Globe carried a superb series of articles on poverty in the rural towns of western Massachusetts. The series was entitled `Hidden Massachusetts' and it was written by two Globe reporters--David Armstrong and Ellen O'Brien. These two have done an excellent job portraying the impact of job loss on both individuals and communities. The towns in this area have been devastated by plant closings and layoffs. Factories and mills throughout the region have pulled out for warmer climates and cheap overseas labor. The jobs which remain are predominantly low paying. Salaries in the communities west of Worcester are dramatically lower than those in the remainder of the state. With this sense of economic hopelessness has come increased levels of crime, violence and abuse. 
These articles are a poignant reminder that the rising economic tide has not lifted all boats. Similar stories could be told about impoverished communities in every one of our states. For those with limited education and outdated employment skills, the economic environment is growing increasingly hostile. The macro-economic numbers which describe a growing economy conceal a great deal of individual pain and dislocation. As a nation, we need to pay much more attention to the disturbing growth in income disparity. The working poor are becoming poorer, and the middle class are finding it tougher to maintain their living standard. We must provide these hard working men and women with the tools they need to succeed in the new economy. We must provide them with the opportunity to share in the prosperity.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, under the new welfare law, many mentally disabled legal immigrants will lose their SSI and AFDC benefits. As a result, some of these immigrants will be unable to pay their room and board at residential treatment facilities. They may be forced to live on the street, without enough money to buy their life-saving medication. 
Two cases demonstrate this problem. In the first case, Mr. X, a former officer in the South Vietnamese army, came to the US as a refugee in 1991. As a result of 12 years on the front lines of the Vietnam War, and 10 years of torture in a re-education camp, he suffers from serious mental illness. At the age of 54, he is too old to start over, learn a new language, and hold down a job. 
He receives treatment at a mental health center in California, and receives SSI. If his benefits are terminated, he will no longer have enough money to pay for his treatment. He is studying to pass the naturalization exam, but his memory impairment limits his ability to study. 
In the second case, a refugee from Vietnam receiving SSI has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, and relies heavily on medication. Without it, he hears voices, and cannot concentrate, follow instructions, or remember anything he learned. He receives $772 a month, of which $692 goes for room and board at a residential facility. If his SSI benefits are cut off, he will be forced to leave the facility, and will be unable to pay for his medication.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a soon-to-be-released study commissioned by the Immigration and Naturalization Service shows that the immigration law Congress passed last year will have a devastating impact on family reunification--especially for working families. 
Members of Congress may think they voted last year to put aside proposals to reduce legal immigration. But in fact, as this new study shows, last year's bill may have accomplished back door cuts that could not have been achieved through the front door. The onerous new sponsorship requirements are likely to cause a one-third reduction in the number of immigrants entering the United States to join close family members here. 
The new law requires immigrants and US citizens seeking to bring immigrant relatives to the US to meet strict income requirements. Anyone sponsoring an immigrant relative for admission to the US must earn at least 125% of the poverty level. For a family of four, 125% of the poverty level is more than $20,000 per year. 
The INS study examined sponsorship patterns under the old law, and found that 29% of family sponsors had incomes below 125% of poverty. That means 3 out of every 10 families who came here in recent years probably could not have been reunited with family members under the new 125% rule. In addition, 52% of immigrants who sponsored their spouses did not meet the 125% income threshold. In other words, over half of all immigrants who brought in husbands or wives--the closest of all family members--would be disqualified if they tried to bring them in today. 
In addition, according to the study, 29% of American citizens who sponsored their spouses earn below the 125% level. That's 3 out of every 10 American citizen sponsors who could not be reunited with their spouses under the new law. 
The new requirement hurts both working American families and legal immigrants. As a result, large numbers of them cannot reunite with their loved ones. The new threshold means that the average construction workers with two children could not sponsor their immigrant spouse. 
We are talking about hard-working Americans and legal immigrants--people who have played by the rules. I doubt that anyone in this Congress wants to deny American citizens the opportunity to bring their spouse to America or watch their children grow up here. But, that is what the 125% requirement does. It denies hard-working Americans these opportunities because the full time job they hold doesn't pay enough. 
Supporters of the new requirement claim that the income requirement is intended to keep immigrants off welfare. But in reality, after last year's sweeping welfare reforms, there is very little public assistance for which legal immigrants qualify. They are banned from receiving SSI and Food Stamps until they have worked and paid taxes for 10 years--or until 
they become citizens. They are banned from Medicaid and other needs-based programs for their first five years in the United States, after which they receive assistance only if their sponsors are unable to provide for them. So even if their sponsors have only modest incomes, the immigrants they sponsor are ineligible for public aid. 
I supported measure to make sponsors more responsible for the care of the immigrants they bring in. But these requirements should not be so burdensome that they prevent American citizens from having their wives or husbands or children join them in the United States. 
We expect sponsors to be responsible--far more responsible than we expect ordinary Americans to be. We expect sponsors to do it all--pursue the American dream, hold a good job, and under the new law, hold a better job than almost a third of American citizens. The 125% requirement contained in the new immigration law puts family reunification out of reach for many hard-working Americans and the majority of legal immigrants. 
In addition, the study found that the 125% requirement disproportionately affects minority communities. Half of the immigrants coming from Mexico and El Salvador had sponsors who earned less than 125% of the poverty level. The same was true for a third of immigrants coming from Korea and the Dominican Republic, and a fourth of immigrants coming from China and Jamaica. So, future immigrants from these countries will have unfair difficulty reuniting with their families in the United States. 
Supporters of the 125% requirement often point out that the new law allows low income sponsors to overcome the 125% hurdle by lining up backup sponsors. What they fail to say, however, is that low-income, working class sponsors usually have low-income, working class friends. As a result, it is extremely difficult to find back up sponsors with income sufficient to meet the 125% requirement. 
In addition, because the new law makes sponsorship agreements legally binding contracts, non-family members are unlikely to agree to sponsorship. Friends and family know that if they agree to sponsor an immigrant, they can be sued by the federal, state, or local government if the immigrant needs public assistance. If the immigrant they sponsor is injured on the job and needs medical care, the back-up sponsor may have to pay thousands of dollars in medical bills. Many families are not willing to ask their friends and other relatives to shoulder such a heavy burden. 
I hope that all of us in this Congress who are concerned about families in the immigration laws will work together to revise these harsh provisions. There is no justification for this blatant kind of bias in the immigration laws, and Congress has an obligation to end it. 
I ask unanimous consent that a recent article from the New York Times on this new study be printed at this point in the Record.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier this week, I met with Monica McWilliams of the Northern Ireland Women's Coalition. She and Pearl Sagar were the only two women participating in the Northern Ireland peace talks, so ably chaired by our former Senate colleague George Mitchell, when they began last June. 
The Northern Ireland Women's Coalition is composed of Unionist and Nationalist women who have united in common cause for peace and for an end to religious discrimination in Northern Ireland. The Coalition serves as an eloquent voice of civility in an often uncivil climate. It is especially important that women's voices continue to be heard in the search for an end to the violence and a peaceful future for Northern Ireland. 
Monica McWilliams talks frankly and effectively about her commitment to inclusive peace talks and an end to the violence in Northern Ireland. Speaking about the intransigence of some in the talks, she has said, `We're naming them, we're blaming them, and we're shaming them.' She has called on the IRA to restore its cease-fire, and called on the British Government to admit Sinn Fein to the peace talks when the cease-fire is restored. 
Monica McWilliams and her colleagues in the Coalition have shown a great deal of courage in their involvement in the political process. Ms. McWilliams recently had her car vandalized, but as she bravely stated, `That's okay, as long as there's peace.'

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am here along with a number of my colleagues to honor Arnie Aronson on his 86th birthday, which was March 11. Arnie eminently deserves his reputation as one of the greatest founders of the civil rights movement. 
Throughout his long and brilliant career, he has been a leader in every stage of the struggle for equal justice for all Americans. Over half a century ago, in 1941, he headed the Bureau of Jewish employment problems, a one-person agency in Chicago that investigated discrimination against Jews. There were no fax machines, no cellular phones, no computers then, no television sets--just one person with an iron will to eradicate discrimination. 
Arnie recognized that the plague of discrimination would not be overcome unless victims of different races and religions joined together. As Arnie once said, `the struggle for civil rights cannot be won by any one group acting by or for itself alone, but only through a coalition of groups that share a common commitment to equal justice and equal opportunity for every American.' 
At that time, Arnie also formed the Chicago Council Against Religious and Racial Discrimination, a coalition of religious, labor, ethnic, civil rights, and social welfare organizations. His organization was immensely successful in addressing the problems of discrimination. 
For over 30 years, from 1945 to 1976, Arnie was program director for the National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Council, a coalition of national and local Jewish agencies. During this period, he worked on every major piece of civil rights legislation, and every major civil rights issue. In 1954, after the historic Supreme Court decision in Brown versus Board of Education, Arnie organized the Consultative Conference on Desegregation. This organization provided much-needed support to clergy members who were under fire for speaking out in favor of the decision. He coordinated the campaign that resulted in 1957 in the enactment of the first civil rights laws since reconstruction. He was also a leader in persuading Congress to enact the three great civil rights laws of the 1960's--the Public Accommodations Act of 1964, the voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. The list goes on and on. 
Arnie was also a principal founder of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. To this day, the Leadership Conference is a powerful force for progress on civil rights precisely because of Arnie's influence and example in the 1950's. When others were seeking to divide the Nation with prejudice and bigotry, Arnie was uniting the Nation through hope and opportunity. The statement of purpose he prepared for the Leadership Conference has as much power today as it did when Arnie drafted it in 1967. The statement reads:  
We are committed to an integrated, democratic, plural society in which every individual is accorded equal rights, equal opportunities and equal justice and in which every group is accorded an equal opportunity to enter fully in the general life of the society with mutual acceptance and regard for difference. 
In 1985, Arnie became president of the Leadership Conference Education Fund. Under his guidance, the Fund has focused on working with young children to root out prejudice early and instill an appreciation for the diversity that is the Nation's greatest strength. 
As we all know, the battle is not over. Civil rights is still the unfinished business of America. But because of Arnie Aronson, we have made substantial progress. Arnie is powerful proof that one person can make a difference in the lives of millions of our fellow citizens. It is an honor to join in wishing Arnie a very happy belated birthday.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to introduce the equal rights amendment on behalf of myself and 14 other Senators. Two days before the 25th anniversary of the first congressional approval of the equal rights amendment, we reaffirm our strong commitment to making the ERA part of the Constitution of the United States. We intend to do all we can to see that it becomes part of the Constitution, which is where it belongs. 
In a sense, action now is more important than ever. Women have achieved a great deal during the last two decades. But the statutory route has not been as successful as we had hoped. Too many women and girls still face unfair and discriminatory barriers in their education, careers, sports, and other goals. The glass ceiling, the locked door, the sticky floor, the wage gap, and the occupation gap are very real problems. 
Women still earn only 76 cents for each dollar earned by men. After a full day's work, no woman should be forced to take home only three-quarters of a pay-check. 
The vast majority of women are still clustered in a narrow range of traditionally low-paying occupations. Too many women continue to be victims of sexual harassment. 
We must do more, much more, to guarantee fair treatment in the workplace and in all aspects of society. Existing laws against sex discrimination in all its ugly forms can't get the job done. The need for a constitutional guarantee of equal rights for women is compelling. 
Susan B. Anthony said it best over a century ago. When the Constitution says, `We the People,' it should mean all the people. Those words speak to us across the years. And in 1997, we intend to see that `all' means `all'--and making ERA part of the Constitution is the right way to do it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the nomination of Merrick Garland for the vacancy on the D.C. circuit, and I am concerned that it has taken more than 18 months for the nomination to reach the Senate floor. 
No one can question Mr. Garland's qualifications and fitness to serve on the D.C. circuit. He is a respected lawyer, a former Supreme Court law clerk, a partner at a prestigious law firm, and since 1989, has served with distinction in the Department of Justice under both Republican and Democratic administrations. 
Support for him is bipartisan. We have received letters of support from numerous Reagan and Bush Justice Department officials, including former Deputy Attorneys General George Terwilliger and Donald Ayers, former Office of Legal Counsel Chief Charles Cooper and former U.S. Attorneys Jay Stephens, Joe Whitley, and Dan Webb. Jay Stephens, who was U.S. attorney when Garland served at that office in the District of Columbia, called Garland a person of `dedication, sound judgment, excellent legal ability, a balanced temperament, and the highest ethical and professional standards.' The National District Attorney's Office supports his nomination, calling Garland an excellent lawyer, brilliant scholar, and a man of high integrity.' There can be no serious doubt about his ability to serve as a fair and impartial judge on the D.C. circuit. 
Why then, has it taken 18 months to bring this nomination before the U.S. Senate? And why is it that no other judicial nominees have been brought before the Senate? 
In fact, only 17 judges--all for district court appointments--were confirmed during all of 1996. Obviously, that was a Presidential election year. But the slow-down in acting on judicial nominations was unprecedented. In 1992, when President Bush was seeking reelection, the Senate, under control of the Democratic Party, still confirmed 66 district court and appellate court judges. 
Justice delayed is justice denied. Thousands of Americans with legitimate grievances cannot get their day in court, because judicial vacancies are not being filled and current Federal judges don't have the time to hear their cases. It's 
hard to crack down on crime when there are not enough judges to enforce the laws that Congress passes. 
Many of us are concerned about the harsh partisanship that is being applied to the judicial nomination process. Republicans in the Senate have organized an ad hoc Republican task force to develop procedures for screening judges. They have rejected a formal role for the American Bar Association in assessing candidates. Republicans are seeking to force the President to conduct the real debate with them behind closed doors--nominee by nominee--to make sure each person the President names meets an ideological litmus test. In fact, some have suggested a quota system, in which half of all judicial nominations come from Republicans in Congress and half from President Clinton. 
If the Federal courts were a business, they would be in bankruptcy. There are over 90 vacancies in judgeships today. In his 1996 annual report, Chief Justice Rehnquist criticized Congress failure last year to create additional Federal judgeships and called it a shortcoming. The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has requested an additional 20 temporary positions on the courts of appeals and 21 permanent and 12 temporary positions in the district courts to address the heavy backlogs that are piling up. 
In the case of Merrick Garland, some Republicans argue that we do not need to fill either of the two current vacancies in the D.C. circuit, because the caseload is too light. Many nonpartisan observers regard the D.C. circuit as the second most important court in the United States, after the Supreme Court. There currently is only one senior judge to assist the other 10 members of the Court. 
In terms of both quantity and quality of its caseload, the D.C. circuit ranks among the Nation's busiest. It handles a disproportionately high proportion of cases of national significance involving intricate legal issues. Complex administrative appeals were 38 percent of the caseload of the D.C. circuit during fiscal year 1995, as compared with only 5.5 percent in other circuits. 
By contrast, pro se appeals, which are generally the easiest to resolve, constituted only 11.8 percent of the D.C. circuit's caseload in 1995, by far the lowest percentage of any circuit in the country. 
Diversity cases, which less often raise complex and time-consuming issues, constituted only 13.6 percent of the D.C. circuit's caseload in 1995, compared with 30 percent in the other circuits. So the charts and graphs that some of our Republican colleagues are using do not tell the whole story. 
The court's backlog is also growing. In 1984, when the 12th seat was added, the court had a backlog of 1,200 cases. Today, that backlog exceeds 2,000 cases, despite a bench that is highly respected for its intellect and dedication. As former Republican Senator Charles Mathias stated on behalf of the nonpartisan Council for Court Excellence, `It is in the public interest for the D.C. Circuit to have its full complement of twelve active judges.' 
It is time to end the excessive partisanship over judicial nominations. I hope very much that our action on Merrick Garland is a sign that the unacceptable log jam is breaking and that the Senate is now returning to its proper role of advise and consent, not partisan obstruction, in the consideration of judicial nominations. 
So, again, Mr. President, I join with those that are urging the Senate's favorable consideration of this extraordinary nominee. This is an individual who has been willing to be put forward now for over some 18 months. He has appeared before the committee and, as has been pointed out, his record is one of special recognition, a brilliant academic record, a strong commitment to public service. He has served under both Democrats and Republicans. He has been an extraordinary success in the private sector, as well. 
I don't think I have seen, in recent times, the range of different support that this nominee has for this position. It is breathtaking in its scope. And the background of this individual has urged us to move forward with this nomination. We are extremely fortunate in the district circuit court to be able to have someone of this quality. As has been pointed out, it is a special court, really second in special recognition to the Supreme Court of the United States, in terms of the complexity of the cases that we require this court to resolve. 
So, Mr. President, I join with all of those and urge a positive vote in favor of this extraordinary nominee. Merrick Garland will be an outstanding jurist, as everything in his life has reflected. He has been an outstanding individual. I remember very clearly the quote of Senator Mathias, who was a very prominent, significant member of the Judiciary Committee, who took great interest in the quality of justice in this country and the quality of individuals. He has joined in urging that we move forward with this nominee and put him on the court, where he will serve this country with great distinction. I join my other colleagues in hoping that the vote for him will be overwhelming. It deserves to be. I think we will all be well served with his continued dedication of public service on the court. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I give my strong support to President Clinton's Partnership to Rebuild America's Schools Act of 1997, introduced today by Senator Moseley-Braun. 
The Nation's schools are facing enormous problems of physical decay. Fourteen million children in one-third of the schools are learning in substandard school buildings. Half the schools have at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition. 
Massachusetts is no exception. Forty-one percent of Massachusetts schools report that at least one building needs extensive repair or should be replaced; 75 percent report serious problems in buildings, such as plumbing or heating defects; 80 percent have at least one unsatisfactory environmental factor. 
It is difficult to teach or learn in dilapidated classrooms. Student enrollments are at an alltime high and are continuing to rise. We cannot tolerate a situation in which facilities deteriorate while enrollments escalate. 
GAO estimates that schools need $112 billion just to repair their facilities. Obviously, the Federal Government cannot meet all of these needs. The Partnership to Rebuild America's Schools Act encourages State, local, and private support by providing interest subsidies for school construction bonds. The Federal Government will pay up to 50 percent of interest on bonds used to finance school repair, renovation, modernization, and construction. 
Half of the $5 billion in Federal funds earmarked for this program over the next four years will be allocated to States using the existing title I formula. States and localities will distribute these funds to communities with the greatest construction needs and the least ability to meet their needs with their own resources. Massachusetts would receive $48 million for grants to local communities. 
The remaining Federal funds will be distributed by the U.S. Department of Education among the 100 school districts that enroll the greatest number of students living in poverty. Thirty percent of this funding will be allocated competitively to school districts that have particularly severe needs and obtain the most support for their construction projects from non-Federal sources. Under this part of the bill, Massachusetts would receive an estimated $25 million. 
I hope that the Partnership To Rebuild America's Schools Act will receive the bipartisan support it deserves, so that it can be in place for the beginning of the next academic year. Investing in education is investing in a stronger America here at home and around the world. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to enact this important measure.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Kerry today in sponsoring legislation to designate a 29-mile segment of the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers in Massachusetts as a component of the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. This proposal has the bipartisan support of the full Massachusetts congressional delegation--Congressmen Martin T. Meehan, John F. Tierney, Edward J. Markey, J. Joseph Moakley, Joseph P. Kennedy II, William D. Delahunt, Richard E. Neal, James P. McGovern, Barney Frank, and John W. Olver--as well as Representatives Christopher Shays and Nancy L. Johnson of Connecticut and Charles F. Bass and John E. Sununu of New Hampshire, who are introducing an identical bill in the House of Representatives today. 
The Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers have witnessed many important events in the Nation's history. Stone's Bridge and Four Arched Bridge over the Sudbury River date from pre-Revolutionary War days. On Old North Bridge over the Concord River, the `shot heard 'round the world' was fired on April 19, 1775, to begin the Revolutionary War. At Lexington and Concord, the colonists began their armed resistance against British rule, and the first American Revolutionary War soldiers fell in battle. 
In the nineteenth century, the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers earned their lasting fame in the works of Ralph Waldo Emerson, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Henry David Thoreau, all of whom lived in this area and spent a great deal of time on the rivers. Emerson cherished the Concord River as a place to leave `the world of villages and personalities behind, and pass into a delicate realm of sunset and moonlight.' 
Hawthorne wrote `The Scarlet Letter' and `Mosses from an Old Manse' in an upstairs study overlooking the Concord River. He also enjoyed boating on the Assabet River, of which he said that `a more lovely stream than this, for a mile above its junction with the Concord, has never flowed on Earth.' 
Thoreau delighted in long, solitary walks along the banks of the rivers amidst the `straggling pines, shrub oaks, grape vines, ivy, bats, fireflies, and alders,' contemplating humanity's relationship to nature. His journals describing his detailed observations of the flora and fauna in the area have inspired poets and naturalists to the present day, and helped to give birth to the modern environmental movement. By protecting the rivers, a future Thoreau, Emerson, or Hawthorne may one day walk along their shores and gain new inspiration from these priceless natural resources. 
In 1990, Congress authorized the National Park Service to issue a report to determine whether the three rivers are eligible for designation as wild and scenic rivers. Under the National Park Service's guidelines, a river is considered eligible for the designation if it possesses at least one `outstanding remarkable resource value.' In fact, the three rivers were found to possess five outstanding resource values--scenic, recreational, ecological, historical, and literary. The report also concluded that the rivers are suitable for designation based upon the existing local protection of their resources and the strong local support for their preservation. 
Our bill will protect a 29-mile segment of the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers that runs through or along the borders of eight Massachusetts towns--Framingham, Sudbury, Wayland, Concord, Lincoln, Bedford, Carlisle, and Billerica. A River Stewardship Council will be established to coordinate the effort of all levels of government to strengthen protections for the river and address future threats to the environment. The legislation also requires at least a one-to-one non-Federal match for any Federal expenditures, and contains provisions which preclude Federal takings of private lands. It is designed not to result in any additional Federal regulatory burden to private property owners along the protected river segments. 
Thoreau wrote in 1847 that rivers `are the constant lure, when they flow by our doors, to distant enterprise and adventure* * * . They are the natural highways of all nations, not only levelling the ground and removing obstacles from the path of the traveller, but conducting him through the most interesting scenery.' Standing on the banks of the Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Rivers, as Thoreau often did, citizens today gain a greater sense of the ebb and flow of the Nation's history and enjoy the benefit of some of the most beautiful scenery in all of America. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, so that these three proud rivers will be protected for the enjoyment and contemplation of future generations.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Wyden in introducing this gag rule legislation and I commend him for his leadership. Last year, a majority of the Senate voted for similar legislation but it was defeated on a procedural technicality. 
Gag rules have no place in American medicine. Americans deserve straight talk from their physicians. Physicians deserve protection against insurance companies that abuse their economic power and compel doctors to pay more attention to the health of the company's bottom line than to the health of their patients. 
I am pleased that this legislation has strong support from both the American Medical Association and Consumer's Union--because it is a cause that unites the interests of patients and doctors. 
One of the most dramatic changes in the American health care system in recent years has been the growth of health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, point of service plans, and other types of managed care. Today, 75 percent of all privately insured Americans are in managed care. Even conventional fee-for-service plans have increasingly adopted features of managed care, such as ongoing medical review and case management. 
In many ways, this is a positive development. Managed care offers the opportunity to extend the best medical practice to all medical practice. It emphasizes helping people to stay healthy, rather than simply caring for them when they become sick. It helps provide more coordinated care and more effective care for people with multiple medical needs. It offers a needed antidote to incentives to provide unnecessary care--incentives that have contributed a great deal to the high cost of care in recent years. 
At its best, managed care fulfills these goals and improves the quality of care. Numerous studies have found that managed care compares favorably to fee for-service medicine on a variety of quality measures, including use of preventive care, early diagnosis of some conditions, and patient satisfaction. Many HMOs have made vigorous efforts to improve the quality of care, gather and use systematic data to improve clinical decision-making, and assure an appropriate mix of primary and specialty care. 
But the same financial incentives that enable HMOs and other managed care providers to practice more cost-effective medicine also can lead to under treatment or inappropriate restrictions on care, especially when expensive treatments or new treatments are involved. 
Too often, insurance companies have placed their bottom line ahead of their patient's well-being and have pressured physicians in their plans to do the same. These abuses include failure to inform patients of particular treatment options; barriers to reduce referrals to specialists for evaluation and treatment; unwillingness to order appropriate diagnostic tests; and reluctance to pay for potentially life-saving treatment. It is hard to talk to a physician these days without hearing a story about insurance company behavior that raises questions about quality of care. In some cases, insurance company behavior has had tragic consequences. 
In the long run, the most effective means of assuring quality care in HMOs is for the industry itself to make sure that quality is always a top priority. I am encouraged by the industry's development of ethical principles for its members, by the growing trend toward accreditation, and by the increasingly widespread use of standardized quality assessment measures. But I also believe that basic Federal regulations are necessary to assure that every plan meets at least minimum standards. 
Medicare has already implemented such a prohibition. All Americans are entitled to this same protection. 
A gag rule provision is also included in a more comprehensive managed care bill that I introduced earlier this session. That bill addresses a number of other issues as well. This prohibition of gag rules is such a simple need and cries out for immediate relief. 
This legislation targets the most abusive type of gag rule--the type that forbids physicians from discussing all treatment options with patients and makes the best possible professional recommendation, even if the recommendation is for a non-covered service or could be construed to disparage the plan for not covering it. 
This bill specifically forbids plans from prohibiting or restricting a provider from any medical communication with his or her patient. 
This is a basic rule which everyone endorses in theory, even though it has been violated in practice. The standards of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Health Care Organizations require that `Physicians cannot be restricted from sharing treatment options with their patients, whether or not the options are covered by the plan.' 
We need to act on this legislation promptly. The Senate has the opportunity to protect patients across the country from these abusive gag rules. Action on this legislation is truly a test of the Senate's commitment to the rights of patients and physicians across the country.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to support the Democratic alternative, and to reject this one-sided, partisan, and unseemly attempt to force the Attorney General to act. 
On the issue of the independent counsel, last week, the Senate voted unanimously to give the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee a broad mandate to investigate campaign violations in all Federal elections, whether by Democrats or Republicans. 
Our able and trusted Attorney General, Janet Reno, already has a task force in full operation investigating these issues. More than 30 special agents from the FBI serve on this task force. The task force has already issued subpoenas and presented testimony before a grand jury. 
Last Thursday, Republican members of the Judiciary Committee wrote to the Attorney General urging her to seek an independent counsel. That letter requires the Attorney General to examine whether an independent counsel should be appointed and to report to the Judiciary Committee on the actions that she takes. 
The Republican resolution now before us proves that Republicans are not serious about conducting an evenhanded inquiry into campaign finance violations. It focuses only on the Presidential campaign and ignores the many allegations of serious abuse in Republican congressional races. 
We faced similar partisan tactics in the debate last week on the Governmental Affairs Committee's investigation. Democrats called for a broad inquiry covering both illegal and improper activities and including both Presidential and congressional campaigns. But the Senate Republican leadership resisted. They were only interested in putting the spotlight on the White House and diverting attention from abuses by Republicans in Congress. 
In the end, their efforts to suppress a responsible inquiry could not stand the light of day. Republicans joined Democrats in voting unanimously in favor of the Democratic position that the Governmental Affairs Committee should investigate all campaign abuses--Presidential and congressional, Republican and Democrat. 
Why don't we hear Republicans calling for an inquiry into the role of money in last year's fight to raise the minimum wage? The majority of Americans supported an increase in the minimum wage to enable American workers to support their families. But money from special business interests was rolling into Republican campaigns as corporations tried to block this long-overdue raise for working Americans. When an increase in the minimum wage became inevitable, Republicans added provisions giving huge tax breaks to business as a consolation prize. 
Why don't we hear Republicans demanding an investigation of the role of money in last year's fight over medical savings accounts? The MSA proposal threatened to block the whole Kassebaum-Kennedy health care bill. The Golden Rule Insurance Co., was the driving force behind medical savings accounts. Golden Rule made more than $1 million in campaign contributions. In October 1994 alone, just before the midterm election, it delivered $416,000 in soft money to the GOP. Only two other companies gave more to the Republicans in that election cycle. 
Golden Rule contributed lavishly to Newt Gingrich's GOPAC political action fund. Without Golden Rule and its huge contributions to Republicans, medical savings accounts would never have been an issue. Republicans were willing to jeopardize health care for working families in order to channel higher profits to insurance companies. 
But what about the Republican regulatory reform proposals in the last Congress? Utility lawyers in a Richmond, VA, law firm are reported to have drafted the Dole bill in the last Congress--the same law firm in which Senator Dole's counsel and chief aide on that bill had been employed only weeks before. That firm represented utility companies, chemical companies, and tobacco companies all seeking to increase their profits by weakening regulations requiring companies to keep our food safe and our environment and water clean. 
In fact, when the time came to inform Democrats about the Republican bill, the briefing was not conducted by Republican staff, but by three lawyers from the law firm. 
So if Republicans are serious, these offensive actions that jeopardized the health and well-being of millions of Americans would be on the list for investigation, too. 
Surely, if there is to be an investigation by an independent counsel, these abuses should be within the scope of the investigation, too. 
President Clinton and Democrats in Congress are talking about better education and health care for children, good jobs for working Americans, protections for the environment, saving Social Security and Medicare while balancing the budget, preventing crime, and reforming the current shameful system of campaign financing. Our Republican friends are interested in none of the above. They are shamefully abdicating their responsibility to prepare a congressional budget resolution. They are stonewalling any campaign finance reform. They are more interested in investigating who slept in the Lincoln Bedroom than addressing the issues that keep working families sleepless at night. 
Attorney General Reno doesn't need this kind of partisan advice to do her job and decide whether to appoint an independent counsel. Our Democratic alternative calls on the Attorney General, in determining whether an independent counsel is necessary, to `exercise her best professional judgment, without regard to political pressures and in accordance with the standards of the law.' It is the responsible thing to do. 
Attorney General Reno has earned broad bipartisan respect for her honesty and integrity. Congress should not pressure her to suspend the current Justice Department investigation and turn it over to an independent counsel. We certainly should not pressure her to seek an independent counsel whose mandate would conveniently ignore the obvious abuses of Republican congressional campaign financing. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Democratic alternative and to oppose the Republican resolution. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join 50 of my colleagues as sponsors of this Senate resolution to designate the month of March each year as `Irish-American Heritage Month.' 
Irish-Americans have contributed to every aspect of American life--business and labor, agriculture and industry, education and the arts, science and religion, at every level of government, and in all aspects of public service. 
From the days of the earliest settlers to our shores, immigrants from Ireland have found hope and opportunity and new lives in America. They powered our industrial revolution. They took jobs as laborers. They dug the canals. They built the railroads that took America to the West. Even today, it is said that under every railroad tie, an Irishman is buried. 
In all of these ways and many more, Irish-Americans have contributed immensely to our Nation and they continue to do so. In a very real sense, their greatest legacy is our modern Nation. 
Today, over 44 million Americans are of Irish descent. They are proud of America and proud of their Irish heritage, and it is fitting that we pass this resolution honoring this extraordinary aspect of our history.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is time--long past time--for the Senate to end the embarrassing delay and ratify the Chemical Weapons Convention. The convention is the most significant nonproliferation agreement to come before the Senate since the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. It is a major step toward eliminating this entire class of weapons of mass destruction. U.S. ratification of the convention, before it takes effect on April 29 of this year, is vital to our national security. U.S. support for the convention will demonstrate our continued commitment to halting the spread of these weapons of mass destruction. This is far too important a subject for further delays. It is time to end the stalling and bring the convention to a vote. There is no justification for a handful of Senate opponents of the convention to bottle it up in the Foreign Relations Committee. 
This treaty is clearly bipartisan. It was negotiated under President Reagan, concluded and signed by President Bush, and submitted to the Senate for advice and consent by President Clinton. It has broad bipartisan support in the Senate, and it should be voted on by the Senate, now. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention deserves this broad support, because it makes sense for America's national security. We have the opportunity now to move forward and rid the world of these senseless weapons. 
The United States initially led by example, by unilaterally destroying our stockpile of chemical weapons. The Chemical Weapons Convention will extend this requirement to all other nations that approve the convention. 
The convention also provides for monitoring and controls to reduce the proliferation of the chemicals and technology used to make such weapons. These restrictions will make it much more difficult for terrorists and rogue nations to develop these weapons of mass destruction. The convention also contains provisions to investigate and punish violators, including short-notice inspections of chemical manufacturing sites and other facilities. 
Opponents of the convention argue that since it is not being ratified by all nations, it will not stop rogue countries from acquiring these deadly weapons. But no international treaty starts with worldwide support. Countries suspected of chemical arms violations will be subjected to broad economic and arms embargoes. In fact, the convention specifically restricts the export or transfer of controlled chemicals to nonparticipating nations, a clear deterrent to rogue countries. 
American leadership is essential to halt the proliferation of these deadly weapons. It is already a serious international embarrassment that the United States, the leading country in the development of the convention, has taken over 4 years to ratify it. If not us, who? If not now, when? As of today, 71 nations have ratified the treaty, 
including the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Canada. We stand with Iraq, North Korea, Libya, and Syria as nonsigners. The Senate needs to act now to end the unconscionable delay in ratifying this urgently needed convention. The longer we delay, the greater the danger of the proliferation of these devastating weapons. 
Protecting our own soldiers and civilians from chemical attack is and will continue to be a high priority. Without U.S. support for this convention, rogue nations will have a greater incentive to acquire chemical weapons, and our military and civilian populations will face greater risk of chemical attack. The Joint Chiefs of Staff, those directly responsible for the men and women who are most at risk from chemical attack, fully support this convention. 
It is clearly in our national interest to ratify the convention before April 29, so that this country can be involved in the initial implementation legislation, the budget negotiations, and the verification provisions for tracking chemical weapons worldwide. 
Critics of the convention say that it will impose high costs on the U.S. chemical industry. But our industry and defense representatives have been involved in the development of the convention from the beginning. They helped draft the convention's language to ensure that their interests will not be compromised. The chemical industry supports ratification, because they know that if the convention enters into force without U.S. support, they will lose hundreds of millions of dollars in annual trade. This economic burden more than offsets the marginal costs that compliance with the convention will impose on the industry. 
Opponents also argue that the convention will reveal U.S. trade secrets to foreign inspectors. But the United States will always be the target of industrial espionage, with or without this agreement. Issues relating to the confidentiality of product and processes received a great deal of attention during the negotiations, and they are addressed in detail in the convention. 
In addition, the Commerce Department's expertise in protecting the proprietary interests of U.S. companies will continue to assist our chemical industry. The strong support for the convention by the Chemical Manufacturers Association, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, and the National Federation of Independent Business is a tribute to the fact that the concerns of these industries are fully protected. 
Ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention is vital to America's national security. I commend all those who have done so much to make this achievement possible. It represents arms control at its best, and I urge my colleagues to vote for ratification.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by my friend Senator Hollings. I respect his leadership on campaign finance reform, but it is a mistake to write it into the Constitution. 
The current system of financing elections clearly needs reform. Something must be done to curtail excessive spending on the campaign trail. The billions of dollars spent by candidates and the massive exploitation of loopholes in current law have led to a growing cynicism and distrust of our system of government. We must act on reform, but amending the Constitution is the wrong way to do it. 
In the entire history of the Constitution, we have never amended the Bill of Rights, and now is no time to start. It would be wrong to carve an exception in the first amendment. Campaign finance reform is a serious problem, but it does not require that we twist the meaning of the Constitution. 
Campaign finance reform is clearly possible without a constitutional amendment. The Buckley decision does not make it impossible for Congress to pass legislation achieving far-reaching reform. In fact, a large number of experts believe that the Supreme Court's 1976 decision in Buckley versus Valeo went too far, and that the Court is likely to reconsider it in an appropriate case. Over 50 prominent lawyers have said that the Buckley decision is `a mistake, unsupported by precedent and contrary to the best understanding of prior first amendment jurisprudence.' 
These lawyers and other constitutional scholars believe that Congress should pass campaign finance reform legislation and give the Supreme Court the opportunity to revise the Buckley decision. 
The McCain-Feingold legislation provides us with that opportunity. As President Clinton commented during his State of the Union Address, Senator McCain and Senator Feingold have reached across party lines to develop a solution to uncontrolled campaign spending. Contrary to what Majority Leader Lott believes, this legislation is not, `food stamps for politicians.' It is a serious bipartisan effort to solve this problem, and the Senate should make it a priority. 
The constitutional amendment before us today--unlike statutory reform--will not make a difference. It merely empowers Congress to pass legislation that would place mandatory limits on campaign spending in Federal elections. After the long ratification process, Congress would still have to actually pass legislation setting those limits. Though well-intended, this constitutional amendment is simply a distraction. We should get on with the business of enacting reform, without waiting for ratification of a constitutional amendment, and certainly without tampering with the Bill of Rights.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have received early reports from the Social Security Administration large numbers of of elderly legal immigrants who will lose their SSI benefits under the new welfare law unless Congress acts to help them. 
In Social Security field offices across the country, the same reports are being heard. Elderly immigrants come into the field offices after receiving a notice that their SSI benefits will be terminated unless the immigrants can prove U.S. citizenship. Many of these immigrants are citizens, but they cannot remember where they stored their naturalization certificate. Most are very old and often infirm. Sometimes they are too infirm to remember whether they were naturalized or not. 
For example, two elderly women, both over 90 years old, were senile, and confined to a convalescent home. They sought help from SSA after receiving the notice that their SSI payments would be terminated. Both women say they were born in the United States, but they cannot prove their citizenship. 
Another woman, born in Ireland over 80 years ago, came to the US when she was 2. Her parents were naturalized, but she has no proof that she was. She has never left the United States, and believes she is a citizen, but she has no way to prove it. 
The Social Security office in New York City reports that a woman's 85-year-old daughter came to inquire about her 105-year-old mother's termination notice. She stated that her mother was born in New York City, but has no birth certificate. Her mother has been receiving SSI benefits since 1976. The only way to find a record of her birth is to search the New York City birth records from 105 years ago. No one knows if the birth was even recorded. 
These are just a few stories of the hundreds coming into Social Security offices since the termination notices were mailed a few weeks ago. Several recent news articles have reported stories of legal immigrants about to lose their benefits. I ask unanimous consent that these stories may be placed in the Record following my statement. Unless Congress intervenes, the consequences of the welfare bill will be too harsh.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, all of us who knew Marty Slate and who worked with him over the years were saddened to learn of his recent, untimely death. 
Marty was an exceptionally dedicated public servant. He worked effectively throughout his extraordinary career to improve the quality of life for working men and women. He served well in many capacities, directing the field operations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, leading the ERISA Division of the Internal Revenue Service, and as Executive Director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Marty also worked hard, on a daily basis, to improve the quality of life of those around him, particularly his staff and coworkers. 
Marty was a brilliant lawyer and a gifted manager who knew how to get things done. He inspired the people who worked for him and helped make them some of the most effective and productive public servants in the Nation. Everywhere he went, his ability and dedication brought out the very best in his colleagues and his staff. 
Marty was a superb legislative strategist who understood the role of Government and the impact that Government could have on working Americans. He was the moving force behind the Retirement Protection Act, the pension funding legislation that Congress approved in 1994. 
Early in the Clinton administration, Marty brought together representatives of the PBGC, Treasury, IRS, Labor, Commerce, OMB, and other Federal agencies as part of an impressive task force. The task force worked effectively under Marty's leadership to identify the problems that caused pension underfunding, and the best solutions to those problems. As chairman of the task force, Marty's door was always open. No person or group was ever shut out of the process. Needless to say, the task force issued its findings and recommendations in a timely manner. 
After the task force report was issued, Marty looked to the future, and worked closely with Congress on legislation to address the problem of pension underfunding. As my Senate colleagues will recall, we approved the funding reforms in the Retirement Protection Act, the most significant pension legislation since the enactment of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act in 1974. It was an extraordinary bipartisan accomplishment, and it was Marty's accomplishment, too. Millions of working men and women have pensions that are more secure today because of Marty Slate. 
In his years at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Marty worked hard to assure that workers did not suffer from discrimination. 
Under his leadership, the EEOC wiped out case backlogs and vigorously prosecuted discrimination complaints. As director of field operations for the agency, he was responsible for the day-to-day activities of 46 field offices. The large numbers of working men and women who were protected from discrimination because of Marty's efforts owe him an enormous debt of gratitude. 
When Marty left the EEOC to work for the Internal Revenue Service, he established the Georgetown-IRS Masters of Taxation Fellowship Program.' This program was designed to help those who were not historically represented in the fields of taxation and pensions because of discrimination and lack of opportunity. Under this program, students applied for admission to Georgetown's Masters of Taxation Program, while simultaneously applying for a job at the IRS. The IRS, the university, and the student-fellow would share the costs of tuition. 
When Marty left the IRS in 1993, he created a similar fellowship program at the PBGC. The fellowship programs that Marty created have been extremely successful, and have enabled many African-Americans and other minority students to break through long-standing barriers and find jobs in the fields of taxation and pensions. One graduate of this program is now a professor at Catholic University. 
In ways like these, Marty Slate didn't just talk about fair play and equal opportunity. He helped to assure that new opportunities for African-Americans and other minorities actually existed, and the graduates of these fellowship programs will carry on Marty's fine work. 
Marty is warmly remembered by those who worked with him as a person who took genuine personal interest in helping them to advance their careers. With all his myriad of responsibilities, he was never too busy to write a letter or place a phone call to help someone develop their career. He was never too busy to reach out. He was there for the people he led and managed because he cared deeply about them. 
Marty also loved sports. He was a true Boston Red Sox fan and he had a great love for sports trivia. A local radio station in this area has a call-in trivia contest for sports fans, which takes place in the middle of the night. Marty would regularly set his alarm for 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock in the morning and get up and call into the talk show. He called so often that he was known on the show as `Marty from Bethesda.' Marty almost always knew the answer and would win Baltimore Orioles tickets. He would then share the tickets he won with his friends. 
As a Boston Red Sox fan myself, I am particularly fond of a story from Marty's childhood. One day, when he was about 6 years old, he wanted to go to Fenway Park to watch the Red Sox play. His parents were concerned, because they couldn't go that day, and they didn't want him to go alone. 
Marty found a way to heed his parents' advice. The Red Sox won and he had a wonderful time. But when he came back, police and emergency vehicles were parked on his street. They were there because 6-year old Marty had, in fact, listened to his parents. He did take someone to the game. The problem was that it was the 3-year-old child of a neighbor. And the police were looking for the missing child in the neighborhood. Even at that young age, Marty was demonstrating his extraordinary sense of responsibility. 
Now that he has left us, all of us who were touched by Marty's brilliance and compassion will work harder to carry on his work. That's the way Marty would have wanted it. 
My heartfelt condolences go to the Slate family, to Marty's wife, Dr. Caroline Poplin, to his parents, Albert and Selma Slate, to his brother, Dr. Jerome Slate, to his sister, Emily Slate, and to all of Marty's friends and coworkers. He touched all our lives, and we will never forget him.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last year Congress passed a comprehensive welfare reform bill that drastically restricted the ability of legal immigrants to participate in public assistance programs. It prohibits legal immigrants from receiving food stamps, SSI, and Federal non-emergency Medicaid benefits. The bill also gives States the option to ban legal immigrants from State Medicaid services and temporary assistance to needy families (formerly AFDC). 
In the past 2 months, we have begun to see the harsh impact of this bill on legal immigrant families in all parts of the country. Many face being turned out of nursing homes, and cut off from disability payments. These human tragedies will only continue to grow in number and severity without congressional action.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to an outstanding public servant who is leaving office as Commissioner of Food and Drugs, Food and Drug Administration, Dr. David Kessler. In 1991, the Food and Drug Administration was at one of the lowest points in its history. The agency was recovering from the generic drug scandal. It was not consistently enforcing the law. Patients felt they were not receiving the therapies they needed. 
The appointment of David Kessler as commissioner changed all that. He launched an extraordinary period of reform and improvement in the agency's effectiveness. He began with the obvious--enforcing the law. 
He initiated many other important reforms. He has worked tirelessly to provide improved treatments for cancer and AIDS, and to assure that life-saving drugs move quickly from the laboratory to the marketplace. Because of his leadership, the information supplied with prescription and over-the-counter drugs will soon be more user-friendly. He led the administration's initiative to reduce teenage smoking. 
He led the way to many other impressive achievements. The United States is now as fast or faster than any other country in the world in getting new drugs to patients. David Kessler achieved this result without sacrificing the FDA's high standards for safety and effectiveness. 
For David Kessler, the first priority was always the public health. He used his brilliant intellect, his boundless energy, and his unparalleled commitment to serve that great goal. He represents the best in public service. It has been a great privilege to work with him, and I wish him well in the years ahead. 
I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we approach St. Patrick's Day, the thoughts of many turn to Ireland. More than 44 million Americans are of Irish ancestry. It is often erroneously assumed that the vast majority of Irish-Americans are Catholics. But at least half of the 44 million are Protestants, many of which are descendants of the ancestors of the present-day Protestant communities in Northern Ireland and Ireland. 
In the 1990 census, nearly 6 million Irish-Americans defined themselves as `Scotch-Irish'--an American term which did not begin to be used widely until the mid-19th century. Most of Protestant immigration from Ireland occurred in the 18th and early 19th centuries, whereas the majority of the large number of Irish who arrived in the United States beginning in the mid-19th century at the time of the potato famine in Ireland were Catholic. 
The Scotch-Irish in America are descendants of the approximately 200,000 Scottish Presbyterians who settled in Ireland in the early 17th century. The modern Protestant majority in Northern Ireland are descendants of that Ulster Plantation. 
In the late 1600's, religious persecution of Scottish Presbyterians by England led some to leave Ulster and seek religious freedom in the American colonies. Many of these immigrants settled in the Chesapeake Bay area. One such immigrant, Francis Makemie, is the father of American Presbyterianism. 
The largest numbers of Scotch-Irish immigrants, about 250,000, left for the American colonies in the 18th century in the decades leading up to the Revolutionary War. They left Ulster less for religious than economic reasons, because of the decline in the linen industry, failed harvests, and high rents for tenant farmers. Many of these immigrants were so poor that they made their way to the colonies only by becoming indentured servants. The destination of the earliest of these immigrants was New England although many of these subsequently moved inland to the frontier. In `The Scotch-Irish and Ulster,' Eric Montgomery writes of these immigrants: 
Ideally suited for the new life by reason of their experience as pioneers in Ulster, their qualities of character and their Ulster-Scottish background, they made a unique contribution to the land of their adoption. They became the frontiersmen of colonial America, clearing the forests to make their farms and, as one would expect, they had the defects as well as the qualities of pioneers. President Theodore Roosevelt described them as `a grim, stern people, strong and simple, powerful for good and evil, swayed by gusts of stormy passion, the love of freedom rooted in their very hearts' core.' 
The Scotch-Irish were staunch Calvinists and their religious differences with New England's Congregationalists led, after 1725, to a shift in their immigration from New England to Pennsylvania. These immigrants first settled near Philadelphia, but soon spread west throughout the entire State. Others went south to the Carolinas and Georgia, always extending the frontiers. 
The Log College was established to train Presbyterian ministers near Philadelphia in 1726 or 1727 by Scotch-Irish minister Rev. William Tennent, Sr. It developed close ties with the College of New Jersey, which was founded in 1746, and later became Princeton University. 
The impact of Scotch-Irish settlers on America was significant. Arthur Dobbs, a member of the Irish Parliament and a landowner from Country Antrim, became Governor of North Carolina in 1753. Five signed the Declaration of Independence--Thomas McKean, Edward Rutledge, James Smith, George Taylor and Matthew Thornton. John Dunlap of Strabane printed the Declaration and also founded the Pennsylvania Packet, the first daily newspaper in America. 
Large numbers of Scotch-Irish immigrants joined the fight for American independence. Irish volunteers performed so courageously in the Revolutionary Army that Lord Mountjoy told the British Parliament, `We have lost America through the Irish.' 
Charles Thomson came to Pennsylvania as an indentured servant, and went on to serve as the Secretary of the Continental Congress from 1774 to 1789. 
Scotch-Irishman Henry Knox was one of four members of President George Washington's first Cabinet. John Rutledge was the first Governor of South Carolina. Thomas McKean was the first 
Governor of Pennsylvania, and William Livingstone was the first Governor of New Jersey. 
The Scotch-Irish were strong supporters of the Jeffersonians in the early years of American independence. The Harvard Encyclopedia notes: 
The Scotch-Irish turned out in strength to vote for Thomas Jefferson in the election of 1800, and their influence, along with that of other immigrant groups, may well have been decisive in New York and thus the nation at large. 
Twelve Americans of Scotch-Irish ancestry became President of the United States. The fathers of Andrew Jackson, James Buchanan and Chester Alan Arthur were each born in Northern Ireland. And James Polk, Andrew Johnson, Ulysses Grant, Grover Cleveland, Benjamin Harrison, William McKinley, Woodrow Wilson, and Richard Nixon were all of Scotch-Irish ancestry. President Clinton's family tree has several Irish branches, and undoubtedly contains both Scotch-Irish and Catholic roots. 
The Scotch-Irish parents of John C. Calhoun emigrated to Pennsylvania and then moved to South Carolina. Born in 1782, he was elected to the House of Representatives from South Carolina at the age of 29, and went on to become Senator, Secretary of War, Secretary of State, and Vice President. As chairman of the Senate House Foreign Relations Committee in 1812, he introduced the declaration of war against Britain. His portrait is on the wall of the reception room adjacent to the Senate Chamber today, as one of the five greatest Senators in our history. 
Many other famous Americans are of Scotch-Irish descent. Sam Houston served as Governor of Tennessee before moving to Texas and leading the fight for Texas' independence from Mexico. Before Texas joined the Union, he served as the first President of the Republic of Texas and, after, as Governor. He was a staunch defender of the Union, but his efforts to keep Texas from seceding prior to the Civil War failed, and he was removed as Governor when he refused to take Texas out of the Union after the vote to secede. 
Stonewall Jackson was a descendent of Scotch-Irish immigrants from County Armagh. Davy Crockett was Scotch-Irish. 
Cyrus McCormick, inventor of the mechanical reaper, was given the French Legion of Honour by Napoleon, who described McCormick as `having done more for the cause of agriculture than any other living man.' A successful businessman, active Democrat, and Presbyterian, he founded the McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago. 
The Mellon family emigrated to Pennsylvania from County Tyrone in 1818. Thomas Mellon, a young boy at the time, became a successful lawyer, banker, and businessman in Pittsburgh. He founded what became the Mellon Bank, and was instrumental in the growth and development of Pittsburgh. His son, Andrew Mellon, served as Secretary of the Treasury for Presidents Harding and Coolidge. He helped found Gulf Oil, Alcoa, and the Union Steel Co., which later merged into the U.S. Steel Corp. He assembled one of the world's greatest art collections, established the National Gallery of Art, and donated his collection to the gallery where vast numbers of Americans enjoy it every year. Andrew's son, Paul, and other members of the Mellon family have carried on the family's business success and extraordinary philanthropy. 
The Scotch-Irish have also been well-represented in the arts. Edgar Allen Poe, Stephen Foster, Horace Greeley, founder of the New York Tribune, and Harold Ross, founder of the New Yorker, were all Scotch-Irish. 
The majority of Irish-American Protestants today define themselves as `Irish,' not `Scotch-Irish.' By and large, the term `Scotch-Irish' fell into disuse over the years as discrimination against Catholics in this country declined. 
Immigrants to America from all parts of Ireland, whether Catholic or Protestant, have made brilliant contributions to the success of America. Those of us who are committed to a just and peaceful resolution of the conflict in Northern Ireland know that peace will only be achieved there when both traditions are treated equally and fairly, and when mutual respect and a good-faith political process replace bombs and bullets as the means for settling disputes. 
Ireland's extraordinary contributions to America reflect Ireland's two great traditions--Protestant and Catholic--and America honors them both on St. Patrick's Day 1997.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there is a right way and a wrong way to balance the budget. And a constitutional amendment is the wrong way. 
The choice is not whether to balance the Federal budget, but how to do it. I believe we will adopt a budget this year that is balanced by the year 2002. President Clinton has already submitted a budget to accomplish this goal. Democrats and Republicans alike in Congress are prepared to work together to enact a balanced budget. 
We can balance the budget by statute, while setting appropriate spending priorities for the future. We can protect Social Security for senior citizens. We can give priority to education and assure that funds for schools will not be cut in the middle of the year. We can deal with vital issues of national defense. We can deal with the need for capital investments in highways, public transportation, and the environment. 
Balancing the budget the right way is of special concern to the people of Massachusetts. A new study by the Twentieth Century Fund concludes that enactment of the balanced budget constitutional amendment would have dire consequences for the State of Massachusetts and its residents. The study finds that Massachusetts health and human services programs and educational programs receive more than three-quarters of their funds from the Federal Government. Three hundred thousand Massachusetts residents are employed in my State's health care sector alone. 
This includes the work and the investment that the United States has in terms of the National Institutes of Health, since the nature of quality research really is unsurpassed in our part of the country. That whole effort would be threatened, as would many other areas of research and technology which help to move our whole economy, our national security defense, and the quality of health care forward. 
That is 10.5 percent of our work force. Balancing the budget the wrong way by failing to give priority to these key programs would place at risk hundreds of thousands of Massachusetts residents and tens of thousands of jobs. 
Republicans had the opportunity to address all of these concerns during the Senate's debate on the balanced budget constitutional amendment. But they refused to do so. 
When the Judiciary Committee considered the proposed constitutional amendment in January, I offered an amendment to protect Social Security. My amendment separated Social Security from the rest of the Federal budget, just as Congress has done by law for most of the past 15 years. Senator Reid offered the same amendment here on the Senate floor last week. But the Republican majority opposed this important protection for the Nation's senior citizens. 
Senator Torricelli offered an amendment to permit a capital budget, just as most States and most families do, as a way of investing for the long run. Yet Republicans opposed this provision that is so important to the future of the economy. 
If families were subjected to this rigid constitutional amendment, they could never make long-term purchases. They couldn't buy a home through a mortgage, borrow money to send their children to college, or buy a new car on credit. 
This amendment flunks the kitchen table test. Families don't balance their budgets this way. Why should Uncle Sam? 
Senator Durbin offered an amendment to allow greater spending flexibility during recessions to protect jobs and assist laid off workers. More than 1,000 of the Nation's leading economists, including 11 Nobel Prize winners, warned that the constitutional amendment proposed by the Republicans would put a straightjacket on the economy that would make recessions worse. But Republicans ignored the economic evidence and opposed our pro-family, pro-worker amendment. 
The proposed constitutional amendment would also empower unelected judges to stop payments on Social Security checks or Medicare, or cut the defense budget. It would have allowed the President to impound funds appropriated by Congress, even though impoundment was outlawed in 1974. But Republicans opposed our amendment to eliminate this problem. 
All our efforts to change the proposed constitutional amendment--to protect senior citizens, protect the national defense, protect workers in recessions--were summarily rejected by supporters of the constitutional amendment. 
In my view, the most serious defect in the proposed constitutional amendment is its threat to Social Security. 
Social Security is a contract with the Nation's senior citizens to guarantee at least a minimum level of security in their retirement years. 
In recognition of its special status, the Greenspan Commission recommended in 1983 that Congress should place Social Security outside the Federal budget. The Commission said we need to build up a sufficient surplus in the trust funds now, in order to have enough funds to provide benefits to the current generation when they begin to retire. 
Both Democrats and Republicans supported that result. In 1983, the Commission's recommendations were enacted in a law sponsored by Senator Dole and Senator Moynihan. Their bill required Social Security to be placed off-budget within 10 years. A bipartisan 58 to 14 vote, including 32 Republicans and 26 Democrats approved this important legislation. 
In 1985, Congress accelerated the process of placing Social Security outside the rest of the Federal budget. The Deficit Control Act of 1985--the so-called Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law--exempted Social Security from across-the-board cuts or sequestration. 
That said, if they were not going to meet the budget titles, we were going to eliminate the cuts in Social Security from being sequestered like other programs would be. The reason for that is, unlike other kinds of spending programs, people have paid in over their working lives into this fund and should be entitled to receive it at the time of their retirement. That is different from all of the other kinds of programs. It was recognized by the Greenspan commission for that very reason--the contract with the American people, the contract with our senior citizens--that they had paid in, and we should not undermine their sacred trust into which they paid in; unique in terms of all of the Federal budget; recognized in a bipartisan way by the Greenspan Commission; recognized in the Gramm-Rudman proposal to be excluded and not be subject to sequestration; recognized again in 1990 during the budget debate. 
When there was any question about it, a vote of 98 to 2 said they will put Social Security outside of the consideration. There was a bipartisan commitment to do so. And, nonetheless, at the time we had the markup in the Judiciary Committee--and here on the Senate floor--those individuals that talk about Social Security state that Social Security recipients will have to fight it out with the rest of the inclusions in the budget. 
That is not what this Congress said and the American people wanted--over 15 years, and a bipartisan effort. But that is what has been excluded. And the answer that our friends give to that question is, `Oh, well, Social Security recipients will be further threatened if we have a demise or a threat to our economy.' 
Mr. President, we can deal with the economy of the United States, which is the strongest in the world. We should not be using the Social Security trust fund as a piggy bank either for tax cuts, as was threatened in the course of last year, or other kinds of cuts. We had the opportunity to support the Reid amendment, and that was rejected and turned down. 
The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law also said that Social Security could no longer be included in the unified budget of the U.S. Government. 
From that point on, when Congress has adopted the annual Federal budget resolutions, Social Security is not included. The last time the Congress of the United States voted on a budget that included Social Security was 1985. 
Congress supported this change by wide bipartisan majorities. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law was approved by a 61 to 31 vote in the Senate and a 271 to 154 vote in the House of Representatives. 
In 1990, some Members of Congress proposed to put Social Security back into the Federal budget. But Senator Hollings and Senator Heinz rejected this unwise suggestion. They insisted that Social Security remain off budget, and the Senate approved an amendment to protect Social Security by a 98 to 2 vote. 
Again in 1995, section 22 of the congressional budget resolution amended the Budget Act to strengthen even further the firewall protecting the Social Security Program. 
The proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment would change all that. It would reverse 15 years of steady progress in protecting Social Security. It would turn its back on all this recent history, and expose Social Security to unwise and unacceptable cuts in the years ahead 
Employees may have worked hard all their lives. Social Security has been withheld from their paychecks month after month. They are expecting the money to be available when they retire. But this constitutional amendment places the entire program at risk. 
This constitutional amendment is a back-door raid on Social Security, and all of us who have worked hard to protect Social Security in recent years should reject it. 
Another serious defect in the proposed constitutional amendment is its enforcement. 
Thirteen of our Nation's most distinguished constitutional scholars wrote to me only yesterday expressing their deep concern about the proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment. The scholars include Harvard professor, Archibald Cox; former Attorney General, Nicholas Katzenbach; Yale professor, Burke Marshall; Stanford professor, Kathleen Sullivan; Harvard professor, Larry Tribe; and others. They stated:  
Whatever our differences about budget policy, we share the conviction that enacting the proposed balanced budget amendment would be a serious mistake. We believe that the amendment would depart unwisely and unnecessarily from our constitutional scheme. 
These eminent constitutional experts further concluded that it `would transfer power over government spending from the Congress, where the Framers deliberately reposed it, to the President and the courts.' 
What happens when we find in the middle of the year that revenues are lower or expenses are higher than we thought and the budget for that year will be unbalanced? 
This constitutional amendment allows unelected judges to step in and draw up a Federal budget of their own. 
That was an issue that was debated in the last two Congresses. It was the decision and the determination in the last two Congresses when we debated this to limit the authority of the judges under the old Danforth amendment to permit courts only to make declaratory judgments. Do you think that has been included in this balanced budget amendment? Absolutely not. 
We saw in the last Congress the amendment that was prepared by Senator Nunn and others which was virtually unanimously accepted to also exclude and limit further the power of the courts. Was that included? No. And all we can conclude is what was testified during the course of the Judiciary Committee hearings, and that is that the opportunity for the courts to interject themselves in making these budgetary decisions will be available to them unless we pass other kinds of laws, and the other laws that we might pass may very well be unconstitutional. Why leave that up in the air? These were attempts to address that issue, and they were rejected. 
Judges are appointed to interpret the Constitution and the laws. They are respected legal experts. But they do not know what priority to give to Social Security or education, or defense, or the public health. They don't know whether it is better in a particular year to reduce highway funding or medical research. Congress is elected to set those priorities and make those changes, and we should not surrender that power to the judicial branch of government. 
Proponents of the amendment say that they oppose judicial activism. Yet this proposed constitutional amendment would be an invitation to judicial activism of the worst sort. 
President Clinton wrote to Senator Daschle on January 28, reaffirming his commitment to balance the Federal budget by the year 2002. The President also emphasized his view that a constitutional amendment was unacceptable. he stated,  
We should not lock into the Constitution a form of budgeting that simply may not be appropriate at another time. . . . We must give future generations the freedom to formulate the federal budget in ways they deem most appropriate. 
I urge the Senate to defeat this proposal. We are very close to balancing the budget the right way. It makes no sense to do it the wrong way, by locking the country into a constitutional straightjacket.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Jeffords for his leadership on this legislation and I am honored to join him on it. Our bill repeals the criminal penalties enacted last year for disposing of assets in order to obtain Medicaid benefits. 
We all agree that Medicaid must be free of fraud and abuse. No one should be able to game the system by giving away their assets just to qualify for Medicaid, a program intended to help the truly needy. 
The criminal penalties enacted last year was a mistake and should never have been enacted. They are poorly drafted, and will have unintended consequences that penalize senior citizens unfairly. Indeed, this provision could frighten the most needy elderly away from seeking the care they need, while doing little to deter and punish those who defraud the system. 
No serious study has defined abusive transfers of assets as a significant problem, or recommended criminalizing an action that is already prohibited and penalized in other ways. If middle and upper income families are transferring assets to qualify for Medicaid, it should be the topic of congressional hearings and investigation, so that we can evaluate the scope of the problem and develop an appropriate response. In the meantime, seniors should not be terrorized with threats of jail merely for seeking nursing home care. 
The current debate over this issue reveals a much larger problem--the need for better coverage of long-term care, so that those requiring long nursing home stays don't have to sacrifice their life savings to pay for their care. 
There is broad bipartisan support in Congress for repeal of this provision. The White House supports repeal. Advocacy groups for the elderly support repeal. I urge Congress to act quickly on this legislation, and provide peace of mind to senior citizens across the country who feel unfairly threatened by current law.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the killings at the Empire State Building last Sunday were the shots heard 'round the country. The entire Nation was horrified to learn of the senseless assault on seven tourists, and hopefully we will be shocked into action to close the flagrant loophole in the gun laws that allowed the attack to happen. It's preposterous that a deranged alien could arrive in this country, set up temporary residence in a motel, buy a semiautomatic handgun, and start blasting away in a crowded tourist site. The gunman at the Empire State Building killed himself. One other person died, six were injured, and countless others on the observation deck at the time bear the psychological scars from this senseless atrocity. Most of the victims were visitors from other countries--France, Switzerland, and Argentina--and were there seeing one of the most famous symbols of America. 
Imagine the nightmare for a 16-year-old French tourist who saw both her parents shot, or the 10-year-old girl from the Bronx whose father was wounded. The thoughts and prayers of all Americans are with the victims and their families. 
The shock and disbelief turned to anger as we learned more about the circumstances of the shooting. The gunman, Abu Kamal, was in the United States on a tourist visa, and was easily able to purchase a Berreta semiautomatic handgun in Florida, even though there is a 90-day residency requirement under Federal law before aliens can purchase a handgun. 
The current gaps in Federal law are appalling. A foreign national can 
come to the United States on a tourist visa, or a work visa, and then obtain a handgun legally with ease. There is virtually nothing to stop a terrorist from entering the United States on a tourist visa, and then purchasing a supply of weapons legally in the United States for use in a terrorist activity. There is no legitimate reason why someone who is in the United States temporarily should be able to purchase or carry a firearm here. 
Senator Durbin and I are introducing a bill today to close this gaping loophole. Our bill will prohibit foreign nationals who are in the United States on a nonimmigrant visa from possessing a firearm. Foreign nationals here on a tourist visa, or a temporary work visa, would be prohibited from carrying a firearm, and dealers would be prohibited from knowingly selling them a firearm. The INS already provides immigration information to law enforcement authorities conducting background checks on gun purchasers, so they are well-positioned to provide this additional information to firearms dealers. 
The bill does not apply to permanent residents. In addition, a series of sensible exceptions will permit certain foreign nationals who are in the United States temporarily to carry a firearm. For example, foreign nationals performing official State functions, such as bodyguards and other Embassy personnel, would be exempted. Foreign nationals who are coming to the United States to go hunting would also be exempted. The Justice Department would have the discretion to grant additional exemptions to qualified applicants. 
We intend to address in future legislation another major aspect of the gun violence problem in America--which is the widespread disparity between gun control laws in various States. It will be impossible to stop guns from coming into New York or Massachusetts, or elsewhere, if we don't solve this problem. Fifteen percent of the gun crimes committed in New York City in 1995 involved guns traced to Florida. Gun-running will always be a profitable business, as long as some States make it as easy to buy guns as to buy groceries. We must address this larger problem, or we will continue to suffer these senseless acts of violence. 
This bill cannot undo the tragedy last Sunday at the Empire State Building. But we can prevent future similar tragedies by closing the loopholes that exist in current Federal law that enable foreign nationals to obtain firearms too easily. I urge my colleagues to support this sensible and needed proposal. 
Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Illinois for his forceful statement in support of this legislation which will address a gaping loophole that exists in the gun laws and which he has ably explained on the floor of the Senate this afternoon where individuals would be able to come into the United States on a temporary visa and be able to purchase not just perhaps one weapon but a whole series of weapons and be able to use them for whatever purposes they might want here in the United States or perhaps take them outside of the United States. This is a gaping loophole. With the information that is being acquired by the INS, there is no reason it cannot be made available to gun dealers around the country with a minimum amount of interference in their ability to sell guns in conformance with other provisions of the law. 
I think this is a really important piece of legislation, and I welcome the opportunity to work with the Senator. Hopefully, we will have it acted on as well as the other provisions that are before the Senate dealing with the massive movement of weapons from State to State. In my own State of Massachusetts, about 80 percent of the weapons that are used in crimes of violence are imported. As good as we have, in terms of the local and State control, we are not able to control it and deal with the issues of providing security to our people in our State. 
But I thank the Senator and welcome the chance to join with him and look forward to working with him on the legislation.   
By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Mack, Mr. Frist, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Craig, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Faircloth, and Mr. Bingaman.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I hope, depending upon the interest of our colleagues, we might be able to address this issue in a more limited period of time and get back on schedule. But at this time, we will move to the time agreement and then try to respond to the leader's request that we move as expeditiously as we can to the conclusion of some of these amendments. 
Mr. President, I offer this amendment to guarantee exclusive congressional enforcement of the balanced budget constitutional amendment and to avoid the serious problem of judicial enforcement under the pending version of the amendment. The balanced budget amendment would overturn the basic principle of separation of powers by giving the courts and the President enforcement authority. We must take clear steps to avoid such a situation. 
The proponents of this amendment apparently believe the old adage that silence is golden. They say that because the amendment remains silent with regard to judicial review and Presidential impoundment power, the Congress has not sanctioned either form of enforcement. Unfortunately, numerous constitutional scholars disagree. During the last debate on this issue, 17 of our country's most well-respected scholars urged Congress to reject the proposed balanced budget amendment. Conservative and liberal constitutional experts shared the conviction that the proposed balanced budget amendment was a mistake, and they specifically stated that the amendment would inappropriately involve the judiciary in intractable questions of fiscal and budget policy. 
The proposal before us today raises those same concerns. The amendment I offer today addresses this problem by granting Congress exclusive authority to enforce the balanced budget constitutional amendment unless Congress authorizes otherwise in the implementing legislation. The courts could not become involved in the many complex budgetary questions that would be raised by taxpayers, Members of Congress, or other citizens without specific authorization from Congress. 
If the Senate does not adopt this amendment, Congress may not have another opportunity to narrow the Court's enforcement authority. I know that some balanced budget amendment proponents argue that the Congress can step in at a later date to address this problem. But constitutional scholars disagree. Cass Sunstein, a well respected constitutional scholar at the University of Chicago, said: 
It is by no means clear that Congress can forbid judicial involvement by statute. Courts are quite reluctant to allow Congress to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims. 
This amendment also protects against Presidential impoundment power, which was soundly rejected in the 1970's. At that time President Nixon unilaterally impounded funds for programs he did not like. 
In 1974, we made those actions illegal, but unless we act again, the balanced budget constitutional amendment restores that authority to the President. The problem solved by this amendment is real. 
Proponents of the balanced budget constitutional amendment argue that there are few, if any, risks that the courts will micromanage the Federal budget. They say that article III of the Constitution is a bar to judicial intrusion. But if that is the case, why did 92 Members of the Senate support an amendment offered last year by Senator Nunn and Senator Conrad which limited judicial action unless specifically authorized by legislation? 
We all know that the risk of judicial intervention is very high, and article III does not afford protection. As Stuart Gerson, a former Justice Department official who testified before the Judiciary Committee in support of the balanced budget amendment, said: 
The `case or controversy' requirement of article III is the greatest bulwark against undue judicial intervention in budgetary matters, but it is not an impregnable barrier. 
The reality is that the balanced budget amendment is likely to produce numerous lawsuits in Federal and State courts. 
Neither article III doctrines, which are not applicable in State courts, nor practices of judicial deference will operate as automatic protections against the flood of litigation that could be brought by taxpayers and others. Such cases will force courts to act to analyze complicated economic questions and prescribe remedies. 
For example, can a State or Federal court enjoin Government spending if three-fifths of both Houses of Congress are unable to raise the debt limit? 
Could a court levy taxes to prevent an unauthorized deficit? 
Can a Member of Congress file suit because he or she disagrees about what constitutes a revenue increase and then argue that such an increase was not adopted by a constitutional majority? 
Could a criminal defendant file suit because he or she was charged under a law claimed to cost more to enforce than the Government can finance through expected proceeds? 
These questions and others regarding funding for Social Security, Medicare, education and the environment would rest in the hands of unelected judges and judicial intervention can easily disrupt Federal services that all Americans depend on. Citizens could find `closed' signs on Federal agencies, parks and museums because employees have been furloughed or hours opened to the public have been cut back. Our Republican friends in Congress closed down the Government in 1995. Surely they don't want a repetition of that experience at the hands of judges. 
Supporters of this amendment may believe these risks are unlikely, but we all know that deficits and lawsuits are not rare, and we have an obligation to tell the American people what will happen if the balanced budget constitutional amendment is not obeyed. 
The amendment also grants a great deal of power to the President. What is the President required to do if it becomes clear that outlays will exceed receipts and Congress has not authorized the deficit? 
Secretary Rubin, former Reagan Solicitor General Charles Fried, and former Attorney General Nick Katzenbach agree that the President would have the obligation to impound funds. Testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995, Solicitor General Walter Dellinger said that if the command for a balanced budget were about to be violated, he would advise the President that he not only had the right, but also the constitutional obligation, to step in and prevent the violation by impounding money before the budget became imbalanced. 
What does that mean to American families? It means that across-the-board cuts or specific cuts will reduce or eliminate Federal programs and that projects in particular States will be subject to cuts. This authority makes the line-item veto look mild 
by comparison. 
We all know that many Republicans want to slash Federal funds for education or even eliminate the Department of Education entirely. If the balanced budget constitutional amendment is enacted, there is nothing to prevent a President from using the excuse to balance the budget to unilaterally deny funds for education or even close the Department. 
The balanced budget constitutional amendment unnecessarily places a huge question mark in the Constitution. The deficit is going down, the economy is improving, President Clinton has put us on the road to a balanced budget by the year 2002. We don't need these serious enforcement problems under the balanced budget amendment, and I urge my colleagues to avoid them by supporting this amendment. 
Mr. President, as I mentioned just a moment ago, the last time we debated this amendment it was the judgment of this body to accept the Nunn-Conrad amendment, which would have provided a limitation on Federal court enforcement. Similarly, the Congress before that accepted a Danforth amendment that was related to the authority of the judiciary. On both of those occasions, it was the judgment of the U.S. Senate that this was a real issue, with the real potential of resulting in the kinds of situations that I have outlined briefly this afternoon. 
This body either intends that we permit the courts to make judgments about different programs, that we permit unelected judges to make judgments about matters dealing with the budget and dealing with the expenditures of resources--judgments the Constitution authorizes Congress to make--or it doesn't. Courts are there to interpret the law; Congress to make budget and resource allocation decisions. 
With this balanced budget constitutional amendment, we are providing an open door for courts not just to interpret the law, but use their power to preempt the power of the Congress of the United States in allocating resources. 
We are also giving that additional power to the executive branch in terms of impoundment. 
If it is the decision of the majority that that is not the case, then this amendment should be acceptable. But I ask my colleagues to review with me the statements of a number of those who have supported the balanced budget amendment. Many of those proponents specifically say they believe the courts will have enforcement authority, and it is one of their reasons for supporting the balanced budget amendment. We can go back and review the report of the Judiciary Committee, which gets into some considerable detail on that. 
If we are seriously interested in protecting Congress' constitutional duty to make judgments regarding the budget, then we ought to support this amendment and make it very, very clear. 
Finally, for those who have said, `We can address this issue at a later time with a statute,' we cannot rely on that because such a statute may very well be unconstitutional. 
So, if we are serious about ultimately preserving Congress' authority to make judgments regarding resource allocation, we ought to accept this amendment. 
If there is another intention, then it will be rejected. But the American people ought to understand the vast enhancement of authority and responsibility that we are giving to the President of the United States and to the courts of this country. They ought to understand that the President and unelected judges will be making judgments about the budget and taxes, not Congress. 
That, I think, is an issue that should not be left to general statements or comments on the floor of the U.S. Senate. In the past, this body has been willing to define those powers, and we should not abdicate that responsibility today. I urge my colleagues to accept this amendment. 
Mr. President, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as pointed out by the Senators from Illinois and Wisconsin, those who are opposing the amendment on the floor today and those who have opposed addressing this issue in the Judiciary Committee agree with what the principal sponsor, Senator Hatch, has said--he wants silence on this issue--silence on the issue. 
We have a great deal at risk by not accepting this amendment. So why not accept it. The amendment is quite clear in its objective--if we are going to be required to enforce the amendment, it ought to be the Congress who enforces it, not the President of the United States or the courts. They should not have the ability to raise or lower taxes or to cut various kinds of programs. That is what this issue is all about. That is why, as the Senator from Illinois has pointed out, it was addressed by Republicans and Democrats previously. 
All we are saying is we are not prepared to make that judgment here this afternoon. But we are presenting an amendment which will permit the Congress to make a judgment as to what those powers would be down the road, in the future. It is amazing to me to hear resistance to that argument. 
The idea that this is really a moot issue and moot question just defies testimony by those who are both supportive of the balanced budget amendment and those who are against the amendment. One of the most compelling cases was made by one of our leading constitutional authorities, Kathleen Sullivan, and supported by a broad range of different constitutional scholars, both conservative and Democrat alike. I will refer to some parts of the letter. I will include the whole letter in the Record. 
First, taxpayers might claim that their rights to a balanced budget are violated, for example, by projections that outlays will exceed receipts. True, taxpayers are generally barred from suing the government for the redress of generalized grievances. But the Supreme Court a quarter of a century ago held that there is an exception to the general bar on taxpayer standing when the taxpayer claims that a government action `exceeds specific constitutional limitations imposed upon the exercise of the congressional taxing and spending power.' 
Mr. Barr suggests that this exception may be limited to Establishment Clause challenges, but there is nothing in the principle stated in Flast that so confines it. If anything, the proposed Balanced Budget Amendment more clearly limits congressional taxing and spending power than does the Establishment Clause. * * * * * 
Second, members of Congress might well have standing to claim that congressional actions have diluted the vote they were entitled to exercise under the Amendment. For example, suppose that the Congress declined to hold a three-fifths vote required to approve deficit spending under section 1, or a rollcall vote required to increase revenue under section 4. This might occur, for example, because of a dispute over whether outlays really exceeded receipts, or over whether revenue was really being increased, because the meaning of those terms might be controversial as a matter of fact. Declining to implement the supermajority voting requirements in such a context, however, might be plausibly claimed to have diluted a Member's vote. This is arguably analagous to other circumstances of vote dilution in which the lower courts have held that Members of Congress have standing. 
Third, persons aggrieved by actions taken by the government in claimed violation of the Amendment might well have standing to challenge the violation. 
And it gives further examples of it.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is a very well-thought-out analysis about the role of standing. It is very clear. And, I believe, to cavalierly dismiss the fact there would be standing for challenge by outside forces does not represent the vast majority of legal opinion, both from those who support the amendment and those who are opposed to it. 
Mr. President, I yield myself 4 more minutes. 
Furthermore, the President is obligated to faithfully execute the laws and defend the Constitution. That duty is not limited to the enforcement of acts of Congress. It includes obligations derived from the Constitution. Thus, if the President believed the balanced budget constitutional amendment was about to be violated, he would be duty bound to prevent the violation. After all, what happens when it becomes clear that outlays will exceed receipts for the fiscal year and Congress has not specifically authorized the deficit? Many, including Secretary Rubin, former Reagan administration Solicitor General Charles Fried, former Attorney General Nick Katzenbach, and Harvard Law School Prof. Laurence Tribe, believe the President would be obligated to take the dramatic step of impounding funds to comply with the Constitution. As then-Assistant Attorney General Walter Dellinger suggested in 1995: If it appears the requirement for a balanced budget was about to be violated, he would advise the President not only that he had the right but the obligation to step in and prevent the violation by impounding money before the budget became imbalanced. 
Those are basically the facts. There is every indication there would be standing, both by citizens and others who wanted to challenge this; that the President would be required, after taking the oath of office, to uphold the Constitution, to impound funds. I do not want to see the seizing of Social Security checks by the Congress, duly elected, but at least we are accountable to people. But to say we are going to leave that to the courts or to the 50 courts--50 courts, as was talked about previously by the Senator from Arizona--we are going to give that to the President of the United States, or to the courts--I find enormously troublesome. 
But, no, no, those who oppose this amendment say the amendment is going to be silent on this issue. I don't think it should be silent. I think the ultimate decision, in terms of budget cutting, should ultimately rest here, specifically in the Congress of the United States unless we are going to make a judgment that the courts should have some kind of a responsibility. That is all this amendment does. 
It comes back to who is going to implement this. I do not believe we should grant that authority to judges who are not accountable to the American people, or to a President of the United States who may impound funds, but it should rest here in the Congress of the United States. That is all this amendment does. Those who support it say we ought to be silent. We say, as other Congresses have said, that we ought to be able to make a conscious decision about the enforcement of this amendment. I do not want unelected judges and the President making that decision. I believe Congress should. 
I retain the remainder of my time.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with all due respect to my friend and colleague, 92 Members of the U.S. Senate felt this was an issue that should be addressed in the last Congress, and a Republican, Senator Danforth, thought it should have been addressed in the Congress before that. 
Now, if the Senator wants to say that under no circumstances are the judges going to be involved and under no circumstances will the President have impoundment, then accept the amendment. 
But you cannot have it both ways. 
Other Congresses--the previous Congress and the one before it, under Republicans and Democrats--overwhelmingly understood this issue, as leading conservative constitutional authorities do, as the 128 organizations that represent working families, children's organizations, those that have Social Security and senior citizens do. 
Mr. President, that is the issue. Who is going to make the ultimate judgment if this amendment is accepted? We believe it should be the Congress, not leave it to unelected judges to permit the President to impound it. That is the simple and fundamental issue. I hope the amendment is successful.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is a matter of importance to my State. Senator Kerry and I are offering legislation to prevent a serious injustice in the Federal Government. Congressman John Olver is introducing identical legislation in the House of Representatives. 
This issue has come to our attention in the context of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing contract for U.S. currency paper production, but it could arise in other contexts that would pose similar inequities. 
A respected and longstanding family-owned business in Dalton, MA, Crane and Company, has supplied currency paper for the Treasury for the past 117 years. Crane has been a trusted supplier to the Federal Government, providing high-quality products on a timely basis. It has negotiated reasonable terms with the Government, keeping its price increases below the rate of inflation, and has made substantial investments over the years to ensure the sophisticated equipment needed to produce the currency, including the special security features now built into the paper itself. 
This year, however, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing has proposed to go to extraordinary lengths to create alternative sources for the currency paper production. The Bureau has proposed subsidies to other companies to help them become competitive and buy the state-of-the-art equipment that Crane bought on its own. 
This is not fair competition. It is a misguided policy that will give other companies an unfair advantage and create an unlevel playing field. 
Our legislation is straightforward. It amends section 303 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to prohibit nondefense agencies in the executive branch from financing equipment or facilities to help a contractor compete against an existing contractor in Federal procurement. 
With all the pressures of the deficit, we should not be spending taxpayers' money on this sort of sham competition. It is unfair to leading-edge firms like Crane that invested their own resources to obtain Government contracts. It is hard to see how any taxpayers will benefit. Crane is in a class by itself. There is no suggestion of antitrust problems. Crane wins these contracts fair and square against potential competitors, and it should not have to compete with Uncle Sam. 
I urge the Congress to enact this legislation and prevent an extremely unfair and unwise policy from moving forward at the Treasury Department or at other Federal agencies.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for yielding this time, and I join with so many of our colleagues in the Senate, hopefully on both sides of the aisle, as well as our senior citizens all over this country in commending him for the leadership he has provided on this extremely important amendment. 
I had the chance to offer a similar amendment in the Judiciary Committee's markup, and we debated some of these issues. But I think the eloquence and the force and the presentation that has been made by the Senator from Nevada has been extraordinarily powerful and increasingly appreciated and understood by the American people, and we thank him for his leadership on this issue and so many others. 
Mr. President, Social Security is America's time-honored commitment to senior citizens that we will care for them in their golden years. It says to every citizen that if you work hard and pay into Social Security throughout your working life, Social Security will be there for you when you retire. It will help you pay the rent, buy the groceries, and maintain a reasonable standard of life throughout your retirement years. 
Social Security is the most successful social program ever enacted. It is among the most solemn obligations that any government can make to its citizens, and Congress should honor it and not undermine it. 
The proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment puts the Social Security contract with senior citizens in danger. If this amendment is added to the Constitution, no one can guarantee you a Social Security check every month. The Rock of Gibraltar, on which this Nation's senior citizens have depended for over 60 years, would be gone, replaced by shifting political sands. The Reid amendment prevents this unacceptable change by protecting Social Security from the proposed constitutional amendment--no ifs, ands, or buts. 
Millions of retired citizens live from Social Security check to Social Security check. They need it to arrive on time at the beginning of each month to pay their bills. Martha McSteen, who headed the Social Security Administration during the Reagan administration and is now president of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, said recently:  
Keeping Social Security safe from budget tampering is, frankly, a matter of life and death for millions of Americans. 
For 10 million Social Security beneficiaries age 65 and older, their monthly Social Security check amounts to 90 percent or more of their income. Those checks keep 40 percent of America's seniors out of poverty. 
But under the proposed constitutional amendment, if Government revenues fall unexpectedly, or if Government expenses go up, payment on Social Security checks could stop. 
Republicans say, `Trust us.' We reply, in the well-known words of President Ronald Reagan, `Trust--but verify,' and the way to verify is by adopting the Reid amendment. 
Just 3 months ago, in November 1996, the House sponsors of the balanced budget constitutional amendment agreed that Social 
Security could be in trouble. As Congressmen Schaefer and Charles Stenholm said: 
Under the proposed constitutional amendment, `The President would be bound at the point at which the Government runs out of money to stop issuing the checks.' 
Economists say there is at least a 50-50 chance in any given year that the budget projections will be wrong and that under this constitutional amendment, this Government will run out of money. Economic forecasting is not an exact science. If budget projections are off by as little as 1 percent, this constitutional amendment could put Social Security checks at risk. 
Some in this debate have said that the budget that President Clinton just submitted to Congress counts the Social Security surpluses reaching a balanced budget by the year 2002. They said if President Clinton counts Social Security in his budget, then why not count it in the balanced budget constitutional amendment? But the difference between a balanced budget, which we will achieve by 2002, and a permanent constitutional amendment are immense, especially for Social Security. 
In the Clinton budget, the laws protecting Social Security from the rest of the budget are still in place. There is nothing that President Clinton or any other President or Congress can do to jeopardize Social Security. Under the current law, President Clinton and future Presidents and Congresses must balance the budget without affecting Social Security. If they want to change Social Security, they have to change the Social Security law directly. The last thing we should do is change it indirectly by a vague constitutional amendment. 
In its present form, this balanced budget constitutional amendment undercuts Social Security. Social Security would have to fight its way on an equal basis with highway construction, defense, welfare, education, and every other Federal program. Congresses have worked for many years, ever since the Reagan administration first tried to cut Social Security, to protect the Nation's senior citizens and Social Security from the annual Federal budget wars. 
For 15 years, a solid bipartisan coalition of Republicans and Democrats have agreed that Social Security should be safe from that result. In 1983, the Greenspan commission recommended that Congress should place Social Security outside the Federal budget. The commission said that we need to build up a surplus in the trust funds now in order to have enough funds to provide benefits to the current generation when they begin to retire. Both Democrats and Republicans support that result. 
The commission's 1983 recommendations were enacted in a law sponsored by Senator Dole and Senator Moynihan, and their bill required Social Security to be placed off budget within 10 years. In 1985, 2 years later, Congress accelerated the process by placing Social Security outside the rest of the Federal budget. The Deficit Control Act of 1985, the so-called Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law, exempted Social Security from across-the-board cuts of sequestration. That law also said that Social Security could never be included in the unified budget of the U.S. Government. Senator Gramm emphasized during the Senate debate on the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings proposal, `This bill takes Social Security off budget. So if you want to debate Social Security, go to the museum, because that debate is over. The President cannot submit a budget that says anything about Social Security. It is not in order for the Budget Committee to bring a budget to the floor that does anything to Social Security. Social Security is off budget and is a freestanding trust fund.' 
From that point out, when Congress has adopted the annual Federal budget resolutions, Social Security is not included. The last time Congress voted on a budget that included Social Security was 1985. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law was approved by overwhelming majorities, 61-31 in the Senate and a 271 to 154 vote in the House of Representatives. 
Then in 1990 some Members of Congress proposed to put Social Security back in the Federal budget, but Senator Hollings and Senator Heinz rejected this unwise suggestion. They insisted that Social Security remain off budget and the Senate approved an amendment to protect Social Security by a 98 to 2 vote. In fact, the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 speaks forcefully of Congress' intention to continue to protect Social Security. 
Section 13-301 of the act reads `Exclusion of Social Security from all budgets'--it says plainly that Social Security shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, receipts, deficits, or surplus for the purposes of the budget of the U.S. Government as submitted by the President, the congressional budget, or the balanced budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985. 
In 1995, section 22 of the congressional budget resolution amended the Budget Act even further to protect Social Security in a provision entitled the Social Security Firewall Point of Order. It said that any effort to include changes in Social Security in the Federal budget were subject to a 60-vote point of order in the Senate. The proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment would reverse these 15 years of steady progress in protecting Social Security. It would be turning its back on all of this history and expose Social Security to all the budget battles that lie ahead. 
Further, in a major recent study, the Congressional Research Service suggested that the proposed constitutional amendment may actually place the trust funds off limits. The funds will be sitting there and the Social Security Administration will need them to write Social Security checks, but if the balanced budget amendment is adopted the Constitution will say no. 
Here is what the Congressional Research Service concluded in its analysis for Senator Daschle on February 5: 
Because the balanced budget amendment requires that the required balance between outlays for that year and receipts for that year, the moneys that constitute the Social Security surpluses would not be available for the payment of the benefits. 
Therefore, the money that had been set aside, the time when more funds are being paid into the Social Security benefits, at the year 2019 when there will begin to be some deficit between the amounts paid in and the amounts that have to be paid out, what the Congressional Research Service is saying is you will not be able to use the surpluses that have been built in all of these next 20-odd years. We will have to only look at the year that the money comes in and that the money goes out. That is, I think, understandable when you look on page 2 of the amendment and under line 7, it says `total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed total receipts for that fiscal year.' Those are the operative words which led the Congressional Research Service to that conclusion which puts it in danger not only of the possibility for balancing the budget in terms of any period in the future but risks the surpluses that have been put in place over these next several years. 
Now, Republicans asked the Congressional Research Service to clarify its opinion. They hoped, if they asked again, they would get a different answer, but instead the Congressional Research Service reaffirmed the opinion of February 12 that Social Security is at risk under the proposed constitutional amendment. CRS said again that under the proposed constitutional amendment when Social Security payments are estimated to exceed Social Security receipts from payroll withholdings, which is expected to happen beginning in the year 2013, Social Security payments can be made from the trust funds only if spending for other programs is reduced by the same amount. In other words, for each dollar drawn down from the trust fund, a dollar must be cut from education or defense or some other Government program. 
Employees have worked hard all of their lives. Social Security has been withheld from their paycheck month after month. They are expecting the money to be available when they retire. But this proposed constitutional amendment suddenly freezes all that money that they had paid in over the years. When this happened, if Social Security is not off budget, we would have only three choices: We could cut Social Security benefits, we could raise taxes, or we can cut billions of dollars from education, health, national defense, other priorities, to keep the Social Security checks flowing. Clearly, Social Security benefits are at risk under the proposed constitutional amendment. 
Now, some supporters of the balanced budget constitutional amendment want this result. When the Judiciary Committee was debating this amendment on Social Security, my amendment on January 
30, Senator Hatch, the chair of the committee, said that under the constitutional amendment Social Security `would have to fight its way just like every other program.' Senator Hatch went on to say that he believed Social Security has the easiest of all arguments to fight its way. But half of the members of the Judiciary Committee rejected that position. I had offered the amendment to protect Social Security during the committee's markup of the proposal. The committee was evenly split on the issue, 9-9. So in the very committee that is responsible for this amendment, half the membership, half of the membership, believed that Social Security is at risk under the proposed constitutional amendment. 
Nothing in the proposed constitutional amendment, nothing, assures our senior citizens that their Social Security checks will survive the budget battles that lie ahead. Elderly Americans deserve more than expressions of good will by supporters of the constitutional amendment. If those who favor this unwise constitutional amendment are committed to protecting Social Security, they should write that protection in their proposal and adopt the Reid amendment. 
President Clinton wrote to the Senate Democratic leader on January 28 about the risk to Social Security, and said to Senator Daschle, `I am very concerned that Senate Joint Resolution 1, the constitutional amendment to the balanced budget, could pose grave risks to the Social Security system.' We cannot let that happen. I say we must--and we will, balance the budget. We must--and we will take steps to protect Social Security in the future. We should have that debate openly and honestly, but we should not jeopardize Social Security indirectly by subjecting it to the requirements of this blunderbuss constitutional amendment. I urge my colleagues to protect the Social Security by supporting the Reid amendment. 
Mr. President, basically, just to sum up where I believe we are, if we look at the record of the Congress since the recommendation of the Greenspan commission of 1983, Social Security amendments in 1983 to put Social Security in order, and the recommendation, the unanimous recommendation was that Social Security was to be considered off budget, 
and that the commission itself urged them to do that in the next 10 years. Those recommendations were adopted 58 to 14, with 32 Republicans and 26 Democrats. This was a bipartisan effort to protect the Social Security system. 
As I mentioned before, with Social Security, unlike other items in the Federal budget, people pay in in order to be able to receive later. I am a great supporter of education, but the students of this country have not paid in previously in order to receive either a grant or a loan. I am a great supporter of medical and biomedical research, but the researchers have not paid in in order to be able to receive funding. I am a great believer in child care, but the parents have not paid in so that they can receive money for child care. 
The one program people have paid into in order to receive is Social Security. That is why, Mr. President, we have the recommendations--unanimous recommendations--of the bipartisan commission, supported by the ranking member of the Finance Committee--by Republicans and Democrats alike--that said we should take the recommendations of the Greenspan commission and, within 10 years, adopt a proposal that would effectively put Social Security off budget. We didn't wait 10 years. We waited 2 years. There was Gramm-Rudman-Hollings in 1985, which was adopted by 61 to 31, with 39 Republicans and 22 Democrats supporting. This is what it said: `Exempt Programs, section 255. Social Security benefits shall be exempt from reduction under any order issued under this part.' This is in the Deficit Control Act. What they are saying is that we will not put at risk Social Security. And then a little later in that act, they pointed out that what we had was a sequestration, which meant there was going to be a reduction in various programs and done so on an across-the-board percentage. What happened in the Congress? What was accepted at that time? It said: `The Social Security benefits program shall be exempt from reduction under any order.' 
So it is saying doubly sure, don't include it, and if somehow it gets in, don't reduce it. This was the overwhelming position. Why? Because, as I stated earlier, it is the solemn pledge and commitment of the United States to our seniors, the lifeline for their lives, their well-being, their ability not to live in poverty, their ability to live with some degree of respect and dignity. These are men and women who have built this country, fought its wars and made it the great Nation that it is. 
Then we had the 1990 Budget Enforcement Act, another opportunity to deal with the issues in Social Security. If it was not clear enough previously under the existing amendments, which have been stated, we had an amendment offered by Senators Heinz and Hollings, adopted 98 to 2. `Exclusion of Social Security from all budgets.' There it is again. Recommended in 1983, enacted in 1985, clarified again in 1985 under the sequestration. If there is going to be any question about it, in 1990, here is the amendment, 98 to 2, Republicans and Democrats, to take it off budget. And then, in 1995, we have the firewalls, those walls to try to separate the various functions of Government as to what areas could be cut or shifted, in terms of budget allocations. It was very clear again in 1995--Social Security firewall point of order in the Senate. 
It points out, once again, `Not only is Social Security off budget, but any budget amendments affecting Social Security are subject to a point of order.' This is what they call the pay-go provisions. 
Once again, every indication, coming from 1983 all the way up to the present time, Republicans and Democrats alike, when it came to the issues of dealing with budgetary considerations and the challenges that we as a country were facing, said Social Security is different. Social Security is different. The reason that it is different is self-evident for, I think, every Member of this body. It is because it is different that we are going to treat it differently from other general budget expenditures. Sure, we are going to have belt-tightening in some areas that many of us would hope that we would not necessarily have. We will have differences on where we ought to tighten the budget. But Republicans and Democrats have repeated time after time after time after time that we were going to exclude this program and let it be considered on its own, in terms of a trust fund, because it isn't the Social Security trust fund that has brought us to the kinds of deficits we have had over any period of time, and it is not the fault of our senior citizens. 
I am not out here today to review what actions we took in 1981 that set us on a path toward the growth of the large deficits. We can debate that at another time. That is not relevant to this. What is relevant are the actions, in a bipartisan way, that have been taken at every single opportunity when this body has addressed the issues of budget. And now we are being asked in the most significant and important request of all to say that when it comes to a constitutional amendment, we are going to make sure that Social Security is going to be included. We are going to make sure it is going to be included. 
How do we know that? Because when we ask to take it out, we are told we can't take it out. The primary sponsors of this program have said that Social Security is going to have to fight it out with the other programs, is going to have to fight it out with education, fight it out with national security, fight it out with other kinds of priorities for the Nation. We have to ask ourselves--some of us have very recent memory when we saw the kinds of potential cuts that were being proposed in Social Security-related programs in the last Congress--cuts in the Medicare Program, not unrelated to Social Security, cuts in the program to pay for tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals. 
Are we going to say now that we are going to wrap this potential cut in Social Security in this constitutional amendment, and that somewhere down the road it may be used as a piggy bank for trading off other kinds of budgetary requirements? I say, no. We have a chance to prevent that. This body is either serious about what we have done over the last 15 years and what we have stated to be the position of this institution, in a bipartisan way, and say Social Security is out, or we are telling our senior citizens that Social Security is being put at risk. 
Now, Mr. President, we have to understand some other items. There are those who have said, well, if we pass the balanced budget, some of this legislation will still be out there, and it might provide some protection for Social Security. Well, they 
ought to read the Constitution one more time, because the Constitution is what controls statutes. It is the Constitution that is the law of the land. It is the Constitution that will be the driving factor and force on this particular issue, not what we have done in various statutes, not what we have done in budget orders, not actions that have been taken by other Congresses. It will be the Constitution. 
So what we are saying, Mr. President, is we are going to put at risk, if the Reid amendment is not accepted, the future in terms of Social Security. All of these actions and protections that have existed there, with strong, overwhelming bipartisan support, not just simple majority--98 to 2--all of that is gone with the wind, all of that is past, all of that is sand, all of those pillars of marble that are out there are now effectively dust, in terms of protection. 
Now, Mr. President, I know we will hear those who will say, well, the best we can do for our senior citizens is to have a sound economy. That is fine. We are going to work for a sound economy. But let's not put the senior citizens who have paid into this fund at risk in terms of their future and vital needs. This is a lifeline for our senior citizens. It is a fundamental and basic commitment that we have made over the more than 60 years it has been in effect. It has been reaffirmed and reaffirmed in this body. Without the Reid amendment, we are putting the Social Security system at serious and grave risk. That, I believe, is unwise, unjustified, and wrong. I hope the Reid amendment will be accepted. 
I thank the Senator from Nevada again, and I thank my friend from Utah for working out the schedule.  
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am introducing today the Health Insurance Bill of Rights Act to provide quality assurance and patient protection. Companion legislation is being introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman Dingell, Congressman Waxman, Congressman Cardin, and others. 
This legislation is a needed response to the surging growth of managed care and the rapid changes taking place in the health insurance market--changes that too often put insurance industry profits ahead of patients' health needs. 
Managed care has mushroomed over the past decade. In 1987, only 13 percent of privately insured Americans were enrolled in HMOs. Today, that figure is 75 percent. At its best, managed care offers the opportunity to achieve both greater efficiency and higher quality in health care. In too many cases, however, the pressure for profits leads to lesser care--not better care. Too many managed care firms and other insurance companies have decided that the shortest route to higher profits and a competitive edge is by denying patients the care they need and deserve. 
Some of the most flagrant abuses by insurance plans have been documented in recent months: 
Just last year Congress enacted legislation to block drive-by deliveries and prevent new mothers and their babies from being evicted from hospitals in less than 48 hours. 
Breast cancer patients are being forced to undergo mastectomies on an outpatient basis, when sound medical advice requires a reasonable hospital stay. 
Children are being permanently injured or even losing their lives because their parents are forced to drive past the nearest emergency room to a more distant hospital because it has the contract with their health plan. 
Doctors are being subjected to gag rules that keep them from giving their patients their best medical advice. 
People with rare and dangerous diseases are being denied access to specialists to treat their conditions. 
Patients can't get needed pharmaceutical drugs, because the particular drug they need is not on the list of drugs approved for coverage by their insurance plan; sometimes such lists are developed and administered by pharmaceutical companies 
bent on selling their own drugs and blocking competition. 
Patients are being misdiagnosed, sometimes with fatal results, because insurance plans cut corners on diagnostic tests. 
Victims of cancer and other serious diseases are being denied participation in quality clinical trials offering the only hope of cure for otherwise incurable conditions. 
Children afflicted with serious, chronic conditions are being denied access to the medical centers with the only available expertise to treat their conditions effectively. 
These abuses are not typical of most insurance companies. But they are common enough that an overwhelming 80 percent of Americans now believe that their quality of care is often compromised by their insurance plan to save money. It is time to deal with these festering problems. Good business practices can improve health care, but health care must be more than just another business. 
The legislation we are introducing today establishes basic standards for insurance plans in six specific areas: 
First, access to care, including specialty care, emergency care, and clinical trials. 
Second, standards for quality of care. 
Third, information that must be available to patients. 
Fourth, expeditious and fair appeal procedures when physicians or patients disagree with plan decisions. 
Fifth, protection of the doctor-patient relationship, by banning gag rules and objectionable compensation arrangements. 
Sixth, a requirement that plan guidelines may not override good medical practice. 
These steps will not eliminate every abuse that occurs in the insurance industry, but they will go a long way to addressing the major problems patients confront. 
At the most basic level, the legislation establishes a right to needed care. A patient facing a health emergency should not be required to go to a distant emergency room, or to obtain prior authorization for care. Someone suffering from a serious condition requiring specialty care should not be denied that care because an insurance company thinks it is too expensive. Someone with a condition that cannot be addressed by conventional therapies should have a reasonable opportunity to participate in a quality clinical trial that offers the hope of effective treatment. Plans should set up clear, fair, and timely appeal procedures for cases in which the plan fails 
to fulfill its obligations. 
Historically, patients have relied on their personal physician to be the best source of impartial advice on needed care. This legislation maintains that critical role by prohibiting plans from restricting doctor-patient communications or from establishing compensation plans that bribe or penalize doctors into representing the plan's interest at the expense of their patients' health. 
To maintain and improve quality of care, all managed care plans will be required to set up a separate unit dedicated to quality, and to collect data to verify that the plan, in fact, is providing care that meets objective quality standards. 
Patients will be guaranteed full information about plan coverage, appeal rights, access to primary care doctors and other specialists, and other needed information. Plans will be required to collect and make available standardized data for consumers to compare plans. 
These provisions add up to a health insurance bill of rights that will protect millions of Americans. 
I look forward to working with a broad range of physician, patient, and industry groups as Congress considers this legislation. Action is essential and overdue to provide these needed protections. The bottom line in health care must be patient needs, not industry profits. Concerned citizens in all parts of the country are demanding action, and Congress owes them a response.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator Kerry and I are offering legislation today to present a serious injustice in Federal procurement. Congressman John Olver is introducing identical legislation in the House of Representatives. This issue has come to our attention in the context of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing's contract for U.S. currency paper production, but it could arise in other contexts that would pose similar inequities. 
A respected, long-standing family-owned business in Dalton, MA, Crane and Company, has supplied currency paper for the Treasury for the past 117 years. Crane has been a trusted supplier to the Federal Government, providing high quality products on a timely basis. It has negotiated reasonable terms with the Government, keeping its price increases below the rate of inflation. And it has made substantial investments over the years to ensure that it has the sophisticated equipment needed to produce the currency, including the special security features now built into the paper itself. 
This year, however, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing has proposed to go to extraordinary lengths to create alternate sources for currency paper production. The Bureau has proposed subsidies to other companies to help them become competitive and buy the state-of-the-art equipment that Crane bought on its own. This is not fair competition. It's a misguided policy that will give other companies an unfair advantage and create an unlevel playing field. 
Our legislation is straightforward. It amends section 303 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 to prohibit nondefense agencies in the executive branch from financing equipment or facilities to help a contractor compete against an existing contractor in Federal procurement. With all the pressures of the deficit, we should not be spending taxpayer money on this sort of sham competition. It's unfair to leading-edge firms like Crane that have invested their own resources to obtain Government contracts, and it's hard to see how any taxpayers will benefit. Crane is in a class by itself. There is no suggestion of antitrust problems. Crane wins these contracts fair and square against potential competitors, and it should not have to compete with Uncle Sam. 
I urge the Congress to enact this legislation and prevent an extremely unfair and unwise policy from moving forward at the Treasury Department or other Federal agencies.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Mack, Senator Moynihan, Senator D'Amato, and myself, I am proud to submit a Senate resolution designating the month of March each year as `Irish-American Heritage Month.' 
Since 1621, when the first Irish settlers arrived on our shores, Americans of Irish descent have made invaluable contributions to all aspects of American life. Between 1840 and 1910, more than 3 million Irish immigrants reached our shores and contributed immensely to the development of our country. 
In fact, this year marks the 150th anniversary of the Great Famine in Ireland that led to one of the most tragic migrations in history. The potato crop failed, and hundreds of thousands fled in desperation to the New World. They found hope and opportunity and new lives in America. They powered our industrial revolution. They took jobs as laborers. They dug the canals. They built the railroads that took America to the West. Even today, it is said that under every railroad tie, an Irishman is buried. In a very real sense, their greatest legacy is our modern nation. 
Today, over 44 million Americans are of Irish descent. They are proud of America and proud of their Irish heritage, and it is a privilege to introduce this legislation designating the month of March in the years ahead as `Irish-American Heritage Month.'

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know there are others who want to speak on the resolution. But at the outset of this discussion, I want to pay tribute to Senator Leahy and Senator Snowe for their bipartisan leadership on this issue. I think that working together bodes well not only for this issue but for other matters that will come before the Senate. I congratulate them for their leadership on this important resolution, which affects millions of families around the world--people whose names we will never know, as they will not know ours. Nonetheless, with the release of these resources, which we expect as a result of this vote, lives will be enhanced. 
I just want to again underline what Senator Leahy and Senator Snowe mentioned about what this bill is and is not. This is not legislation to promote abortion. They have laid out very clearly that this is about providing resources that will be used to support family planning and avoid unwanted pregnancies and subsequent abortions. That case has been made by Senator Leahy, Senator Snowe, and our former colleague Senator Mark Hatfield, who is a strong opponent of abortion. Senator Hatfield rejected the argument that family planning is a back-door means of supporting abortion services. He reviewed the alleged evidence that family planning funds were being used to provide abortions and, in a letter to Representative Chris Smith, said, `I do not see anything in these materials to back up your assertion that U.S. funds are being spent on abortion.' 
This is not only the understanding of those of us here today but also the clear understanding of the President. I think those that support this action have been justified in challenging those that are opposed to it to produce information or evidence to the contrary. 
As President Clinton has said very clearly, `The United States provides family planning support where it is wanted and needed. We are prohibited from law from ever funding abortion--and we abide faithfully by that law. Indeed, the work we have funded in developing countries has been supportive of families, helping them to flourish.' 
One of the extraordinary examples of this work is the lifesaving efforts of CARE. In many different parts of the world I have had the opportunity to see the extraordinary work of many nongovernmental organizations, and I have enormous respect for the dedication of the men and women who are so selfless in volunteering for these organizations. 
All we have to do is read the newspapers of the past weeks and months to recognize the enormous threat to their lives. Red Cross and other NGO workers in Chechnya, Uganda, Rwanda, and other parts of the world have actually lost their lives because of their work. 
CARE, long respected for its efforts to meet the basic health needs of poor families around the world, has used U.S. funds to enhance the lives of large numbers of women and children. 
In Uganda, over the last 4 years, CARE has trained over 1,000 community-based health workers, launched family planning services in 71 clinics, and increased the number of couples using contraception from 1 percent to 10 percent. But, that project in Uganda--as well as projects in Bangladesh, Niger, and Togo--will be shut down if these United States funds are not forthcoming. 
That is the story all across the Third World. Without U.S. aid, millions of people would not have access to gynecological examinations, postnatal care, and family planning services. The funds appropriated by Congress decrease the instances of female genital mutilation and prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV and AIDS. 
So, for all of these reasons, Mr. President, this is an extremely important vote. It is really about children, and it is about struggling families in foreign and distant parts of the world that are trying to take care of their families and ensure a future with a greater sense of hope and health. It is really about life--not about other factors. That is the underlying purpose of this bill. That is what the record has demonstrated. 
That is why I think this vote is so important, and why I commend the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Maine for their leadership. 
Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.

Mr. KENNEDY. The Social Security program is America's time-honored commitment to our senior citizens that we will care for them in their golden years. It says to our seniors that you have worked hard and faithfully paid into Social Security for all those years of labor, and when you finally retire, Social Security will be there for you. It will help you pay the rent, buy your groceries, and maintain a reasonable standard of living throughout your retirement. 
But under the proposed balanced budget constitutional amendment, the Social Security contract with America's senior citizens is broken. If this amendment is added to our Constitution, then no one can assure you of a Social Security check every month. 
The Rock of Gibraltar, on which our Nation's senior citizens have depended for the past 62 years would be reduced to shifting sand. 
The Reid amendment, which will be considered later this month, prevents this unacceptable outcome by protecting Social Security from the proposed constitutional amendment. 
The Reid amendment is needed because millions of the Nation's retired citizens live from check to check. They need that check to arrive on time at the beginning of each month to pay their bills. 
Martha McSteen, who headed the Social Security Administration during the Reagan administration, and now is president of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, said recently, 
Keeping Social Security safe from budget tampering is frankly a matter of life and death for millions of Americans. For 10 million Social Security beneficiaries age 65 and older, their monthly Social Security check amounts to 90 percent or more of their income. Those checks keep 40 percent of America's seniors out of poverty. 
But under the proposed constitutional amendment, if Government revenues fall unexpectedly or Government expenses go up, payment on Social Security checks could stop. 
If the balanced budget constitutional amendment is enacted, senior citizens may well find that the check is not in the mail after all. 
Three months ago, in November 1996, the House sponsors of the balanced budget constitutional amendment agreed that this could happen. As Congressman Dan Schaefer and Congressman Charles Stenholm said, under the proposed constitutional amendment `the President would be bound, at the point at which the Government runs out of money, to stop issuing checks.' 
And now we learned just this week that this unwise constitutional amendment could deny the Social Security program access to the trust funds in the future. American workers have contributed their payroll taxes to build up the trust so that when the baby boomers retire, there will be enough money there to pay for their Social Security. But now we learn from the experts in the Congressional Research Service that the proposed constitutional amendment could place the trust fund off limits. The money will be sitting there, and the Social Security program will need it to write Social Security checks. But if the balanced budget amendment is adopted, the Constitution will just say no. 
Here is what the Congressional Research Service concluded in an analysis provided to Senator Daschle on February 5:  
Because the balanced budget amendment requires that the required balance be between outlays for that year and receipts for that year, the moneys that constitute the Social Security surpluses would not be available for the payments of benefits. 
Clearly, Social Security benefits are at risk under the proposed constitutional amendment. 
There are those on the other side who don't want America's seniors to know that this proposed constitutional amendment puts Social Security on the budget chopping block. They say that our concern about Social Security is a scare tactic. 
But economists say there is a 50-50 chance in any given year that the budget projections will be wrong and that under this constitutional amendment, the Government will run out of money. Economic forecasting is not an exact science. The projections of budget experts could be off by only 1 percent. But under this constitutional amendment, that is enough to throw the budget out of balance and put Social Security checks at risk. 
Senator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, agrees. When the committee was debating this constitutional amendment on January 30, he said that under the proposed constitutional amendment, `Social Security would have to fight its way, just like every other program.' 
Senator Hatch went on to say that he believes Social Security `has the easiest of all arguments to fight its way.' 
I don't believe we should take that gamble when the future of the Social Security program is at stake. 
There is nothing--nothing--to assure our seniors that their Social Security checks will survive the budget battles that lie ahead. 
Senior citizens deserve more than speeches of good will by supporters of the constitutional amendment. If those who support this unwise constitutional amendment are committed to protecting Social Security, they should write that protection into their proposal and adopt the Reid amendment. 
President Clinton wrote to the Senate Democratic leader on January 28 about the risk to Social Security. He said to Senator Daschle: 
I am very concerned that Senate Joint Resolution 1, the constitutional amendment to balance the budget, could pose grave risks to the Social Security System. In the event of an impasse in which the budget requirements can neither be waived nor met, disbursements or unelected judges could reduce benefits to comply with this constitutional mandate. No subsequent implementing legislation could protect Social Security with certainty because a constitutional amendment overrides statutory law. 
In the State of the Union Address, President Clinton added: 
I believe it is both unnecessary and unwise to adopt a balanced budget amendment that could cripple our country in time of economic crisis and force unwanted results such as judges halting Social Security checks or increasing taxes. 
But supporters of the balanced budget amendment are ready to cast Social Security to the winds. They say to the Nation's senior citizens, `We are going to toss your retirement, your safety net into the rough seas of Federal budgeting and see if it can stay afloat.' 
We cannot let that happen. 
The balanced budget constitutional amendment turns its back on almost a decade and a half of bipartisan progress in protecting Social Security. 
In 1983, the Greenspan Commission recommended that we should place Social Security outside the Federal budget. The Commission said we need to build up a sufficient surplus in the trust funds to have enough money to provide checks to baby boomers when they begin to retire. And we can't do that if Social Security is subjected to the same ups and downs as the rest of the Federal budget. 
Both Democrats and Republicans supported this proposal. The Commission's recommendations were introduced as bill S. 1 sponsored by Senator Dole and Senator Moynihan. That bill required Social Security to be placed off-budget within 10 years. A bipartisan 58-to-14 vote, including 32 Republicans and 26 Democrats adopted the conference report. 
In 1985, Congress accelerated the process of placing Social Security outside the rest of the Federal budget. The Deficit Control Act of 1985--the so-called Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law--exempted Social Security from across-the-board cuts or sequestration. 
Even more important, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law said Social Security could no longer be included in the unified budget of the U.S. Government. 
As Senator Gramm of Texas emphasized during the Senate debate on the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings proposal: 
This bill takes Social Security off budget. So if you want to debate Social Security, go to the museum, because that debate is over. . . . The President cannot submit a budget that says anything about Social Security. It is not in order for the Budget Committee to bring a budget to the floor that does anything to Social Security. Social Security is off-budget and is a free-standing trust fund. 
From that point on, when Congress has adopted the annual Federal budget resolutions, Social Security is not included. The last time the Congress of the United States voted on a budget that included Social Security was 1985. 
Congress supported this change by wide bipartisan majorities. The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law was approved by a 61-31 vote in the Senate and a 271 to 154 vote in the House of Representatives. 
In 1990, some Members of Congress proposed to put Social Security back into the Federal budget. But Senator Hollings and Senator Heinz rejected this unwise suggestion. They insisted that Social Security remain off budget, and the Senate approved an amendment to protect Social Security by a 98 to 2 vote. In fact, the final Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 speaks forcefully of Congress's intentions to continue to protect Social Security. In section 13301 of that act, the title reads, `Exclusion of Social Security From All Budgets.' It says plainly that Social Security, 
. . . shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of--

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was shocked and deeply saddened by Pamela Harriman's death last week in Paris. All of us in the Kennedy family cherished her friendship, and we will always have many warm memories of her close ties to our family. 
In a very real sense, throughout the Reagan and Bush years, she was the First Lady of the Democratic Party. I especially admired her leadership, her extraordinary ability, and her abiding commitment to the best ideals of public service. 
Pamela's friendship with the Kennedy family goes back more than half a century. It began in the difficult days of World War II in England during my father's service as Ambassador in London. Pamela became an especially close friend of my older sister Kathleen, and her friendship with our family continued ever since. 
Her marriage to Averell Harriman in 1971 brought us even closer. Averell had been a great friend and key adviser to President Kennedy on foreign policy, and his wise counsel had been instrumental in the passage of the Limited Test Ban Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union. 
In one of her most extraordinary accomplishments, Pamela became one of the pillars of the Democratic Party during the 1980's. She never lost faith in the enduring principles of our party. She held those ideals high, and she inspired legions of others to do so as well. Her leadership was especially effective in revitalizing our party in all parts of the country during the Reagan and Bush years, and President Clinton's dramatic victory in 1992 was her victory too. 
Pamela's unique qualities of leadership and ability earned her great additional renown during her recent service as Ambassador to France. On a host of challenging issues ranging from the war in Bosnia to disagreements over NATO and international trade, she served with her trademark combination of skill, grace, and sensitivity that made her so respected and beloved by all who knew her and by the entire diplomatic community. 
All of us in the Kennedy family admired her leadership and her statesmanship, but most of all, we were grateful for her friendship. The Nation has lost a truly remarkable public servant, and we will miss her very much.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in paying well-deserved tribute to Proctor Jones, who is leaving the Senate to continue working with our distinguished former colleague from Louisiana, Senator Bennett Johnston. Like Senator Johnston, Proctor will be greatly missed in the Senate. 
Proctor Jones has been an outstanding staff member who has served the Senate and the American people well for almost four decades. With his vast experience on appropriations issues and his skill at weighing complex priorities, Proctor has earned the respect of the entire Senate over the years. He has also earned the deep appreciation of other staff members for his signature style--unerring graciousness and pleasantness, even under intense pressure. Proctor represents the best of Senate civility, and he will be long remembered by all of us. 
It has been my particular pleasure to work closely with Proctor on a number of projects in Massachusetts which have been conducted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and which have significantly improved public safety, the environments, and the economy of our State. I am grateful for Proctor's leadership on these issues and many others. He represents the best in public service, and I wish him well in the years ahead.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment offered by Senator Durbin to protect jobs for working families. Without it, millions of Americans may well lose their livelihood if adequate steps are not taken to prevent real damage to the economy from the proposed constitutional amendment. 
Proponents of the balanced budget constitutional amendment claim that it will help American families. They predict dire consequences without a constitutional requirement to force a balanced budget. But, we know better. President Clinton's budget gets us to balance by 2002, and American families don't need or want to lock themselves into a budgetary straightjacket. 
Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin and over 1,000 economists have told Congress that the balanced budget constitutional amendment is a mistake. Because the amendment turns off the economy's automatic stabilizers, `it could turn slowdowns into recessions, and recessions into more severe recessions or even depressions,' according to Secretary Rubin. 
Without the automatic stabilizers, the Treasury Department estimates that the 1990 recession might have led to 9 percent unemployment--instead of 7.7 percent. That would have cost the country over 1 million additional jobs. 
The fundamental problem with the amendment is that it requires a balanced budget even in times of recession. The depression of the 1930's was made far worse because Congress repeatedly cut Federal spending and raised taxes trying to keep the budget in balance. This amendment could easily condemn us to repeat that unacceptable history. 
Surely, we can't ignore the views of over 1,000 economists who agree that this amendment mandates `perverse actions in the face of recessions.' The last time we failed to heed the warnings of the Nation's economists, at the beginning of the 1980's, the deficit skyrocketed and hundreds of thousands of Americans lost their jobs. 
Of course, supporters of the amendment say this will never happen. They tell us that if an economic depression is on the horizon, the proposed constitutional amendment allows Congress to waive the balanced budget requirement with a three-fifths vote. But it is reckless for Congress to gamble in this way with the economy. 
The Durbin amendment is needed to avert these serious threats to the economy and to American families. Under the Durbin amendment, a constitutional majority could waive the balanced budget amendment's requirements if there is an economic recession or serious economic emergency in the country. 
The amendment protects the country during times of military emergency, and it should also protect families during an economic emergency. I urge my colleagues to support the Durbin amendment. 
Finally, I want to ask the Senator a question, if I might. 
I have listened with great interest to the Senator's explanation. I find it enormously powerful and extremely compelling. After listening to the interpretation of both the balanced budget amendment and the Senator's anti-recession amendment, one has to draw the conclusion that on the one hand Americans who have great wealth will not be significantly impacted by the implementation of the balanced budget amendment during a recession. 
The very wealthy do not rely on the kinds of programs that you have mentioned. So their lives will not be adversely affected if this measure is actually put in the Constitution. 
On the other hand, as the Senator has pointed out, working families, children of working families, and parents of working families have the greatest risk under this amendment. If I understand the position of the Senator from Illinois, it will be the sons and daughters of working families that will suffer because Pell grants will be cut. It will be the children in Head Start--children of working families--that will have their education put at risk. It will be mothers and fathers of working families who will not receive assistance from job training or job dislocation programs during times of economic calamities. It will be their parents, those who have toiled in the factories, served in the Armed Forces, lifted this country out of depressions, and been the backbone of this Nation, whose Social Security and Medicare checks are put at risk. 
I wonder whether the Senator's arguments reach this issue of unfairness inherent to the balanced budget amendment. Because, it seems to me that one group of Americans, those hard-working Americans, have the most to risk. And those that are the wealthiest individuals or the most successful corporations have the least to risk. I wonder whether the Senator agrees with that observation. 
Second, if the Senator believes that is true, then what does he believe is the position of the organizations that represent working families. 
Where do the workers stand on this? Are they for this? Do they think that their futures are more secure by putting the balanced budget amendment in the Constitution? They say no. 
What about those groups that have fought for the rights of children, day in and day out, year in and year out, what is their position? Do they say yes? They say no. 
Do those groups that have been fighting to ensure decent health care for American seniors come to us and say, `This balanced budget amendment is in the best interest of our seniors,' or do they say, `Do not pass this measure, at least not without the Senator's amendment?' 
I am just interested if the conclusions that I draw from the Senator's excellent argument, particularly as it relates to the adverse impact economic downturns would have on hard-working Americans, is something that the Senator is very concerned about as well.

As he has pointed out, the economic issues and strength of our country is really the backbone for all of the hopes and dreams of working families. His amendment goes right to the core issue about what this impact would be at a time of economic cycles. I think anyone that understands the history of the economic strengths and weaknesses of our country would see that we should learn lessons from the historic past. 
Unfortunately, this amendment does not benefit from that kind of historical perspective, the underlying amendment. The Senator's amendment certainly does. I look forward to supporting the Senator's amendment. I thank him for bringing this matter to the attention of the Senate today.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont. Mr. President, I support a balanced budget, but I oppose this constitutional amendment. It is unnecessary, unwise, and untimely. At the very moment when Congress is about to balance the Federal budget the right way, our Republican friends are attempting to do it the wrong way, by writing an inflexible requirement into the Constitution. 
Tomorrow, President Clinton will give Congress an opportunity to approve a balanced budget that genuinely protects the priorities of American families on key issues, such as Social Security, Medicare, education, jobs, health care, and the environment, while achieving the goal of a balanced budget in the year 2002. That is what American families want and need, not a risky and unnecessary constitutional amendment that would jeopardize these priorities, hamstring the economy, and place a straitjacket in the Constitution. 
Our Republican friends refuse to admit the extraordinary progress we have already made under President Clinton to balance the budget. Twelve years of Reagan-Bush budgets tripled the national debt and quadrupled the deficit. But in 4 years under President Clinton's leadership, we have reduced the deficit by nearly two-thirds, and the goal of a balanced budget is clearly within our grasp. 
The proposed constitutional amendment has several fatal flaws. One of the most flagrant is the clear threat it poses to Social Security. Today, over 43 million senior citizens rely on Social Security as a lifeline, and millions more are counting on it for their future. Yet the balanced budget constitutional amendment does not protect Social Security--it endangers it. 
For over a decade, beginning with the Reagan administration when Social Security first came under heavy hostile fire from some members of the Republican Party, large bipartisan majorities in both the Senate and the House of Representatives have consistently dealt with that threat by providing clear protection for that basic program. Major legislation in 1983, 1985, and 1990 all protected Social Security by placing it outside the regular budget process. Yet this proposed constitutional amendment would undo all those protections, and put Social Security on the chopping block with all other programs. 
When we were considering the markup of the balanced budget amendment, I made this point. Those who took a different position said, `Well, Social Security will be protected in any event because of the existing statutes.' But what they fail to understand is that we are talking about a constitutional amendment that will override those particular statutes. Those statutes will be ineffective because of the new constitutional mandate. 
We will erode the protections afforded Social Security in the past. The protections recommended by the Social Security Commission in 1983, which were effectively adopted in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget statute and restated, with bipartisan support, in 1990. These are important pieces of legislation that clearly said that Social Security is different. 
Social Security is special. Social Security represents dollars paid in by workers with the clear understanding and effective guarantee that they will be paid back at retirement. Social Security is different, as all of us well understand, from other provisions of legislation--direct appropriations and the discretionary budget, which funds, for example, education programs, NIH, the military, and the entitlement programs, plus the interest on the debt. As much as I strongly support the commitments at NIH or the Pell Grant Program, citizens do not pay into those programs expecting to get something back in the future. 
That is why, Mr. President, it has been the time-honored position of this body--with bipartisan support--to place a firewall around Social Security. But not under the balanced budget amendment. It is right in there along with other programs, eligible for the chopping block. 
This proposal could easily force the Federal Government to stop making payments on Social Security checks. As House sponsors of the amendment have admitted, `The President would be bound, at the point at which the Government runs out of money, to stop issuing checks.' That would be a disaster for senior citizens on fixed incomes who count on Social Security to pay their rent, buy their food, or pay their heating bills. 
How can any senior citizen count on Republican pledges that say, `Trust us. We won't hurt Social Security'? Our answer is clear--stop dissembling about Social Security. Stop playing this phony shell game with Social Security. We all know how to protect Social Security--so I say, protect it. 
The second fatal flaw surrounding this amendment is the pretense of broad public approval. Proponents claim the amendment has widespread support among families in communities across the country. The polls seem--but only seem--to confirm that. A balanced budget constitutional amendment does have superficial appeal. It sounds good in a sound bite, but it can't survive serious debate. 
Families don't balance their budgets this way. If they did, they could never buy a home through a mortgage, or borrow money to send their children to college or to buy a car. 
That is the family budget. We hear, `Well, the families have to account for their funding.' They do, and we should. And we will under President Clinton's budget. But to say that the families of this country do not mortgage their homes and pay off the debt over a period of time or borrow to send their children to college or to buy a car is misstating and misrepresenting what is really happening on Main Street USA. 
Our Republican friends should not be lulled into a false sense of public support for this phony amendment. When families across America realize its flaws, this amendment will flunk the kitchen table test. 
The third fatal flaw in this amendment is its threat to the economy. Republicans tell us that this proposal is good for families. But over 1,000 economists, including 7 Nobel prize winners, have condemned the amendment as an unacceptable risk to the health of the economy. 
As Secretary of the Treasury Bob Rubin told the Senate Judiciary Committee, the amendment would `subject the Nation to unacceptable economic risks in perpetuity * * *. A balanced budget amendment could turn slowdowns into recessions, and recessions into more severe recessions or even depressions.' 
Mr. President, we have seen an expanding and growing economy in recent years. It has worked very well for an important percentage of the American people. It has not worked as well for all working families in this country. We acknowledge that. That is an area which I think we have to give greater focus and attention. But we do not have the dramatic swings that we experienced at other times in our economic history. Times that had a disastrous effect on working families--in particular, working families at the lower level of the economic ladder. So why are we putting them at risk with the balanced budget amendment? The wealthiest individuals are not going to be hurt if their Social Security check is cut or the Pell Grant program is reduced. Working families will be at risk. And the working poor have the most to lose because, if this country is put into a depression, they are the ones who will forfeit their jobs and the opportunity to provide for their families. 
This amendment could spell disaster for working families during times of recession. The amendment turns off the economy's automatic stabilizers. That could cause unemployment to rise dramatically. 
It is estimated that the unemployment rate in the 1992 recession would have risen to 9 percent, instead of 7.7 percent, and an additional 1 million Americans would have been thrown into the unemployment lines. What sense does it make to pass a fell-good constitutional amendment that could have harsh and extreme consequences like that? 
Proponents claim that Congress would act in time to avoid any economic emergency. Does anyone seriously believe that? Under the three-fifths rule in this amendment, a willful minority could hold the economy and the entire country hostage indefinitely. 
The House sponsors of the amendment have acknowledged this problem. They admit the amendment would have the effect of `lowering the blackmail threshold * * * from 50 percent plus one in either body to 40 percent plus one.' That is the height of irresponsible government. 
I say, let's work together, on both sides of the aisle, to pass an honest balanced budget that protects the Nation's priorities, protects the economy, and protects the Constitution too. Amending the Constitution is a transparent partisan political gimmick, and I'm convinced the people will see through it as this debate continues. 
Mr. President, I look forward later in this debate to have the chance to debate the issues on Social Security, the enforcement provision, how this measure would tend to force amendments, and we will work with the leadership, Senators Leahy and Hatch, to offer those amendments in a timely way to permit Members to engage in this debate. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support this sense-of-the-Senate resolution which calls for the National Cancer Institute to reissue guidelines for breast cancer screening for women between the ages of 40 and 50. Although an NIH advisory panel decided that women in their forties may not need mammograms, this finding continues to be a controversial one. Even though some studies have shown that mammography may not always be effective in detecting breast cancer, we can't ignore the importance of the early detection of this disease. Early detection and treatment will lead to reductions in breast cancer mortality. Failure to encourage breast cancer screening for women in their forties may well have disastrous results. 
The scientific literature is controversial. In this situation, it makes no sense to rescind the current mammography guidelines and standards. The evidence is far from conclusive that screening brings no positive effect for women in their forties. Further studies need to be conducted before our choice is made. We need to do all we can to encourage the early detection of breast cancer. I commend Senator Snowe and Senator Mikulski for their leadership, and I urge the Senate to pass this important resolution.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, before speaking on the issue of LIHEAP, I want to thank the chairman of our Human Resources Committee, Chairman Jeffords, and also the Senator from Tennessee, Senator Frist, for introducing the IDEA legislation today and to indicate this is one of the prime areas of priority for the Human Resources Committee. 
This issue, in terms of helping and assisting the special needs of children in education, is of incredible importance to millions of families all across this country, and we cannot afford to let the authorizing legislation expire. 
I join in commending the leadership that has been provided by Senator Frist in our last Congress, along with Senator Harkin, who has been our ranking member on the Subcommittee on Disability and who has made such a very important contribution on all of the issues relating to the disabled in this country over a very distinguished career, Senator Jeffords, and others on our committee. 
This has been a strong bipartisan effort. We welcome the opportunity to work very closely with them. This is not to minimize the issues that are outstanding, but it does represent a continuing commitment of those who support the legislation to try to continue the very important efforts that have marked this legislation and finding cooperation and finding ways to deal with some of the still outstanding issues. 
So I am very, very grateful for their statements on the floor today.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on the issue others have spoken to, I want to add my strong voice in hope and anticipation of the President's release of these emergency LIHEAP funds to help the families in the Northeast and Midwest. I think all of us have understood the extraordinary hardships and loss of lives that are affecting people in the Midwest, and people are hurting in my part of the country, in the Northeast, as well, with the soaring heating bills this winter. 
The reduced benefit levels and the skyrocketing prices of home heating oil have been a double whammy for the 5 million low-income families nationwide who receive LIHEAP assistance. 
Federal funding for LIHEAP is already near an all-time low--listen to this, Mr. President--down from $2.1 billion in 1985 to $1 billion today. In Massachusetts, Federal fuel aid has declined from $87 million to $41 million over that same period, about half of the resources in dollars. When you measure it out in terms of inflation, it is even less than that. When we see what has happened to the cost of home heating oil, we will see that people are in dire straits. 
Local fuel assistance directors have been successful in past years in stretching the limited LIHEAP funds to serve as many needy families as possible. This winter, however, low stocks have sent heating oil prices through the roof, causing excessive hardships to LIHEAP recipients across the Nation. 
According to the Massachusetts Division of Energy Resources, the cost of home heating oil has risen 20 percent, and, in some communities, considerably higher, from some 95 cents a gallon in December 1995, to over $1.15 today. Despite the oil companies' efforts to bring their inventories to last year's levels, heating oil prices still remain high because of increased world demand. 
This rise in heating oil prices has imposed a heavy burden on low-income families, many of whom must devote a significant portion of their limited resources to paying their energy bills. 
Who are these families, Mr. President? Forty-three percent of the recipients for the LIHEAP program are elderly or disabled citizens. They spend an average of 19 percent of their income to keep their homes warm in the winter, whereas middle-income families devote 4 percent. 
That is who we are talking about: elderly people, the neediest people who are living and affected by this colder climate, are spending way out of proportion of their income in order to just 
remain warm. 
The AFDC recipients spend as much as 25 percent of their income for home heating. At the same time, these families are hard pressed and struggle to pay their bills for food, rent, and health care. 
A decade ago, LIHEAP assistance could sustain a low-income family through an entire winter, purchasing as much as 750 gallons of heating oil. Today, the higher cost of heating oil and the lower benefit levels will only purchase a third of that amount. Some 10 years ago, there was the ability to address this issue for the neediest families for the winter and now a third of the winter, even with these resources that would be available. 
Many local fuel assistance directors are already planning for the worst. According to Jim Murphy, whose TRI-CAP Community Action Program serves 1,500 clients in Malden, MA, over 40 percent will be without any heating assistance at the end of next week unless emergency funds are provided. 
Other communities in Massachusetts are facing a similar crisis. In Boston, as many as 2,000 families, out of 13,000 served by LIHEAP, have run out of heating oil. An additional 4,500 households will be at risk in the next few weeks. We are talking the next 2 to 3 weeks. 
In economically distressed towns like Gloucester, many working families involved in the fishing industry have already exhausted their annual benefits. According to Eliott Jacobson, chairman of the New England Energy Directors Association, charities are being tapped for additional assistance 2 months ahead of schedule, taxing their limited resources to serve the community. 
Clearly, without an immediate release of emergency funds, little relief is in site for these families. If another cold spell strikes, even more families will be without protection. 
As we mentioned, 49 Senators wrote to the President last week requesting the release of the emergency LIHEAP funds before more cold weather grips the country. This year, $420 million in emergency funds could be made available at the President's discretion. The letter sent to the President Thursday requested $300 million of that amount. I hope all of my colleagues will support this necessary action and will support action by the President to respond to these very important and critical needs.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on another item, I want to draw the attention of the Senate to President Clinton's announcement today for making education a top priority in his balanced budget plan. The President has announced the proposal and recognizes the importance of investing in education as the cornerstone of a stronger future for the Nation. 
In the coming years, a college education will be more important than ever. We know that by the year 2005, 60 percent of all of the new jobs will require not only a high school education, but also skills in the utilization of computers. So the President's program is focused on a number of priority areas. I will introduce at the end of my statement a brief summary of those items, but I would like to just mention some of those which I think are most important. 
First of all, to try and assure working families in this country that not only high school will be available, but really the 13th and 14th grades, the first 2 years of college, would be available as well. That is being done in a number of ways: 
First, with a $10,000 deduction for the payments of tuition that will be available to working families and middle-income families, what they call the Hope Tax Credit, which will be a $1,500 credit for the sons and daughters who are going to college. 
This would amount to the payment in full of tuition for 67 percent of all the community colleges in the country; and then an expansion of the Pell grants by some $300 to a maximum of $3,000 for those individuals who are eligible for Pell grants. That is a very important and significant commitment. That will mean about 130,000 more students across this country will be able to take advantage of the Pell grants. 
Then there are the changes in the Pell grant provisions that will be primarily targeted upon older students, those who have been out in the work force and are coming back, those who are 24 or 25 years old or older. I do not know whether the distinguished Chair has had the kind of opportunity I have had to visit some of the community colleges in his own State as I have in Massachusetts. We find changes which are taking place where the makeup of the student body is considerably older. 
Changes in the Pell language are going to make available 218,000 additional slots for those individuals who are returning to college to upgrade their skills, which is very important. 
We also have a strong commitment in the areas of literacy. We will see an expansion of the Work-Study Program, which provides important opportunities for students to help work their way through college. It is an absolutely vital link to permit students to match together what they are able to earn in the summertime by working, with what they earn working under the Work-Study Programs. There is a strong commitment to fulfill the President's commitment to try to make sure that every third grader is able to read by the year 2000. It is an important program that really builds upon the successful programs of the past. We will have more of a chance to review those in the Labor and Human Resources Committee later in the session. 
We also see the willingness to try to help and assist those communities where a third of all of the high school students are going to school in dilapidated buildings. The Educational Facilities Improvement Act is a program that was developed by Senator Carol Moseley-Braun and has been a very creative program which will be addressed in the President's program. 
Finally, the President makes a strong commitment in the area of technology, about $2 billion over the next 5 years, to try to make sure that we are going to have technology--hardware and software--and, most importantly, trained teachers that will be able to use technology to help students learn more. 
A number of States, including my own State of Massachusetts, are now involved in what we call the Net Day Program--there are 12 other States involved in it--where we have been able to bring the Software Council, the leaders of business in software, the Telecommunications Council, which represents the best in terms of telecommunications, the unions, working all together in order to provide wiring and also computers to the classrooms and schools of Massachusetts. 
We were 48th out of 50 at the start of this whole effort; and we are now, I believe, leading all the States in the number of classrooms that we have already wired for the Internet with the help of this voluntary program which is very successful. More than 600 schools have now been adequately wired. We intend, within the next 15 months, to have the approximately 2,700 schools in Massachusetts achieve that. 
We have benchmarks to be able to assess where we are. The next benchmark will be in April of this year. But nonetheless, this kind of commitment by the administration to technology and teacher training is enormously important. 
It is our understanding that the new education programs and the strong commitment to education is paid for in the President's balanced budget. We will see the details of the President's budget in the next 10 days. But today we commend his strong commitment to education. 
We are looking forward to working in our committee, the Labor and Human Resources Committee, under the chairmanship of Senator Jeffords, who has had a long and distinguished career of bipartisan leadership in education, to maintain the Nation's commitment to strengthen academic achievement and accomplishment. We should continue to support local school reform efforts and to help provide seed money to communities to help bring technology into their schools--and to help ensure that technology is available to schools in all parts of the country. In addition, we will continue to make college more accessible and affordable for all students. 
We have every expectation that colleges and universities will join us in this partnership to increase accessibility and affordability and that they will not respond by raising tuition. We will work with them over the course of this Congress to ensure that this happens. 
To reiterate, I commend President Clinton for making education a top priority in his balanced budget plan. The President's proposal recognizes the importance of investing in education as the cornerstone of a stronger future for the Nation. 
In the coming years, a college education will be more important than ever. By 2005, 60 percent of all jobs created will require education beyond high school. A college graduate earns almost twice what a high school graduate earns, and almost three times what a high school dropout earns. 
But too often, college is priced out of reach for many families. From 1980 to 1990, the cost of college rose by 126 percent, while family income increased by only 73 percent. 
To meet the rising cost of college, students and their families are going deeper and deeper into debt. In the 1990's, students have borrowed more in student loans than in the three preceding decades combined. In 1996 alone, students borrowed $30 billion--a 65-percent increase since 1993. Since 1988, borrowing in the Federal student loan program has more than doubled. 
The President's proposal recognizes that making college more accessible and affordable is a top priority for the Nation. His proposal increases funding for higher education, provides tax cuts for education, and cuts student loan fees. 
Under the proposal, funding for higher education will increase by 20 percent by 2002, including a $1.6 billion increase in Pell grants. The Pell grant maximum will increase by $300 in the first year to $3,000, to give 130,000 low-income students greater access to college. With reforms in eligibility rules, the proposal will also help over 200,000 adults obtain the extra education and training they need to compete in the modern workplace. 
The proposal targets tax cuts for education to help students and working families. Students with incomes below $70,000 would benefit from the $1,500 Hope Tax Credit, which makes 2 years of community college affordable. 
All families with incomes below $100,000 may take advantage of a $10,000 tuition tax deduction. The President's budget also provides for penalty free withdrawals from IRA's to pay for education expenses. Student loan fees will be cut in half, saving students $2.6 billion over the budget period. The College Work-Study Program will be expanded to help up to 1 million students gain work experience while they earn money for college. 
In the area of elementary and secondary education, the President's proposal provides significant support for school reform. 
The Information Age has arrived, yet millions of children attend school in conditions inadequate to modern needs. By the year 2000, 60 percent of new jobs will require skills possessed by only 22 percent of the young people entering the labor market. Already, more than half of high-wage jobs require the use of network computers. Jobs that require computers pay 15 percent more, on average, than those that do not. 
Schools across the country are struggling to repair decrepit facilities, let alone develop modern classrooms. Fourteen million children in a third of the Nation's schools are learning in substandard classrooms. Yet enrollments are at an all-time high of 52 million students and are continuing to rise. 
We must also do more to help children learn to read--40 percent of all children now read below their grade level. Higher standards are clearly needed to encourage reading and other basic academic skills. 
The President's proposal responds to these needs by investing almost $2 billion in improved education technology over the budget period--a $252 million increase in fiscal year 1998 alone. 
The President's plan will also invest $2.45 billion over the budget period in the America Reads Challenge, to help children read well by the third grade. It invests $5 billion to improve school facilities. Funding for Goals 2000 will increase to help children meet higher academic standards. Funding for charter schools will increase. The title I program and the Eisenhower Teacher Training Program will receive increases to give students the extra help they need to improve their skills. 
President Clinton's plan is effective and comprehensive. It sets the right priority for education, and the right priority for the Nation's future. President Clinton has proved once again, that he truly is the education President, and I look forward to working with all Members of Congress to achieve these essential goals.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last week I introduced a bill to control illegal immigration and protect U.S. jobs. I would like to take a few minutes to expand on that bill. 
Last year, Congress passed landmark immigration reform legislation intended to curb illegal immigration. 
But that Republican legislation addressed only half of the illegal immigration problem. Republicans did not get the job done. So today, with the support of our Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, I introduce legislation to address the unfinished business of controlling illegal immigration. 
Immigration experts, policy think tanks, and blue-ribbon commissions over the past two decades all agree that effective enforcement against illegal immigration requires two steps. 
We must stop people from crossing our borders illegally. But, we must also combine our border enforcement efforts with effective workplace enforcement to deter employers who hire illegal workers. 
The Clinton administration should be commended for their aggressive enforcement strategy at the border. By the end of this year, the Clinton administration plans to have increased the Border Patrol from under 4,000 agents in 1993 to 6,859 agents--a 73-percent increase. And last year's immigration bill reenforced this increase by authorizing an additional 1,000 Border Patrol agents for each of the next 3 years. 
In addition, last year's immigration bill contained new, stiff penalties against the crime syndicates that smuggle illegal immigrant workers into the United States. 
But Republicans neglected the second key element of a successful immigration enforcement strategy, which is workplace enforcement to deny jobs to illegal immigrant workers. There is one reason, and one reason only, that illegal immigrants come to America: to find jobs. Last year's Republican immigration bill did almost nothing to address this problem. We will never reduce illegal immigration significantly until we shut off the job magnet that draws illegal immigrants to this country. 
That was the conclusion of the Select Commission on Immigration and Refugee Policy in 1981, the so-called Hesburgh Commission. And it was the conclusion of the Jordan Commission in 1994. The Jordan Commission stated, `Reducing the employment magnet is the linchpin of a comprehensive strategy to reduce illegal immigration.' 
Consider the following fact. The Immigration and Naturalization Service says that at least 40 percent, and possibly half, of the illegal immigrant population in the United States actually entered the country legally, but stayed on and worked illegally after their visas expired. They came here originally as tourists or students, but overstayed their visas and are now illegally taking American jobs. 
No amount of border enforcement will stop this major source of illegal immigrant workers. They arrive at our airports and at our borders with genuine passports and visas. There is no way to know that their real plans are to stay and work illegally. 
The only way to deter this kind of illegal immigration is to deny jobs at the workplace. Rather than just beefing up our Border Patrol, we must also increase the capacity of the Immigration Service and the Department of Labor to protect American jobs by finding illegal immigrants in the workplace and prosecuting unscrupulous employers who hire and abuse them. 
In 1986, Congress made it illegal for employers to hire illegal immigrant workers. But today it is far too easy for these workers to pose as legal immigrant workers or even U.S. citizens by using false documents. 
We must also find new and better ways of assisting employers to determine who can and who cannot work in the United States. 
Under the current failed system, employers often cannot distinguish a real green card and makes someone eligible to work from a good fake. 
Last year, the Senate adopted a proposal that Senator Simpson and I developed that contained aggressive pilot programs to test new and better ways of addressing this problem. Upon the completion of these programs, the President was required to submit to Congress a comprehensive plan that would enable employers to know with greater certainty whom they can and cannot hire. Without such a plan, illegal immigrants will continue to take American jobs from working families by the hundreds of thousands each year. 
But Republicans in Congress, under pressure from lobbyists representing the employers, met in secret last summer and dropped this vital provision from the bill. They put in its place a weak requirement for only a single pilot program. And they stripped the bill of the requirement that the President present to Congress for its approval a comprehensive plan for denying jobs to illegal immigrant workers. Instead of standing up for working families and protecting their jobs, they chose to coddle unscrupulous employers who hire and abuse illegal immigrants to make a buck. 
Our Democratic message to working families today is that we will not tolerate the loss of hundreds of thousands of your jobs each year. Last year's Republican immigration bill simply sets adrift the urgently needed workplace enforcement under our immigration laws to protect these jobs. Democrats say that working families need to be assured that their jobs will be protected under our immigration laws. 
The bill I introduce today: 
Provides the workplace enforcement we need to protect U.S. jobs. It increases the number of Department of Labor Wage and Hour investigators. These investigators will target employers who hire illegal immigrants to evade labor standards. And it provides funding for additional INS personnel to enforce our immigration laws in the workplace. 
It increases penalties for employers who hire illegal workers. And it allows judges to double an employers penalties if they have violated both immigration and labor laws. 
It mandates the President to fix the broken employment verification system. Currently employers have an obligation to verify whether those they hire are authorized to work in the United States. But, the verification system in place now does not work. My bill requires the President to propose a plan to Congress within 3 years for an improved employment verification system. 
It prevents employers from discriminating against American and legal immigrant workers by making some workers go through more hoops to get a job than others, just because they may look or sound foreign. 
Finally, my bill provides needed protections for battered immigrants. Many battered immigrants are afraid to seek protection from their abusers because they fear they will be deported or cannot find work to support their children. This bill removes the hurdles for battered immigrants, and protects their ability to qualify for green cards and jobs. 
Last year's illegal immigration bill addressed only half the problem. The bill I introduce today will complete the picture and protect jobs for working families. And I look forward to working with our new Immigration Subcommittee chairman, Senator Abraham, and the Republican leadership to see early enactment of this important measure. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be included at this point in the Record.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to vote for Senator Bill Cohen's confirmation to serve as Secretary of Defense. We are all very familiar with Senator Cohen's experience and commitment to the Nation's defense as a member of the Armed Services Committee and I am confident he will put those qualities to good use in leading the Department of Defense into the next century. 
In the 8 years since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Department has guided our Armed Forces through a challenging and often painful downsizing, while maintaining the preeminent position of our forces as the world's strongest, best led, best trained, and finest performing military. And we have done so while making major progress toward balancing the budget. 
Senator Cohen is eminently qualified to carry on these important responsibilities. 
We continue to face major challenges in maintaining a sound defense strategy to forthcoming years in the post-cold-war world. 
Our nuclear arsenal and that of the four other nuclear powers are larger and are operated on higher alerts than the threats now justify. The threat from terrorists who seek to obtain and use weapons of mass destruction demands more of our attention and resources. 
The Pentagon is embarking on a quadrennial defense review to determine the proper balance of size, structure, and funding to keep our forces equipped, trained, and ready. We all look forward to working with Senator Cohen and the President to deal with these critical issues for our national security. 
Another vital challenge is to ensure that our military personnel have the quality of life to which their service entitles them. Health care, child care, and adequate housing are all initiatives on which the committee works closely with the Department, and I know these will continue to be priorities for the Pentagon under Secretary Cohen's leadership as well. 
Finally, it was a special privilege for me to work with Senator Cohen on the Seapower Subcommittee for many years on issues of special importance to the Navy and Marine Corps. I commend him on his nomination and I look forward to continuing to deal with him on safeguarding our national defense.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a special honor for all of us who know and respect Madeleine Albright to vote for her confirmation as Secretary of State. This is an historic moment for the country, and I know that she will serve with great distinction as the first woman in our history to hold that high office. 
Over the years, Madeleine Albright has always been an excellent source of wise advice to many of us in Congress on matters of foreign policy. I have always valued her counsel and respected her leadership, and the President's decision to nominate her as Secretary of State is a well-deserved honor. 
In the course of her extraordinary career, she has skillfully combined public service and academic pursuits, and these abilities make her especially well-suited for the challenges she will face as Secretary of State. Many of us first came to know her when she was an able assistant to our former colleague Senator Edmund Muskie, and later as a member of President Carter's National Security Council. And all of us were proud of her brilliant service in recent years as our Ambassador to the United Nations. 
Academically, she has served as a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, as a professor at Georgetown's School of Foreign Service, and as president of the Center for National Policy. 
Her personal history of fleeing Hitler and Communism as a child from her home in Czechoslovakia and her rise in this country to the position of Secretary of State is one of the great American success stories of our time and a vivid symbol that the American dream is alive and well in our day and generation.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that we learned last weekend of the death of our former colleague from Massachusetts, Paul Tsongas. Paul served in the House of Representatives for 4 years, from 1975 to 1979, and in the Senate for 6 years, from 1979 to 1985. All of us who knew him respected him and admired him. 
Paul was a great friend, a great Congressman for the people of Lowell, a great Senator for the State of Massachusetts. He had a special dedication to public service that began as a Peace Corps volunteer in Ethiopia in the 1960's and endured throughout his brilliant career, including his 1992 Presidential campaign. 
As a Lowell city councilor, a county commissioner, Congressman, Senator, and Presidential candidate he had a special vision of America as it ought to be. Above all, he had an extraordinary personal and political courage. It was a courage demonstrated during his long illness and in all aspects of his years in public service. He often took stands that were unpopular. He had strongly held beliefs and he fought hard for them regardless of the passing political cause. He cared more for the truth than public opinion. And the people of Massachusetts loved him all the more because of it. 
President Kennedy would have called him a `profile in courage.' 
One of his enduring legacies is the Lowell National Historic Park, which symbolized a great deal about his commitment to Lowell and to that entire region of our State. He had the vision to conceive the park and the skill to achieve it. In a larger sense, it also typified his unique ability to find new ways to see old problems. Where others saw a fading mill town, Paul saw the opportunity for rebirth, growth, and a thriving new economy. 
He applied that same dedication to new ways of thinking in everything he did in our State, our country, and our common planet, yet he had both a realistic and idealistic vision of a better future and a powerful commitment to reach it so no one would be left out or left behind. 
He reminded me of Robert Kennedy. As my brother often said, `Some people see things as they are and say, why. I dream things that never were and say, why not?' That was true of Paul Tsongas as well. We will miss him very much. Our hearts go out to his wife Niki, his sisters, Thaleia and Vicki, all the members of his wonderful family, his three daughters, Ashley, Katina, and Molly.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I rise to express appreciation to our leader, Senator Daschle, who has over the period of these recent weeks and months been working with many in our caucus and I know will be working closely, as well, with those on the other side of the aisle who are really interested in this Nation's commitment to the young people of this country in the field of education. 
I think all of us who have had the opportunity to travel through the country, certainly in my travels around Massachusetts over this last year--no matter where we traveled--heard the concerns that parents had about access and availability in areas of education as one of the paramount issues. 
The President has addressed those concerns by recommending a tax credit, also a $1,500 tax deduction, and some $10,000 that will be helpful to working families. Also included in the Daschle proposal are recommendations that we consider the interest on the debt for education in the same way that we would consider interest on the debt for machinery or the manufacturing industry assets, in being able to provide some deduction for those expenses as well. 
That effectively, Mr. President, is to respond to the President's commitment to the American people to make the next two grades beyond the 12th grade--13th and 14th, the first 2 years of college--accessible and available to the young people in this country, so that future generations will be able to say that we, as a nation, during this Congress, have committed this Nation to the next two grades in the area of education. 
I think this is a bold commitment. I think it is a dramatic enterprise. I think it will take the best judgment of all of us to achieve and accomplish this. But, nonetheless, as we understand it, the President's budget that will be submitted in the next 2-week period will demonstrate the funds that will be necessary to achieve it, and we will be able to say, in effect, when we actually legislate these proposals, that they are effectively paid and paid in full. That will be very, very important and a significant commitment to the young people of this country. 
Included in the education proposal, Mr. President, are a number of other items which I think all of us should be able to embrace and endorse, and these have been outlined by Senator Daschle, I have been informed, earlier during the course of the day. 
There will be commitments in terms of additional new technologies for our young people in schools across this country, to make sure they are going to be able to take advantage of the latest in technology and also resources to make sure we are going to be able to train teachers so that they will be able to be well-trained and able to impart to the younger people of this country the skills that young people will need to be able to use these technologies. 
It will be a modest program, but an important program, that follows the leadership of Carol Moseley-Braun, to try and give focus and attention to many of the schools in local communities across the country that are in very dilapidated conditions. That is true for most of the older cities of this country. It is true in my own city of Boston. It is true in many of the older communities of my State--Lowell, Lawrence, New Bedford, Fall River, Springfield, Worcester, and many others. It is equally true in many of the large urban areas. 
This is a very modest program, but a very innovative and creative program about leveraging limited financial resources to address those particular needs in a modest way. Hopefully, we will be able to bring additional support for continuation of that program into the future. 
A very important continuing commitment to literacy and expanding the opportunity for children to read in our society so that we can achieve the goal that children who have reached the third grade will be able to read in a rather creative way is using the funding that will be allocated in the various competitive 
grants in ways that the young people of this country are going to be able to read and to really challenge the young people in our Nation, many who are going to schools and colleges, to help and assist with that undertaking, and to challenge American people, in general, to help and assist young children in this country. 
These are some of the elements of it. There are a number of others which are important, but I have summarized it, Mr. President. I hope that we will be able to move ahead in the area of education. It is extremely important. 
At the end of the last session, we did move forward in terms of funding various programs. We are going to have to find the funding for these programs and also for the increased number of children who will be going to high school. We are seeing an increase in total student enrollment, and we want to make sure that their particular needs are going to be attended to, as well. I think that is very important. That is something I know Senator Daschle has addressed, and I know that the President's program will address it. 
Hopefully, we will have broad, broad bipartisan support. For so many years in this body, the support for education was broad-based and bipartisan. It is bipartisan and broad-based in the country, and we should try and find ways to maintain that in the Congress and Senate. 
Second, Mr. President, is an area that I consider of enormous importance and that is to address the needs of 10 1/2 million children who are uninsured today. Ten and a half million will be uninsured over the course of a particular year. The leader has outlined approaches to addressing this issue. 
There is a rather dramatic definition of who those children are, Mr. President. Children are the fastest growing segment of the uninsured population. It is a rather dramatic phenomenon. They are the ones who are being dropped from coverage in the current insurance system. Nine out of ten of the 10.5 million children who are uninsured have parents who are working. 
We have the Medicaid Program which addresses the poorest children in this country. I welcome the fact that the administration is going to try and be more creative and imaginative in terms of reaching many of those children who are eligible for Medicaid. These children are desperately in need of a healthy start and are not receiving it today. But we are talking about the next level; that is, the sons and daughters of working families. These are men and women who go to work every day, they play by the rules, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year making America work. They are the backbone of so much of what is right in our society, but their children are being left out and being left behind. 
The figures and statistics are a fierce indictment of what is happening in our society. As one of the major industrial nations in the world, we still have one of the highest infant mortality rates. We are 17th among the industrial nations of the world. 
More than half of all uninsured children with asthma never see a doctor, with all the implications that has, in terms of a child's future development and growth. As the father of a son who now happens to be a Congressman who had chronic asthma when he was a child, it is unbelievable to me the difficulties that he had in terms of coping with the problems of asthma. I do not know how he would have coped unless he had been able to get important medical attention. 
We know one out of three uninsured children who have recurring ear infections never see a doctor. There are significant increases in the number of ear infections and the number of children who are going deaf in our society from preventable diseases. And the list goes on. 
The final point that I want to make in this area, Mr. President, is that expanding coverage for children is wise economic policy. 
We are always going to have to come back to justify this from economic means. We all know for every dollar that is invested in immunization, the savings are $5 to $6. That is true in terms of the investment in children's health. It is true certainly in terms of providing the kind of prenatal care that would be included in this program for expectant mothers. That is an exceedingly wise investment. 
There are different ways of funding this proposal, Mr. President. My principal interest and I believe all of ours is to get the job done. I will introduce legislation that will ensure that all working families can afford to purchase private health insurance for their children. I support an increase in the tobacco tax to cover this cost because of the relationship between tobacco and children's health. A number of our States are moving forward in terms of addressing the issues of children's smoking and all of the implications that has as a gateway drug. The States know that curbing smoking among young people is a sound and wise way to proceed. 
But there are alternative ways to fund this program. I have every intention of working with our leader and those on the other side of the aisle to try and find alternatives. 
Our principal interest is getting the coverage for these children. If we achieve very little else in this Congress we should cover our children. We should move in those areas, and also move in the areas of coverage of pensions for working families. We need to make steps in the area of pensions when we realize that close to 60 percent of all working families do not have any pensions at all and that there is an increasing number of working families that do not have pensions. 
We are all thankful about Social Security. We know we have challenges that have to be addressed in the areas of ensuring its financial integrity over the period of the years but that is basically a program to prevent people from living in dire poverty. What we are talking about are those working families that have a standard of living who have been participants in our society, in so many instances served in the Armed Forces, want to be part of a pension system, and are not part of it because of various complications that have existed out there. We ought to make it easier for them to participate, encouraging employers as well as employees. 
I would say in this area, Mr. President, no one has a greater interest in this area of pension coverage than women in our society. They are the ones that often are the part-time workers. They enter and leave the work force to meet various family needs and family requirements. And they are the ones, if you identify any group, are the ones that are left out and left behind in terms of a national pension system. 
We have to be more responsive to their particular needs. And I commend the work that has been done on this by Senator Boxer and Carol Moseley-Braun and Dianne Feinstein, Patty Murray, Barbara Mikulski, and many in our caucus that have provided important leadership in this very important area. 
Finally, Mr. President, I want to mention one area that working families are very much concerned about. These themes are all related to security for working families. What is more important for working families than they are going to be able to make sure that their children are going to get covered? What is more important for working families than making sure that their children are going to be able to continue in the areas of education? What is more important for working families than if they are going to be able to look to the future with some degree of hope and opportunities and some degree of security with the pension reforms? 
I just mention, finally, unfinished business as part of our immigration law last year. We are working to ensure protection for American workers, for American jobs that are being replaced by foreign workers who are displacing those American workers, not being paid the adequate kind of salary, given the decency in terms of benefits. They are replacing an American worker in the first place and then because they are doing that at much less of a wage, much less benefits, being able to be competitive to the disadvantage of other Americans with whom they might be competing in producing widgets, for example, and therefore seeing other Americans that are going to lose their jobs. 
There are two basic and fundamental concepts that underlie our basic problems with the issues of immigration--one is addressing the needs at the border in terms of halting illegal immigrants that are coming here and, second, addressing the magnet of jobs--the magnet of jobs. 
If you look at the Jordan study, if you look at the Hesburgh study on what is the key issue in terms of attracting immigrants, illegal immigrants, immigrants that are going to abuse the immigration system, you will find out it is jobs. Unless we are going to make sure that Americans are not going to have important jobs, and we are talking about hundreds of thousands of jobs a year in many instances--we have really failed on the other extremely important effort in terms of immigration reform. We had important provisions in the immigration bill last year that Senator Simpson supported, many of us supported. Those were dropped in the conference. We will come back to that particular issue in this year.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if we act on health care in a spirit of bipartisanship this year and build on the accomplishments of last year, the new Congress can be the Health Care Congress. 
There are several significant health care goals that this Congress can and should accomplish: 
We should expand health insurance coverage for children and the unemployed. 
We should deal with the serious problem of abuses by HMO's by adopting needed patient protections and standards for care. 
We should put Medicare on a sound fiscal footing for the next decade, without dismantling the program or adding to the already high health care costs that burden senior citizens. 
We should protect Medicaid, as we did last year, against any attempts to undermine protections for children, senior citizens, and the disabled. 
The final months of the last Congress were a period of considerable accomplishment. We finally broke the long stalemate over health care reform. We passed a health insurance reform act. We made a start toward long-overdue parity for mental health coverage. We put an end to the insidious practice of drive-through deliveries, by guaranteeing newborn infants and their mothers a 48-hour stay in the hospital if they need it. 
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ends some of the worst abuses in the current insurance system. It guarantees that, as long as you faithfully pay your premiums, your insurance cannot be taken away--even if you become seriously ill, or change your job, or lose your job. In addition, insurance companies can no longer impose new exclusions for pre-existing conditions, as long as you do not let your insurance lapse. 
The legislation on mental health parity was a first step toward the day when those who suffer from mental illness will receive the care they need and deserve. The ban on drive-through deliveries is a wake-up call to unscrupulous health plans that exalt profits over patients' needs. 
Now, we have a new Congress and a new opportunity to build on these achievements. The crisis that put health care on the front-burner of public policy has not gone away. In fact, it has become worse. Between 1990 and 1994, the number of uninsured Americans rose from 34 to 40 million, and it continues to climb. 
A quarter of the uninsured--over 10 million--are children. One in every seven children in America today have no health insurance. Almost all of these children have parents who work. Cutbacks in employer coverage are worsening this problem, as more and more employers decide to cut costs. 
Many firms are shifting from full-time to part-time employees. Others are contracting out work to firms that typically don't provide benefits. Large employers with generous benefits are reducing the number of employees eligible for the benefits. Other employers are dropping coverage for early retirees, or even all retirees. Cost-sharing is going up, and coverage of spouses and children is going down. Every 35 seconds another child loses private insurance. Parents should not have to live in fear that their employer's failure to provide coverage will deny their children good health care. 
Every Member of Congress knows that those who are uninsured or underinsured can see the savings of a lifetime swept away by a single serious illness. Every Member of Congress knows that those who are uninsured are vulnerable to financial catastrophe, and are too often denied the timely, quality care they need to avoid disability or death. Children in particular often suffer premature death or a lifetime of unnecessary suffering because they lack the access to quality care that insurance provides. 
All children deserve the health care they need for a healthy start in life. Every family deserves the security of knowing their children will get the health care they need. Unfortunately, too many American children lack that care, and too many families lack that security. 
Uninsured children are less likely to see a doctor regularly. As they grow, they tend to receive little or no treatment, even when they need it for injury or illness. If the case is serious enough, they go to the hospital. The only family doctor they know is the hospital emergency room. 
More than half of uninsured children with asthma never see a doctor. A third of uninsured children with recurring ear infections never see a doctor, and many suffer permanent hearing loss. 
Providing health care for children is sound public policy and also sound economics. It's an investment in the future. Dollars spent immunizing a child or providing prenatal care can save hundreds or even thousands of dollars in future medical costs. 
At the end of the last Congress, Senator John Kerry and I introduced a program to make private health insurance coverage accessible and affordable for all children through age 18. Working families will have the financial assistance they need to purchase such coverage, including care for pregnant women, so that every baby has a healthy start in life. We intend to reintroduce this legislation with other Members of the Senate early this year. A similar plan is being introduced today by Senator Daschle, and I am hopeful action in this area will be high on the agenda of both parties. 
The legislation that Senator Kerry and I intend to offer will make Federal assistance available to the States on a sliding scale to help families purchase health insurance for their children at group rates, if they do not already have coverage under an employment-based plan or an existing public program. The covered benefits will include in-patient, out-patient, and preventive care--all comparable to the coverage available under good group health plans. 
The plan does not guarantee that every child will have insurance coverage. But it will give every family the opportunity to cover their children at a cost the family can afford. 
I hope this program will receive broad bipartisan support. The Health Insurance Reform Act passed by the last Congress was based on the common elements of proposals that had previously been introduced by Republicans and Democrats alike. Our current plan for coverage of children also meets that test. Every Republican proposal and every Democratic proposal introduced in the first 2 years of the Clinton administration expanded coverage by providing financial assistance to low and moderate income families to purchase private insurance. Almost all of these proposals included extra assistance to purchase children's coverage. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle recognize the importance and priority of covering children. 
Our legislation establishes no Government mandates. It relies on the private sector to provide insurance and deliver care. It imposes no price controls. It builds on the efforts of 14 States that already have similar programs in place. 
Our plan will be financed by an increase in the tobacco tax, because that tax is an especially appropriate means of funding children's health coverage. Society pays dearly for the health costs of smoking. We know that the tobacco industry is targeting children. If children start smoking, the industry will live. If children stop smoking, the industry will ultimately die. It's as simple as that. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, if nothing more is done, 5 million of today's children will die prematurely as the result of smoking. An increase in the tobacco tax is the most important single step we can take to reduce childhood smoking, save lives, and lower the health costs of smoking over the long run. 
In addition, we must do more to provide health care for the unemployed. For too many workers between jobs, coverage is difficult or impossible to afford. Too often, they are forced to let their insurance lapse in order to meet other needs. Modest financial assistance can make all the difference in making coverage available and affordable. Massachusetts has already shown that such coverage can be provided at reasonable cost. 
Another key area to address is managed care. In many ways, its current growth is a positive development. Managed care offers the opportunity to extend the best medical practice to all medical practice. Good managed care plans provide more coordinated care and more cost-effective care for people with multiple medical needs. 
It compares favorably with fee-for-service medicine in a variety of ways, especially preventive care and early diagnosis of illness. But the same financial incentives that make HMO's and other managed care organizations so cost-effective can also lead to under-treatment or excessive restrictions. Some managed care plans put their bottom line ahead of their patients' well-being--and pressure physicians in their networks to do the same. 
Some of the worst abuses include failure to inform patients of treatment options; excessive barriers against referrals to specialists; irresponsible attempts to slash hospital care; unwillingness to order appropriate diagnostic tests; inadequate support for clinical trials and academic health centers; refusal to pay for potentially lifesaving treatment; and lack of fair ways to resolve disputes or redress grievances. Some of these problems affect conventional insurance as well. In many cases, these failures have tragic consequences. 
The ban adopted in the last Congress on drive through deliveries was a first step in dealing with these problems. We also attempted to deal with another flagrant HMO abuse--the so-called gag rules that prohibit doctors from mentioning certain treatment options with patients. Time ran out before we could complete action, but the issue is high on our agenda for 1997. Managed care plans themselves have recently taken a strong position against this abuse. But there continues to be strong bipartisan support for additional steps to guarantee consumer protections and adequate care--and this Congress should be the Congress that enacts needed legislation in this area. 
As we try to pass measures to improve the health of the American people, we must not undermine effective programs already in place. In the last Congress, a destructive proposal to slash Medicaid and convert it to block grants to the States threatened to strip children and parents, senior citizens, and disabled of needed coverage. Senior citizens in nursing homes could have lost their protection of quality of care, and their families would have been increasingly burdened by the high cost of long term care. Fortunately, that assault on Medicaid failed. In this new Congress, I hope that a bipartisan approach will keep such extreme measures from serious consideration. 
Finally, we need to act responsibly on Medicare. President Clinton has proposed responsible steps to protect patients while extending the life of the trust fund for a decade. Senior citizens deserve fair action by this Congress on Medicare. But we should continue to reject proposals to slash Medicare to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy, or to force senior citizens to give up their own doctor and join private insurance plans under the guise of expanding patient choice, or to pile additional out-of-pocket costs on hard-pressed senior citizens. 
This Congress can be the Congress that puts Medicare and Medicaid on a stable basis for the next decade. This can be the Congress that guarantees quality and consumer protection in managed care. This can be the Congress that gives every family health security for their children and every child the opportunity for a healthy start in life. This can be the Congress that grants the unemployed needed protection for health insurance. If we work hard together, this Congress can achieve these goals, and both Republicans and Democrats will deserve a real vote of thanks from the American people.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I give my strong support to the `Education for the 21st Century Act' introduced today by Senator Daschle on one of our principle democratic leadership initiatives. 
Education must continue to be a top priority in this Congress. We need to do more to make college accessible and affordable for all students, to modernize school classrooms, to help communities build new school facilities and repair old ones, and to help all children learn to read so that they can read to learn. 
It is not enough to maintain current spending levels for education. Modest increases are essential to meet rising enrollments and inflation. 
Too often, college is priced out of reach for many families. From 1980 to 1990, the cost of college rose by 126 percent, while family income increased by only 73 percent. To meet that rising cost, students are going deeper and deeper into debt. In the 1990s, students have borrowed more in student loans than in the three preceding decades combined. 
In 1996 alone, students borrowed $30 billion--a 65-percent increase since 1993. Since 1988, borrowing in the Federal student loan program has increased by more than 100 percent, while starting salaries for college graduates failed to increase at all. Eighty percent of young adults with student loans make under $20,000 in their first year of repayment, barely enough to support the average repayment. 
Communities are struggling to repair decrepit facilities, let alone build modern classrooms. Fourteen million children in a third of the Nation's schools are learning in sub-standard classrooms. Half the schools have unsatisfactory conditions. Forty-six percent of schools report insufficient electrical wiring for computers and communications equipment. The repair bill alone is estimated at $112 billion. 
And while all this is happening, enrollments are at an all-time high of 52 million students, and thus are continuing to rise. 
Forty percent of all children are now reading below their basic grade level. Many parents do not read to their children and with their children, even though we know that when parent involvement is high, student reading scores are also high. 
Technology is a powerful tool for improving schools and encouraging economic growth. Computers enable teachers to spend more time with students and teach more effective lessons. By the year 2000, 60 percent of all jobs in the Nation will require skills in computer and network use. According to a recent GAO study, one in 
every four schools does not have sufficient computers to meet its needs. Only 9 percent of classrooms are connected to the Internet. 
Clearly, we are not prepared to meet the challenges of the next century. We have to do better, and the Education for the 21st Century Act will help us to meet the pressing needs of communities, schools, and families. 
The Act includes four separate titles: The Higher Education Affordability Act, which includes President Clinton's $1,500 Hope Tuition Tax Credit, the $10,000 tuition tax deduction, and the restoration of the tax deduction for student loan interest; The Educational Facilities Improvement Act; The America Reads Challenge Act, which includes The Parents as First Teachers Act and The Challenging America's Young Readers Act; and The Investing in Technology in the Classroom Act. 
The Hope Tax Credit will make at least 2 years of community college affordable for every student. The bill provides a $1,500 a year refundable tax credit for net tuition payments during the first 2 years of college after high school for full-time students. Part-time students may receive $750 per year. The tax benefit is phased out for single persons between $50,000 and $70,000 in adjusted gross income, and phased out for couples between $80,000 and $100,000. Only students who have a cumulative `B' average from high school, or its equivalent, qualify for the credit. Pell grants and the tax credit are additive, up to the value of the net tuition paid. 
The $10,000 tax deduction will be available to all families with incomes below $100,000. The bill provides an above-the-line deduction of up to $10,000 per taxpayer per year for net tuition expenses. The deduction is available for all college and graduate schools, and the income limits are the same as those provided under the Hope Tax Credit. 
The bill also restores the deduction for interest on student loans that was available before the Tax Reform Act of 1986. Unlike the previous deduction, this bill provides an above-the-line deduction. The income limits are the same as those provided under the Hope Tax Credit. 
The Educational Facilities Improvement Act instructs the Federal Government to pay up to 50 percent of the interest costs on State and local bonds to finance school repair, renovation, modernization and construction. Twenty percent of the funds will go directly from the Secretary of Education to the 100 poorest school districts under a formula based on the number of poor children. The remainder of the funds will be awarded to States to provide assistance to State or local bond authorities. 
The America Reads Challenge Act includes two components: The Parents as First Teachers Act and the Challenge America's Young Readers Act. The Parents as First Teachers Act--recognizing that parents are the best first teachers--will support national and regional parent networks that disseminate information on helping parents help their children to read. It will also fund programs to expand successful programs and activities that help parents increase the reading skills of their children. 
The Challenging America's Young Readers Act will help State and local organizations help children learn to read by the third grade. Programs funded by this act will provide 30,000 reading specialists and volunteer coordinators to run tutoring assistance programs outside regular school hours to more than 3 million children. 
My hope is that these proposals will receive the bipartisan support they deserve, so they can be in place for the beginning of the next academic year this fall. Improving education or opportunities for education is clearly one of our highest national priorities. Few things which this Congress does will matter more to the country's future. Investing in education is investing in a stronger America here at home and around the world, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to enact these important measures.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 
today I join with the distinguished Minority Leader, Senator Daschle, in co-sponsoring legislation important for the future of working families in this country. One of this Congress's highest priorities should be pension reform. 
The Treasury now spends $66 billion a year in tax subsidies to encourage pension coverage, but working families are not getting full value for this money. 56 percent of the workforce is not currently covered by any private pension plan. The situation is worse for employees of small businesses. Eighty-five percent of those employed by firms with fewer than 25 workers have no pension coverage. For low-wage workers, the situation is worst of all. More than 26 million employees--80 percent--who earn under $15,000 a year are not covered by a pension plan. Forty-one million employees who earn less than $30,000 a year do not participate in a retirement plan--60 percent. 
Women make up an excessive portion of the working population that is not covered by a pension plan. Employees covered by union agreements are nearly twice as likely to have a pension, but women are half as likely to hold these jobs. More than eight million women who work for small firms have no access to pension coverage. 
Low-wage women are especially hard-hit. Sixty percent of those earning under $15,000 a year are women. Nearly sixteen million women who earn less than $15,000 a year are not participating in a pension plan--80 percent. Twenty-three million women earning less than $30,000 a year don't participate in a retirement plan--nearly 60 percent. 
Women are more than twice as likely as men to hold part-time jobs, with no pension coverage. Women make up more than half the workforce in industries with the lowest rates of pension coverage--such as the service and retail industries. In those industries with higher rates of access to pensions--mining, durable manufacturing, and communications--women make up just one-fourth of the workforce. 
We must change these figures. I am proud to join in sponsoring the Retirement Security Act that Senator Daschle is introducing today to deal with these serious problems. 
This bill will make real progress in expanding access to pensions for all working families. It will facilitate retirement savings by millions of Americans, by enabling workers to ask their employers to set aside savings from paychecks and deposit the savings directly into retirement accounts. This `pension checkoff' is a simple, practical step to make the private pension system more accessible to all workers. 
The bill will also provide tax incentives for low-wage employees to set aside money for retirement. Families on the lower rungs of the economic ladder deserve a secure income when they retire. This bill will reform the tax laws to make them more beneficial to low-income workers. No one who works for a living should have to retire in poverty. 
The bill advances other important goals as well. It strengthens the security of the pension system, so that the benefits families rely on will be there when they retire. It will stop employers from forcing employees to invest their retirement contributions in the employer's stock, against the workers' wishes. It will provide closer monitoring of pension plan terminations, to prevent companies from raiding employee pensions. 
The bill also promotes pension portability. The checkoff system will allow employees to continue saving for retirement even if they change jobs or leave the labor market for a time. Wherever they go, they can take their pension plan with them. In addition, the bill makes it easier for employees to roll over their retirement accounts to a new employer's plan. 
The bill will remove the most significant obstacles to pension coverage for women. It builds on the efforts of Senator Moseley-Braun and Senator Boxer in the last Congress to improve pension benefits for surviving spouses. It will also enable spouses to contribute to IRAs. The pension checkoff system will benefit millions of working women whose employers do not provide pension plans. 
I commend Senator Daschle for the leadership he has shown in introducing this important bill. At a time when Social Security is facing tremendous budget pressure, it is essential that the private pension system be accessible and affordable to every working family. I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass this necessary legislation.

Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join Senator Daschle in introducing legislation to ban the abusive practice of drive-by" mastectomies. This legislation will respond to the concerns of women throughout the country who fear that, in dealing with the cruel disease of breast cancer, their health plan's bottom line will take precedence over their health needs. This legislation will require health insurers to provide coverage for a minimum hospital stay for mastectomies and lymph node dissections performed for the treatment of breast cancer. The legislation allows outpatient surgery when the patient and the doctor decide that a hospital stay is not necessary, but it prohibits a health plan from forcing patients to go home on the same day that they have these major surgical procedures. 
The Daschle bill is a companion to bipartisan legislation (H.R.135) introduced by Representative Rosa DeLauro in the House of Representatives. It will ban an abusive practice that even the health plans themselves have recognized should not be tolerated. 
This legislation is of major importance to millions of women. Breast cancer is the most common solid tissue cancer among women. In 1996, approximately 184,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer were diagnosed. It is now the leading cause of death in women between the ages of 40 and 55. 
This legislation is supported by the National Breast Cancer Coalition the National Association of Breast Care Organizations, the Y-me National Breast Cancer Organization, the Families USA Foundation, the Women's Legal Defense Fund, and the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. It prohibits plans from requiring hospital stays shorter than 48 hours for patients after mastectomy and 24 hours after lymph node dissection. 
Decisions about the need for hospital care after such surgery should be made by a woman and her doctor. The social, medical, geographic and health issues unique to each person must be considered in deciding the required amount of in-hospital care. In certain circumstances and with proper support, it may be possible for some women to undergo these procedures with a shorter hospital stay, or even on occasion as an outpatient. Each circumstance is unique. 
This bill preserves every woman's ability to avail herself of needed services without fear of penalty or prejudice. It does not require a stay in the hospital for any fixed period of time. Rather, it guarantees that hospital care will be provided when it is needed. 
Last year, Congress voted overwhelmingly to ban the practice of health plans forcing excessively short stays after delivery of a baby. This legislation is a further needed step to protect consumers against a particularly abusive practice, and I look forward to its early bipartisan approval by Congress.
