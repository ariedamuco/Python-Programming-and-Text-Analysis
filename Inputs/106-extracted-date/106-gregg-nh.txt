   Mr. GREGG. I thank my distinguished colleague from Maine as well and share her concerns about the impact of natural disasters on the lives of people and on the economy. In the past, government has worked effectively with the building industry to make homes and commercial buildings better and safer through building codes and standards, and by supporting improvements in building technology. 
   The subcommittee is very interested in the contributions that the NIST Building and Fire Research Laboratory can make to improve the quality of building products. Fiberglass-reinforced wood composites can greatly increase the safety of homes subjected to natural disasters. I agree that the National Institute of Standards should pursue with the University of Maine the development and demonstration of fiberglass-reinforced wood composites for improved building materials.

   Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Washington for the courtesy of recognition. 
   Mr. President, I join with my colleagues in praising and expressing our appreciation for the opportunity to work with and know as a colleague in this body Senator SLADE GORTON from Washington. I expect to continue to work with and know Senator SLADE GORTON for many years. But, unfortunately, he will be leaving this body, which is too bad because I consider him to be one of the truly extraordinary people I have had a chance to get to know. 
   I would describe him as delightful and extraordinary--delightful as a person, extraordinary as a Senator. He brings to this Senate a uniqueness which is special. He has a freshness about him, a way of approaching the issues which is always creative and imaginative. He has true love for this institution. He especially understands its rules and the way it works. 
   He is one of the few senior Members on our side of the aisle who will sit in the chair for hours and hours in order to officiate over the Senate. In fact, I think every year he has been here he has received what is known as the Golden Gavel for sitting in the Chair for 100 hours, something usually received by junior Members of the Senate, but because of his interest in and intensity and love for and commitment to this body, he has enjoyed the opportunity to preside. And he has presided extraordinarily well. 
   He, however, as the Senator from New Mexico has mentioned, has been probably less visible than many Members of the Senate but has had much more impact than most of us. His actions and effectiveness are really in the famous back halls and meeting rooms of the Senate. Very few pieces of legislation have moved through this body that do not, in some part, have the fingerprints of SLADE GORTON on them. 
   He is truly an effective tactician, but more importantly, he is an effective spokesperson for a philosophy. And he knows how to move that philosophy forward within our institution. 
   As a result, he has had a tremendous impact on the legislative activity of this body over the years. I suppose we shouldn't be surprised at that though. The truly great Senators in this body--I suggest that maybe one of them is Daniel Webster--have come from a tradition from which SLADE GORTON also comes. He went to school in New Hampshire. He went to school at Dartmouth, as did the great Daniel Webster. Maybe he learned at Dartmouth some of those characteristics which carried both Webster and him forward so well. Clearly, those characteristics are unique and special. We take pride in New Hampshire in claiming a little bit of SLADE GORTON for our own. 
   As I think of him, I think of a friend, somebody to whom I could always go talk to get ideas. We talked about his family that he so loved, Sally and his children, his grandchildren, his nieces, nephews. He used to go to hockey league for his niece all the time. She is a wonderful hockey player. He is totally committed to his family. 
   It was a pleasure to have the chance to sit down and talk with him on any subject, but especially when it came to issues of family and what everybody was up to and what everybody was doing. That is the priority for SLADE and Sally. At one point, they took a bike ride across the country, which must have been an amazing experience, the whole family riding across the country. 
   He set an example for those of us who came here after him. As we look around this institution, we often refer to people: He reminds me of so-and-so, he reminds me of some Senator from here or some Senator here at some other date. I must say, I can't think of higher praise than if someone were to come up to me some day and say: You know, you remind me a lot of SLADE GORTON and the way he worked as a Senator. That, to me, would be the highest praise I could receive because I consider him to be one of the finest, if not the finest, Senator I know. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for his courtesy, and also the Senator from Idaho for his courtesy. 
   I want to speak today, just quickly, in response to the press conference which the President held in the Rose Garden approximately an hour and a half ago. The tenor of the press conference was that the Commerce-State-Justice bill will be vetoed because the White House had not been allowed to participate in the negotiations on how the bill was put together. 
   I chair the Subcommittee on Commerce-State-Justice appropriations. I have to say that I believe the President's statement is an inaccuracy of the most egregious level. The fact is, the White House, myself, Congressman ROGERS, along with Senator HOLLINGS and Congressman SERRANO, representing the ranking membership on the committee, negotiated with the White House for many hours relative to the Commerce-State-Justice bill. 
   The bill that was produced was agreed to in almost all aspects except on issues of extraneous language that had never been in either bill, that language was authorizing language dealing with immigration--the NACARA language, as it has come to be known. This was language that had nothing to do with the appropriations bill. It was authorizing on an appropriations bill. It has not been acted on in either committee. It was, therefore, not relevant, appropriate, and would not be germane to the bill under our rules. However, the White House wanted action on that language. 
   As to the appropriations bill, his representation that the appropriations bill was in some way done in a back room without White House participation is totally fallacious. The fact is, the White House was there at the table, negotiating. And because of the White House's insistence on certain changes, this bill was changed. The White House asked for an additional $700 million. We agreed to it. We agreed to fully fund peacekeeping. We agreed to fully fund the COPS Program. We agreed to a number of funding increases which the White House demanded, as a matter of good faith, to move along this piece of legislation which is so critical to the operation of our Government. 
   Specifically, this bill, as has been mentioned before on this floor, represents the funding for almost all law enforcement activities at the Federal level. The FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Border Patrol, the Federal marshals, the U.S. attorneys, the U.S. court system--all of these agencies require funding. All of these agencies need the funding in this bill to  operate effectively in our law enforcement community. 
   This bill also funds the State Department, the other Commerce Department agencies, and agencies such as the SBA, the FTC, the FCC, and the SEC, fairly significant agencies in our Government which need to operate. 
   For the President to claim that he has not been a participant in developing this bill is absolutely inaccurate. It is an inaccuracy of the worst sort because it is totally inconsistent with the facts as they occurred. 
   They participated. We changed the bill to meet their desires, except in one area, the area of NACARA, which, by the way, has nothing to do with an appropriations bill. This type of legislation should be taken up on some other bill, and by the Judiciary Committee where the jurisdiction actually lies. 
   This bill, I am sure, will be vetoed because the President has promised to do so. The Administration will throw up a lot of other issues, but those issues were essentially settled--questions such as Amy Boyer's law. We accepted the two major items they wanted; on issues such as tobacco. We essentially said: We will no longer try to take congressional control over how money is distributed to the Justice Department. You have $350 million to do with whatever you want, within the Justice Department, and in the area of litigation. You certainly do not need another $7 or $12 million earmarked to tobacco litigation. They have plenty of money for tobacco. 
   Those issues are red herrings and would not be in play at all except for this extraneous issue of NACARA. The President has once again used his bully pulpit to mislead the American public on this specific issue, which is the question of whether or not the White House played a role in developing the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. The White House not only played a role, they had a significant impact. 
   I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Missouri. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I want to speak about the appropriations agreement for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies for fiscal year 2001. This bill is part of the D.C. Appropriations bill and I thank the Senator from Texas for her help on this matter and everyone else on the subcommittee. 
   I cannot tell you how hard we have tried to work with OMB and the White House on this bill. I find it hard to believe that they want to veto the bill based on what is in here. The main issue they have difficulty with is on immigration and it was never requested by the President and is not an appropriations matter. 
   This bill does include $38.0 billion for these agencies. I believe the funding levels in this bill will allow the departments and agencies funded by it to fulfill their mandates. 
   The first title in this bill is the Department of Justice. We provide $21 billion, an increase over last year's level. Within Justice, there are a number of issues that stand out. 
   This bill provides comprehensive counter drug funding. It is our goal to provide the resources to protect our communities from the violence associated with illegal drugs. One of the most prevalent concerns in this area is the production of methamphetamine. The Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has reported an increase in clandestine lab seizures nationwide. In 1997, 3,327 labs were seized by Federal, State, and local law enforcement. By 1999, that number had escalated to 7,060. 
   Although the number of clandestine methamphetamine labs has almost doubled since 1997, the President included no funding to combat methamphetamine production, trafficking, and use in his FY 2001 budget request. We remedy that mistake here. 
   Our recommendation includes a total of $76.9 million for methamphetamine initiatives. We provide $25.9 million for investigations and day to day operations on methamphetamine cases, including maintaining a database of labs around the country. 
   Since the bi-products from methamphetamine production are hazardous, explosions or fires often result and specially equipped teams are sent in to clean-up the lab sites. We provide $20 million to the DEA through the COPS Methamphetamine Drug Hot Spots Program for clean-up activities. We have also made available for State and local law enforcement agencies $28.5 million for their methamphetamine enforcement and cleanup efforts. 
   Of course, methamphetamines are not the only problem. We provide $28.8 million to DEA for its heroin-related efforts. Because drug traffickers are highly adaptive, we must have the ability to respond where ``hot spots'' arise. The bill provides $24.2 million for Regional Drug Enforcement Teams and $53.9 million for Mobile Enforcement Teams. 
   To aid those communities that have suffered because of the presence of drug dealers, we provide $34.0 million in direct funding for the Weed and Seed program. This program distributes grant funding to qualified neighborhoods so that they can weed out criminals in their communities while seeding new prevention and intervention services to help revitalize the neighborhood. 
   The drug problem in the United States is so pervasive that over 480 drug courts have evolved to handle these particular cases. This bill includes $50.0 million through the Office of Justice Programs for drug courts; additional funding can be obtained through the Local Law Enforcement Block Grants or the Juvenile Accountability Block Grants. 
   Moving on to another important program in this bill, we continue the Safe Schools Initiative. This initiative was one the Ranking Member and I sponsored in 1999 just after the Columbine massacre. For fiscal year 2001, we provide a total of $227.5 million for State school programs with $180.0 million for school resource officers and $15.0 million for school technology. This program gives school administrators resources to enhance safety measures. It grants them the flexibility to implement decisions on how best to maintain a safe learning environment without impacting funding for educational programs. 
   The final agreement contains funding for after-school youth programs. A leader in this category is the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. For this reason, $60.0 million is available for their programs. 
   Additionally, Juvenile Mentoring Programs, JUMP, receive $16.0 million. These programs, including Big Brothers/Big Sisters, foster healthy relationships between at risk youth and responsible adults. 
   The next item is of particular interest to me. The Missing Children program is one that continues to show positive results, and is funded at a level of $23.0 million. Within this amount, $6.5 million is provided for investigative cyber units for State and local law enforcement agencies and $11.4 million for the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. 
   One of the Center's most valuable resources is the Cyber TipLine, which allows individuals to report information about missing children on-line. Information reported to the Center is compiled and made accessible to law enforcement officers all over the continent. The Center dedicates significant resources to preventing and responding to incidents of cyber stalking. Overall, this bill includes more than $830.0 million for juvenile programs through the Office of Justice programs, the juvenile justice budget, and the COPS program. 
   Our dedication to communities and families is also captured in our support of the Violence Against Women Act programs, which address domestic violence and its effects. For fiscal year 2001, we fund the program at $288.7 million. This includes funding for legal assistance, rural domestic violence initiatives, and court-appointed-special advocates. 
   At my request, this bill also recommends $11.0 million for grants to address violence on college campuses. Grantees use these funds to expand defense classes; to make capital improvements, such as installing emergency phones and improving lighting on campuses; and to train campus administrators and students on how to deal with violence and its after effects. 
   On a related topic, the conference agreement directs the Center for Sex Offender Management to develop a system through which local law enforcement can notify communities when a sex offender has been released and is living nearby. 
   Law enforcement is Justice's primary mission, and there are several key components. The U.S. Marshals are responsible for protecting our Federal judges and courthouses, for serving legal papers in Federal cases, and for recapturing fugitives. The $604.3 million recommended for the Marshals provides funds for new initiatives to apprehend the most dangerous fugitives; outfit and man new courthouses; and reduce the backlog of security upgrades at old courthouses. 
   The recommendation provides $4.6 billion for the Immigration & Naturalization Service, INS; $1.5 billion of this is derived from fees. The amount provided improves our posture on the border, expands efforts to apprehend illegal aliens in the interior, increases resources for naturalization backlog reduction, and begins to tackle the nationwide backlog on INS construction, maintenance, and repair. 
   An appropriation of $3.2 billion is dedicated to the FBI. This includes $67.5 million for the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, NICS, used by gun dealers to prevent the sale of weapons to individuals who are prohibited from owning a gun. We have reiterated the Senate recommendation that no fees be charged to conduct these checks. 
   The FBI Crime Lab is famous for its forensic capabilities, and many States rely on its scientific expertise. The bill provides $137.3 million for forensic services within the Bureau.  
   DNA testing is just one example of an important emerging forensic science. The FBI reported a 15 percent increase in the number of cases aided this year by having DNA profiles 
   available in a national database. Our recommendation includes $1.4 million for the National Offender Database, which stores the DNA profiles of convicted criminals. 
   The Internet has created numerous social and economic benefits in the United States and around the world. Unfortunately, it is also an efficient medium by which crimes can be committed. 
   The conference agreement includes an increase to $3.9 million for the FBI's Computer Analysis and Response Teams and $30.5 million for its digital storm program. In addition, we continue funding levels for the Field Computer Crime Intrusion Squads, which are highly trained computer experts available on demand to field offices. Finally, $5.5 million is recommended for the Special Technologies Applications Unit of the National Infrastructure Protection Center, a clearinghouse for Federal cases dealing with cyber crime. 
   We aggressively fund State and local law enforcement assistance, providing $2.8 billion. 
   COPS is funded at $1.03 billion. A large portion of this amount is for hiring initiatives. This high level of funding also allows law enforcement agencies to upgrade technology. For programs funded under the Crime Identification Technology Act, $130.0 million is available. There is an additional $140.0 million for non-CITA technology needs. 
   In order to get this bill passed without a veto, we have also provided $25.0 million for community prosecutors and $75.0 million for gun prosecutions. The agreement limited these funds to prosecutions of individuals who committed crimes with firearms. 
   Separate from COPS funding we provide funding for the programs that Congress traditionally supports. There is $523.0 million available for the Local Law Enforcement Block Grants, $569.0 million for the Edward Byrne Grants, and $686.5 million for State Prison Grants. 
   The last item I want to talk about in the Justice section of this bill is my proposal on how to prevent misuse of Social Security numbers. 
   We have incorporated language that will protect people from the improper use of Social Security numbers. We must protect individuals when access to an individual's most personal information is wrongly obtained. 
   A recent example of the gross misuse of a Social Security number happened in Nashua, New Hampshire, just one year ago. Amy Boyer was murdered by a stalker who was able to purchase her Social Security number on the Internet. The social security number gave him access to information so that he was able to track her down and kill her. 
   We have named the incorporated provision after Amy because its goal is to ensure that no more stalkers can easily use Social Security numbers for their nefarious acts. Amy Boyer's Law prohibits the display or sale to the public of any person's Social Security number without that individual's consent. It imposes civil and criminal penalties on those who violate this law. 
   This legislation, while banning improper or fraudulent uses of social security numbers, does preserve the legitimate uses of Social Security numbers by such groups as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America, and the Association for Children for the Enforcement of Support, ACES, as well as banks, insurance companies, and others who use these numbers to prevent fraud. I am confident that this legislation is crafted in such a way as to balance the many concerns surrounding the use of Social Security numbers. I believe that passing Amy Boyer's Law is one of the most important things that Congress can accomplish this year. 
   The next title in the bill is the Department of Commerce and its related agencies. Title II is funded at a level of $4.7 billion. 
   One of the primary functions of Commerce is to generate a comprehensive international trade policy for our country. Many agencies play a part in this effort. For the agency that has the lead on negotiating trade agreements, we provide $29.5 million for the United States Trade Representative, USTR. 
   To one of its supporting agencies, the International Trade Commission, we provide $48.1 million. Their statutory mandate also includes enforcing dumping and counterveiling duty actions in accordance with the World Trade Organization and General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
   The International Trade Administration is responsible for promoting exports and provides information on Federal Government export assistance to individuals and businesses. We provide $337.4 million. This level includes additional funding to increase trade enforcement and compliance activities, in concert with USTR. Of particular importance are the funds included in this bill for compliance activities with respect to China, Japan, and the European Union. The bill also continues funding for the core programs within the agency. 
   The bill includes $64.9 million for the Bureau of Export Administration which is an increase of roughly $10.8 million over the fiscal year 2000 appropriation. The Committee increases funding for export cooperation for the implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
   Also, increased funds are provided to assist in export enforcement in the area of counterterrorism and computer export verification to ensure that high technology exports are being used for peaceful purposes and not for proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
   We are providing significantly less money this year for the census because most of the activities supporting the decennial census have been concluded. The Committee provides $433.6 million to conclude Census 2000 and maintain normal operations for fiscal year 2001. 
   The conference agreement provides funding to permit the initiation of an effort to include a measurement of electronic business in the fiscal year 2002 economic census. The Committee's funding level should also permit the Bureau to continue issuing key reports on manufacturing, general economic, and foreign trade statistics which are so important to the U.S. business community. 
   Moving on to the scientific side of the Commerce Department, this bill includes $100.4 million for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. From within this funding, $43.5 million is for the public telecommunications grant program and $45.5 million is for information infrastructure grants. 
   The President believes solving the digital divide is a government obligation. He requested $50.0 million to provide new Home Internet Access grants. Neither the House nor Senate bills included funding for this program. However, the President made this a priority and raised it in discussions with us, so we have directed $30.0 million into the Information Infrastructure Grants as a compromise position. 
   However, I note that in an earlier age, public libraries were created to give those without the resources to maintain a personal book collection access to information. The Schools and Libraries program was created in 1996 to provide access to the Internet for every American visiting a library and to school children. 
   Just as Enoch Pratt and Andrew Carnegie endowed public libraries throughout the country, the high tech industry has the ability and the wealth to create an endowment for addressing the so-called digital divide. Every person in America who has a phone contributes to the Universal Service fund, which provides funds for the Schools and Libraries program. I do not believe that asking Americans to contribute additional funds to bring Internet access to homes is the way to solve the so-called digital divide. 
   One of the agencies whose goals is to stimulate economic competition and innovation is the National Institute for Standards and Technology, NIST. This agency provides industry with assistance to leverage their efforts in technological advances and infrastructure enhancements that benefit all of us by keeping U.S. companies on the cutting edge. 
   NIST's funding level is $598.3 million for fiscal year 2001. Of this amount, $312.6 million is for scientific and technical research and services programs; $155.0 million and carryover funding  are available for the Advanced Technology Program (ATP), and $105.1 million for the Manufacturing Extension Program (MEP). 
   Also, $10 million is provided to develop new measurements, test methods, and guidelines to better protect the information technology elements of the Nation's critical infrastructure, of which our cyber infrastructure is a key component. NIST's research results are made publicly available so that all may benefit from its findings and suggestions. 
   Another agency within the Department with scientific expertise is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The bill before you includes $2.6 billion for NOAA, and the five major line offices within NOAA are funded as follows: the National Ocean Service at a level of $290.0 million; the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) at $517.0 million; the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research at $323.0 million; the National Weather Service at $630.0 million; and, the National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service at a level of $125.0 million. 
   Within the National Ocean Service, $28.25 million for the National Estuarine Research Reserve program. We continue the efforts to reduce the backlog of NOAA mapping and charting as well as to map shorelines. The bill supports the Coastal Zone Management grants at a level of $52.0 million and the Great Lakes Environmental Research Lab at the Senate level of $7.0 million. 
   Under the National Marine Fisheries Service, we assist the collecting of scientific data on healthy fisheries as well as those that are threatened. Protection for threatened and endangered species continues. For NMFS Information, Collection, and Analysis programs, the bill provides $120 million. 
   The funding levels included in the bill for the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research support several important programs of interest to the Senate. The Sea Grant College program continues at a level of $62.25 million and $15.8 million for the National Undersea Research Program. 
   Climate and Air Quality research is funded at $68.5 million. A new climate initiative was requested for fiscal year 2001, and while the conference could not support the total request of $24.0 million, there is a recommendation of $9.25 million for initiating the ocean observations component of the proposal. 
   The National Weather Service touches all of our lives, and provides the warnings to protect life and property. The Committee funds Weather Service Operations and Research and systems acquisitions at $630.8 million. 
   NOAA's National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service operates the satellites which provide data used by the Weather Service to track hurricanes and to provide guidance for forecasts and warnings. Funding of $125.0 million is provided for this office within NOAA in fiscal year 2001. In addition, funding is provided elsewhere in the bill for the acquisition of both geostationary and polar-orbiting satellites. 
   The next title in our bill covers the Judiciary. For the third branch of government we provide an increase to $4.25 billion. We provide conditional funding for the cost of living adjustment for the justices and judges. However, the Senate Committee language ending the ban on honoraria for judges was not incorporated into this final agreement. 
   Now, for the last department in this bill, we provide $6.6 billion to the State Department. This is an increase over the fiscal year 2000 level for the department. 
   After the Dar Es Salaam and Nairobi bombings, we poured funding into State Department security, but we emphasized the need for a cohesive plan that had the capability of being effective. The past performance of the Department and resulting plans have not allayed the misgivings we have about their handling of the billions of dollars we appropriate to them. 
   We are disturbed by the security breaches. The State Department was not just lax with security overseas, but that it has been less than stellar at its headquarters here in Washington. From losing 16 laptop computers and letting press agents roam unattended through its corridors, the State Department's security plans remain of grave concern. We are providing the funding but are not seeing improvements. 
   This bill gives the State Department substantial resources to address its requirements. The funding levels include $410 million for worldwide security under Diplomatic and Consular Programs. We also provide $663.0 million in security-related construction under the Embassy Security, Construction, and Maintenance account. 
   The agreement includes a sizeable increase over last year's levels for Cultural and Educational Exchange Programs, providing $231.6 million--an amount above the President's original request and the Senate and House levels. The funding is used to bring individuals together, professionally and culturally, to share experiences to foster peace and understanding among multiple countries and the United States. My colleagues may be familiar with the Fulbright, International Visitors, and English Teaching Fellows programs that are included in this account. 
   Lastly in State, we provide $299 million to cover our country's regular dues to the United Nations and $846 million for U.N. peacekeeping. 
   We remain concerned that the United Nations continues to levy peacekeeping payments against us based on a percentage system setup during the 1970s connected to estimates on what member countries could afford to pay for such ventures at that time. The United States contests millions of dollars in payments to the United Nations because their billing procedure is outdated and does not reflect the fiscal capacities of the current member states. 
   For decades, the United States has been levied to pay roughly one-third of peacekeeping efforts even though it is an obligation of all 188 United Nations members. We will continue to encourage other members who have rebuilt and financially recovered from the ravages of the Twentieth Century's wars. They must step up and take over a more proportionate share of the financial burden of current peacekeeping endeavors. 
   This bill contains a handful of related agencies that act independently of the departments within this bill, and comprise $2.2 billion of the total of this bill. 
   The first of these agencies is the Maritime Administration which is responsible for administering several programs for the maritime industry relating to U.S. foreign and domestic commerce and our national defense. The bill includes a total of $219.6 million for its efforts. Within this level, the Maritime Security Program receives $98.7 million. The Maritime Guaranteed Loan Program (Title XI) is funded at $34.0 million. In addition, $10.0 million in carryover balances from prior fiscal years are available for this purpose. 
   The final bill before you includes an increase over last year's funding level for the Federal Communications Commission to $230.0 million. 
   The Small Business Administration (SBA) is one of the larger independent agencies in this bill. We provide $837.0 million for the SBA. Within this amount, $88 million is appropriated for the Small Business Development Centers; $15.0 million for PRIME; $3.8 million for SCORE; and, $4.0 million for the Veteran's Outreach program. 
   For SBA's business loan program account, the bill provides a total of $294 million in fiscal year 2001. This funding level provides a program level of $10.4 billion for 7(a) loans. 
   For the SBA disaster loan program, a total of $186.5 million is included to cover loans and the administration of the program. 
   The last two agencies I want to mention are the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC. We have given both these agencies increases this year, funding the FTC at a level of $147.2 million and the SEC at a level of $422.8 million. The Internet has caused a fundamental change to both these agencies as they try to put in place mechanisms to prevent fraud in the electronic market place. 
   The FTC has brought 100 cases against 300 companies and individuals for Internet fraud. As Internet access expands and more Internet businesses come on-line, the need for these agencies to have a strong presence in the market increases. There is a need to  protect consumers, and particularly elderly consumers who are prone to attacks, from ever varying fraudulent schemes. In 1999, consumers were estimated to have spent $20.2 billion on line, and the expectation is that this number will grow almost exponentially over the next 4 years. 
   We are providing additional funding for investigators and prosecutors within both the SEC and FTC to grow with the impending surge of activity. We provide funding to expand Consumer Sentinel so that international law enforcement officers will have access to it. 
   The strong presence we promote throughout this bill in the cyber-world is not one derived from statutory and regulatory restrictions, but achieved instead through the presence of enforcers of existing laws that will aggressively seek out those who abuse the Internet. I have made a point of mentioning throughout this summation the key Internet initiatives within the agencies and departments because it is such a critical issue for all of us. 
   Its importance will continue to grow. We have bolstered Federal agencies' efforts to stay on top of Internet advancements and maintain functionality in the technological world. 
   This bill effectively uses our resources to provide adequate funding for the agencies under our jurisdiction. It addresses the most pressing needs that were brought to our attention by the Administration and by my colleagues. Chairman ROGERS, the Ranking Members, and I have worked together with the members of the Committee to craft a bipartisan bill to recommend to both our houses. I do want to thank my colleague from South Carolina for his efforts in creating this bill. He remains a leader on many of the issues we address. I urge my colleagues to adopt this funding agreement. 
   Madam President, I would also like to acknowledge today the dedication of one of the staffers who drafted portions of this effort who has retired from Federal service. 
   Paddy Link served on the Committee for 4 years dealing with the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, the Commerce Department, the Small Business Administration, and many other agencies. She was an expert in FCC and NOAA. Her astute evaluation and handling of technical concepts made her a valued part of the Committee. She has in-depth knowledge of the people and issues in the areas she worked on which gave her much appreciated insight on the issues the Committee had to tackle. 
   She provided decades of Federal service, starting as staff in the House of Representatives, moving to the Department of Commerce as a congressional liaison officer and then to be the director of the office of legislative affairs for the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. Most recently before her time with Appropriations, Paddy was the staff director of the Senate Commerce Committee under former Chairman Larry Pressler and had a critical role in writing and passing the Telecommunications Act of 1996. 
   We miss her political acumen as well as her sense of humor. We wish her the best of luck in the future.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, I congratulate the Senator from Ohio and the ranking member, the Senator from Maryland, for bringing this bill forward, the chairman and ranking members of the subcommittee, and also the chairman of the full committee and ranking member of the full committee, the Senators from Vermont and Massachusetts. 
   The Older Americans Act is a significant piece of legislation. I had the good fortune to chair this subcommittee for a number of years and worked very hard on this piece of legislation. Regrettably, at that time we were unable to pass it all the way through the Congress. Certainly, the work of the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Maryland in getting it to this point is significant and positive for senior citizens of America. 
   This is a very important piece of legislation. There is no question about that. The changes made to this bill are extremely constructive to making the plan more flexible, more vibrant, more effective for our seniors and for the States in their ability to administer this program. Again, they have done an excellent job and I look forward to voting for final passage of the full bill. 
   There is, however, one area where I have reservations about the mechanisms in the bill which are designed to protect the money and make sure the money flows to the benefit of senior citizens. The whole object of this piece of legislation is to benefit our seniors primarily in meals programs, employment programs, and a variety of other programs. It is extremely critical that the dollars that are spent not get tied up in bureaucracy and not get abused or misused, not be subject to fraudulent activity but, rather, actually flow through the 
   system to the benefit of seniors; in the specific area of title V, which is the employment program of the bill, that the dollars flow for the purposes of employing seniors in jobs that can be constructive for them and give them a better lifestyle. That is the purpose of this bill. 
   The problem, the concern, I have with the bill is that I do not believe it is strong enough in the area of enforcing the discipline in order to assure that the dollars flow through and end up benefiting the seniors of our country. 
   I have suggested some changes to the bill which are part of this amendment. The bill has what is known as a responsibility test in title V which essentially lays out approximately 12 different areas where the Department must review the activities of grantees in order to determine whether or not they are delivering services correctly. 
   Let me step back a minute and explain that there are a series of grantees under this title V proposal. One group is funded at the State level; another group is funded at the Federal level. The group funded at the Federal level is made up of a series of named agencies, specific agencies. Some of them are extraordinarily good at what they do. For example, Green Thumb does an extremely good job. Our parks department does an extremely good job. These agencies every year get what amounts to an entitlement, a specific amount of money to specifically grant to them $350 million in total which flows to each one of these agencies without any competition. 
   With most Federal grants, most Federal contracts, if you want to build a road or you want to start a program of social service somewhere, you want to help people out in a day-care center, you have to usually compete, go through a system of applying to the proper Federal agency and competing for that money to see if the program you are proposing makes more sense that the program somebody else is proposing. That is called good government, creating that atmosphere of competition so that different ideas come to the table. 
   In the area of these initiatives, I think nine agencies get the money independent of any competition. They get this money as an entitlement. It is simply a check written every year to them and they get it under the law. They don't have to compete for it.  They don't have to apply for it. All they have to do is go to the Department of Labor and pick up their check. 
   Obviously, when you have that structure, you are bypassing one of the safeguards for making sure that the money is effectively spent and that it flows to the people who deserve it. You are bypassing the safeguard of annual competition for the funds--a fairly significant decision, by the way. 
   When you do bypass that safeguard, you need to put into the law something that makes sense in the area of giving the Department of Labor oversight over those dollars so the Department of Labor has the authority and the capacity to look at a grantee who has an absolute right to this money and say: Well, even though you have an absolute right to this money, Mr. or Mrs. Grantee, you have to do a better job or we are going to have to question whether you should get the money. If you don't do a better job, we will have to put you through some disciplines to get you to do a better job or, alternatively--and this is where I am really concerned--if you happen to misuse this money, if you happen to use it in a way which is totally inappropriate to the purposes of assisting seniors in getting better employment, the Department of Labor should have the authority to go in and say you can't have that money any longer. 
   I mean, that is just logical to me. This is pure logic, as far as I see; ``intuitively obvious through observation,'' as a professor of mine once said. 
   If someone is abusing the money, the Department of Labor ought to have the right to go in and reduce that grant, or maybe even eliminate the grant, take the money back and redistribute it to people who are using it effectively, such as Green Thumb. 
   But, under the present law, that is not the case. That type of authority really does not rest with the Department of Labor. There are procedures the Department of Labor can go through, but the complication, bureaucracy, and time limit involved in executing those procedures makes them virtually useless. As a result, there is no clear-cut way for the Department of Labor to, essentially, make accountable those agencies which presently have what amounts to an entitlement from the Department of Labor and from us, the Congress, for $350 million. 
   What my legislation does is try to address that issue. It tries to add to the responsibility test which is in the bill. The present responsibility test in the bill has good language, but unfortunately it does not have good enforcement and does not have the language we need in order to accomplish enforcement in any sort of reasonable timeframe. It tries to add to that language tightening elements which will make it more effective for the Department of Labor. 
   Let me run through it briefly. Essentially what it does is it says: First, the grantees have to have the proven ability to do what they say they are going to do. That is reasonable. You wouldn't want someone who cannot establish that. It says if they misuse the funds--including doing lobbying or litigation against the Federal Government, which is illegal, by the way; they are not allowed to do that--if they misuse the funds and the Secretary identifies that or an independent inspector general audit identifies that or there are official inquiries of the Federal Government that identify that, that misuse of funds is cause for the Department of Labor to move and take the money back from that grantee. It does not have to, but it creates a cause that allows the Department of Labor to do that. One would think they would because why would the Department of Labor want to fund somebody who had been found by, for example, the General Accounting Office or the inspector general, to have misused funds? So that only makes sense, in my opinion. 
   It also tightens the disallowance. Under the present proceedings, you can have a 5-percent misuse of funds and still get away with it. There is law that says basically if you want to take 5 percent of your grant and misuse it, essentially you are going to get protection. We move that down to 2 percent, which I think seems a little more reasonable. Then what it says is, if there is a grantee who has misused funds, who has been found by the Department of Labor or the IG or the GAO, some group that has the imprimatur of authority of the Federal Government--if that group determines there has been a misuse of funds and revokes the grant, then the dollars get rebid. The dollars flow back into the pool, the pot; they are not lost. They go back into title V and they get rebid. 
   For example, if one of the nine grantees were found to be acting inappropriately, misusing funds--inappropriateness doesn't lose your funds but misusing funds, fraudulently using 
   funds, that grantee loses its funds--that money would go back in the pool and logically somebody such as Green Thumb or some other agency which has a respectable track record and knows what they are doing and has not been using the money for inappropriate activities and has been getting the money out to the senior citizens would have the right to compete to get those dollars. That is the theme of this amendment: good government, it is called; a good government amendment. 
   Why do we need it? We need it because we have an example of one of these agencies that gets an entitlement acting in a way which essentially has been a misuse of funds. Yet there has been no way to remove that agency from the list of those who get an entitlement. This agency is, today, called the National Senior Citizens Education and Research Center. It used to be known as the National Council of Senior Citizens. I think it is important to review the things this group has done with these tax dollars which have flowed to it for the purposes of helping seniors, and have turned out to be doing a lot less than that. In fact, they have been found by innumerable Federal reviews to have actually been misusing those funds in a way that is significant. 
   This is not a small agency. This agency every year gets $64 million in tax money written to it as a check, as an entitlement--$64 million. That is a lot of money to be flowing to an agency without any competition, without any oversight in the sense it has to justify how it uses those dollars or, when it does have to justify them, actually has to produce a result, as we will see from what they have actually done as an agency. So it is not small dollars. 
   The IG took a number of looks at this. I think it is important to review what the IG has found. The IG found this grantee has misused over $10 million of Federal taxes since 1992--$10 million. In an audit in 1992-1994--and remember, the IG does not audit every year, so it could have been more. Who knows? But from an audit in 1992-1994, they questioned $5.8 million of direct costs claimed by the National Council of Senior Citizens as not allowable under OMB regulations. These regulations are regulations the Department did not enforce: $3.8 million for health insurance refunds that it received from insurers providing health coverage for seniors participating in the JOBS Program. 
   This may seem to be a worthy endeavor, purchasing health insurance for seniors. It is. But the IG found the National Council of Senior Citizens paid premiums out of its DOL account but received refunds based on favorable claim experiences and, instead of using the refunds to offset the earlier charges to the DOL grant, the National Council of Senior Citizens essentially pocketed the money. Under the Federal regulation, Circular A-122 of the OMB, the refund should have been credited directly to the costs of the program. But they were not; $1.1 million of direct costs were questioned in 1992 and 1994 because the National Council of Senior Citizens charged its DOL grant the cost of incurring the administration for this health insurance program on which they got the refunds. 
   Here is a clever little scheme. They charged a fee to the insurer and claimed the fee for administering the plan was membership promotion income. The fee should have gone to reduce the DOL grant cost as required under the circular I just cited. But, instead, the money went into--where? The National Council of Senior Citizens' pockets. We will later get to what 
   that money went to and, believe me, it was not senior citizens. It is very interesting where this money ended up. This trail leads down some very interesting roads. 
   Mr. President, $580,000 of the $850,000 total general liability insurance cost was also questioned during the 1992-1994 audit as being an arm's length  transaction because the insurance company shared the same management as the personnel of the National Council of Senior Citizens, and it was not competitively bid. In other words, the National Council of Senior Citizens was hiring its leadership to run an insurance company to insure its programs. That has a very suspicious note to it, I would think, under any program. It is a very disturbing finding by the audit. 
   This very disturbing finding by the audit was that the liability company, which was being run by the National Council of Senior Citizens, appeared to be related almost entirely to the National Council of Senior Citizens and its affiliated entities. Many of the insurance company board members were members of the National Council of Senior Citizens' executive management group. 
   This is not my information, by the way. This is information found by the IG. The IG found this liability insurance to not be an arm's length transaction, and the DOL, Department of Labor, has even concluded that all of the costs of the policy should be disallowed. 
   So you have what appears to be a sham contract, not an arm's length contract, for $850,000 that was not even competed out. The Department of Labor has agreed with the bulk of these findings from the 1992-1994 audit and has issued a final determination that requires the National Council of Senior Citizens to repay millions of dollars in questionable funds. Has the agency repaid these funds? No, it has not. In fact, they have appealed the administrative law judge decision, and are currently in a discovery process. 
   Then there is, of course, the fact that they will probably go to Federal court, all the time keeping these funds which are so clearly being misused. 
   Believe me, they are not running to benefit any senior citizen who is trying to get a job under this program. 
   All during this process, they have been running this sham operation--that is my term; ``it is not an arm's length transaction'' was the IG's term--all during this process they have been receiving $64 million a year every year, just being paid out. 
   There are other items about this organization that are working their way through the Department of Labor which are showing there are even more serious issues and significant problems. 
   An IG report reviewing the 1995 funds--remember, the ones I was talking about reviewed 1992 to 1994--finds identical violations--identical violations. In other words, after they have already been found to have violated the rules of the Department of Labor, the rules of the Office of Management and Budget, and the rules of objectivity, identical violations were committed in 1995, and it was recommended $2.8 million be disallowed. 
   There are still other audits reviewing 1996 and part of 1997 that call into question approximately $2.7 million. This grantee has simply not, under any reasonable test, been administering these funds in a responsible way. It has been misusing these funds. 
   As if these types of findings are not bad enough, there is another audit from the IG dated April 24, 1998--fairly recently--which exposes a $6.1 million slush fund at the National Council of Senior Citizens maintained for over 14 years. This fund, which they euphemistically call a contingency fund, was set up in 1984 with $3.7 million in Federal funds to provide financial assistance to enrollees ``in case the JOBS Program had been terminated by the Congress or the administration.'' In other words, they set up a slush fund, the purpose of which was to continue the program in case Congress, by some decision, decided the program was not any good. In other words, they were going to be an extraordinary form of government. We now do not have three branches of Government, we have a fourth over here. It is called the National Council of Senior Citizens which had decided even if Congress determined, which it has not and which it will not, that title V did not make sense, they were going to continue to run title V with tax dollars. That is a new form of government in our midst. 
   The program was not terminated, of course. It has continued. It will continue as far as the eye can see because it is a program which, on balance, has worked extraordinarily well for our seniors. 
   Has the slush fund been terminated which was set up in 1984 in case there was a contingency that this program might be terminated? Has that slush fund been terminated? No, it has not. The IG found it. After the IG discovered the fund, by then the money had been transferred to a trust fund. It recommended the money be returned to the Treasury, but the National Council of Senior Citizens filed a lawsuit in Federal court saying they should be able to keep the money. 
   This is unacceptable. It should be unacceptable to all of us. Anybody who is interested in good government should say, on the face of it, this is an unacceptable action by somebody who is using our Federal dollars in trust for the purposes of helping seniors get jobs. 
   Many of the grantees who participate in these programs, 
   even the entitlement grantees--in fact, all the entitlement grantees--do so with the understanding that they have local and community organizations; they basically take the money from the Federal Government under this entitlement, and they funnel it out to the local community organizations which then manage the money and the people they administer. Green Thumb is a classic example of this. Urban League and ARP are other examples. This is a very legitimate, good way to do it. They have a national organization and send it out to the local organization. That is the concept behind this. 
   This is why we had, I presume, although I do not know, the original nine grantees. I hope nine is right. Nine grantees were picked because they were national but they had local organizations or they at least represented they would. 
   The National Council of Senior Citizens does not. It does not have local affiliates. Instead, they function exclusively as a middleman program. They subcontract the services and the job placement out to other nonprofit organizations in States. They do not have a unique expertise to bring to the table. They are simply an intermediary. 
   In their case, they are an intermediary which takes a fair amount of the money and keeps it here in Washington, as it would appear, under their insurance program to benefit an insurance company with which it is affiliated, in the sense its membership is the same membership as the National Council of Senior Citizens group, and that it creates a slush fund with the money, and that the IG in 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998 found in violation of the rules of the Department of Labor and the Office of Management and Budget. 
   One has to wonder why we need such a middleman. Would it not make more sense, if we are going to have these entitlement programs, if we at least send them to people who are using the money to benefit seniors and give them jobs, such as the Urban League, ARP, or Green Thumb, and let them compete for it. 
   There is something equally disturbing about this organization because, as I said earlier, where did this money go? What were they doing? It is my understanding that at one point almost 90 percent of the money of this organization came from this entitlement, and even today this entitlement makes up a huge amount of their funds. So shouldn't they be basically working on senior citizens issues? You say, yes, that is right, of course. 
   It turns out that a lawsuit in New York City involving the Teamsters Union and the illegal use of cash in the electoral process for the president of the Teamsters Union, which some may remember involved transferring money from the Democratic National Committee to the Teamsters Union and the Teamsters Union to the Democratic National Committee--back and forth and in and out--that in that lawsuit, lo and behold, the National Council of Senior Citizens ended up being named as an unindicted co-conspirator. 
   According to the scheme outlined by the Federal prosecutors in the court documents, the Teamsters allegedly funneled money illegally into the National Council of Senior Citizens, which then arranged to hire direct mailing firms whose president applied a portion of the money received to the campaign for the presidency of the Teamsters Union.  
   Money, of course, is fungible, but one has to presume that some of the operating dollars was being used by the National Council of Senior Citizens to float this exercise with the Teamsters Union. You explain to me why funds which are supposed to be flowing to benefit seniors getting jobs are flowing to get the president of the Teamsters Union elected president of the Teamsters Union. Explain that to us and tell us that we, as a Senate, justify allowing this to happen. It is pretty hard to explain. 
   Is that their only illegal campaign activity? No, it is not. In yet another instance involving the same organization, the Federal Election Commission conducted an investigation of the National Council of Senior Citizens, and as part of the complaint filed relating to the 1994 Virginia Senate race, that investigation resulted in the National Council of Senior Citizens admitting that they had violated the law, and I believe they actually paid a fine as a result of violating an election campaign law. 
   These election violations involved paying for publications specifically endorsing candidates, making illegal corporate advances, and coordinating activities of political candidates. 
   This, by the way, is an organization which gets a majority of its funding or has traditionally gotten a majority of its funding, as a result of an entitlement to tax dollars, the purpose of those tax dollars being to hire senior citizens to give them work so they can have a better lifestyle. 
   So one would guess that maybe--this is only a guess or a projection--maybe some of that contingency fund, otherwise known as a slush fund that the IG found was used at least potentially, because money is fungible, be exchanged with the dollars which were being used, in the FEC's opinion, in violation of campaign financing, and in opinion of the U.S. attorney for the district of New York for the purposes of being an unindicted co-conspirator in the election of the president of the Teamsters Union, who later lost his election. He won the election, but it was sort of one of those elections that was thrown out because there was so much inappropriateness about it; and he was found to have violated the law in that election as did a number of other individuals. 
   So this organization has a pretty sour--and ``poor'' would be generous--track record on the management and use of the funds which flowed to it as an entitlement under title V. 
   Does my language specifically say this organization gets defunded? No, it does not. I would certainly hope there would be a conclusion by the Department of Labor that this sort of action was intolerable and that tax dollars should not be used in this way. They should not be used to create slush funds. They should not be used to fund liability in health insurance corporations which are closely connected to the management of the group that is paying for them. They should not be used in a mismanaged way, as the IG has found. I would certainly hope that. 
   But my amendment does not specifically say the National Council of Senior Citizens, which has now been renamed--I always forget its new name, but I guess it is changing its name again anyway. It changes its name a lot. I can't, quite honestly, understand why they did that. They are going to change its name again and are going to be absorbed into the AFL-CIO, which is the original creator of the organization. 
   The National Senior Citizens Education and Research Center --the National Council of Senior Citizens--which will soon be an AFL arm, that the organization should lose its funding and that those funds should be made available to other agencies which are doing the job right, does my amendment say that has to happen? No, it does not. 
   What my amendment says is this. I will run through it. Basically, it boils down to saying we should manage these Federal resources in the way they are intended; that we should manage them for the purposes of giving senior citizens jobs, and making sure the people who are responsible for giving them jobs are responsible organizations. That is essentially what my amendment does. 
   Let me run through the specifics so people understand this is a reasonably benign amendment. I do not know why it has been resisted. I find the resistance, in light of what the National Council of Senior Citizens has done--in fact, we have a track record of an agency that has clearly misused funds-- 
   highly inappropriate. 
   But in the first part of my amendment, basically, I take the responsibility tests section of the present bill, and I add to them language which says, first, there must be proven ability of the agency which is getting these entitlement dollars from the Federal Government to do the job of delivering a senior citizen employment program. There is nothing unreasonable about that. 
   Second, we say the Secretary must do a timely review of each agency to determine that they have the capacity to do the job they claim they are going to do. 
   There is a problem here in that sometimes these----

   Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair, and I especially thank the Senator from Nevada for his courtesy in allowing me to proceed. 
   Anyway, the first section goes to requiring proven ability. 
   The second section requires that there be timely reviews and that there be no disruption of service. In other words, I do not want seniors losing their jobs because the agency has come in and said that somebody has been misusing their funds. 
   Thirdly, we make it clear that in three major areas if you are found to be in violation of the responsibility test, you lose your funding if the Department of Labor decides to do that. 
   The first two are already in the bill: fraud and debts after three demand letters. The third one, which I am putting in, is:  
   Established misuse of funds, including the use of funds to lobby or litigate against any Federal entity or official or to provide compensation for any lobbying or litigation activity identified by the Secretary, independent Inspector General audits, or other official inquiries or [audits] by the Federal Government.  
   In addition, as I mentioned earlier, we basically lower the hold harmless from 5 percent to 2 percent. 
   Lastly--and I think equally importantly--we put in a competition clause so if it is determined that one of these agencies does not qualify, is misusing funds, or has acted fraudulently, then the funds can be competed out. 
   We also make it clear that the Department of Labor can use some of the extra money which they retained from this program for the purposes of auditing programs to make sure they are being done correctly. 
   The important point here is this. I am not suggesting anything radical. I am not suggesting anything even remotely 
   outrageous or excessive. All I am saying is, let's, under this responsibility test, have some teeth. Let's make it possible for the Department of Labor to come in, and when they find that a group has been acting inappropriately with these funds, misusing these funds, let's give them the authority they need to take action. They may not take action, but let's at least give them the authority to do that. 
   Under the present responsibility test, and the time constraints, and the bureaucracy, it is 3 years, at a minimum, before they could take action--3 years for the National Council of Senior Citizens; that is $64 million a year, almost $200 million of taxpayer money being misused. 
   We have already had audits which establish beyond a question that one  agency has acted inappropriately and has misused the funds. It is appropriate we give the Department of Labor the authority to act, so if they determine that, they can take action to make sure the money ends up where it is supposed to be, which is in the pockets of seniors who deserve to have jobs and need those jobs for a better lifestyle. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, first, I appreciate the kind words that have been expressed relative to my efforts on this bill. They are minor compared to the efforts of the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Maryland who have worked very hard. 
   The underlying bill is a strong bill. Remember, we are talking about a 5-year authorization. We are not talking about 1 day, 2 days, 1 year, or 2 years. We are talking about 5 years. We are talking about continuing the status quo for another 5 years on this piece of legislation. 
   This amendment is about good government. The amendment is: Are you for language which says that a grantee that misuses the funds can be disciplined by the Department of Labor? It is that simple. It is generic. If the Department of Labor determines that a grantee misuses funds, this gives the Department of Labor the capacity to do something about that. 
   As I talked about earlier today, we have an example of one of the grantees, the National Council of Senior Citizens, which has grossly misused funds, which set up a slush fund of $6 million, which spent over $10 million basically to pay for expenses for insurance, which were insurance organizations operated by the same people who ran the National Council of Senior Citizens, which has had an audit in the years 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998, all of which audits have shown it has misused funds. 
   If we do not adopt this amendment, that organization will continue to get $64 million a year, will continue to misuse those funds, and the Department of Labor will not have the authority to act against that organization in anything that is even conceivably a reasonable timeframe. Under this bill, as it is presently structured, the fastest timeframe in which the Department of Labor can act against an organization which has acted in the manner in which this organization has acted is 3 years. Even then it is not an issue because there is no language for activity for misuse of funds. They would have to raise it to a level of  criminal or fraudulent activity, which is a standard that is very hard to prove. 
   It is very obvious that American tax dollars are not being used for the purposes of employing senior citizens, which should be our goal. I am asking for some extremely reasonable good government language to be inserted into this bill. The only argument I have heard today against this language is essentially that, if this little amendment goes in, this bill dies. 
   I say to my colleagues, that is absurd on its face. We are not leaving here very soon. Regrettably, I wish we were leaving here today. A lot of us wish we were leaving here today, but we are not. I happen to know of three major pieces of legislation which are not going to be completed today. They probably are not going to be completed tomorrow. It is a fairly safe bet that we are going to be back next week. In fact, I can almost guarantee it. I can say that with some authority because I happen to chair one of the committees which has jurisdiction over one of these pieces of legislation, the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill. That bill is not going to be completed today, and it is probably not going to be completed this week, and probably we will be back next week. 
   The same is true of the Labor-HHS bill, and the same is true of the tax bill. We know we are going to be able to take this amendment, send it back to the House, have it passed, and come back here and pass the whole bill. 
   If that is the reason this language is being opposed, it is inaccurate. This language can be inserted, this bill can be reformed and it can be corrected, and the bill can be brought back to us and passed. 
   The House of Representatives passed this bill overwhelmingly. This language is not debilitating to the bill. It is an attempt to make the bill function as it should. 
   What should it do? It should make sure that when we give $350 million a year to agencies without requiring them to bid on the programs, when we give them an entitlement that says, you get this money; you just walk up to the window and we give it to you, at least those agencies should be required not to misuse the money; that those agencies should be required to spend the money for the purposes of employing senior citizens, not for the purpose of creating a slush fund, not for the purpose of financing a Teamsters Union election, not for the purpose of financing a campaign against a Senator, not for the purpose of creating an insurance vehicle which benefits the underlying agency. 
   It should be that those moneys should be used for the senior citizens, to be employed under the bill under title V. 
   That is all this language does. It is benign language. Without this language, we will essentially continue a process that allows these agencies to come to the window, take the money, and run, without adequate accountability. Even more importantly, there will be no competition and no performance standards. 
   So the language is reasonable. It needs to be included in the bill. The timing of this bill is not such that this language is going to kill the bill. The momentum for this bill is immense. There is no way that this bill will not pass with this language in it if this amendment is agreed to. The bill will pass. The bill will be conferenced. The bill will be back here. The bill will be voted on before we adjourn as a Senate or a Congress. So that debate is inaccurate. 
   So I hope that this language, which is a very reasonable attempt to address what is regrettably a glaring problem in the delivery of these services, will be accepted. I hope people would not vote against something so simple as a statement that we should allow the Department of Labor to discipline people who misuse tax dollars. To vote against that is really to take a position which I think is very hard to defend. 
   We are going to vote on this amendment. I would certainly appreciate my colleagues not being swayed by the argument that a vote for my amendment will bring the bill down because that argument is a red herring, in my opinion, because we are going to be here next week and we can certainly pass this bill next week. It will pass on a voice vote once this amendment is taken. In fact, it will pass by unanimous agreement. 
   But, rather, I hope my colleagues will be swayed by the fact that if we fail to include this amendment, we will continue to have the issue of whether or not the dollars we are spending to employ seniors, to make their lives better, are, instead, going to be able to be spent to benefit some agency in some way that has no relationship to seniors and their needs. A good government requires that this type of language be put in the bill. Therefore, I ask my colleagues to support the amendment. 
   Mr. President, I understand that all time on the other side has been used; is that correct?

    Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is with great sadness that I rise to note the recent passing of the Reverend Dr. Bennie Thayer. Dr. Thayer was an extraordinary and inspiring figure in the eyes of all who knew him, and I would like to take this opportunity to describe for the record just a few of his achievements and his many attributes. 
   I have found it striking that the people who are now mourning Dr. Thayer's loss come from so many different backgrounds and walks of life. Clearly this was a man who touched many people in many different ways. Dr. Thayer was an ordained minister, the Senior Pastor at the United Methodist Church of the Redeemer in Temple Hills, Maryland. He also worked tirelessly to expand the political activities and economic opportunities for African Americans, both within his community and across the nation. His funeral last Saturday literally produced an overflow crowd--testimony to the high esteem in which he was held in religious communities, in political circles, and among many others. 
   Reverend Thayer was also the President and the CEO of the National Association for the Self-Employed, and it was in this capacity that I had come to know him. Along with Senator JOHN BREAUX, Congressman JIM KOLBE and Congressman CHARLIE STENHOLM, I co-chaired the CSIS National Commission on Retirement Policy. In the course of our work we took testimony from all sorts of groups--seniors' groups, youth advocacy groups, employer groups, and others--and it was through the gathering this testimony that my office first established regular contact with Reverend Thayer. 
   Among those who worked in the area of Social Security reform, Dr. Thayer stood out for his passionate and unswerving dedication to his cause. He also stood out in every other respect as well. He was an impressive, imposing figure of a man, with a deep and sonorous voice that he used to tremendous effect. And he was always there to do whatever was necessary to advance the work in which he so deeply believed. In the rough and tumble world of Social Security politics, it is easy to become discouraged or demoralized, but Dr. Thayer was unfazed by any setback. Regardless of the short-term fortunes, he always kept his eye on the long-term horizon, and applied all of his considerable gifts and his hard work to achieving it. 
   All of us who knew Dr. Thayer admired him deeply for his willingness to argue passionately for an unconventional position when he knew that he was right. What was striking about Dr. Thayer's oratorical style was that he always strove to appeal to the very best instincts in his listeners--never selfishness, never division, never despair--always hope, opportunity, advancement, responsibility, self-reliance, and giving all that one can. There's a poignant example of this in a recent speech that he gave in Nashville, Tennessee, ``The Power of Small Business for Wealth Creation in the Minority Community''--when he talks about why he felt that African Americans should support reform of the Social Security system. To quote from his words: 
   ``First, African Americans tend to start working at a younger age than whites. So we pay taxes into the system for more years than whites. And second, African-Americans also have shorter life expectancies than whites. The average African-American male currently has a life expectancy of less than the retirement age of 65! So many African-Americans will spend their entire working lives paying taxes into Social Security. But then, they won't draw out a dime in retirement benefits. Or accumulate any wealth to pass along to their children, or other heirs.'' This is typical of his approach; noting not what was in it for him--but what kind of legacy was being left behind. 
   The sad irony here is that Bennie himself died at the age of 61. When one heard Bennie speak those words, one didn't think that he was talking about himself. I think that everyone close to him assumed that he had come so far in life that he would beat the odds. 
   And indeed Reverend Thayer had come very far from his birthplace in Pickens County, South Carolina. He was fully 36 when he received his bachelor's degree from the University of Maryland, 54 when he received his master's in divinity, and 58 when he received his doctorate of divinity. His biography shows the mark of a man who was always striving, always working to create the next opportunity. But when you look carefully at the opportunities that he sought, they so frequently centered on creating new hopes for others--promoting economic opportunities with the National Association of the Self-Employed, spiritual guidance through his ministry, bequeathing wealth to our children and our grandchildren through reform of the Social  Security system. This theme of striving to create a constructive and uplifting legacy ran throughout his life and throughout his work. 
   Dr. Thayer was an extraordinary man who led an extraordinary life. He is already deeply missed.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, in his 1991 book ``Assets and the Poor: a New American Welfare Policy,'' Washington University Professor Michael Sherraden argues that people move forward economically through savings and investment, not through spending and consumption. Owning assets gives people a stake in the future--a reason to save, to dream, and to invest time, effort and resources in creating a future for themselves and their children. As Sherraden puts it, ``income may feed people's stomachs, but assets change their heads.'' 
   I am pleased today to be joined by Senator HARKIN in introducing legislation designed to further promote innovative asset-building strategies for the poor. 
   Over the past two years, asset-building strategies have gained widespread, bi-partisan support at both the federal and state levels. Legislation has been introduced and laws have been enacted to develop and promote Individual Development Accounts (IDAs) among low income Americans. IDAs reward the monthly savings of working poor families who are trying to buy their first home, pay for post secondary education, or start a business. 
   In some respects, IDAs are like Individual Retirement Accounts for the working poor. IDAs are dedicated savings accounts that can be used for purchasing a first home, paying for post-secondary education, or capitalizing business. These investments are associated with extremely high rates of return that have the potential to bring a new level of economic and personal security to families and communities. Participants also are able to make emergency withdrawals in limited circumstances and must pay back such withdrawals within 12 months. 
   The individual or family deposits whatever dollar amount they can save (typically $5 to $20 a month) into the account. The sponsoring organization matches that deposit with funds provided by local churches and service organizations, corporations, foundations, and state or local governments. The sponsoring organization determines the ratio at which they will match an individual's contribution (not less than $0.50 and not more than $4 for every $1). 
   In 1998, Congress enacted legislation entitled the ``Assets for Independence Act''. This Act established a five year demonstration program to determine the social, civic, psychological and economic effects that individual development account, IDA, savings accounts can have on low income individuals and their families. The assets for independence demonstration program is presently the largest source of federal funding for individual development accounts. 
   The intent of this demonstration program is to encourage participants to develop and reinforce strong habits for saving money. To assist this, sponsor organizations provide participating individuals and families intensive financial counseling and counseling to develop investment plans for education, home ownership, and entrepreneurship. In addition, participating welfare and low-income families build assets whose high return on investment has the capacity for propelling them into independence and stability.  
   The community also benefits from the significant return on investment in IDAs: we expect welfare rolls to be reduced, tax receipts to increase, employment to increase, and local enterprises and builders can expect local businesses to benefit from increased activity. Neighborhoods will be rejuvenated as new micro-enterprises and increased home renovation and building drive increased employment and community development. 
   In fact, it is estimated that an investment of $125 million in assert building through these individual accounts will generate 7,050 new businesses, 68,799 new jobs, $730 million in additional earnings, 12,000 new or rehabilitated homes, $287 million in savings and matching contributions and earnings on those accounts, $188 million in increased assets for low-income families, 6,600 families removed from welfare rolls, 12,000 youth graduates from vocational education and college programs, 20,000 adults obtaining high school, vocational, and college degrees. 
   IDA programs currently exist in about 250-300 communities, with another 100 in development. Overall, at least 10,000 people are currently saving in an IDA and another 30,000-40,000 are expected to be reached by the year 2003. All but three states have IDA programs in their states or mechanisms in place to permit the start up of an IDA program. 
   The field of economic development has rapidly changed over the course of the last few years, and as a result, those administering IDAs on a national basis have sought to work within the structure defined by Congress. Unfortunately, because of changes in the field and certain unforeseen difficulties with the implementation of the demonstration in its current form, we have been asked to consider making a handful of technical changes that will help with program administration and make the program run more consistently and effectively. 
   Those changes include: (1) changing the legal accounting structure of IDAs; (2) expanding the potential field of grantees to include low-income credit unions and community development financial institutions; (3) providing additional flexibility for withdrawals from IDA accounts for the purchase of a home; (4) expanding the availability of funds for economic literacy training; and (5) adding a Federal poverty measure to the current eligibility criteria; and (6) making the AFIA and TANF Individual Development Account programs consistent with respect to the treatment of funds for purposes of determining eligibility for Federal programs based on need. 
   These are modest but needed changes in the law that will help Federal IDA programs function more as originally intended. I urge their adoption.

    Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate one of our nation's finest Olympians, Jenny Thompson. This week, Jenny set herself apart from the rest of the world. With 10 Olympic medals, 8 of which are gold, Jenny has become the most decorated Olympic female swimmer of all time. As an American, I am very proud of our U.S. Olympic athletes, but I am especially proud of Jenny Thompson, from my home state of New Hampshire. 
   Jenny first appeared on swimming's national stage in the mid-1980's when she began swimming for the Seacoast Swimming Association in Dover, New Hampshire for coach Mike Parratto. At the age of 15, Jenny just missed making the 1988 U.S. Olympic Swim Team, but her success as a young athlete drew the attention of college swimming programs from around the country. Jenny began attending Stanford University in 1991, and in 1992, she became the first woman in 61 years to set a world record in the 100 meter freestyle event. She followed up on her new world record by leading Stanford to a 27-0 dual-meet record, four PAC-10 titles and four consecutive NCAA Championships. Through her leadership and her firm sense of teamwork, Jenny Thompson was elevated to team captain and served as a mentor for Stanford's more recent arrivals to the natatorium. 
   In addition to Jenny's team accomplishments, she managed to swim her way to 19 NCAA titles, the most in women's collegiate swimming history. Having also captured 23 U.S. national titles, Jenny is the most successful active swimmer in the United States. 
   When Jenny arrived in Sydney, Australia, she did so with five gold medals and one silver medal. She has now added to her Olympic success by again leading the U.S. women's relay team to gold in the 4 x 100 meter freestyle relay, setting another new world record, and the 4 x 100 meter medley relay. Additionally, Jenny continued to show her competitive edge as an individual by medaling in the 100 meter freestyle, winning the bronze. 
   Jenny Thompson's performance at the 2000 Sydney Olympics has made her the most decorated female Olympian in the United States and the most successful female Olympic swimmer in history. Aside from her achievements at the Olympics and Stanford University, Jenny has won numerous World Championships and accumulated countless awards and honors as an athlete. She has always displayed team spirit and professionalism in and around the pool, showing that character is one of her finest assets. Her contribution to the sport of swimming is unmatched and has left a lasting impression in the minds and hearts of all who have watched her represent the United States throughout the years. Jenny Thompson has inspired a generation of young swimmers to dream and achieve their goals, to think positively and to work hard. 
   Jenny Thompson will enter Columbia University Medical School next fall, where I know she will be successful. Her drive and desire will surely allow her to achieve her goals as she makes  her way into a different stage of her life. I am confident that Jenny will continue to be a role model for all, and I hope that she knows we are proud of her. New Hampshire is proud of her, our nation is proud of her, and we wish her nothing but the best in her future endeavors.

    Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor B.J. Bedford, a gold medalist for the 2000 United States Olympic Swim Team and originally from the town of Hanover in my home state of New Hampshire. B.J. has been a competitive swimmer in national standings for years. She competed in the 1988 Olympic trials when she was just 15 years old. After three Olympic trials and a successful 12 year career in domestic competition, B.J.'s hard work has paid off this year as she secured a spot on the U.S. Swim Team for the 2000 Summer Games. 
   B.J.'s participation in the XXVII Olympiad certainly adds to a long and illustrious career in swimming. B.J. Bedford has qualified and competed in four Olympic trials, winning the 100 meter backstroke this year, set an American record in the 50 meter backstroke, and won seven U.S. National Titles in the 50, 100 and 200 meter backstroke and two gold medals for relays at the 1998 World Championships. On September 23, 2000, B.J. Bedford became the holder of a new world record. Swimming the backstroke leg of the 4 x 100 meter medley relay, B.J. and three of her teammates won gold in Sydney and smashed the previously held world record by an incredible three seconds. 
   Her outstanding work in the pool, along with her display of dedication to her sport and her country, have helped to make the U.S. Swim Team more successful than any other country at the Sydney Games. The United States won 33 medals in swimming, tying its highest total since 1984. B.J. Bedford was an important part of this overall team victory, as her experience undoubtedly made her a leader in the pool. B.J.'s athleticism, drive and determination have allowed her to claim her place in history. She has made both New Hampshire and the country proud, and I am confident that B.J. will be successful in all that she chooses to do. 
   I would like to congratulate B.J. for her fine work at the Olympics, for the excitement that she brought to Americans this summer, and for her gracious representation of the United States. She is a positive role model that will be looked up to by younger swimmers, and for that, she should be proud. We wish her nothing but the best in all of her future endeavors.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the Democratic leader's comments and the sincerity of those comments. But I think a few points should be made in response to them. Then I will make a unanimous consent request relative to the motion which has been put forward by the Democratic leader. 
   The first point is that the rules of the Senate are being followed. The Democratic leader knows the rules a great deal better than I do. But the vote on cloture yesterday, to which the Democratic leader on a number of occasions has alluded to represent the Democratic leader's commitment to the H-1B proposal, is the vote which puts the Democratic leader in the position that he is in now, which is that the amendment he is offering is not relevant and not germane to the underlying bill. So, as a practical matter, for him to first claim that, with great enthusiasm, they voted for cloture but now they are being foreclosed under the rules of the Senate from doing what they want to do is, I think, crocodile tears. 
   Secondly, it appears at about this time every election cycle we see a movement that occurs from this administration which involves bypassing the usual and legal procedures for obtaining citizenship. 
   Citizenship is the most sacred item of trust that we can impart as a nation to someone who wishes to come to our shores and live. The granting of citizenship is an extraordinary action because it gives a person the right to live in our Nation--the greatest nation on Earth--and the capacity to vote and participate as a full citizen and to raise a family here as a citizen. So it is something where we have set up a fairly significant and intricate set of laws in order to develop a process so there is fairness in how we apply citizenship. 
   Yet every election year, during this administration, or at least for the last two major election years--especially Presidential election years--we have seen an attempt, basically, to set aside the law as it is structured for purposes of obtaining citizenship, and to create a new class of citizens independent of what is present law. 
   To say that people shall be given the imprimatur of citizenship just before the election, ironically--and the last time this occurred under Citizenship USA, which was the title given to it, a title which was truly inappropriate because it ended up being ``Felony USA,'' thousands of people were given citizenship outside of the usual course. They did not have to go through the usual process, in a rush to complete citizenship prior to the election, which led to literally thousands of people who ended up being felons and criminals receiving citizenship. We are still trying to track down many of the felons who received citizenship under Citizenship USA, which was the last aggressive attempt to bypass the citizenship laws of this country during an election year. 
   I think we should have learned our lesson from that little exercise, that attempt at political initiative for the purposes of political gain, which ended up costing us literally millions of dollars to try to correct and leave us with, fortunately, a number of good citizens but, unfortunately, a number of people who should never have gotten citizenship who are literally felons and who have committed serious crimes. 
   So this attempt to bypass the citizenship process must be looked at with a certain jaundiced eye in light of the fact it is an election year because there is a history which asserts that it  should be viewed with a jaundiced eye, because the Citizen USA was such a debacle and so grossly political and ended up costing our Nation so dearly, by giving the sacred right of citizenship to people who are criminals and who committed lawless acts against other citizens. 
   So that is why we are in this position today. 
   The Democratic leadership claims that they strongly support H-1B and so they voted for cloture. Then they come forward and claim: But the rules are limiting us. 
   They were the ones who voted for the rule that happens to be limiting them. They can't have it both ways, but they appear to want to. It is, as I said, crocodile tears on their part, in my opinion. However, the Democratic leader has the right to make this request. He has positioned himself procedurally in that order. 
   Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that a vote occur on the pending motion to suspend the rules, that the vote occur today at 4 o'clock, and that the time between the two sides until 4 o'clock be equally divided in the usual form.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of this innovative and much-needed piece of legislation, the Fair and Simple Shortcut Tax (FASST) Act, which would streamline the process of paying federal taxes for millions of Americans. I am very pleased to join Senator DORGAN in introducing this important legislation. 
   The current Federal tax code is a tangle of requirements, deductions, credits, and other regulations that only a few lawyers and accountants fully understand. Still, we expect the average American citizen, under penalty of law, to have a complete grasp of all their tax obligations and to pay them in full and on time. The complexity of the current tax code has made it a burden to pay ones's tax obligations. This burden must be alleviated. 
   The good news is that we can do something to simplify the tax code for the millions of Americans who do not have complicated investment or corporate income and for whom paying taxes should be as easy and painless as possible. The FASST Act offers a voluntary tax plan which would simplify the filing process for millions Americans. It also provides much needed tax relief through the elimination of the marriage penalty, a tax which actually punishes people for getting married. 
   The FASST Act would provide a single, low tax rate of 15 percent for taxpayers who earn up to $100,000 per year in wages and receive no more than $5,000 in income from capital gains, interest, and dividends. A taxpayer who chooses to participate in this program would not receive a tax return, nor would he have to pay the federal government on April 15th because too little in taxes was deducted from his payroll. Instead, the employee would elect to fill out a modified W-4 form at work whereby his employer would withdraw the exact tax obligation at the single low rate of 15 percent. What a relief it would be for those folks who qualify to be free from the yearly burden of trying to decipher the federal tax code. 
   Taxpayers who elect to participate in this program would still benefit from the current standard tax deduction, as well as personal exemptions, child care credits, the Earned Income Tax Credit and a deduction for home mortgage interest expenses and property taxes. Thus, employees would experience the best of both worlds--the current tax system's generous deduction and credit system for working families, as well as a simplified tax system. This bill also provides generous savings incentives by exempting up to $5,000 of all interest, dividends and capital income from taxes. 
   Taxpayers who do not participate in the FASST program would also benefit from provisions in the FASST Act. First, this act reduces the marriage penalty, and provides an exemption from the Alternative Minimum Tax for many sole proprietors and small businesses. In addition, all taxpayers would be eligible to receive a 50 percent credit for up to $200 in tax preparer expenses if they file their taxes electronically. And again, there is a substantial incentive for savings and investment as up to $500 of dividend and interest income is exempt for individuals. The FASST Act is good for all taxpayers. 
   I believe that the FASST Act provides much needed reform to our tax system. Our current federal tax code is immense, complex, and confusing. It has become a burden on the American taxpayer. The FASST Act takes a much-needed first step toward providing a simpler, friendlier means of collecting taxes from our hard-working citizens. I am pleased to join with my fellow Senators from North Dakota and Illinois in introducing the Fast and Simple Shortcut Tax Act today.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, ironically, I came to the floor to talk about some of Vice President GORE's proposals, specifically in the areas he is spending money. The fact he has created this Pyrhhic lockbox--not Pyrhhic, this mystical lockbox he is claiming for the extra surplus which has been identified under the new budget estimates, which is mystical because he has already spent the entire surplus plus whatever would occur as a result of the increased estimates on the surplus. In fact, according to the Budget Committee, he spent under the high estimate almost $1 trillion more than the surplus. As a result, he is significantly invading the Social Security accounts. 
   But having listened to the Senator from Massachusetts, I do not believe his words can go unanswered because he has, first, made a number of statements which are inaccurate about Governor Bush's proposals on the drug plans for seniors and, second, I think he has put forward the basic premise of the debate between the two parties on the issues that should be answered. Let's begin there before I go to the specifics of the areas of his presentation, which were unfortunately numerous as they related to Governor Bush's positions. The difference here is fairly simple between the two approaches. 
   What was very distinctly stated by the Senator from Massachusetts is that they want to create--they use the term ``universal,'' but a 100-percent program in the drug benefit area, which is totally managed by the Federal Government--100 percent. Vice President GORE wants to do for prescription drugs what Hillary Clinton wanted to do for health care generally. He wants to take ``Hillary Care,'' which is essentially a nationalization of health care, and apply it to the prescription 
   drug program. 
   There are a lot of problems with nationalizing the prescription drug program, with having the Federal Government take over the senior citizens' ability to buy drugs. I think most seniors understand that having the Federal Government tell them what they are going to be able to buy in drugs, exactly what type of drug program they are going to have--and it will be one size fits all for this entire country--I think most seniors have an inherent understanding, as most Americans have an inherent understanding, that that program has some significant flaws. 
   One of the reasons this Congress and the American people so enthusiastically rejected ``Hillary Care'' is that people intuitively understand that taking a program and turning it over to the Federal Government to operate, specifically when that program is critical to one's well-being, as is health care, is putting at risk one's health care, by definition. 
   So the Gore plan is essentially a nationalization plan. The term is used ``universal, 100 percent.'' That means the Government runs it all. Well, 68 percent of the seniors in this country today already have a drug benefit. Many of them are fairly happy that they are able to go out and purchase a drug benefit that is tailored to what they need. There are, obviously, a lot of seniors in this country who need assistance in purchasing that drug benefit. There are a lot of seniors in this country today who do not have adequate coverage in drug benefits. The concerns of those seniors need to be addressed. But we don't address them by taking all the other senior citizens of this country who have set up their own  systems--and most of them come as a result of their employer continuing to cover their drug benefit as a result of their retirement--and saying to them: No longer can you participate in your employer plan, no longer can you participate in a plan which you chose which covers the needs which you and your family have. No. Now you must participate in a plan designed by Vice President GORE and a group of bureaucrats here in Washington under the guidance of the Senator from Massachusetts, and you either participate in that plan or you get nothing. When you participate in that plan, you don't get options. You have to do exactly what the Federal Government says. That can be a nightmare. That can be a nightmare, as we all know. 
   That is the fundamental difference. What Governor Bush has put forth is a proposal which will address the needs of seniors who do not presently have adequate prescription drug coverage and will address it in a way that allows seniors to have choices. It allows them to tailor their health care plans to what they need, not to what somebody here in Washington thinks they need. That is the difference of opinion here. There is the Washington mindset which says we in Washington actually know better than you do, John Jones out in Iowa, what you need to buy for your prescription drug benefits. It is this arrogance, this elitism that just permeates Washington and which was so precisely stated in the ``Hillary Care'' package and which is now just being repackaged with new words--``universal, 100 percent''--under the Gore drug plan. 
   Governor Bush has put forward a very thoughtful, very aggressive proposal in the area of prescription drugs that does address the needs of seniors who cannot afford those programs and seniors who need assistance in those programs. It was, regrettably, misinterpreted by the Senator from Massachusetts. 
   To begin with, it doesn't start 4 years from now. It actually begins much sooner and potentially 2 years sooner than the Gore plan. The Gore plan does not go into effect until 1 year after the date of enactment, which means we are probably looking--should we have the fate of having the Vice President become President, we are probably looking at somewhere around the year 2002 before it even gets operating. 
   That is a pretty optimistic viewpoint. The Senator from Massachusetts said Texas took a long time to participate in the CHIPS program and all the other States took a long time to participate in the CHIPS program. What was that? That was an attempt by the Federal Government to make sure all the kids who are low income, who need insurance in this country, get health insurance. It was passed by the Congress. 
   Do you know how long it took this administration to put in place the regulations to manage the health care plan for children, CHIPS? They have not done it yet. They are still working on those regulations. Why have States not been able to put their CHIPS program into place quickly? Because the regulations have taken so long to get in place. They have a majority of them in place now, but it literally took years to get the regulations in place so the States could comply with them. 
   So the idea that the Vice President, should he be fortunate enough to be elected President, is going to put in place a drug program that is going to be managed by the same agencies that manage the present systems, that manage the health care system we have--and they couldn't even do that--is going to set up a program for the country in a prompt way is, on its face, not believable. 
   The fact is his plan, if he is lucky, assuming he was able to pass the nationalization of the prescription drug programs in this country, assuming he was able to inflict ``Hillary Care,'' relative to drugs, on our people, assuming he was able to get that through the Congress, there is no way that plan would be in place and operating even by the year 2002, which he claims it could be. Maybe 2003; maybe 2004. 
   This timeframe thing the Senator from Massachusetts talked about is just a lot of mush. The fact is, the Gore plan, by definition, cannot start until 2002, and we know, as a practical matter, the way the Federal Government operates, and especially the way HCFA operates, there is no way it will be operating until probably sometime in 2005, whereas Governor Bush has proposed a unique and creative idea. He recognizes that what we need is fundamental Medicare reform. We need to bring all the parties to the table and reach a Medicare package that will reform the whole system to get efficiencies into the system, to reduce the costs of the operation of the system, to make it work more like a system for the 21st century rather than a system designed in the sixties, which is the way it works today. 
   He said it is going to take time to develop that package, it is going to take time to develop that comprehensive agreement, bipartisan in nature, so let's have a bridging program and let's begin the bridging program immediately. He said one of his first pieces of legislation will be a bridging program in the area of drugs which will allow the States, during the period when the Federal Government is working out major Medicare reform, to address not only drug benefits but everything else that deals with Medicare. During the period when the Federal Government is working on that, he said let's set up a specific program that will benefit seniors who need prescription drugs as a bridging program. That program can be in place--if the Congress actually wants to get to work, that program can be in place by March of next year. 
   There is a distinct difference in timeframe, yes. The difference is, under the Gore proposal, which is nationalization of the prescription drug program, which is ``Hillary Care'' for the prescription drug program, it puts all seniors in America under one system managed by the Federal Government. We know it is going to be a bureaucratic disaster and there are going to be a lot of delays. By definition, his plan does not start for 2 years, whereas what Governor Bush suggested is that he understands Government takes time to address major issues such as this, so let's put in a bridging program and start the program early. There is a time difference. The difference is Governor Bush's plan starts a heck of a lot earlier than the Vice President's plan. The Senator from Massachusetts was wrong in that assessment. 
   Secondly, the Senator from Massachusetts--there are a whole series of points, and I am not going to be able to cover them all--the Governor's plan only covers 25 percent of the cost and we cover 50 percent of the cost. I remember a story told by an attorney in New Hampshire who represented the northern part of New Hampshire. He said he was once working for a logging company and sent back a report. There were five loggers at this base camp, three men and two women. One of the women married one of the men, and a report said that 50 percent of the women had married 33 percent of the men. This statistic is one of those types of statistics. It is a nice statistic. It may make sense, but if you look behind it, it makes absolutely no sense because the statistic is based on two different programs. 
   The Gore plan, yes, covers 50 percent of the cost, but what it says is every American must use the federalized system of drug care. As I mentioned earlier, 68 percent of senior citizens already have a drug program. Many of them do not need a new drug program. Some may want to opt into a new drug 
   program if it is available, but many of them do not. They are quite happy with what they have from their company which continued to cover them after they retired. If they have to pay 50 percent now under a Federal program, it actually works out for many seniors that the premium costs of the Gore plan will be higher than the premium costs which they have for their present drug program. 
   If one looks behind this 50-percent number, it becomes very clear that it is not a positive number for seniors, it is very negative for a lot of seniors who will end up paying more for their drug benefit than they pay today because they are going to be put in a Federal plan where the premium costs more than the premium they have today, and they do not have any choice, they have to go into the Fed plan. Why? Because AL GORE knows better; because the Members on the other side of the aisle know better; they are smarter than the rest of Americans; they  should design the plan for the rest of Americans, and it should be run out of Washington. It is called elitism and, as I said, it permeates this city. Whereas under Governor Bush's plan, yes, 25 percent of the premium will be picked up by the Federal Government, but he also said this is an option, this is not a requirement. In other words, a senior will take that option if it is a better deal than what they already have. 
   He has also said that for low-income seniors, people at 175 percent of poverty, his plan covers all the premium. So let's not have any of this class warfare jargon we have been hearing from the other side of the aisle through their convention and since then. Actually, Governor Bush said he will cover all the premium for people up to 175 percent of poverty; the Vice President said he is only going to cover all the premium up to 150 percent of poverty. Governor Bush has exceeded, for low-income seniors, the assistance that will be given. 
   This 25-50 percent is a nice number, but it has no relevance to reality because they are two different plans which have two huge, different impacts on the flow of events around how this is covered. 
   Then the Senator from Massachusetts went on to say that block grants are a terrible idea generally, which has always been the theory coming from the other side of the aisle because they do not like to give States any authority, and especially in this instance it is a bad idea because of, as I mentioned earlier, the time lag between when the block grant is created and when the States will be able to operate under it. 
   The point is, once again, that is a Democratic approach to a block grant. A Democratic approach to a block grant is: We will give you the money, but we will set up a whole bunch of strings in Washington which you have to comply with before you get the money. Governor Bush's proposal is a real block grant. ``Block grant'' has become a pejorative. It should not be a pejorative. It is a return of funds to the States, and it says to the States: Manage these funds for low- and moderate-income seniors so they have a drug program. 
   I happen to think States are going to do that more effectively than HCFA has done their job in a variety of different areas, or the other Medicare activities that have occurred. I am willing to put the State of New Hampshire up against the Federal bureaucracy in health care any day of the week, and I can absolutely assure you that New Hampshire citizens are going to get a lot better care when the State of New Hampshire is making the decisions than when some bureaucrat in some building in Washington is making decisions under the guidance of Hillary Clinton or under the guidance, in this case, of Vice President GORE. Why can I say that? Because it is a fact. It is the way it works today. We have seen it time and time again. 
   This proves the point of what I am saying: that HMOs have been dropping their participation like flies, radically. The Senator from Massachusetts pointed out that HMOs have been moving out of States, as they have in New Hampshire--senior HMOs, Medicare HMOs. That is absolutely right. Why? Because the Federal Government under this administration shortchanged the reimbursement to HMOs. HCFA specifically undercut the ability of Medicare HMOs to function because they would not reimburse Medicare HMOs at a reasonable rate. 
   It has become such a crisis that before this Senate adjourns and before this Congress adjourns, we are going to adjust that. Unfortunately, so much of the damage has been done by this administration's Health and Human Services Department that I am not sure we are going to recover the HMOs. He is proving my point by saying the HMOs are falling out of business. It is another classic example of a statement which, on its face, may make sense, but if you look behind it, just the opposite is the fact. 
   It is like another story in New Hampshire, another legal story, which is the guy who shoots his parents and then goes to the court and claims he is an orphan and throws himself on the mercy of the court. The administration is shooting the Medicare HMOs, left and right, because they will not reimburse them. Then they come here and say: Oh, the Medicare HMOs are falling off; therefore, plans can't work because they might use Medicare HMOs. It is a little hard to accept that logic. And it is especially inappropriate for that argument to be made, in my opinion, from people in this administration. 
   So beyond the specific errors of the statement, which I think were considerable as they related to Governor Bush's proposal, and which I have tried to outline--I am sure I have not hit them all because I am not that intimately familiar with the entire package; but even with general familiarity, I noticed a number of mistakes--beyond that, it really does come back to this basic philosophical difference: Do we want to give our senior citizens in this country the opportunity to have quality prescription drug coverage, which they get to choose, and have some part in the participation, in making decisions as to what it will be, what type of coverage they want, and how much it will benefit their families, or do we want to nationalize the prescription drug care process in this country, and have what is essentially another slice of ``Hillary Care'' put upon the Nation? 
   That is the difference. That is the difference between these two approaches. Both approaches try to address the needs of the low- and moderate-income seniors and give them adequate health care and drug coverage. Governor Bush's proposal does a little better job because he takes 175 percent of poverty and covers all the premiums up to that, and Vice President Gore's proposal only goes to 150 percent of poverty. 
   So we are not talking anymore about whether or not low-income seniors are going to have adequate drug care. We are talking about timing. Governor Bush's proposal moves a lot quicker than Vice President GORE'S in getting the money out and getting support to seniors. 
   But what we are really talking about is the ability of seniors to play a role and have participation in the choice of the drug care they get as versus having the Federal Government doing it all. 
   So that is a response to Senator KENNEDY's comments on drugs, which I guess we are going to hear a lot more about, and which I am sure the Senator will have a response to my response, if he decides he deems it worthwhile. 
   I was going to discuss this other issue, so let me quickly discuss it. I know the Senator from Idaho has been very patient. 
   I do have to make this one point that this chart illustrates which is that the Senate Budget Committee took a look at the Vice President's proposals. Anybody who has been listening to the Vice President wandering around the country knows he has gone to just about every interest group in this country and has suggested money he will spend to assist them in some program, which is his right and, obviously, his philosophical viewpoint. But at some point you have to pay the piper. You have to add those numbers up. 
   So the Senate Budget Committee added those numbers up. When you get to the bottom line, which is shown on this chart, the surplus, over the next 10 years, which is $4.5 trillion, is 
   entirely spent. 
   We have heard a lot from the Vice President about how Governor Bush's proposal of the $1.3 trillion tax cut, which is about a quarter of the entire surplus, is going to eat up the surplus and, therefore, not leave anything for anybody else. But what we do not hear about, because maybe the press has not focused on it because it is a lot of numbers--but they can now go to the Senate Budget Committee numbers and focus on it fairly easily--is that Vice President GORE has already spent the surplus. He has spent the entire surplus. 
   If you use the low range, he has overspent the surplus by $27 billion. That is the low range. That is if you give him every benefit of the doubt. If you use the high range, which is not an outrageous high range--if it were my high range, it would be a lot higher than this is from the Budget Committee; and they tend to be fairly conservative number crunchers up there--it comes up to $900 billion, almost $1 trillion, that he has spent that exceeds the surplus. From where does that come? That comes from Social Security. That is what you end up hitting. 
   There are a couple numbers on this chart that stand out like sore thumbs  that I want to mention quickly, and then I will stop. 
   First, the tax cut relief. In the entire Gore package--we have a $4.5 trillion surplus--do you know how much tax cut relief there really is? The Vice President says he has $500 billion, but that is, once again, one of these numbers which, if you look behind it, is not really there. The net tax cut relief in his package is $147 billion out of a $4.5 trillion surplus. 
   The American people are paying $4.5 trillion more to the Federal Government than the Federal Government needs to operate. That is what the surplus is. Everyone in this room, everyone in America who pays taxes is paying taxes which the Federal Government does not need to operate. It adds up to $4.5 trillion. And all that the Vice President can agree to give back in the way of a tax cut--and it is not really a tax cut, returning taxes that do not need to be paid--is $147 billion out of $4.5 trillion. It is incredible. 
   That number distinctly reflects the view that any money that comes to Washington is not the money of the taxpayers; it is the money of the people who live in Washington. It is the Vice President's money; therefore, he does not have to give it back. It is the Government's money. They don't have to give it back. Not in my view. Not in Governor Bush's view, which is that it is the taxpayers' money. It comes out of your pocket. It is your taxes. It is your money. If the Government has too much of it, let's give it back. 
   The second item that I want to highlight is this retirement savings plus plan, which is a brand new major entitlement of huge proportions and a massive increase on the next generation. This is only a 10-year number shown on the chart. That number explodes, as you move into the outyears, into trillions. It is the most significant major entitlement ever put on the books of the American Government, in my opinion--if it were to pass. It will exceed Medicare by a huge function in the outyears, as we head toward the year 2030, I believe. But it will at least be competitive with Medicare as a massive new entitlement program. 
   Who is going to pay it? The next generation. Our kids. My daughter who just got her first job. She is out of college, which we are very happy about because we don't have to pay 
   tuition. She got a job, which we are even more happy about. Unfortunately, around about 10 or 15 years from now, assuming she keeps her job, she is going to be paying taxes at an outrageous rate in order to support a brand new entitlement put on the books by Vice President GORE, if he should become President. That, to me, is a little number in there that seems little in this package, although it is huge--obviously, even in this package; $750 billion on the upper side. That is not talked about much but should be looked at by the American people as they consider who they are going to vote for in this coming election. 
   Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Idaho in allowing me to proceed for a little extra time. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GREGG. I congratulate the Chairman on a strong bill that will improve our national security. As a conferee I understand the many challenges he faced in putting this bill together. While I support the overall bill, I would like to express my deep concern over a provision of this conference report that reduces funding for an important electronic warfare system for the F/A-18E/F. The conference report reduces funding for the Integrated Defensive Electronic Countermeasure (IDECM) program by $29.6 million in the F/A-18E/F procurement account. I understand that this reduction may provide insufficient funding for Low Rate Initial Production, significantly increase the risk to full rate production, and may mean that operationally deployed F/A-18E/F aircraft will not have adequate protection against radio frequency guided missile threats. Therefore, I would like to ask the Chairman for his support in addressing this issue for FY01.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise with my colleagues to express my deepest sympathy for Nancy and PAUL's family. 
   I had the great good fortune to come to the Senate with PAUL COVERDELL, as did the Senator from North Dakota, who I see sitting across the aisle. 
   PAUL was a special individual. He brought to this Senate an infectious enthusiasm and gracious energy which dominated the institution and those of us who worked with him. He always had a smile. He always had an idea. He always had a purpose. The purpose was tied to making this country a better place to live--for all of us and for our children. 
   He used to wander around this institution with a styrofoam cup that had ``Waffle House'' on it. That was one of the great mysteries to me in this institution--how PAUL COVERDELL managed to get Waffle House coffee sent all the way from Georgia. 
   It was a great promotor of Georgia. He never missed an opportunity to promote Georgia. That was only one of the minor ways he did it. 
   He was a great friend, also. I had lots of discussions with him. We worked on lots of issues--our concerns about the original health care proposal put forward by this administration, to when we set up the first aggressive, active task force that I got involved in and that he was also involved in. Even at the time we were both new to this institution, he had an incredible amount of ideas and initiatives on ways to address the issues. He was always tactically two or three steps ahead of the rest of us. He understood the way the institution worked long before some of us--I put myself in that category--who didn't fully understand the institution. He had an intuitive sense about the Senate--a feel for it and a love of it. He knew how to work an issue, to address an issue in order to produce better policy and better government for our country. I worked with him on that. 
   It seemed almost all of the time we were working on an answer with PAUL COVERDELL because he was involved in about every issue that came through the institution that had significance. The last major issue I worked with him on, of course, was education. We had a task force on our side to put forward what I thought was an extremely positive educational agenda, much of which came from his thought processes, which I was proud to support. 
   We worked a lot, of course, on Governor Bush's campaign. I had a discussion last Friday with him about that. He was working hard on an issue having to do with that campaign, and we was very hopeful that Governor Bush would become the next President. 
   He also had, as I mentioned, a deep regard for this body. 
   I think one of the discussions I will remember fondly occurred last week when we were sitting in my office. Some of the offices in the Russell Building have unique marble fireplaces. Many offices have unique desks. He was very concerned that we didn't really have a historical database of where these desks came from, who had these desks, and we didn't have a historical database of where the marble, for example, of the fireplaces came from; We had not, as a Senate, done our job of maintaining our own traditions and our own history as well we  might. We got to talking about that and the history of the Senate. His love of the institution was exuberant. 
   What a huge impact he had in such a short time. We only came 8 years ago--the two of us. At that time, I think there were 11 after the class finally got settled in. He took a while to get here because he confronted a number of races, but with his perseverance he was totally committed and won them all. In that time, he left a huge mark. 
   One of the true strengths of our democracy is that it totally exceeds any individual. This institution includes Daniel Webster, Calhoun, Clay; people in our century who had a huge impact, including Taft, Bob Dole. When they leave, the institution goes on; it functions. It functions extraordinarily well for a democratic body--as well as a democratic body can function. It produces governance for our people which is fair and honest and committed to a better life. 
   Recognizing that the institution goes on, there are still people who leave a mark. There are still people whose memory will be there, and will be there for a considerable amount of time. PAUL certainly falls in that category. It will be hard for me to turn and look at that door and not see PAUL standing by it, working on some issue. That is where he usually worked from, the pillar back there, addressing some concern, planning some initiative, all of which was directed at one single purpose: Preserving and keeping our democracy. 
   We will miss him. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in commemorating the Town of Jackson, New Hampshire on the occasion of its Bicentennial and in appreciation of the contributions its citizens have made to our nation. Jackson is the only New Hampshire town celebrating its Bicentennial in the Year 2000. 
   Founded by settlers as New Madbury circa 1775 and incorporated on December 4, 1800, Jackson proudly traces its roots deep into the history of our state and nation. Originally named Adams, in honor of then President John Adams, Jackson selected its current name on July 4, 1829 to honor President Andrew Jackson. It is here, settled gently into the awe inspiring beauty of New Hampshire's Presidential Mountain Range, at the foot of Mount Washington, where Jackson, a quiet farming community with an abundance of open space and spectacular scenic views, evolved into a popular American resort destination for artists and summer vacationers. 
   The centuries have been bridged by generations of old and new Jackson families. Today, visitors come year round, joining local residents, to enjoy its pastoral vistas, timeless ridge lines, wild and scenic rivers, covered bridge, water falls, white steepled church, mountains, rolling farmland and outdoor recreation amidst the magnificence and splendor of New Hampshire's world famous White Mountain National Forest. 
   On the occasion of its 200th Birthday in the Year 2000 please join me to proudly salute and celebrate Jackson, New Hampshire, a classic American community with a unique character, spirit and old world charm which has enriched the State of New Hampshire and our Nation.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, obviously, the PNTR bill is an extremely important bill. This body understands that. Certainly those of us on this side of the aisle who have been the force for expanding trade in this world, who have been basically the majority vote of things the President has wished to do--for example, on the African free trade agreement and on NAFTA, two areas where it was really our side of the aisle that carried the ball for the administration, as they tried to open our trade opportunities across the world--are strongly supportive of the concept of PNTR. 
   But there is still a fair amount of work that has to be done before we can bring it to the floor. Specifically, as was alluded to, there is the Thompson amendment, which would be nice to be able to deal with independent of PNTR. There are also other issues which we are going to have to address before the PNTR is ripe for consideration. 
   So at this point I would have to object, although it is clearly the intention of our side of the aisle to bring up the PNTR issue and to hopefully pass it, as we did with NAFTA and as we did with the African free trade agreement. So I object.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the H-1B bill happens to be a priority of this side of the aisle. I would be happy to move to this if we could move to the H-1B bill. Unfortunately, the Democratic leader isn't proposing that we move to the H-1B bill. What the Democratic leader is proposing is that we move to an extraneous agenda attached to the H-1B bill, that we bring to this bill debate on all sorts of issues which have no relevance to H-1B. In fact, we have offered, on this side of the aisle, to bring up the H-1B bill with relevant amendments. That has not been accepted by the other side of the aisle. 
   We are continuing to be agreeable to bringing up the H-1B bill with relevant amendments. There is no question but that we should pass the H-1B bill. I do sense a touch of crocodile tears coming from the other side of the aisle because, as a practical matter, almost all the bills that are listed as being held up, such as the education bill--the PNTR is a little different class, but the H-1B bill, for sure--are being held up not because of the underlying bill, not because the underlying issue is in contest as to whether or not we should take it up--we are perfectly willing to take up those issues on this side of the aisle and have propounded a series of unanimous consent requests to accomplish exactly that--but it is because there is a whole set of other agenda items, which the Democratic leader has a right to and desires to bring up, but he cannot bring them up on those bills and then claim he is bringing up those bills, because he is not bringing up those bills; what he is bringing up is those bills plus an agenda as long as my arm of political issues that they wish to posture on for the next election. 
   If he wishes to bring up the H-1B bill with three relevant amendments, or even five relevant amendments, on each side, we would be happy to accept that type of approach. 
   I have to object to the present proposal, but I would be happy to propound a unanimous consent which limits discussion to relevant amendments, if the Democratic leader is willing to pursue a course of bringing up H-1B with relevant amendments. On the proposal as laid out by the Democratic leader, I object.

   Mr. GREGG. If the Senator's position is he is willing to allow relevant amendments, then we can develop a unanimous consent request which says ``relevant amendments.'' Is that the Senator's position? The Senator just used the world ``relevant'' three times to describe the amendments he would propound. Therefore, it should not be a problem for the Senator to offer relevant amendments.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the issue being debated and brought forward by the minority leader was that he wanted to take up and discuss H-1B. The presentation was for the purpose, at least formally it appeared, of taking up the H-1B issue. We are willing to take up the H-1B issue. 
   And we are willing to do it with relevant amendments. Now, the other side says that is not the English language and it is not common sense to use the term ``relevant.'' That term has been used for the past 200 years in this body, and I think it is reasonable to continue to use it. 
   On a number of occasions, we have presented unanimous consent requests asking that we be allowed to take up the H-1B legislation with relevant amendments. In fact, the Democratic leader said specifically that the amendments he was talking about would be relevant. He used the term ``relevant.'' I understand that was more in the context of not necessarily the Senate, but in any event he used the term ``relevant.'' 
   Right now, I am going to propound a unanimous consent request. I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the majority leader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, to proceed to Calendar No. 490, S. 2045, the H-1B legislation, and it be considered under the following limitations: 
   Three relevant amendments per each leader in order to the bill; No other amendments in order other than second-degree amendments which are relevant to the first-degree amendments. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the above amendments, the bill be read the third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage, with no intervening action or debate. 
   The purpose of this unanimous consent request is to bring up the H-1B visa issue, which I believe should be brought to the floor with relevant amendments.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for bringing forward this extremely positive proposal in the area of patient protections. This bill has a lot of initiatives, many of which have been outlined very well by my colleagues. One that has not been highlighted as completely as I would like because of time--and I want to touch on it quickly--is the issue of liability. 
   When our bill initially passed the Senate, we did not include an opportunity to sue, but we have changed that policy. Under the bill as it is proposed today, first there is a tremendously positive appeals process. If a patient believes they have been aggrieved by their HMO, they have the right to an internal appeal and an external appeal which is set up with an independent group of physicians who will review the case and who are knowledgeable on that subject. More importantly, if a patient thinks they have been aggrieved, under certain circumstances, they will be able to sue that HMO. What they will not be able to do is have an open season on the employer. 
   If one looks at the proposal that has been put forward by the other side, they are suggesting we have an open season on employers. The whole exercise in the Patients' Bill of Rights is not to have open season on employers. It is to address inequities occurring to people as they deal with their insurers, specifically with health maintenance organizations. 
   If we allow this open season on employers, we will simply drive people out of insurance. Instead of improving insurance for individuals across the country, individuals across this country will walk into work one morning and their employers will say: I did not give you this health care policy which happens to be a very expensive event in my day in trying to make an effective workplace; I did not give it to you so lawyers could use it as a game area to bring suits against me. 
   Employers across this Nation are going to simply drop their health care insurance. They will give their employees a certificate to buy their own health insurance or some other type of vehicle to allow them to compete in the marketplace. Because employers are able to get a better price and are able to tailor their insurance policies more effectively to the needs of their employees in different regions of this country, the practical effect will be employees get significantly much less health care under the proposal coming from the other side because employer after employer will simply drop their employees' health insurance programs and will allow the marketplace to compete for their employees. Unfortunately, the result will be the employees will be left with the short stick. 
   I think that is the actual goal of the other side. I think their real goal is to drive up the number of uninsured across this country. If one looks at the pattern of activity on the other side of the aisle, it has been to annually increase the number of uninsured by raising the price of insurance in this country. 
   Since this administration has been in office, the number of uninsured has gone up by 8 million people because the price of insurance has gone up and up as the other side has tried to drive up the price of that insurance. 
   What is the ultimate goal? ``Hillary care.'' If they put enough people on the street, if they create enough uninsured, inevitably they will have to claim: I am sorry, everybody is uninsured so we have to nationalize the system.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me make a couple of points on title I generally. Title I is one of those programs which was conceived as an excellent  idea and which has accomplished many things. Unfortunately, it hasn't accomplished one of its most critical goals. 
   When title I was originally created, the purpose was to get low-income children into the educational system in schools which would have the capacity to teach them and the ability to teach them at a level that was equal with their peers. The concern was that many low-income children weren't getting fair treatment in the school system. That was a good idea. Unfortunately, the way it has worked out over the last 35 years, it has not proven to be such a great success. In the last 35 years, we have spent $120 billion on title I, attempting to educate and give a better chance in life to low-income kids. The problem, however, is that we have accomplished very little. 
   Most low-income kids today are not getting any better education than they were getting 10 years ago, 20 years ago. Their academic achievement levels are actually stagnant or they have dropped. We have seen that instead of improving the academic capability of these children, we continue to send these children through school systems that essentially end up passing them through the system and not giving them the skills they need to compete in America, to take part in the American dream. 
   The statistics are fairly staggering. I think I have some 
   of them here. Just off the top of my head--I believe I recall most of them--over 7,000 schools that have title I kids in them have been identified as failing--not by the Federal Government but by the school systems themselves, generally. We know that in our schools where we have children who are under title I, low-income kids, those children are learning at at least two grade levels less than their peers--in the area of math, for example. We know that children in the third and fourth grades who are low-income are consistently at least a grade or two grades behind their peers. We know that low-income fourth graders are simply not able to compete with other fourth graders who are not low-income. We know that in our high schools we are seeing the child who has been a low-income child, who is qualified for title I dollars, who has gone through the system--it turns out that their skills are right at the bottom of their classes in many cases and as a matter of average. The achievement gap really has been dramatic. Yet we have spent all this money to try to improve their achievement. 
   So we as Republicans, in the markup of the title I bill this year, the ESEA bill, attempted to try to address the problem. We put forward a whole series of ideas, the purpose of which was to improve the academic achievement of the low-income child. Instead of warehousing these children and moving them through the system, we would actually expect and demand that for these Federal dollars we received results. 
   One of the suggestions we made was called Straight A's, where we said to the local school districts: Your results on low-income kids hasn't been that good; maybe it is because the programs are too categorical. We will let you merge them and put them into a flexible program. But if you take the money under this scenario, you have to prove there has been academic achievement by low-income kids; that the gap between low-income kids and kids who are not low-income is closing--not by reducing the abilities of the higher income kids or the average children in the school system but by actually improving the capability of the low-income child. 
   Another suggestion we made was called portability, where we said that the low-income child in a failing school should not have to stay in that school; They should be able to move to another public school system, and the dollars that are allocated for the purpose of trying to help that child out should follow the child to the different school. That is called portability. 
   The reason we suggested that is that the present title I program is structured so the money goes to the administrators and the schools; it doesn't go to the kids. In fact, in cities such as Philadelphia, if you aren't in a school where 70 percent of the kids are low income, you get no dollars from title I. So maybe if you have a low-income child attending a school where, say, 50 percent of the kids are low income, that school will get no title I money. That is true in a lot of different cities across this country. In fact, there is a threshold of 35 percent, I think, where, if you are in a school with only 35 percent low-income kids, that school absolutely gets no money. Other cities have adjusted that. In Philadelphia, as I said, it is up to 70 percent. 
   The practical effect, under the law as presently structured, is that a lot of the dollars that should be going to children are not going to them. A lot of the low-income kids who should be getting assistance dollars for tutorial help or 
   special needs help are not getting them; those dollars don't flow to that child. So we end up with a system where the dollars flow to the school and the administrators but not to the children. 
   We suggested that we actually have the dollars go with the child, and if the child goes from school to school--or if they decide to do so and their parents want to get involved and make that decision--let the dollars that are supposed to support the child also go from school to school. 
   We have put forward a whole lot of ideas. Those are only some of them. We also have something called ``choice'' for public schools, where parents will be able to move their children from school to school. We have the Teacher Empowerment Act, which affects the title I kids, which comes out of the ESEA bill, to try to improve teacher capability. We have a whole set of ideas to make title I work better. That is the bottom line. 
   What the Senator from Minnesota has suggested is that in a program that has already spent $120 billion over 30 years and has produced negative results in the area of academic achievement for children, it should today arbitrarily get an additional $10 billion. In this bill, we already increase that funding significantly. But this $10 billion should be on top of what is already in title I. 
   Unfortunately, what would happen is the same thing that has happened to the $120 billion. It would end up being spent and going to bureaucracy and going into school systems. It would not necessarily end up giving children a better education--especially low-income children--because we have already proven fairly definitively that the present system isn't doing that. 
   So rather than breaking the budget by adding $10 billion which is not offset--and it is subject to a budget point of order, by the way--what we should do is reform title I and reform the ESEA bill. We tried to do that. We brought the bill to the floor, and, unfortunately, a number of Senators wanted to put extraneous matter on it, and, as a result, it got all balled up and wasn't able to be moved. 
   But the point here is that until we get fundamental reform of title I and until we get fundamental reform under the new ESEA authorization, putting another $10 billion into this system is not going to help. 
   Therefore, I oppose this, first, on the budgetary grounds that it is not offset and therefore is a $10 billion increase that has no way to be paid for; second, on the grounds that it probably won't accomplish what the sponsor would like to accomplish, which is to improve the achievement of low-income kids. 
   Until we require that low-income kids' academic achievement goes up for the dollars we are spending on them and put in place systems that are going to give the local school districts the capacity of accomplishing that and to give them the flexibility of Straight A's, or portability, or the parents the chance to participate through public school choice, there is really no point in making this type of huge increase in funding in this program--especially on top of the fact that this committee has already significantly increased funding for this program in this bill. 
   Mr. President, I reserve my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from Minnesota has made a couple of points to which I think I need to respond. First, the reason the authorization bill is not on the floor is because Senators from the other side decided to put a political agenda on that bill. The unanimous consents which were requested by the majority leader to limit the number of amendments to that bill and make them education amendments and thus complete that bill were rejected by the other side. 
   Second, yes, we strongly supported increasing funding for title I, if it was reauthorized under a bill which was student centered. The problem with the present law is it is not student centered. It is bureaucracy centered. 
   I am not surprised the other side of the aisle is defending the bureaucracy-centered bill. It was their idea in the first place. Our position is we should look for academic achievement. We should not leave these children behind. The Senator says these are poor children. Yes, they are poor children. Regretably, they are poor children caught in the cycle of poverty for generation after generation because their educational system has failed them for generation after generation, even though we spent $120 billion on title I. Child after child has come out of the system unable to compete with their peers because their academic achievement has been so low. 
   What we suggest is a proposal which is child centered, which is flexible, which is targeted on academic achievement, and which has accountability standards which will work so these children are not left behind.  
   The Senator on the other side of the aisle makes the argument these children are being left behind not only because they are educationally underfunded but because they have all sorts of other concerns. Yes, there is no question about that. But when we look at school systems that work, because they demand achievement from the children they are serving, the same children, then we know success in this area is possible. We can look at our Catholic school systems in which the same population is served. Yet they accomplish good things with those students' academic achievement. 
   The statement there has been a great increase in academic achievement among low-income kids is simply not accurate. What has happened is the academic achievement of low-income kids has finally gotten back to the level it was in 1992. From the period 1992 to 1998, the gap in academic achievement between African American and white students actually grew. The same was the case for Hispanic students and white students; it actually grew in a number of the most critical States that have a large population of African American and Spanish students. 
   The simple fact is, we have not been serving these kids effectively. We do not have a program that serves these kids effectively. 
   The Senator from Minnesota is right on one count. It is not $10 billion he is proposing this year, but over a 5-year budget it would add up to approximately $10 billion. I stand corrected. 
   I join the Senator from Minnesota. If he is willing to put forward a program that is child centered, dedicated to academic achievement, giving the local schools accountability 
   and flexibility, then we should talk about dramatic increases in funding because we would get something for the dollars that would be effectively used. But to simply put more money in here on top of money that has been already increased outside the budget priorities which we have already set--and remember there are other major budget priorities in this bill that have been paid for, such as special needs, special ed kids--it is just not appropriate. That is why I oppose this amendment.

   Mr. GREGG. I simply state the reason we do not have the authorization levels we should have on the ESEA is that we have not passed ESEA, and the reason we have not passed ESEA is that we have been unable to debate on this floor the issue of education. We have had debate on the issue of campaign finance, on the issue of guns, on the issue of prescription drugs, but not on the issue of education, which is too bad, because the bill out of committee was a good bill and, by the way, it did not demand the States do anything. It set up a set of options for the States which the States could then follow. They could choose to use portability, they could choose to use Straight A's or they could choose the present law. It gave the States total flexibility. The goal was to get the academic achievement of low-income kids up. That should be our goal as a Senate, and that was our goal when we reported out the bill.

There are a lot of relevant amendments on education that deal with guns. All you have to do is make it relevant and you can involve a gun issue. There is no question, for example, if you want to offer an amendment that deals with using title I money for the purposes of allowing people to put in some sort of screening system for going into a school relative to guns, that is a very relevant amendment, I would presume. But I am not the one who makes that decision. The Parliamentarian makes the decision.

   Mr. GREGG. I am perfectly willing to make an adjustment, to give you a timeframe, so we can have a timeframe on the debate. We can have relevant amendments, 1 hour on each amendment. I have gone up to seven amendments now because the Senator from Nevada made a good case that we might not have gotten the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico into the mix. So that is seven amendments on each side and a vote on final passage--that is 14 hours--we vote on final passage, leaving it to the majority leader to call the issue to the floor. I think we could have a deal.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I don't want to prolong this ad nauseam because it is sort of an internal debate. I know the Senator from New Mexico has an amendment he wants to offer. 
   I will make a couple of points in response to the Senator from Nevada, who always eloquently presents the minority's position. 
   The fact is, all the amendments he talked about in the area of education are amendments which we are perfectly willing to get into. We got into them in committee, and we are happy to get into them on the floor. I suspect they would have no problem being found as relevant--school construction, afterschool programs, safe schools. In fact, we have done a great deal in the area of all of these accounts. On the Safe Schools Program, aftershool programs, we have increased funding dramatically in both those proposals. 
   We have brought forward an ESEA bill in a creative and imaginative way. I think it is being held because there are amendments people want to put on it which they know will cause it to not go any further than this body because the bill has so many imaginative and creative ideas in it which the Federal bureaucracy and the educational bureaucracy do not like because they return power to the States, power to parents, power to children, power to principals. They just don't like the fact that this bill is coming up for a vote with a whole cafeteria of ideas that threaten the present educational lobby here in Washington. Therefore, they have decided to gum it up with a bunch of amendments that have no relevance at all. 
   ``Relevant'' is an important term for the education issue. The education debate should be on education. There are a lot of 
   gun issues which are education related. We are perfectly happy to take those as relevant. But there are some that are not, and they know that. That is why they are throwing it on this bill, because they know it will stop the bill on the floor. They can use that as an excuse for stopping the bill rather than being the actual reason the bill is being stopped. 
   As to gun amendments, we have voted on those enumerable times in this body. We have had amendments relative to abortion clinics, relative to gun-related debt. We have had them relative to gun violence crime protection, safe school new Federal restrictions on firearms, on education and violence protection. There have been votes on these. The list goes on and on. There have been gun amendments all through the process. There are gun amendments that can be made relevant. I would presume if they wanted to include those seven that I suggested, it would be easy enough to do it. 
   I do think that the defense that they don't want relevant amendments, that they want to have the freedom to throw whatever amendment they want on this bill, is a puerile defense. ``Puerile'' is the wrong word. It is a sophomoric defense because basically what they are interested in is not having the ESEA bill come through this House in its present form because it is not a form that they liked when it was reported out of committee.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from North Carolina is certainly one of the finer trial lawyers who has come to this body in a long time. I simply note, on at least two of his examples, they were inaccurate. First, if it was an emergency-room situation, there could be no denial because under our bill emergency rooms have to be covered; and second, in the instance he just described about the child, which was a compelling incident, unfortunately he failed to mention in our bill we require that the reviewer be a medical person who has expertise in the discipline and in the area where the person is claiming to have received injury. 
   The point I do think has been made by the Senator from North Carolina, and has been made by a number of other Senators on the other side of the aisle, is that employers will be sued. Employers will be sued under the bill that is being brought forward by the Democratic membership. That is a serious problem. 
   We put an offer out, an offer to the other side, which was fairly substantive. It may have been two pages, but the other side understood there was a lot of documentation behind it, and in fact there were actually months of negotiation relative to the appeal process behind that offer. In that offer, we said employers cannot be sued. Why? Because when you start suing employers, employers drop out. They start creating uninsured individuals. We have already heard from a number of major employers, and testimony has been given here today by Senators who represent States where major employers have informed them that they are going to drop insurance if they start being sued. We know small employers will do that in droves because they cannot afford the risk of putting their businesses through a lawsuit over medical insurance. 
   So this is not about suing HMOs, I say to those on the other side of the aisle, this is about opening up lawsuits to everybody, not only against HMOs, which by the way we allow to occur in our bill which was admitted to by the sign that was put up--we allow HMOs to be sued--but, more important, it is about suing employers. 
   Look at this chart. This chart is a reflection of the various elements of what is essentially the bill the Democratic Party has brought to the floor today. It is so convoluted and so complex that, literally, you would have to spend probably a month just figuring it out, just to figure out what it all means. 
   That is one of the reasons this conference has taken so long, because we have been trying to sort through all the different complications. I point out, at almost every element in this chart, every one of these white lines, every one of these crossing lines, every  one of these agencies that is being created, every one of these decision processes being placed upon the community, there is a lawsuit waiting to happen under the Democratic bill. 
   This is the attorneys annuity act. The direction the trial bar is going to go is to go after the employers; they are the ones who will be at risk. As a result, you will drive many people into an uninsured status because employers will stop running their insurance programs in droves. I mean literally millions of people. 
   Why would you want to do that? I hate to be cynical about this, but I honestly think, if you look at the process this administration has pursued over the last 8 years, they are trying to continually raise the cost of insurance, health insurance, in this country and make it less and less affordable, so more and more people become uninsured, so at some point they can make an argument--which they have already made--that they have to nationalize the health care system in order to pick up all the people they have created as uninsured. 
   It is the old orphan argument. You know, the person who killed his parents goes to court and claims he should receive clemency because he is an orphan. 
   The fact is, what the Democratic proposal does, and what the result of the administration proposal has been consistently, is to create more and more uninsured and then claim: Oh, my goodness, look at all these uninsured. We have to nationalize the system so we can cover them all. In the context of this bill specifically, however, the game plan is to create a whole new activity for the bar association, suing employers left and right. 
   There is a law firm up in New England which represents Car Talk. They are called Dewey, Cheatum and Howe. Today, they have about three people working for them, according to Click and Clack, the Tappet brothers, who work at Car Talk Plaza. But I will tell you something. If this bill passes, they are going to give up automobile insurance and they are going to go into suing companies, suing businesses, suing employers who happen to supply health insurance to their people. They are going to add probably 20 or 30 or 40 new attorneys. 
   So Dewey, Cheatum and Howe is going to just keep on going and going and expanding, because they will have received an annuity under this bill--not an annuity to sue HMOs, because that is not really in contest anymore; we have already put that 
   on the table. It will be an annuity to sue employers. As a result, not only will there be a heck of a lot of lawyers working at Dewey, Cheatum and Howe; there will be a lot more people in this country who don't have insurance, and then we will hear from this administration, from Vice President Gore: My goodness, look at all the uninsured--who were created by this bill we just passed--we will have to nationalize the system. And then we will end up with a system that really doesn't work. 
   We put on the table some fairly substantive and very good proposals which have come from months of work. I hope the other side, rather than try to politically posture during this period, will take a hard look at them, in the area of scope, the area of access, the area of appeals, and in the area of lawsuits and liability, and that we can get back to the business of negotiating this conference rather than to the politics of this debate. 
   Mr. President, I yield any time I have remaining back to the Republican leader.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to speak about the issue of what is happening in Africa, specifically in Sierra Leone. Recently, I have become involved in this issue because, as chairman of the Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Subcommittee, we have jurisdiction over the funds that flow to the U.N. for peacekeeping activity. In order to adequately do the job as chairman of that subcommittee, our job involves oversight of those funds, to make sure they are being used effectively. After all, they are American tax dollars; Congress has control of the purse strings; and we have a major role in how those dollars are spent. 
   I recognize fully, as all Members of Congress do, that the key individual who sets foreign policy is our President. Even though we may disagree with our President, he does have that priority position. But there are, obviously, issues on which the Congress has a role in foreign policy--very significant issues. One of them happens to be the funding of peacekeeping activities and the role the United States should play in that. So I have had very serious concerns about our policies in Sierra Leone specifically--on a number of peacekeeping activities, but specifically our policies in Sierra Leone. This is because of a number of issues that have been raised there. 
   Last year, the United States, regrettably, played a key role in imposing the Lome Accord on a brutalized Sierra Leone. The accord granted a total amnesty to the Revolutionary United Front, RUF, which is basically a gang of thugs that murders, rapes, and mutilates people. Just about everybody in their path has come under their severe act of violence. In fact, they actually  empower their soldiers--and they are not really soldiers; many are very young boys--to cut off the arms of women and children in order to make a point. This is a very common practice with this alleged military group called RUF, this gang of thugs. They have been terrorizing the country of Sierra Leone. There is no question about that. Their leader, Foday Sankoh, and his lieutenants, as part of the Lome agreement, as part of the understanding of the Lome agreement--and this is why it was such a horrendous agreement--were given top spots in the ``transition'' government and guaranteed RUF control over the Sierra Leone diamond mines, which is basically the core of the element of how they generate their revenues. 
   It is inexcusable that we were party to the Lome agreement and that we therefore empowered these war criminals to take office and to have control over basically the only significant economic resource of the country of Sierra Leone. So I was more than upset about this. I believed it was essentially a surrender in the face of criminal violence. As a result, I did put a hold --not technically a hold, but I actually refused to approve a transfer of peacekeeping funds for the Sierra Leone initiative. I began exploring alternatives to this, what I believed was an extraordinarily unjust accord. In response to my concerns, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Holbrooke and his staff took on the difficult task of crafting a better approach to this issue. 
   Since my ``hold'' became news, I have been sharply criticized by some, including some in the U.N. and the State Department, and even--not even, but not surprisingly, really--the Washington Post, which recently accused me of ``playing at foreign policy,'' implying that serious students of world affairs would not question U.S. support for the Lome Accord. I simply point 
   out that I think a lot of serious students of foreign policy question the decision to support that accord. 
   Meanwhile, in Sierra Leone itself, the RUF, as a result of Lome in large part, continued to terrorize civilians and even challenge the U.N. peacekeepers. By last month, the RUF was marching on Freetown in complete violation of the Lome Accord. In fact, of course, they have humiliated the U.N. mission in Sierra Leone, which was supposed to disarm them. It actually ended up being disarmed by them, and much of the military equipment that is being used there by the RUF is U.N. equipment taken from U.N. advisers. Thus, the mission of the U.N., as a result of being an outgrowth of the Lome Accords, which were so disgraceful, is in disarray. Today, all that stands between the RUF and total control of Sierra Leone is the British and Nigerian troops who have come in to try to stabilize the situation. 
   And what of the U.S. policy? Following our most recent meeting 2 weeks ago, Ambassador Holbrooke has sent me a letter laying out a new strategy for a more just and lasting approach to peace in Sierra Leone that gives me some reason for hope. I would like to read from what his letter says because I think it is an important adjustment in American policy in Sierra Leone. I congratulate him for it. 
   First, he notes in his opening paragraph that he has taken this issue and walked it through the administration and that he has support for his letter from Secretary Albright, National Security Adviser Berger, and the head of the OMB, Jack Lew. Reading paragraphs from his letter:  
   You asked for a letter encapsulating our discussion on Sierra Leone and Congo. After close consultation with Secretary Albright, let me review where we stand on each issue: 
   First, Sierra Leone. Let me posit five principles that we will use to govern our policy. First, the United States does not believe that Foday Sankoh should play any role whatsoever in the future political process in Sierra Leone, and we will continue to press this point. He must be held accountable for his actions.  
   This is a significant change in policy, in my opinion, and it is a positive one.  
   Second, we strongly support the British military presence in Sierra Leone, which has played a key role in restoring a measure of stability to Freetown. We are discussing with the British their continuing role, and on May 23 London announced an important training program for Sierra Leone army, something that they will undertake at their own expense outside the U.N. system.  
   This, again, is positive news that the British will be a stabilizing force there, which will be armed and know how to defend itself.  
   Third, the objective should be to ensure that regional and international forces in Sierra Leone, together with the armed forces of the government of Sierra Leone, have the capacity to disrupt RUF control of Sierra Leone's diamond producing areas, the main source of RUF income. Completely eliminating them as a military force is not likely to be possible as an acceptable cost, but sharply reducing their sources of financial support and restricting their capability to threaten the people or government of Sierra Leone is within reach of sufficient numbers of properly trained, equipped, and well-led troops and is vitally important.  
   That is to paraphrase a much more robust mission directive and portfolio and is exactly what needs to be done.  
   The most likely nations to carry the burden would be Nigeria and Ghana, with the backing of other ECOWAS states. Other nations who are already rushing troops to Sierra Leone include India, Jordan and Bangladesh. Most potential troop contributors from the region are likely to require better equipment and training if they are to contribute meaningfully. Pentagon and EUCOM assessment teams are studying the issue urgently. If our objectives are to be accomplished, the U.S. will need to be ready, with congressional support and funding, to provide our share of international effort to provide equipment and training to those who are willing to do the military job--including the government of Sierra Leone and other countries in the region. Any direct training of contributing country troops by U.S. military personnel would be done outside Sierra Leone and no U.S. combat troops would be deployed to Sierra Leone. We will have to work out the relationships between such an operation and the UN, recognizing that for many countries a UN role is preferable--but we must ensure that the mandate is robust. Fourth, since there is virtually no real government structure left in Sierra Leone, if the security situation can be stabilized a longer term international effort will be needed to help build viable institutions in Sierra Leone. It will take time, but in the long run, the rest of the effort will be unsuccessful if it is not accompanied by this component. However, this cannot start until the situation is stabilized, and there is no present funding request for this function. Fifth (this is a point I failed to mention in our meeting) we must develop a corresponding political strategy for dealing appropriately with Liberia's President, Charles Taylor, and with the illicit diamond trade that fuels conflict and criminality in the region.  
   That is a reading of two of the major paragraphs in this letter.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this letter obviously, in my opinion, is a very positive step in the redirection of American policy in Sierra Leone. I congratulate Ambassador Holbrooke for organizing the letter. 
   Whereas the Article V and IX of the Lome Accord granted Foday Sankoh the Vice Presidency of Sierra Leone and an ``absolute and free pardon,'' Ambassador Holbrooke's plan makes it clear that Foday Sankoh can play no role in the politics or government of Sierra Leone and that ``he must be held accountable for his actions.'' This when as late as a month ago State Department officials were still being quoted as saying that Sankoh's ``voice was positive'' and that he ``has a chance to play a positive role.'' Now, we will recognize him for what he is, a war criminal, and treat him as such. 
   Whereas Annex 1 and Articles V and VII of the Lome Accord left Foday Sankoh and the RUF in control of Sierra Leone's diamonds, Ambassador Holbrooke's plan rightly strips Sankoh of his chairmanship of the diamond control board and insists that ``allied'' forces ``have the capacity to disrupt RUF control of Sierra Leone's diamond producing areas, the main source of RUF income.'' Under Lome, peacekeepers did no more than oversee the looting of Sierra Leone. Now, international troops will fight alongside local forces to expel the RUF from the diamond fields. 
   Whereas the Lome Accord was silent on root causes of violence in Sierra Leone and the region, Ambassador Holbrooke's plan seeks a ``political strategy for dealing appropriately with Liberia's President, Charles Taylor, and with the illicit diamond trade that fuels conflict and criminality in the region.'' The RUF is in large part Taylor's proxy. Under Lome, Taylor's success in seizing the riches of Sierra Leone could invite a similar attack on Guinea. 
   Lome is dead. The U.S. will not turn a blind eye to the rape of a people and a land. We will demand that brutal thugs are held accountable for their atrocities, and regional trouble-makers. 
   Why the change? I do not flatter myself that my ``hold'' did all of this, but it did give those of us who opposed the Lome Accord a chance to right a terrible wrong. And to his credit, Ambassador Holbrooke has crafted a forceful plan, and vetted it through the inter-agency process in record time. It is a plan that I believe Americans can and should support, and can be proud of. 
   Therefore, I am releasing my hold on the $50,000,000 owed the U.N. for peacekeeping in Sierra Leone. I will also press ahead to ensure that my provision blocking the illicit sale of diamonds from Sierra Leone and other war-torn countries is included in the final version of the fiscal year 2001 military construction appropriations bill. Finally, I look forward to working with Ambassador Holbrooke and his staff to ensure that the strategy laid out in his letter is supported by Congress. 
   I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Idaho for his courtesy.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wanted to speak about Sierra Leone and especially about the attempts I have made to address this issue as chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary. 
   The New York Times and a number of other daily papers have reported that I have limited the ability of the State Department to spend money on behalf of the United Nations, or send money to the U.N. for the purpose of peacekeeping in Sierra Leone, and that is correct. However, the numbers that the New York Times, at least, used were incorrect. 
   I think the record needs to be corrected. I presume this story came from a momentum within the U.N. to try to put pressure on the Congress to spend money on U.N. initiatives. Obviously, the U.N. feels that by using our media sources in this country, they can influence the activity of the Congress, specifically of the Senate. However, I would have hoped that the New York Times reporter would have reviewed the actual facts and determined the facts before reporting them as facts. Obviously, this reporter got his information from somebody, I presume, at the U.N., or maybe the State Department, and did not bother to check the facts. 
   It was represented in the story, for example, that the amount of money that was owed to the U.N. in the area of peacekeeping was somewhere in the vicinity of $1.7 billion. This number is inaccurate and the story was, therefore, inaccurate.  
   Let me review the numbers specifically. In accounting for the amount of money that the U.N. is owed, there is a regular budget assessment of approximately $300 million. This is included in the $1.7 billion, which I presume they got from the U.N., or they could not have gotten to that number. However, that $300 million is not owed. We paid that money on a 9-month delay. We have always paid it on a 9-month delay because of the budgeting process of the Federal Government. So you can reduce that number by the $300 million figure because that money will be paid on October 1, as it always is. 
   Second, the Times must have been counting as a U.N. assessment the peacekeeping moneys of $500 million. Well, the $500 million is the amount we have allocated for peacekeeping in our budgets for the benefit of the U.N. But that $500 million has not yet been called upon by the U.N. In fact, of that $500 million, we have received requests for approximately $300 million. We have not received requests for the full $500 million. We have received requests for about $300 million. We have paid--of that $300 million requested--approximately $55 million. The balance is in issue, but it is being worked out. So that number is inaccurate, and you can reduce that $1.7 billion by at least $200 million that we have not received a request for, and the $55 million we have paid and, in my opinion, by significant other numbers also. 
   Third, the Times must have been counting the $926 million which is an arrearage payment. The arrearage issue was settled last year. It had been delayed for 3 years because of the Mexico City language, which did not need to be delayed. But the administration put such a hard line on obscure language dealing with Mexico City Planned Parenthood that they ended up tying up the arrears that we as the Senate were willing to pay. We appropriated that money every year, by the way. There was an agreement reached between ourselves and the State Department and 
   the White House, known as the Helms-Biden agreement, which said we would pay that money. So that money is in the pipeline to be paid, subject to the U.N. meeting certain conditions. That is not in issue. 
   So when you take all the numbers, there is no $1.7 billion at issue. Actually, it is closer to $100 million than $1.7 billion. So the exaggeration in the story was inaccurate. It reflects, I think, shoddy journalism. 
   Secondly, the story implied that my position was basically an isolationist position and that I am opposing peacekeeping everywhere in the world. 
   No, I am not. In fact, we have approved peacekeeping in my committee in a number of areas. We have approved peacekeeping in the Golan Heights for $4 million, Lebanon for $15 million, Cyprus for $3 million, Georgia for over $3 million, in Tajikistan for $2 million, and the Yugoslavia and Rwanda War Crime Tribunal for $22 million. The list goes on and on. 
   So we have approved a significant amount of peacekeeping dollars for a variety of different missions that have been undertaken by the U.N. However, the problem I have is that in Sierra Leone, what we ended up doing was endorsing a policy that brought into power parties who had committed rape, murder, and atrocities against the people of Sierra Leone. And instead of having these people brought to justice under the War Crimes Tribunal, as they should have been, what we have done is endorsed these people in the Lome Accord and said they should be brought into the Government. That policy makes no sense. 
   We are seeing a deterioration of that policy by what is happening to the peacekeepers in Sierra Leone today. Instead of taking weapons from the rebels who are basically killing people arbitrarily and, as part of the policy, hacking limbs off of people--instead of taking their weapons, the U.N. has given up more weapons than it has taken in Sierra Leone. 
   Right now, we still have actually hundreds of U.N. peacekeepers who have been taken hostage over there. Why? Because the policy being pursued in Sierra Leone was misdirected from the start. We should not have been making peace. We should not have been bringing into the Government people who acted in such a barbaric way toward their own people. We should have been taking a harder line. We should have been sending in U.N. peacekeepers--in Sierra Leone honoraria we may not want to--people who had the capacity and the equipment to defend themselves, and had the portfolio and the directions so they could defend themselves and use force. 
   Unfortunately, we didn't send those types of troops in there--or the U.N. didn't. America is complicit in this. American taxpayers have to ask themselves, why are we spending this money? Why would we want to spend money to support, encourage, and endorse people who are essentially criminals and moving those criminals into the Government of Sierra Leone and giving them the authority to act? Well, that was my reason for putting a hold, as we call it, on this. It was actually a denial of the funds for Sierra Leone. 
   It appears, having said that, I guess, that suddenly people have awakened and are saying, hey, maybe that is right. In fact, as of yesterday, the State Department changed its position as to the rebel leader over there. Instead of him being a conciliatory, positive force for the basis on which they might base the peace accord over there, this person--or people--should be brought before an international tribunal when they have committed crimes against humanity, which this individual clearly has. Maybe there is a shift of attitude occurring within the State Department. I hope there is because that would move us down the road towards resolving this issue. But the representation that the committee I chair, and in which the ranking member, Senator HOLLINGS, participates in very aggressively, has in some way opposed peacekeeping is inaccurate. The numbers used in the article are inaccurate. The fact is, we have raised legitimate concerns to protect the taxpayers of this country, which is our job. I believe we are doing it effectively. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman BURNS and the ranking member, Senator MURRAY, for their support of my amendment combating the illicit trade in diamonds. I also want to acknowledge the assistance of the staff of the Treasury-General Government Subcommittee and the U.S. Customs Service. 
   As the op-ed in today's Washington Post, ``Diamonds Are For Killers,'' by Sebastian Mallaby, correctly points out, diamonds are fueling the violence in Sierra Leone. The Revolutionary United Front (RUF), responsible for so many horrors, is not fighting for a belief, a cause, or an idea. They are a criminal gang brutalizing the people of Sierra Leone simply to maintain their grip on diamond rich lands. Diamonds from Sierra Leone are unusually large and clear, much prized by a jewelry industry prepared to pay top dollar with no questions asked. The diamonds buy weapons and narcotics, RUF staples. The diamonds are transshipped through Liberia and the Ivory Coast, the leaders of each taking their cut of the profits. From Africa, the diamonds are transported to Amsterdam or London before, in many cases, being shipped here. 
   My amendment is a simple one. It bans the use of funds for the processing of paperwork associated with the importation of diamonds from Sierra Leone, Liberia, the Ivory Coast, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, or Angola. I have chosen to include the Congo and Angola because so-called ``conflict diamonds'' have fueled the bloody civil wars in those countries as well. 
   Having choked off the RUF's source of revenue, it is my hope that forces loyal to the legitimate government of Sierra Leone, fighting even now in the outskirts of Freetown, can begin to gain the upper hand on the battlefield. Ultimately, it will take more, far more, than cutting off the diamond trade to crush the RUF, but the road to victory has to begin somewhere. Let it begin here. 
   Fellow Senators may not realize that my amendment is based on legislation championed by Representatives HALL and WOLF. Clearly, there is bipartisan, bicameral support for banning this bloody trade. Few would treasure a diamond torn at such terrible cost from the blood-soaked soil of Sierra Leone. I look forward to working with colleagues in both houses to bring the trade in ``conflict diamonds'' to an end.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today Gov. George W. Bush set forth some ideas addressing the issue of Social Security. It is my understanding that the Vice President is also going to discuss this issue today, although he has, before today, made a number of comments in this area. 
   I have spent a considerable amount of my time over the last 7 years I have served in the Senate working on the issue of Social Security, working on it in a bipartisan manner, trying to develop a coalition in this Senate to move toward resolution of what I consider to be one of the most significant public policy matters we have confronting us. 
   Let me define the problem so we understand what we are working with and what the concerns are. Today, the Social Security system is running a very aggressive surplus. In other words, it is taking in more money than it is paying out. The Social Security system is on a dollar in/dollar out basis. In other words, there is no asset value that is placed somewhere. There are not a set of dollars saved to pay your Social Security benefit. The dollar raised today pays the benefit that is incurred today. The younger worker who is paying Social Security taxes today is paying for the older worker who is retired today. 
   We have the baby boom generation working today at its maximum earning capacity, and because we have a larger younger generation than the generation that is retired, we are now running a surplus. In other words, more money is being taken in to pay for the benefits than is being spent on the benefits. That extra money is being borrowed by the Federal Government. It is being used basically to operate the day-to-day activities 
   of the Federal Government. In exchange for that, a note is given back to the Social Security trust fund. 
   Alternatively, the money is being used to buy down the debt of the Federal Government--the public debt in many instances--and that money is then basically returned to the marketplace in the form of proceeds going into the capital markets because we no longer have the Federal Government borrowing those moneys from the capital markets but, rather, the money is no longer needed by the Federal Government and, therefore, the capital markets are free to create more activity for a stronger capital market. 
   The problem is, the baby boom generation today is generating the huge surplus in Social Security funds and is going to start retiring in the year 2008. When that generation starts to retire, the demographics of the situation change radically. The Social Security system was always perceived as a pyramid. It was always believed there would be a larger working generation than the retired generation. The retired generation at the top of the pyramid would be smaller and the working generation at the bottom of the pyramid would be larger. 
   Because the postwar baby boom generation is so large, it is that unique generation that has changed this country in every decade and forced the country to build all sorts of elementary schools in the 1950s and created the disruption to a large degree in the 1960s. It has gone through the pipeline and has changed the system in every generational phase. When that generation retires, we go from a pyramid to almost a rectangle. Instead of having 3.5 people working for every one person retired by the year 2015, we only have two people working for every one person retired. The system comes under a huge strain. The benefits don't change--or there is no plan to change them--and therefore all the folks who are retired have to be supported by a younger generation, which is a smaller generation, but they have to support them again with the tax dollars earned by that generation. 
   As we look into the future--and we don't have to look very far; it begins in 2008--we see as we head into the second decade of this new century, the next generation, our children and their children are going to be subjected to a huge cost, a huge tax increase, in order to support the retirement of the baby boom generation. This escalates rather dramatically through the year 2045. 
   There are Members who think something should be done, that we should not pass this huge burden on to the next generation; that we, as a baby boom generation, have an obligation to get ourselves and our Nation ready for the retirement of our generation. 
   As I said, we worked across the aisle for the last few years to try to develop policies to address this problem. Dramatic progress has been made. There are at least four or five major initiatives in this Senate today which legitimately address the issue of making the Social Security system solvent for 100 years. One of them happens to be one which I worked on with Senator BREAUX, Senator KERREY, Senator THOMPSON, Senator THOMAS, Senator GRASSLEY, and Senator ROBB. It is bipartisan and crosses philosophical spectrums. 
   Our proposal, as scored by the Congressional Budget Office and by the Social Security actuaries, makes the system solvent for the next 100 years. It does it without any tax increase of any significance. 
   In order to accomplish this type of a change, we have to have comprehensive reform. We cannot do it piecemeal; we have to do the whole system. We can't just simply pick out one point in the system and try to change that and expect to address the system so it becomes solvent, 
   so we do not put a huge burden onto our children's backs in new taxes, or additional tax increases. 
   We have tried to draw into this debate, to get this process moving, the White House and the President, but we have had singularly little luck in doing that. Regrettably, although this administration has occasionally talked about Social Security reform, and the President in his State of the Union even said this would be one of his primary goals in his waning years in office, it has done virtually nothing and, in fact, has put out proposals that would dramatically cause the situation to deteriorate, especially for the younger generation, in the form of major tax increases. 
   Today, Governor Bush has put forth a proposal. Regrettably, the response by Vice President GORE, up until today--and I suspect he will not change his tune today--and the response of the White House, has been to essentially take the old time school approach of attacking it in the most demagogic terms, saying the proposal is going to end Social Security; it is going to put at risk recipients who are presently benefiting from Social Security, and that it is a proposal which undermines this critical national program of Social Security. 
   The Vice President has used terms such as ``risky'' to describe it. He has used terms such as ``inappropriate.'' He has used terms--``smug,'' I think is one term, and other terms which try to demonize the proposal in a way that is  not constructive. So let's look at the proposal because I think it is important to think about this. What Governor Bush has suggested is this. 
   First, we recognize anybody who is on the Social Security system today, or about to go on the Social Security system soon, should have their benefits locked in place and the structure of the system maintained exactly as they receive it; there should not be any change at all for those folks. So any senior citizen today or anybody who is about to go on the system, anybody 55 years or older, I believe, has no concern here. Essentially the proposal says you will be held harmless. Nothing is going to impact your way of life as it relates to Social Security. Yet it is very obvious the Vice President is trying to scare senior citizens and is saying the proposals coming from Governor Bush will in some way affect their benefit structure when Governor Bush is saying specifically it will not. 
   Second, Governor Bush suggested we set up a bipartisan commission to take a look at this, a proposal that has been put forth by Senator MOYNIHAN and Senator KERREY and Senator MCCAIN, I think. It is not a bad idea because this needs to be done in a bipartisan way, and we have worked very hard on the bipartisan process in this Senate, so that makes sense. 
   Third, the Governor suggested we take a look at what is known as personal savings accounts. This is an idea whose time has come, in my opinion. Why? First, let's talk about what personal savings accounts are in the context of Social Security reform. 
   There are three ways you can address Social Security and make it solvent, only three ways. One, you can raise taxes. That is the Clinton-Gore proposal. In fact, under the Gore-Clinton proposal, there will have to be a tax increase each year going forward on working Americans in order to support retired Americans. That goes up and goes up, I think, until it is $1 trillion 
   around 2035. That is their proposal: Raise taxes on Americans in the outyears. Just do not tell Americans that is what is going to happen to them. 
   The way they do not tell you is they say we are going to use the interest on the Social Security to pay down the debt, which is occurring today because we are returning a surplus; we are going to use that interest to extend the life of the trust fund. That is a paper game, the bottom line of which is a tax increase that hits $1 trillion by the year 2035. Why is that? 
   Just to make an aside for the moment, so people understand what the Vice President is proposing: There are no assets in the Social Security trust fund other than Government bonds. What do Government bonds do? Government bonds are a claim on the taxpayers of America to be paid. It is an IOU from the taxpayers to the trust fund. It says we, the taxpayers of America, owe you this money. When you need this money, when that baby boom generation retires, then we, the taxpayers, of America will pay it. 
   Who is ``we''? We are the younger generation. The ``we'' in that sentence is my children and their children, your children and grandchildren who will be working then. They will get stuck with the IOUs that Vice President GORE wants to stick them with, with his little gamesmanship of transferring interest, which is purely a paper transaction, creating absolutely no assets in the trust fund. All it does is create an IOU which has to be paid by the younger generation. These kids sitting right here as pages are going to pay that IOU. 
   It means their taxes on Social Security will not be 12 percent of their payroll; it will be somewhere in the vicinity of 18 percent of their payroll. As I said, it will amount to about a $1 trillion tax increase on working Americans by the year 2035. That is the Vice President's proposal: Raise taxes but do not tell anybody it is coming. Use this little euphemism: We are going to transfer the savings on interest over to the trust fund, which means we are going to create a massive tax burden on the next generation in the outyears in order to pay for the benefits of this generation of which I am part, the baby boom generation. But do not tell anybody about that. Just use the term, ``We are going to transfer the savings from interest.'' ``We are going to transfer the savings from interest on Social Security'' sounds good--do that by paying down the Social Security funds, and that savings means we will extend the life of the trust fund. 
   That means nothing. It simply means we are going to end up increasing taxes and having more IOUs our younger generation has to pay. So that is the first way you can do it; you can raise taxes--the Vice President's proposal. 
   The second way you can address the issue is to reduce benefits. There is not much incentive for reducing benefits in our society. People do not like that idea in a democracy. In fact, the Vice President not only is not going to reduce benefits; he is already suggesting we increase benefits. The only specific proposals he has made on Social Security is we raise benefits in two different accounts. It happens to be both those proposals to raise benefits make some sense, but they have to be done in the context of the entire structure. There has to be some tradeoff. If you are going to raise those benefits, there has to be some adjustment in the other benefit side or 
   else you significantly increase the liability to the trust fund, which means once again you raise the taxes on the next generation to pay for those benefits, that younger generation. So he has raised benefits. That is not the way to solve it. 
   The third way he can address it--remember, you can address it by raising taxes on the younger generation that is earning the benefits for the older generation that is receiving the benefits, or the third way is you can prefund the liability. That is what personal savings accounts do, prefund the liability. By prefunding the liability, we mean you actually create an asset which is owned, actually physically owned by the person who is going to retire, which is not a debt instrument of the Federal Government. It is not an IOU that has to be paid for out of taxes, necessarily. It can be stocks or bonds--some of the bonds could be U.S. Government bonds--but it would be an asset owned by the individual. What does that do? 
   Today, if you are in the Social Security system and you happen to die, unfortunately, before you reach retirement age--say you die and you are 59 years old and you do not have a spouse or any children. Everything you paid into the Social Security system is lost. You paid in for years and years and years and your estate does not get anything from it. It is gone; it just dissipates into the system. Somebody else benefits from all those taxes you paid. You have no asset value. 
   Even if you have a spouse and you die before you retire at 62 or 65, or even if you die soon after that, the benefits that spouse gets as a result of your death, as a result of your Social Security payment, is really minimal--very, very small--compared to the amount of taxes you actually paid in to Social Security. So there is nothing physically there that you own. You have an obligation from the Federal Government to support you at a certain level after you retire, but you have no asset value. 
   What a personal account does is it allows you to take a small portion of the taxes you are paying in to Social Security--and it is a very small portion. Under the plan that we have, it is 2 percent. Of the 12.4 percent of taxes you presently pay in Social Security, you would get to put 2 percent of those taxes into some sort of savings vehicle which you would own. You would physically own it. It might be stocks; it might be bonds, but you would physically own it. It could not be placed in those vehicles and then be speculated with; it would follow the course of what we call the thrift savings vehicle. That vehicle would require the Social Security trustees to basically set up the investment vehicles in which you could invest. 
   One would be limited in how one could invest that money. They could not speculate with it. They would have to put it into basically large mutual funds which would be approved by and would be under the fiduciary control of the Social Security trustees. 
   Mr. President, I note it is 3 o'clock. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for another 4 minutes.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, a person would have this asset called a personal account which they would have to invest in three, four, five, or six different  funds set up under the auspices of the Social Security Administration. The asset would be owned by that person. If they were to die at 45 or 59 or even 66, their estate would receive the asset held in that account and it would go to their wife, husband, children, or to whomever they wanted it to go. 
   Equally important, the rate of return on personal accounts would dramatically exceed what one gets under the Social Security system today. A person who is today beginning in the workplace, who is about 22 or 25 years old, is going to pay more, if they are an African American, into the trust funds than they will ever receive from the trust funds. In other words, they get zero rate of return. 
   If one happens to be a typical, average American, their rate of return in the Social Security trust funds, if they are in their twenties today, is about 1.4 percent. If they are in their thirties, it might get up to 2 percent. If they are in their forties, it might reach 2.5 percent--might. It is a terrible rate of return under the Social Security system. People are paying all these taxes and getting virtually nothing in return. 
   Under a personal account--remember, it is only a small percentage of one's Social Security tax which is going to be invested in this personal account--one will own the asset; plus, the average rate of return over any 20-year period, including the Depression, of investment in the stock market exceeds 5 percent. Since I am talking about a 20-year period, not a 4-month period or a 5-month period or a 1-year period or 3-year period, one can be pretty sure the rate of return on the personal account is going to be at least twice the rate of return on the taxes that person is paying into the Social Security fund generally. 
   That is called prefunding liability. In other words, we are going to give a person the opportunity as a citizen, especially a younger citizen--people over 55 are not going to be affected by this at all--to actually own an asset and have that asset grow at a rate that is at least twice the rate of their investment in Social Security. Then when they retire, that asset will be physically there to benefit them in their retirement. The liability that is owed to that person by the Federal Government will have actually been prefunded. There are many ways we can talk about that, but it gets into some complexities I do not have time for now. 
   Essentially, what it means is that the younger generation, instead of having to pay a huge tax increase to support retirement, is going to actually be creating assets which give them, when they retire, a rate of return which will be 
   significantly or at least as good as what they would get under Social Security without having to pay all these new taxes. It is a way of keeping the system solvent and, at the same time, maintaining a benefit structure that is reasonable and, at the same time, not dramatically increasing taxes. 
   What we have is a pretty simple debate, in real terms, between the Vice President and Governor Bush. The Vice President does not want to tell people the younger generation is going to get hit with a huge burden of new taxes under his plan, and he does not want to tell us how he is going to address the Social Security system and reform it in the outyears. Governor Bush, on the other hand, is willing to step forward and put some interesting and innovative ideas on the table to address one of the most critical issues that will face our country over the next 30 or 40 years.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, this morning Senator LIEBERMAN will be recognized to offer his alternative to S. 2, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Debate on this amendment is expected to consume the morning session. 
   At 12:30 p.m., the Senate will recess until 2:15 p.m. to accommodate the weekly party conference luncheons. When the Senate reconvenes, it will proceed to a vote on the Gregg amendment regarding teacher quality. It is hoped that an agreement regarding the Lieberman amendment can be reached so that votes can be stacked to occur at 2:15 p.m. 
   Following the disposition of the Lieberman amendment, the next two amendments in order are the Kennedy teacher quality amendment and the Jeffords-Stevens early childhood investment amendment. 
   Prior to today's adjournment, the Senate is expected to begin consideration of the African trade-CBI conference report. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me begin by saying I congratulate the Senator from Connecticut for bringing forward an amendment that has a lot of interesting, creative ideas, 
   ideas that are attractive to myself and other Members on the other side of the aisle that find attractive the proposals presented; and the accountability proposals and the idea we should allow local communities and States to have more flexibility in the management of the funds which come from the Federal Government, with an expectation they produce a better level of achievement for their students. 
   These are ideas which we think make sense. We have some reservations about some proposals within the amendment, but I hope we can work over time with the Senator from Connecticut and his cosponsors on his side of the aisle to evolve a bipartisan package. I think there is significant opportunity for that. I congratulate the Senator for his efforts. 
   The amendment that was set aside, offered by Senator LOTT, is called the Teachers' Bill of Rights. That amendment involves four items: First, a commitment that allows, under the underlying bill, S. 2, to make sure we use the dollars of the Teacher Empowerment Act, which is $2 billion, to hire high-quality teachers, teachers who have the qualifications to teach the subjects they are supposed to be teaching. In turn, it has accountability standards which we expect from the States for using the money to hire quality teachers, to show they have hired the quality teachers, and as a result student achievement has improved. 
   The thrust is not directed at institutions or school systems but is directed at children and making sure children's achievement improves in the context of giving States more flexibility but expecting more accountability. This amendment tracks that proposal. It gives more dollars to the local districts and the States to hire quality teachers, but it expects the quality teachers to be able to show results. It specifically requires accountability in showing either student achievement is increasing or that the teachers who are teaching in the core curriculums they are assigned to--math teachers teaching math, for example--actually know the subject and are capable of teaching the subject to the children. 
   In addition, the bill has an authorization of $50 million to encourage midcareer professionals to come into the teaching profession, a very important proposal that came forward with Senator HUTCHISON of Texas, Senator FRIST, and Senator CRAPO, a good idea that allows using dollars to attract folks who have gone through their professional career in the private sector and decided they wanted to give back a little bit to society and have decided to go into public education. This assists them in doing that. We are starting to attract a fair number of people from that career path. It is important to encourage. 
   The fourth element of the Teachers' Bill of Rights is the very important proposal from Senator COVERDELL limiting teacher liability as they pursue professional activities in teaching children. This is a problem for teachers. Most teachers say their big concern is they will get sued because a child is on the playground, gets injured, and they are held responsible. They are afraid of the impact on their family to have such a lawsuit occur. This is an attempt to try to mitigate that in a reasonable way. It is a good proposal. 
   These are the four elements of the Teachers' Bill of Rights amendment. I hope my colleagues can support that amendment which is not overly controversial. It is a good proposal. 
   Speaking about the general debate we have been involved in 
   for the last week on the issue of ESEA, it has been an interesting and a very substantive debate. It has, however, involved clear distinctions on policy in how we approach the question of education in this country. 
   On our side of the aisle, we believe very strongly that we should have an approach to elementary education that stresses the child and stresses the need for the child to do better, especially the low-income child, which is where the bill focuses. 
   Third, it gives the State, the teachers, principals, and superintendents flexibility as they try to address that issue of how it gives low-income children a better education. 
   Fourth, it expects academic accountability. We give flexibility to States and they have to produce academic accountability. Low-income children have to do better than in the past. We have spent, as I mentioned a number of times, over $130 billion in title I over the last 35 years. Yet the academics of our low-income children have actually gone down over that time period. As a result, we are seeing the gap widen between the non-low-income child and the low-income child in the school systems. The statistics are stark. The Senator from Connecticut cited a number of them. The most stark is that the average low-income child reads at two grade levels below their peers by the fourth grade; that difference expands as they move into high school years. 
   We believe strongly there has to be a different approach. We have to allow the local school districts flexibility and expect academic achievement. 
   On the other side of the aisle, I have been interested by the tenor of the debate. A large percentage of the positions taken on the other side have been to attack the idea of giving flexibility and power to the States, subject to accountability standards in the area of achievement. There has been a clear and aggressive response and attack coming from the other side of the aisle on the leaders of our States and our school districts across this country. It has been focused to a large extent on the Governors. There seems to be a deep suspicion on the other side of the aisle about Governors, which I find discouraging, having been a former Governor. I think there are about 12 or 16 of us in this room. I see one other former Governor in the room right now on the other side of the aisle. 
   Here are some of the quotes from Members on the other side of the aisle about Governors or State leadership. Senator WELLSTONE:  
   But honest-to-goodness, Washington, DC, and this Congress is the only place I've been where people say, ``Let's hear from the grassroots, the Governors are here.'' I mean, Governors are not what I know to be grassroots. Could be good Governors, bad Governors, average Governors. But my colleagues have a bit of tunnel vision here thinking that decentralization and grassroots is the Governors.  
   Senator KENNEDY on the issue of local control:  
   What priority do these children get in terms of the States? They didn't get any priority when this bill was passed in 1965, even with requirements that the funds go down to the local community. This legislation is going to effectively give it to all of the States, as I mentioned. I think that is basically and fundamentally in error. As I mentioned, what are we trying to do?   
   A little suspicious about what would happen if the money 
   goes to the States. 
   Senator SCHUMER:  
   I understand the desire to keep schools locally controlled. But a block grant, a formula for waste, and much of it going to the Governors, so that money doesn't even trickle down.  
   As an editorial comment, the evil Governors will get their hands on it. 
   Senator KENNEDY:  
   We need a guarantee. We don't need a blank check. We want to make sure the money's going to go to where it's needed and not go to the Governors' pet programs and pet projects and pet leaders in the local communities and their States.  
   Once again, the evil Governors strike. 
   Senator MURRAY:  
   The Republican approach would take the things that are working and turn them into block grants, and their block grant does not go to the classroom. It goes to the State legislatures and--it goes to the State legislatures and adds a new layer of bureaucracy between the education dollars and the students that is so important.  
   There it is, the evil State legislatures. 
   Senator DODD:  
   ..... What are we saying in this bill or trying to say is back in that community I won't be able to make it absolutely equal. But I would like to get some resources into that school. Now I've got to trust--trust your good Governors.  
   Said with a bit of sarcasm, the Governors, once again, are being pointed out as being inappropriate sources to be trusted in our institutions. 
   Senator REID:  
   What Republicans are saying essentially is let's give the money to the Governors; if they want to concentrate more efforts on low-income students, they can, but if they don't, they don't have to.  
   The Governors are the force of evil, it appears, in the educational systems of America. 
   It is very surprising language. I am tempted to say it is the Governors who actually have been doing the original thinking in the area of education. In fact, ironically, if you look at what has happened in education, you will see in the issue of class size reduction, which is such an important question we have debated on this floor, 22 States have implemented major class size reductions. In fact, most of those States implemented those projects before there was any class size initiative adopted at the Federal level. 
   In the area of school accountability, 40 States have initiated report cards already. These have been initiated, I suspect, by the Governors in those States, as was the class size initiative, I suspect, initiated by the Governors in those States. 
   In the area of charter schools, before there was any idea of a Federal charter school initiative, 2,000 charter schools had been initiated at the local and State level. Once again, it would be the Governors who initiated those charter schools; 2,000 of them have been initiated across this country. In fact, the National Educational Goals Panel, which is probably the most objective reviewer of what is happening in education, looking at it from a national perspective--they don't have too much of an agenda. They have a little agenda, but 
   they have not too much, and the NEPA test is something that comes out of that agenda--said States such as North Carolina and Texas, which were cited by the Senator from Texas as States very effective in raising the scores of low-income students--they said in their studies they cannot attribute any gains to Federal activity. They attribute the gains to the fact that in the States, the local communities, the local policy has been the force for educational excellence. 
   I am not here necessarily to defend, carte blanche, Governors, because I suspect Governors make mistakes. But Governors have as their primary responsibility the issue of education. A Governor is not going to stop halfway through the day, is not going to stop talking about education and suddenly go on to the African trade agreement and the Caribbean Basin agreement, which is exactly what we are going to do in a couple of hours. Then we are going to be on to an appropriations bill on military construction. Then we are going to be on to an appropriations bill on agriculture. 
   Governors, for the most part, think about education probably 40 to 50 percent of their time. Why? Because 40 to 50 percent of the dollars that are spent at the State level in most States--not New Hampshire, ironically, but in most States--are education dollars. That is the biggest item in their budget, so they spend almost all their time on that issue. 
   It is not as if they come to this issue as some sort of force for darkness. But if you listened to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, you would think so. This bill gives more authority to the State Governors and to the local schools and to parents and to teachers--by the way, subject, however, to significant accountability--and you would think the Governors were part of the Evil Empire, that they came from the dark side. Maybe you would think they are related to Darth Vader, if you listened to Senator MURRAY, Senator REID, Senator DODD, Senator KENNEDY, Senator WELLSTONE, Senator SCHUMER. 
   So I decided to make up a chart. It is very obvious to me, as I listen to the debate, the other side of the aisle has met the enemy and the enemy is the Governors. That is the problem with education according to the other side of the aisle. So I got pictures of all our Governors, our good Governors. I am sure they are all good Governors. A few of them are Democratic Governors. Surprisingly, a majority are Republican Governors. That was not the case when I was a Governor, but I am glad to see that is the case today. I am thinking to myself: All these good people, they are the enemy. I did not know that. 
   Poor Governor Shaheen, she has some problems in New Hampshire, I have to admit. She is trying her best, but she has had some tough times. She got some tough cards dealt to her. But she is really interested in education. I know that. She is a Democratic Governor. 
   I know some of our Republican Governors--John Roland, from Connecticut, he has dedicated an immense amount of thought and creativity to being a leader on education. I will bet there is not a Governor here, not one of these enemy Governors, who has not got a very creative idea on education moving in their State, an extremely creative idea, something we have not thought about here in the Federal Government but something that is actually producing academic achievement by the kids in that State, something that is actually producing results. 
   That is an ironic concept for us in Washington. We don't necessarily work on results. We spent 35 years on title I, 
   spending $130 billion. We did not care about results. We did not care if the kids did any better. We wanted to get them in the school systems, and that worked, but we didn't really care whether they did any better. So now we bring forward a bill which says we care about the kids and we want achievement, and how is it attacked? It is attacked on the grounds it is going to give more power to the Governors and the Governors are really not responsible people and should not be given that power. 
   I have to say, I find that extremely disingenuous, just on the face of it. But I also find it inappropriate on the grounds that Governors really do care. They are pretty close to the people. They are elected just as we are. Some of them are elected more often than we are--in fact, I think most of them--so they are answerable to the people a few more times than we are. 
   I do think this response, which is essentially: you can't do anything because it might be a block grant to the Governors, is inappropriate. By the way, nothing we have in here is really a block grant at all because there is tremendous accountability pressure. The fact is, we set this up as a cafeteria line so States can go through and pick out what program they think is going to work best for them. But that gives too much authority to the States, to choose something that might actually work, because the Governors cannot be trusted. 
   This attack on this bill, which is quite honestly the gravamen of the opposition, is that we are taking the power out of Washington. Although I put it in humorous terms, that really is the gravamen of the opposition. We are taking the power out of Washington; we are taking the strings away from Washington; we are returning the authority back to people actually giving the education in expectation, with accountability standards, that we expect achievement.  
   That is the difference here. There is a lobby in this city that wants to maintain control over these dollars at all costs, even if it means the dollars are not producing any results or any significant results that benefit the kids to whom they are directed. We have 35 years of record that show us these kids have lost out; we have lost generations of young children who were low-income, who were not able to pursue the American dream because they could not read and they could not write. We cannot tolerate that any longer. 
   I believe, very strongly, we should give authority back to these folks subject to the conditionality that they produce achievement. That is a reasonable approach, in my opinion. I am interested that the other side has rejected this approach and basically looks at the Governors as the opposition. 
   Another way you could look at this is, what do you get for Federal dollars that are controlled by the Federal Government versus what you get for State dollars controlled by State governments--these Governors, these people who do not know how to administer their programs and clearly are going to be inefficient? 
   Let's look at it at the State levels. It takes 25 people in the State government in Georgia to administer $1 billion of Georgia's State money. It takes 116 people to administer the $1 billion that comes from the Federal Government--more than four times the number of people it takes to administer State dollars. That is people sitting at desks, answering mail, doing forms, who are not teaching, who are not helping kids get a better education but 
   who are simply pushing paper through the system. 
   It gets even worse for the State of Florida. For every $1 billion spent, it takes 46 State employees in Florida for Florida State dollars; for every $1 billion of Federal money spent, it takes 297 employees to manage that money--46 to 297. 
   So these terribly inefficient folks who really should not be given the authority to manage the money because they really do not know what they are doing, at least with their dollars they appear to know what they are doing. They are getting their dollars out to the kids. Their dollars go to the classrooms. They don't end up in some room in some big building in Tallahassee for filling out forms. Most of the people in the big room in Tallahassee filling out forms are doing it to fulfill Federal responsibilities. 
   You do not have to look at just Florida and Georgia. The commissioner of education in Colorado said the involvement of the Federal Government has served ``only to confuse almost everyone.'' Actually, he used the words ``nearly everyone.'' 
   Lisa Graham Keegan, the superintendent of public education in Arizona:  
   Every minute we spend making sure we're in compliance with all those pages of Federal regulations means one less minute we can spend to help teachers with professional development, improving curriculum, developing our own testing standards and insuring all the children are getting the help they need to succeed.  
   That pretty much sums it up. I think there is a good case you could make, and I believe we have made it, that the States, local school districts, the principals, the teachers, and the parents are just as concerned about education as anybody in this room, and maybe even more so because they have actually got the kid in the school in which they have to invest. 
   The case can also be made--and I think we have made it--that these dollars will be effectively and efficiently handled because they are going to be subject to conditions which are reasonable, which basically require academic achievement to improve amongst our low-income children. 
   I believe the case can be made, looking at the statistics, that the States are already doing the job better than we are doing; that they are not absorbing huge amounts of the dollars in bureaucracy but, rather, are putting those dollars into the classroom, which is where they should end up. 
   When I hear the other side talk about the poor suffering Governors as being the problem, I shake my head and think, what can they be thinking, because clearly they are inaccurate. I believe our approach to this bill is the right approach. Let's give the Governors, the local schools, parents, and teachers some flexibility, and let's expect them to produce results. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the Senator from Washington has brought forward her amendment on class size on a number of occasions, and it has been well debated already. My colleagues on both sides of the aisle have expressed their view on it. But I do think there are still some points that need to be made. 
   Of course, the fundamental problem is one of philosophy. The essential theme of the proposal is that Washington knows best. It is a top-down proposal, a straitjacket to the local school districts and to the States. It is a demand. If you, the States, want to have education dollars coming to you from Washington, then you, the States, must do exactly as we tell you here in Washington. Flexibility or ideas which  you may want to pursue at the State level are stifled. 
   This, of course, is different than the philosophy which we have proposed in our bill. Our bill, relative to teachers, says: Yes, if the local community feels it needs more teachers to reduce class size, it can hire teachers with the money to do that. But if the local community feels it needs to educate its teachers to do a better job, it can use the money to do that also. Or if it feels it has some teachers who are uniquely capable and need to be kept in the school system because there is a private sector demand for them that maybe will attract them out of the school system as a result of higher compensation in the private sector, then they can use the money to pay bonuses to assist keeping the teachers in the school system. 
   It is an attempt to say to that local school district: Here is the money you can have available to you from the Federal Government to assist you with making classrooms work better relative to the teachers' involvement in the classroom. You make the decision--you, the local school district--as to whether you need a smaller student-teacher ratio, whether you need better teachers, better trained teachers, or whether you need to keep your best teachers in your school system. We in Washington do not know the answer to that question. That is the opposite view. 
   I note, however, the problem we confront as a society is not necessarily that our classroom ratios are fundamentally out of skew. As some of my fellow colleagues have said, maybe it polls well to say, ``Class size, class size, class size, that's what improves education.'' But study after study has shown us that is not necessarily the case. Class size is not necessarily the driver of a quality education. In fact, if you look at it in historical perspective--people who look back on the old days as education working better in this country say in the 1960s or 1950s, you will see the class size ratio was really rather dramatically worse than it is today. In 1960, the class size ratio was 26 to 1 average in the nation. Today, for most States it is around 18 to 1. 
   Or if you look at our fellow competitors in the international community such as Japan or Germany or China or Singapore, where their students are performing much better than our students in the area of math and science, those class size ratios are in the 50-to-1 regime. 
   It is not necessarily the number of students in the classroom relative to the number of teachers. In fact, the study by the gentleman from Rochester which has been recited a number of times, Mr. Eric Hanushek, an economist at the University of Rochester, who looked at almost 300 different studies of the effect of class size on the academic achievement of students concluded it really was not class size that affected the students' achievement. It was--and this should not come as too big a surprise--it was the quality of the teacher. 
   If one looks around the country today, one will notice, especially in our low-income school districts, that teaching quality is in question because many of the teachers are teaching out of their discipline. For example, we know that in the area of math, almost a third of our secondary teachers did not major in math and yet they are teaching math. They did not even minor in math. 
   In the area of English, almost a fourth of our teachers did not major or minor in English, reading education, literature, speech, or journalism. 
   The same statistics hold true for science and languages, in many instances. The fact is that our teachers have not been trained in the subjects which they are teaching. If a local school district knows that, then they are going to try to improve the teacher's ability to teach that subject. They do not think there has to be more teachers in the classroom; they think the teacher in the classroom has to know the subject better in the discipline they are teaching. 
   Our bill gives that option to the local school district. It says they can improve the teacher's ability in that area of activity the teacher is teaching. That makes much more sense. 
   We also know that a poor teacher teaching in a class does tremendous damage to students. In fact, arguably, a poor teacher in a class can do more damage to students than a good teacher in a class does good. Bill Saunders, who headed the Tennessee study, determined that 3 years of high-quality teaching versus 3 years of poor-quality teaching can mean the difference between a student being enrolled in remedial classes versus a student making it in honor classes. 
   We know from a Dallas study that a low-quality teacher actually stunts the academic performance of the students in that classroom. 
   So it is the quality of the teacher we should be stressing, as well as the ratio of teacher to student. The only thing that is stressed in the President's proposal, as brought forward by the Senator from Washington, is teacher-student ratio. There is no emphasis on quality at the level that gives the schools the flexibility they need to address quality. 
   In fact, the whole program is a little skewed because, even relative to school districts, the program is designed not to reflect class size; it is designed more to reflect the level of income of the school system as to whether or not they qualify for the funds. There is a problem there. 
   We also know in our high schools, where 40 percent of the students qualify for free lunches, that 40 percent of the classes are taught by unqualified math teachers. That is even a higher statistic than we see here. 
   It means essentially that when one is in a low-income school district--and this chart shows that--they have even a higher likelihood of getting an unqualified teacher or at least a teacher who is not experienced or has not been trained in the 
   area they are teaching. 
   The green bar reflects school districts where more than 49 percent of the kids receive free lunches, and in those school districts 40 percent of the teachers do not have math as their primary area of qualification. Yet they are teaching math. Thirty-one percent of the teachers in English fall into that category; 20 percent of the science teachers fall into that category. 
   We know from looking at what has been happening in the educational community, therefore, if we are concerned about low-income kids, we should not be so focused on class size as we should be on getting somebody teaching the math who actually understands math. 
   Today, unfortunately, that is not the case. In the low-income high schools across this country, many of the teachers simply do not have the math background they need. 
   What are we suggesting in our bill? Rather than saying to that high school, you must put the money into hiring a new teacher, we are suggesting the teachers they have maybe are not trained well enough in math, and if that is their decision, they can send them out to get better training or bring in people to help them get better training in that area. 
   We also know putting in place a compulsory class size ratio can create significant negative, unintended consequences because that is exactly what happened in California. When California went down this route, they ended up getting a large number of unqualified teachers and teacher assistants teaching students. This was especially true in the rural and low-income school districts in California. 
   As a result, we saw in California that they may have gotten better ratios, but they got poorer teachers. The only advantage to a poor teacher teaching a smaller class size is that fewer kids are subjected to that teacher. That is the only advantage of a reduced class size if a school has a poor teacher. It makes much more sense to follow the proposal we put forward, which is to give flexibility to the States as they address this issue. 
   Another point that needs to be made is that almost 42 States today meet the ratios which the President is requesting, an 18-to-1 ratio. Forty-two States already have that ratio as an average across their school districts. Of course, the President's proposal, as brought forward by the Senator from Washington, will not allow an average to get out from underneath the requirements in their bill. Every school district must have an 18-to-1 ratio before they can get out from underneath using the money for the purposes of hiring a teacher to reduce the class size ratio.  
   Even though the State, as a whole, may have reached 18 to 1, it does not matter. The fact is that most States in this country have reached the 18-to-1 ratio and, therefore, they probably have other things they would rather do with this money to assist the teachers they already have in place. Those other things include giving the teachers more opportunity to be better at the job they are doing, which should be our goal. 
   In addition to allowing teachers to be better at the job they are doing, our bill allows the school districts to do other things with this money. This chart reflects that. Under current law, which this amendment is essentially an attempt to expand, we have $1.6 billion committed to basically two purposes: professional development for math and science teachers. That is the Eisenhower grant which is not actually involved in this amendment. Class size is this amendment. 
   Under our bill, we take the Eisenhower grant and class size and we end up with $2 billion. We allow it to be used for a variety of areas where local school systems are in need of improving their educational and professional development for science, for math, for history, for English, and for reading; technology training for teachers; teacher mentoring, which is something that has worked very well, getting a high-quality teacher into a community of teachers and having that teacher pass on his or her knowledge; alternative certification, teacher recruitment, which is also critical in our society today, getting quality teachers into the profession; teacher retention, as I mentioned is important because of competition today; hiring special education teachers; or class size reduction. 
   If the local school district comes to the conclusion that it needs more teachers to reduce the ratio of teachers to students, then there is absolutely no limitation in our bill on them. They can do exactly that. 
   They can take all the money they receive under the TEA Act, Teacher Empowerment Act--which the amendment of the Senator from Washington would basically replace--they can take all the money, and they can use it for the purpose of reducing the student-teacher ratio. 
   If they decide, as many school districts will--because you saw the statistics. It is not necessarily ratio relationships which develop quality teaching; it is more likely to be a quality teacher who delivers quality teaching. So many school districts are going to choose to make their teachers better. We are going to give them that opportunity, that flexibility to do that. 
   Regrettably, the amendment of the Senator from Washington, which is essentially a restatement of the President's proposal, does not do that. I ask, How can there be resistance to a proposal which says, essentially: All right, school districts, if you want to reduce class size, you can use the money to do that. That is your choice. But, if, on the other hand, you have some other concerns that you, the principal, that you, the parent, that you, the teacher, that you, the community, believe is important to make that school work better relative to the teachers' ability to deliver a better education to the kids, then, in certain limited areas, you can pursue those opportunities. You can train teachers. You can make them better. You can keep teachers who are of high quality. 
   How can you resist an idea which gives those options to the State? The only way you can resist that idea is if you do not have any confidence in the local schools and the people who are running those local schools. 
   We have heard it again and again from the other side of the aisle that they do not trust the Governors--the Senator from Rhode Island essentially said that--that they do not trust the local school districts, that they do not trust the local teaching community, and that they do not trust the parents in those communities. Why? Because, according to the other side of the aisle, those folks failed with 93 percent of the money, and we in Washington had better tell them how to use the 7 percent we send them and manage the life of the local school district for them because they certainly cannot do it themselves, because there is some bureaucrat down here in downtown Washington, sitting in a building on the third floor in a room you cannot find, and I cannot find, who knows a heck of a lot better how to run Johnny Jones' educational opportunities up in New Hampshire than his parents in Epping, NH, his teacher, his principal, the school board in Epping, NH, or the Governor of New Hampshire. 
   It is an attitude of complete arrogance, an attitude that says, we know so much more about education in Washington than the people who have dedicated their lives to this issue and more than the Governors, who, by the way, have the primary responsibility for education. They are not going to turn to the African trade bill tomorrow. They are going to be turning to education tomorrow. They work on it every day, not just one week out of every year.

   Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator for his generosity. 
   They say they know so much more than the Governors, the boards of education, the principals, the superintendents, the 
   teachers, and, most importantly, the parents. They say they can run the school systems from here in Washington. 
   As I have said before, it is as if the folks on that side of the aisle want a string. They want to run a string out to every school system in America, every classroom in America, from the desks on the other side of the aisle. They want to have hundreds of thousands of strings running out, and they are going to pull the strings and tell America how to run their classrooms. 
   It is an attitude which I cannot accept. It is an attitude which we have tried to avoid in this bill, by giving flexibility--subject to achievement, subject to accountability--to the local school districts. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield back my time to the Senator from Vermont.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, there have been a number of representations that have been inaccurate from the other side, and I regret that. I think that maybe they are concerned that the substance of this bill works so well, they have to mischaracterize the actual process in order to attack it. The representation that there are voucher proposals in this bill is inaccurate. The senior Senator from Washington has offered an amendment which would make this absolutely clear. 
   He put the status of the Straight A's proposal in this bill in the same position as the present law under the ESEA of 1965, which law does not limit the ability to use the funds for public entities. So that law, as viewed, is a chilling event on school systems from using it for private entities which would create the voucher issue. 
   The amendment of the senior Senator from Washington clarifies that point, which was a point raised in committee and which was the language reported out of committee. If a State such as Florida has a private voucher system--I guess the issue now is whether they have one or not--those funds can be used in this manner. But as a practical matter, what the Senator from Washington is making clear is that they can't--that they will be subject to the chilling event that presently exists for any title I money. That chilling event has basically made it virtually impossible for vouchers to be used by any State. This was the concern of the Senator from Maine. 
   That is why I have agreed wholeheartedly with the amendment of the Senator from Washington, as I believe we should not allow the bogeyman vouchers--it has been used as a bogeyman by the other side--to be used to try to undermine what is a really good idea, which is the concept of Straight A's. 
   The basic theme of Straight A's doesn't need vouchers in order to work  well, and we don't have to get in the voucher debate in order for Straight A's to work well. I am perfectly happy to have the voucher issue taken off the table. I don't think it was really on the table to begin with because I don't think many States have a system to make it available. But even if it was on the table, the Senator from Washington is taking it off the table. 
   I heard about this attempt this morning from a number of people on a couple of talk shows. Representatives of the educational lobby are here in Washington in full charge against any idea of changing the status quo because they basically are the beneficiaries of the status quo. They are also trying to use the term ``vouchers'' to stigmatize this piece of legislation, which I suppose is the defense of folks who really can't defend their positions in opposition to this language on substance. 
   The fact is that Straight A's, as put forward, is an optional program. It is up to each State whether they want to pursue it. 
   If a State pursues Straight A's, the achievement obligations in the area of increasing the educational success of our low-income children is very strict. Straight A's is an attempt to give low-income children a better education and to require that better education actually be proved to have occurred, something that has not happened under title I over the last 35 years after $130 billion has been spent. 
   Also, one of the Senators came out and said it is also about portability. There is no voucher program for portability. Portability is not a voucher program. All the money under portability stays with the public school systems. The public school systems write the check. The public school systems control the dollars. 
   This is once again a bogeyman attempt to try to mischaracterize the bill and, as a result of using mischaracterization, to try to, therefore, tune up opposition to it. 
   I think we ought to stick to the substance of the actual language versus those types of presentations which I don't think 
   are constructive to the debate. 
   I yield to the Senator from Georgia.

   Mr. GREGG. No. Under no circumstance was portability ever represented as a voucher, or ever represented as a voucher in committee. What I said was Straight A's could have been used by a State to qualify that it had set up a voucher program such as Florida had. Yes, in those instances Straight A's could have been used. The Senator from Washington was making it very clear that is not going to happen.

   Mr. GREGG. No. The Senator is incorrect in her characterization. The family does not have possession of the funds. The funds go to the public school. The public school, at the request of the family, may then and should then take the money and use it to support that child in an additional learning activity. 
   In other words, the child has to go to the public school. The child cannot go to a private school under portability and use funds for the purpose of going to a private school. The child must attend the public school. If they decide to do so under the plan as presented to the Secretary of Education, under their portability plan as designed by the public school system, the public school may use those dollars as it does today for the purpose of giving additional support to the low-income child in assisted learning.

   Mr. GREGG. I regret the Senator will not yield to debate this issue in a forum-like manner. Let me answer the question on my own time because I guess the Senator isn't making her point because she recognizes her point is inaccurate. 
   If the language is as they stated, the school has the control over the dollars. The parent has the right to direct the school to pursue an assisted learning activity. But the child is in the public school and the public school controls the dollars for that assisted learning activity. 
   The only difference between the present law and what this does relative to that assisted learning activity, in this case the parent gets involved. Under present law, the parent is not involved in the assisted learning activity. If they want to bring in the Sylvan Learning Center or any tutorial service to help the low-income child, they can do that, but the parent does not have the right to say do it or not do it. Under this proposal, the parent has the right to say, yes, please send my child to an assisted learning facility. 
   The school, however, has the right to say they don't think that an assisted learning activity qualifies as being a quality educational activity and is applicable to this child's needs. If the school overrules it because they say that the assisted learning activity is not a qualified activity, then the parent can't direct the funds to go in that area. 
   Essentially, what we are proposing is a system which already exists in Arizona--in fact, I think Seattle may have some form of this system--where parents actually get involved in the process of educating low-income kids. Parents actually have something to say about it. 
   We all know from history and from study after study after study that pertinent for improving the quality of education of the child is parental involvement. We also know that the single biggest problem we have with low-income children is the fact that parents are not involved. This is an opportunity to draw the parent into the process and have the parent have a role in the process. That is very important. 
   Equally important, this is an opportunity to make sure the dollars actually benefit the low-income child. Under the present law, there are lots of low-income children who don't get any benefit from the title I dollars, which are low-income dollars theoretically. Why is that? Because if a school does not have a threshold number of children, does not have the 35 percent, or in some States it is up to 65 percent of the kids in the school who qualify as low income, in other words, kids who meet the School Lunch Program, then no dollars go to that school. 
   If you are a low-income child attending a school where you don't have 35 percent of the other kids in the school as low-income children, you don't get any title I assistance. Does that make any sense? Of course, it doesn't make any sense. 
   We are saying, instead of having the dollars go to the school systems and to the administration and to the bureaucracy, let's have the dollars follow the child. Let's have the dollars actually follow the child to different public schools so every child who is a low-income child actually gets funded, actually gets dollars benefiting that child. 
   That is a pretty good idea because that means we are actually going to point the dollars at the kids who we allegedly are trying to help, the low-income kids. The dollars never 
   leave the public school system in the sense that all dollars must go to the public school. In other words, the parent does not have the control over those dollars. He doesn't get a check. 
   If John Jones goes to public school A, the dollars go to public school A. If the parent says they don't think public school A is doing the best job for their child, and then moves John Jones to public school B, the dollars go to public school B. When John Jones gets to public school B, if the parent says they think John Jones needs some assisted learning outside of his schoolday--remember, his whole schoolday is dominated by the public school system and he cannot go to a private school with these dollars--then the dollars go to the assisted learning to the extent it is required in order to pay for that assisted learning subject to the public school system, and subject to the public school system saying that the assisted learning is actually something that is qualified and will do the job as they deem it appropriate, recognizing that under present law we already allow this to occur. We allow assisted learning which is a private activity. 
   To characterize this as a voucher is an inexcusable attempt to try to stigmatize this with a term that is being used for the purposes of creating an irrational response from folks, especially teachers and the educational community. It is simply hyperbole for the purposes of trying to beat this for political reasons. It is not a substantive or an accurate response to what this proposal involves. 
   Remember, this proposal--whether it is portability or whether it is the Senator from Washington's Straight A's proposal--is an option. No State has to pursue this. No community has to use this. If they decide to pursue this, if the State decides it wants to use portability, it is the educational community in that State that has come together, that has thought about the issue, that has said: Title I isn't working in its presents form; let's try a portability initiative. 
   It will be the educators who write the portability initiative in the State and who apply for it. They will have the say in how it is structured. They don't have to do it if they don't want to do it. 
   If the State of New Hampshire decides they like the way they are doing title I, they don't care about trying this new idea of portability or this Straight A's idea, they can walk away from the proposal. They don't have to do it. They can keep the law the way it is. 
   Why is there such fear on the other side of the aisle of putting on the table a bunch of different options, having a cafeteria line that States and communities can go through? I don't understand it. They have been stratified, iced into the status quo, petrified into the status quo to the point they are not willing to adjust in any way or give the States any opportunity for adjustment. It is regrettable. 
   It is regrettable because it means we basically, as we know for 35 years, are locking our low-income kids into generation after generation of failure. We know for a fact our low-income kids simply have not achieved. We ought to try some other ideas. We ought to let our States try some other ideas. 
   There are a lot of States out there that want to try other ideas, and we should not lock them out of that opportunity with Federal dollars. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I rise to respond to some of the points made by some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle during the debate yesterday because, unfortunately, they have attempted, I believe, to mischaracterize our bill as it comes forward. The reason for mischaracterizing it I don't understand. Maybe they are not fully informed about it or they simply believe the bill is so strong that they can't defend it when they talk about it in its real form; therefore, they must characterize it as a fantasy and then attack the fantasy as being inappropriate. 
   Let's begin with the Senator from Massachusetts who came to the floor yesterday and said that the flexibility we are suggesting to the States will just revisit the situation where States were spending education dollars on things such as uniforms and tubas. I must say, I think the Senator from Massachusetts is in a time warp on this point. That happened back when tubas and uniforms were bought, and I think one or two schools actually did that. 
   Title I was passed in 1965. That was 35 years ago. I think it is important that people catch up with today and the events of today. It is important that people catch up with the events of today and the educational system of today. We have had 35 years of title I, the proposal as structured by a Democratic Congress for the purpose of addressing the issue of education of low-income children. That Congress was controlled by the Democrats for the vast majority of those 35 years. 
   What have we gotten as a result of that? We have spent $120 billion to $130 billion on title I, and the achievement level of low-income children has not improved; it has either decreased or it has stayed the same. We know low-income children in the fourth grade are reading at two grade levels lower than the other children in that grade level. We know the low-income children in our inner cities are reading at grade levels significantly lower, and some can't read at all as they head toward high school graduation. 
   We know, for example, as this chart shows, that 70 percent-plus of our students in high-poverty schools are below the basic levels in reading, 60 percent-plus are below the basic levels in math, and almost 70 percent are below the basic levels in science. We know the program has not worked. Yet Members from the other side decide to stroll onto the floor and start citing problems from 30 years ago and acting as if they have corrected those problems over the last 35 years. 
   They haven't corrected the problems in education. They have aggravated the problems in education. Generation after generation of children have been put through a system that has not allowed them to achieve. Low-income children have been denied the American dream because they haven't been educated to read and to write. They are complicit in this. They say the status quo works. They basically say they have the answers. 
   Let me quote from the President on this point. I like to hold up these charts myself, and I can read them. This is from the Washington Post in which the President is quoted. He told the reporters the Federal money for new teachers does not belong to the States and local school districts. ``It is not their 
   money,'' he said. 
   That is the attitude on the other side, that it is not their money. Well, whose money is it? Where does this money come from? It is obviously the taxpayers' money, and it obviously is coming out of the local school districts and States. It comes to Washington. But for some reason, the mentality on the other side is that we then capture this money here in Washington, send it back to the States, and tell the States exactly what to do with it--categorical, targeted, and straitjacketed programs; programs after programs, regulations after regulations, 900 pages of new law. What do they get for it? What have we gotten for it after 35 years? Very little. Our low-income kids have gotten even less--virtually no improvement in their academic efforts. 
   So the Members on the other side come to the floor and they say things such as, ``This money will be spent, once again, as it was 35 years ago, if flexibility is given to the States, on tubas and football uniforms.'' 
   I guess they didn't read the bill because it is very specific. For the first time, we are expecting achievement in exchange for giving the States these flexibility opportunities with these funds. This bill, as a result of the Republican initiative, says there must be academic achievement. It must be provable. It must be academic achievement which can be shown to have occurred through tests that have been given at the local level. The academic achievement must occur amongst our low-income kids so they are not left behind. 
   We are not suggesting dumbing down, as has occurred, regrettably, in too many school systems. We are not suggesting lowering the average so that it looks as if the low-income child is getting closer to the norm. No, we are saying low-income children's achievement must improve as a result of low-income kids actually doing better in math and science and reading in relationship to their peers. 
   Equally important is that the achievement accountability standards in this bill are very specific in saying they will be disaggregated. What does that mean? That means they are not going to be able to hide the performance of low-income kids behind throwing them in with the average; you will have to look at groups on the basis of their abilities and their classification so we will know whether poor children from the inner city are actually improving in their educational efforts, and we won't have a poor child being claimed to have improved because he or she is put in a pool with kids who have higher incomes and who are attending different school systems. 
   So we have very specific achievement requirements in this bill. You cannot, in any way, come down here and, in fairness, or with objectivity, or, in my opinion, with an accurate reading of our bill, claim this is the type of program that occurred 30 or 35 years ago and it is, therefore, not going to work today. 
   This is entirely different. It is an attempt to acknowledge what study after study has shown. Study after study has shown it is not Federal programs and title I that have worked to help kids; local communities and States focusing on kids' education have helped kids. In those States that have actually seen an increase in the achievement levels of low-income kids, such as Texas and North Carolina, success has been specifically achieved because the local schools had flexibility and control over the State money. 
   It wasn't because of Federal dollars. In fact, a NEPA study by the National Education Goals Panel reported that ``the study concludes that the most plausible explanation for test score gains are found in the policy  environment established in each State''--not in any policies that came out of Washington. 
   The point is this: The other side is trying to mislead us. It is making representations which are totally inaccurate on the issue of how these dollars, which are put into more flexible arenas such as Straight A's portability, will be used. 
   There is specific accountability. Straight A's requires that States establish annual numeric goals for increasing the percentage of economically disadvantaged students, of minority students, and of students with limited English proficiency. It requires that those kids meet higher abilities of proficiency and that they advance in their ability in math, science, and English. 
   This representation, which we have now heard for at least a day and we have heard in the press for numerous days, about the ability to just simply throw money in the school systems and allow them to spend it for whatever they want--tubas, footballs, or uniforms--is a fantasy being made by people who are living in a time warp, not only a time warp relevant to that fantasy, but it is a time warp about what is the proper way to approach education. They are unwilling to look at any change. They are so mired in the status quo that they are unwilling to consider any change--even one such as we put forward as an options approach versus an approach which requires the States to do something. We say the States should have the option to try these new ideas. We don't say they must try the ideas. 
   Another area: There was a representation that Straight A's would end up undermining the ability of kids to achieve in the sense that the school will get the money, that the money won't flow to the low-income child, and that it will be used on some other activity within the school system. They are not talking here about tubas and uniforms. They are talking about another school activity which might end up benefiting the average-income student versus the low-income student. That may be. 
   But the point is, of course, that at end of the day the school system must prove the academic achievement of the low-income child has increased to get the money. However they spend the money, the results of spending the money must be that the academic achievement of the low-income child must improve. This is the new trust we put into this bill. We are concerned about the achievement of the low-income child, and we are not willing to spend another 35 years throwing money at a problem and creating a status quo in education that loses another generation or two of kids. 
   Senator MURRAY came to the floor. She said this is a block grant. First, it is not a block grant because it has all of the categorical programs still in place. The money flows into the States. The States still have the categorical programs. They can spend it on any one of those programs. But they will have the ability to move it amongst those programs. They have the accountability standard which we put in place. 
   But, more important than that, she goes on and says block grant programs are always easy to cut and therefore we shouldn't do this because the programs might get cut and might end up reducing funding. 
   I point out that it is this Republican Congress that has significantly increased funding for education over the last 4 
   years. We have increased Federal funding for K through 12 by 67 percent. That is a big improvement. 
   Equally important, it is this administration--and specifically on the other side of the aisle--that has suggested cutting block grant programs. Title VI, which is the only true block grant under ESEA, has been put in for zeroing out and for cutting in every Clinton/Gore budget. That is a block grant program that has been proposed as zeroing out. 
   There is a certain disingenuousness when Members on the other side of the aisle come down here and give us crocodile tears about cutting educational spending--especially block grant educational spending--when it is their side that has proposed time and time again in their budgets that we do exactly that. 
   It is our side that has proposed and has succeeded in significantly increasing funding for the various functions of education--elementary and secondary specifically--and this bill does the same. 
   It is an important debate we are pursuing right now because it is a debate over the fundamental question of how we improve education for our children, and specifically for our low-income children. It does none of us any good to have a mischaracterization and a misrepresentation of the proposals that are brought to the floor. 
   Regrettably, the other side has participated in hyperbole of a rather aggressive nature. I suggest if they really wanted to debate the issue of education, they would turn from hyperbole to getting into substance. 
   Explain to us why we shouldn't put pressure on the local school districts to require that low-income children succeed. 
   Explain to us why we should not empower parents, teachers, principals, and school board members to make the decisions as to how to better educate low-income children. 
   Explain to us why they believe--by ``they'' I mean the people here in Washington who represent the educational establishment in Washington--they know more about educating a child, a low-income child specifically, in the town of Rye, or the town of Epping, or the town of Grantham, NH, than the people who spend their whole life in Rye, in Epping, and in Grantham, NH, working to educate that child, and the parents of that child who happen to be totally committed to its education. 
   Why do we believe we know more and can do a better job? 
   We have put forward a series of proposals which say to the States: You do not have to take any of them. You can continue this program called title I exactly as it is, if that is what you desire. But if you want to try something more creative, we are going to give you four or five really good options that have worked in other States such as Arizona, or in other cities such as Seattle. And you can undertake those proposals. But it is up to you to make that choice. 
   The other side needs to come down here and explain to us substantively why it is inappropriate to give States those options when we don't deny that there is a chance to use title I. They refuse to do that. They refuse to address the substance of the issue. Instead, they use hyperbole and go back 56 years to find a problem that has no relationship to today. It is a meager response to this bill coming from the other side of the aisle. Regrettably, it does not do them a service and it doesn't do this debate a great deal of service. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GREGG. Thank you, Madam President. 
   I congratulate the Senator from Vermont for bringing this bill forward. We recognize it is an extraordinarily important piece of legislation because it sets Federal policy for education, especially in the primary area where the Federal Government has responsibility, which is low-income education. 
   There are really two areas of elementary and secondary school education where the Federal Government is the dominant player. One, of course, is elementary school education--the low-income kids. The other is elementary school education for special needs children. This bill doesn't address the special needs issue. It is not the IDEA bill, which is a special needs bill. This bill focuses primarily on how we deal with low-income children. 
   I think it is important to reflect a little bit as we begin this debate as to what the history of this piece of legislation is because that puts in context to a significant degree why it is we on our side believe there needs to be interest for other options to be made available to the States as they address the issue of educating and helping low-income children achieve and, thus, realize the American dream. 
   This bill was put together 35 years ago. At that time, it was a 32-page bill with 5 specific programs. Today, this bill before us has 922 pages; it has 79 different programs. It is a huge piece of legislation which has expanded radically over the period of the last 35 years. It originally had, and still has, categorical program after categorical program which specifically told the local school districts and the States how to manage very narrow areas of education in a very prescribed way. 
   There has been a philosophy built up over 35 years in this Congress--essentially dominated by the Democratic Party when this bill evolved--that essentially says: We in Washington know a heck of a lot better how to educate a low-income child than you folks back in the districts do where that child is going to school; We know better than the parents of that child; We know better than the teachers of that child; We know better than the principal; We know better than the school district; And we know better than the State. 
   As a result, this bill exploded from a 32-page bill to a 1,000-page bill with program after program after program very narrowly, rifle-shot targeted with  significant limitations on the funds being spent and significant directions for the local communities. 
   What was the result? The result was that over that period we spent almost $130 billion in education directed at low-income children--$130 billion over 35 years. What did we get for that? Unfortunately, what we had was a bunch of kids who were left behind--children to whom we had made a commitment, and low-income children who weren't educated hardly at all as a result of all of these dollars being spent. 
   We know for a fact today that two out of every three low-income fourth grade African American and Hispanic children can barely read. This chart shows that over 70 percent of the children in our high-poverty schools who are low-income do not meet the most basic levels in reading. We know 60 percent of those children do not meet the basic levels of mathematics. We know almost 70 percent of those children do not meet the basic levels in science. 
   This is the product we have produced $130 billion and 35 years later: 79 programs and 1,000 pages of law. We know in our high-poverty schools, low-income kids in the fourth grade read at two grade levels less than their peers who are not low-income. We know in our urban schools almost half our children are not graduating from high school. We know the achievement gap between our moderate-income, our average-income kids and our low-income kids is not closing as it was supposed to after $130 billion but is potentially expanding and, at best remains the same. 
   We have gotten nothing for these kids from all this money that has been spent. It is not just our low-income kids, the children addressed in this bill who are being affected by the quality of education, but our entire educational system has serious problems. Forty percent of our fourth graders can't read at a fourth grade level. Our 12th graders have seen either a decline in reading, math, and writing skills or, at best, a stagnation of reading, math, and writing skills. I am talking about all 12th graders--not just low-income 12th graders. 
   Our 12th graders, compared with the rest of the world, which is where we are competing today, and what our prosperity is tied to, come in about last among industrialized nations. We are behind Hungary, Slovenia, Austria, Germany, Netherlands, and Sweden. We are just about last in levels of academic achievement in mathematics and last for our academic levels in science. 
   We know there are 7,000 schools in this country today that are deemed failing schools. They are not defined as ``failing'' by the Federal Government. We have not set a standard to say a school is failing. They are defined as failing by the school systems at the State and local levels that rate their own levels. School systems rating their own schools have identified over 7,000 schools that do not meet the standards they have set. Some of the schools have had the failing designation for not just 1 or 2 years but for up to 6 or 10 years. 
   We need to be very concerned about this. We are not the only ones, as legislatures, who are concerned. Our manufacturers and our people who are trying to hire folks so they can become prosperous, so they can have good jobs, and so we as a country can compete internationally, are concerned. United States manufacturers have found that 40 percent of all 17-year-olds do not have the math skills necessary to do the job for which they are hired; 60 percent do not have the reading skills necessary to do a manufacturing job. That is a staggering number. Over half the kids leaving our school systems come in to their work experience without the ability to do the job because they cannot read and they cannot do math. 
   Madam President, 76 percent of our college professors and 63 percent of our employers believe that a high school diploma is no guarantee the typical student has learned the basics necessary to function in our society, and specifically, in college and the businesses into which they are being hired. 
   We obviously have a very significant problem. I must stress this problem isn't a lack of money. As I said, we have spent $130 billion for title I kids over the last 35 years. We have also as a Federal Government dramatically increased our funding. This chart reflects how much we have increased funding for education generally in this country from 1950 to the year 1997--from about $10 billion to well over $300 billion in total expenditures from K-12. 
   This chart shows how much we are spending on our increases on children per pupil during that period. From 1970 to 1999, we see the increase per pupil went from $1,000 to well over $7,000 in this country. 
   The United States spends 6 percent of its national income on primary and secondary school education which is more than any other of those industrialized countries. Every one of these countries spends less of their gross national product for education than the United States, except Denmark and Canada. All the other countries spend less as a percentage of their national product on education. 
   It is not a function of dollars being spent. It is a function of what we are getting for our dollars that we are spending that is the problem. 
   Somebody else said it is a function of the teacher ratio; We simply have too many kids in the classrooms for the teachers to handle. There may be instances where that is the case. I think that is possibly true. But as a practical matter, when reviewing the statistics, it is hard to defend that position. In the 1960s, there were 26 pupils per teacher. Today there are 17 students per pupil in this country, on average. The President has said he wants to have 18 students to one teacher. That is the ratio he wants to reach. As a practical matter, 42 States in this country already have ratios which equal either 18 to 1 or better for the ratio of students to teachers. We know we have a problem, and it is very significant. 
   Some States have taken this issue on and made significant success. I point to Texas as an example. They have reduced their achievement gap by almost a third between the low-income kids and the high-income kids, and they have not done it by reducing the level of the achievement of the higher or the moderate-income child, the non low-income child. They have done it by raising achievement levels of the low-income child. 
   One might ask: How have they done it? Texas--and there are lots of other States initiating these programs, including Michigan, Arizona--has done it by being creative, taking a different approach with their kids by demanding achievement in most instances. 
   When we looked at this bill as it came to the committee for reauthorization, we looked at the statistics and said one thing we know is what we are doing is not working. There are a lot on the other side who are willing to defend the status quo. I am not. These numbers are staggering. We have had generation after generation of low-income children who have been given the raw deal in the way the Federal Government has addressed the issue of educating or trying to help educate them by assisting the local communities. 
   Their achievement levels have not increased. They cannot do math, they cannot read, even though we have poured these huge amounts of dollars into trying to help them out. So we knew it was not working, the status quo. We knew those 79 programs that had come, originally, from 5 simply had not resolved the problem. 
   I guess they made a lot of people feel good because there is hardly a Member, especially on the other side of the aisle, who has served here for any length of time who does not have one of these targeted programs that is called something--something to help somebody somewhere that has his or her name on it so they can put out their press releases and go back to their States and say: I put out the ``da-da-da'' program which helps ``da-da-da.'' 
   But the problem is, that has not improved the education of the children at all, especially the low-income children. So we, on our side of the aisle, said let's try to think of a better way to do this. We came up with a basic thematic approach. We said that, first, the programs we put forward should be child centered. That might seem obvious and everybody might say, of course, they should be child centered; it is education. Unfortunately, title I, the way it was originally designed and the way it functioned up until 1994, was not a child-centered program. 
   Title I was a school-centered program, an administrator-centered program. Basically, the money went to the  schools. If you happened to be a low-income child, you may or may not have ever seen that money. If you happened to be a low-income child in a school system which had less than 35 percent of its kids being low-income kids, you were absolutely not going to see any of that money because none of that money could go to your school. So a lot of low-income children were simply written out of the system, and the money did not go to the children; it went to the schools. So we said let's have a child-centered approach where we are really looking at the children. 
   Second, we said title I has not accomplished its purpose, it has not improved the education of low-income kids, so let's put the emphasis on achievement; We especially want to see low-income children have their math and reading skills increased; We do not want to see them put into some aggregation where there is a claim of increase because they are part of an average; We want a disaggregated approach, so different groups within the low-income community are looked at independently. 
   Then we want those groups of kids to improve relative to everyone else. We don't want everyone else to be brought down; We want to see better math skills, better science skills, better reading skills for the low-income children so when they leave school, they can read and they can write and they can do math. So we decided we were going to have an achievement-oriented proposal. 
   First, it was child centered; second, it was achievement oriented. 
   Third, we came to the conclusion that maybe we do not know best here in Washington; maybe the local school districts do know what they are doing. I meet very few parents, teachers, and principals who really don't want good education. Almost everyone I ever meet who is a parent of a student or teacher or principal or superintendent really does want good education. That is why they have committed their lives to this exercise. 
   So we said let's give the flexibility to local school districts so they can make the decision as to how to allocate the funds within their school districts and within their schools the way it will get the best results. 
   In order to give that flexibility we also said, fourth, that we want accountability. We want the local school districts in the States to show us the kids are achieving at a higher level. They have to be accountable. 
   So it has four steps: Child-centered, achievement, flexibility, and accountability. That is the theme on which we built this bill, or the ideas we put into this bill. 
   There was another approach which we took, which is a tactical approach. We said we do not know all the answers, unlike some on the other side who appear to think they do know all the answers. We said we don't know all the answers, we don't know what the States need and what they want, so we are going to give the States an optional approach. We are not going to say you have to do this in order to get the money, or you have to do that in order to qualify for the program. We are going to set out a series of options. 
   The way I describe it is it is similar to a cafeteria line. A State can go down that cafeteria line, or a local school district can go down that cafeteria line, and they can pick out the program which they think best suits their ability to produce the results for the low-income child, to enable that child to have a better school experience and to learn more. 
   We do not say you have to take any specific program. We do not say in order to get a new teacher you have to take class-size dollars, and if you take class-size dollars, you can't do anything but get new teachers. We don't say that. We say you, the State, can go down this cafeteria line, and if you like this program--and I will talk about them in a second--if you like Straight A's or you like portability or you like public school choice, you can just take that program and try it out in the context of an accountability system where you have to prove that you achieve the results of improving the quality of education for the low-income child. 
   But if you don't want any of those programs, if your educational community is so strong in your State and you believe you are doing such a good job that you want to stick with title I as it is presently structured out of all the different rules and regulations and all the categorical programs, you can do that, too. You can go right down through that cafeteria line, don't pick up anything, and get the same amount of money. If you take any one of these programs, you get the same amount of money. We are not going to affect anybody's ability to get the dollars the Federal Government is sending to them. They are all going to get the same amount of dollars, but we are going to give some States and communities an opportunity to have options. 
   It has outraged the other side of the aisle for some reason, the idea we would give options. Maybe it is because we are not demanding people do this. The approach we often hear, regretfully, from the Washington educational establishment is you must tell people what to do. We are not going to do that. We are going to say you have options and when you choose an option, then we are going to say you have to produce the results, yes, but you will have flexibility within that option to produce those results. 
   Let me talk briefly, because there is going to be a lot of debate about these items, about the four major options in this 
   bill. There are also a lot of other good initiatives in this bill. The Senator from Maine put in a superb initiative in rural education that is going to help rural school districts be able to manage their Federal dollars more, but that is not controversial because it is such a good idea. Let me talk about the four items that basically set these themes in place. 
   The first, of course, is Straight A's. There are two different types of Straight A programs in this bill. One is the Governors' proposal; the other is pure Straight A's and includes title I. Essentially, what it says is we are going to take a bunch of programs, 14, 15 programs, and instead of having the money go to the States in a categorical way, the States will get the dollars from those programs in a group, and then they will have very significant obligations to meet accountability standards for having improved the achievement of low-income students as a result of getting those dollars--something which does not now exist. We will give them flexibility, but we will expect results. And low-income kids will learn. 
   This is a State's choice, by the way. The State does not have to take Straight A's. If the State doesn't think this will work for it, it does not have to take this track. If a State wants to take this approach, it can. But after taking this approach, it has to prove, after a reasonable amount of time, the kids are actually improving in their educational levels. 
   The second approach is called portability. Here we have tried to engage the parents in the process of becoming involved in the education of the low-income child. I think if there is one thing we all recognize, it is that parent involvement is absolutely critical to good education. This is an attempt to get the parents into the process. This proposal, essentially, says that instead of sending the money to the schools--as I mentioned earlier, if the school does not have 35 percent low-income kids, they don't get any money--instead of sending the money to the schools, we give the money to the schools, but we give it to them in relationship to the children who are in the schools so the money follows the child. It does not flow to the schools. Then the parent has the right to go to that school system and say: I am not happy with what my child is learning in this school. I would like you to put my child into an afterschool program or a tutorial program--not a private school; the child still has to go to the public school--but I would like you to put him or her into some sort of private tutorial assistance, or it could be public tutorial assistance, that may cost more money. 
   That is allowed today under present law, under title I, but it is not at the direction of the parents. The school systems make these decisions. So the parent has the right now to say: Take my title I money and allow my child to get some assisted learning at a Sylvan Learning Center or some sort of other outside assistance program. That is portability. The money goes with the child and the parents, although they never get the dollars, they do not physically have the dollars. This is not anything like a voucher, even though it is  occasionally, by people who are really demagogic, being classified as such, but nobody with any integrity would ever call this a voucher because it is 
   not--the dollars go to the school, and the school has control over the dollars. But the parent has the ability, if the parent decides to do so, to direct that these dollars be used to assist the child in additional educational support, something the school can now do but may not want to do, for whatever reason. 
   That is portability. Again, the most common attack we get on this--and it is legitimate--is: What happens? Under the present system, money comes together in the school system and the school gets to use it to benefit all the kids. It is not going to take control away from the school and their ability to benefit all the kids with these title I dollars. 
   Yes, it is; it is going to benefit the low-income kids. That is exactly what it is going to do. Remember, for this program to go forward, the school district and the State have to have made the decision this is what they want to do. So if the State and the school system come to the conclusion the best way to educate their kids is to use portability as an option, then they can apply for it, but if the local school district, the teachers, the principals, and the administrators decide this is not going to work, they do not have to apply for it; it is an option. 
   There are some States in this country that, obviously, are going to apply for it because they already use portability. Arizona uses portability for its State funds, and the city of Seattle uses portability for its State funds. It is not a new idea. I am sure it will be pursued by those places. It will be on the table and available to them if they want it. 
   Another area is public school choice. As I mentioned, in this country today, 7,000 schools have failed or are failing. What we essentially say is: If your child is in a failing public school--which can do a fair amount of damage to a child, to be in that school for 2 years--but if that school continues to fail for 2 years--and remember, failure is defined by the States, not by us--then the parent has the right to move that child out of that public school. If that public school fails for 4 years, then the parents have a right to move that child out of the public school and the public school system must assist them in the transportation costs of moving their child out of that public school, as long as it is a reasonable number. There is a contingency on how much can be spent. 
   Parents cannot move their children to a private school and get any support. This is a public-school-to-public-school choice. In other words, if a parent wants to move their child out of one failing public school, under this bill, they can move to another public school that they, as a parent, believe is doing better. Again, this is a process of getting parents involved. Equally, it is a process of putting pressure on the 7,000 failing schools. 
   Another area is teacher empowerment. This has already been attacked at some length from the other side of the aisle. I heard a commentary on this. There is a philosophical difference which reflects precisely from where the two different parties are coming. The President, the Vice President, and his supporters, have said: If you want to get more money from the Federal Government, you must use this money to add new teachers to classrooms; you must do it. 
   I do not know how AL GORE or President Clinton know that the town of Milan, NH, needs more teachers, but for some reason they think they do. I do not know how they know that.

   Mr. GREGG. The Senator is absolutely correct. On a side point to which the Senator is making an excellent allusion, it is very hard to tie student-teacher ratio to improved student performance. Study after study has been done on this, and, as a matter of fact, the University of Rochester did a study of the studies done. There have been over 300 studies done on student-teacher ratio and whether or not that is a determinative event in the education of a child, whether the education of a child improves. 
   At the 17-to-1 level, it really is not. The University of Rochester determined the most determinative event was the quality of the teacher; surprisingly enough, it was not the ratio of the students to the teacher. If there is a teacher of poor quality teaching 17 kids versus 26 kids, the only advantage is 9 kids are not getting a lousy education. This study found it was the quality of the teacher that was the determinative event, which brings us to our point. 
   Under our proposal, we say to the local school districts: OK, if you need more teachers, if you want to reduce your classroom percentages, you can do that; you can use the money for that; but if you want to use it to improve your teachers' ability to teach, you can use it for that, too. Or if you have really good teachers and the marketplace is trying to attract them away from the school system--math and science teachers are in great demand in the private sector these days, as are a lot of teachers--then you can pay them a bonus to stay in the school system. 
   We took the teacher size categorical straitjacket the President and Vice President GORE proposed, and we put that together with the Eisenhower teacher training program and created the Teacher Empowerment Act, which essentially says to local school districts: You have the flexibility to use this to improve your teachers in any of three different ways: Add more teachers if you want; give your teachers better educational skills; or pay teachers a little bonus or incentive to stay in the school and teach if they happen to be people you want to keep on board. That is a difference of approach and a philosophical difference. 
   Those are four items that reflect the difference in our themes, and our themes, to reiterate, are these: We think, after 35 years, it is time we focus on the low-income kids and it is time we expect the schools in this country to deliver those low-income kids an education that is going to give them a shot at the American dream. Unfortunately, we have not done that as a society. The record is abysmal, and I have cited countless statistics to support that. What we expect is a program that is child centered, that is achievement oriented, that is flexible and has accountability. 
   I again congratulate the chairman of the committee and members of the committee who worked so hard on this. I look forward to the continuation of this debate over the next couple of weeks. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the issue of how we are fighting drugs in this country--specifically, the President's initiative relative to the country of Colombia in relation to our own initiatives on the southern border of our country. 
   I have the privilege to chair the committee that funds the INS, which includes the Border Patrol, DEA, the department of drug enforcement; and the judiciary. All three agencies, of course, of our Government have a significant role in the issue of drug enforcement and especially as it affects our southern border. 
   The President has asked for $1.6 billion of new money--he has asked for it in an emergency format--to be sent to the country of Colombia, in order for Colombia to fight drugs and the production of drugs. That may well be a reasonable request. I have reservations on its substance, but I also have serious reservations as to its appropriateness in the context of the drug war that we as a Nation face. The reason is simple. When the President sent a budget up to address the agencies that are responsible in our Government to fight drugs, he did not fully fund their needs. He underfunded the needs of the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA; he underfunded the needs of the INS and Border Patrol; he underfunded the needs of the judiciary, which enforces the law. 
   I have made a little chart here that reflects a comparison. The unfunded capital--I am talking about capital needs, one-time items, which involve the construction or technology and needs of these different agencies, the INS, DEA, and the judiciary. The unfunded requests of these agencies represented about $1.8 billion--a little bit more than $1.8 billion. Compare that with the fact that the President is willing to fund almost $800 million--million, not billion--of capital needs for Colombia. 
   Let's do a little review of this because I think it is important for people to understand what happened. Essentially, what the President is saying is that the capital needs of Colombia are more important than the needs of our own drug enforcement agencies here in the United States. For example, the President has requested 15 Huey helicopters for Colombia and 30 Blackhawk helicopters. They are the most advanced helicopters we have in our fleet. Thirty Blackhawk helicopters will cost approximately $388 million. Let me tell you, those 30 helicopters, along with the 15 Hueys, are going to go to Colombia. 
   Let me tell you what the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Border Patrol have to fly on our borders in order to interdict drugs. They fly old Vietnam-era helicopters. They aren't safe. In fact, many of them have been grounded. The Army, in fact, grounded almost all of its Hueys. But that is what we are left with. 
   DEA and INS have both requested aircraft in order to patrol the borders. Those requests were not funded by this administration. Yet the administration turns around and is willing to give 30 Blackhawk helicopters to Colombia. Who knows what will happen to those helicopters. Who knows how they will be used. But I can assure you that the first call, I believe, on new helicopters for the purposes of the drug war should have gone to the departments which fight the drug war in the United States and which need them. 
   Another example: Night vision goggles. We are going to send $2 million to Colombia to buy night vision goggles. Yet here in the United States, the Border Patrol and DEA are short on those materials. In fact, the Border Patrol is woefully short on night vision goggles, on pocket scopes, on fiber-optic scopes, on hand-held searchlights--all of these items the Border Patrol asked for and were not funded in this budget by the President. 
   Yet the President has been willing to find the money, or suggested that we should find the money, to send not only night vision goggles but ground-based radar systems, secure communications systems, signal intelligence gathering systems, computers, and installation of sensor sights for aircraft. All of these items they have suggested we send to Colombia. 
   In addition, they have suggested that we actually construct facilities for Colombia to the tune of approximately $49 million--physical buildings. 
   Let me tell you, both the INS and the DEA need physical facilities. In fact, the Border Patrol is functioning out of extraordinarily crowded facilities. Many of the Border Patrol stations are grossly overcrowded. There is one site which is designed for 5 people with 125 people working out of it. There is another site where the Border Patrol is working out of an old Tastee Freeze building. I guess you can use an old Tastee Freeze building. It is sort of hard to handcuff a drug dealer to a Tastee Freeze machine. 
   The fact is we do not have the facilities which we need in order to adequately enforce our laws relative to drug dealers coming across the borders and drugs coming across the borders. We don't have the facilities to detain those people. 
   There is a detention need of approximately $406 million. In other words, we need $406 million of construction in order to meet the potential detention needs for people illegally coming across the border, many of them drug dealers. 
   The judiciary has the same problem. There is a massive increase in the amount of caseload which the judiciary along the southern border has to handle. Five district courts on the southwest border now handle 26 percent of all the Federal criminal activity--26 percent of all the Federal criminal activity--and a great deal of that is drug related. 
   To put that in perspective, the remainder of the criminal activity in this country is handled by 89 other district courts. Five are handling 26 percent and 89 handle the rest. You can see how overworked those five courts are. 
   The border courts' basic caseload is four times that of the national average. Yet did the administration put money in to try to increase the capacity of those court systems to handle this wave of crime that is coming across the border, much of it drug-related? Absolutely not. There are no physical facilities in that area. 
   I put up another chart which is a little more stark 
   explanation of some specific accounts. 
   For example, the aircraft needs along the southwest border, this is what was unfunded. This bar chart shows the unfunded needs for aircraft along our southwest border. This shows how much the administration is willing to spend for aircraft for Colombia. They are willing to spend three times what it would take in order to adequately monitor our own border with aircraft. They are willing to spend it in Colombia. 
   I have to say that I really doubt that aircraft in Colombia is going to end up doing the job. I do not know how it is going to be used. But I strongly suspect it is not going to be used very effectively if we look at the history of what has happened with our efforts outside this country in the area of crime enforcement. I suspect what we will end up with is some company in America making a heck of a lot of money because somebody will buy 30 Blackhawk helicopters and ship them to Colombia. That will be the end of it. That will be the last we hear of them. 
   But if the administration is willing to pay for the aircraft along the border, the use of those aircraft would be accountable to the American people. We would know whether those aircraft were being used correctly in law enforcement and drug enforcement. I can assure you that my experience with the Border Patrol and the DEA is they would be used correctly, and we would get a return for the dollars that are being spent. 
   It is not only in the capital areas that this administration has acted, in my opinion, with gross irresponsibility in their obligations to fight the drug war here in the United States, by funding the Colombian request but not  funding the American needs, but more importantly, in the area of personnel and initiatives, it is really unbelievable. This administration is willing to spend $1.6 billion in Colombia, but they spent absolutely nothing in their budget on the methamphetamine initiative of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Nothing. The methamphetamine initiatives of DEA have been some of the most successful initiatives they have undertaken. 
   Talk to people in Colorado, Missouri, Minnesota, and all along the southwest border. They will tell you methamphetamine is the drug that is growing most rampantly. It is growing at the most dramatic rate. Its production is growing at the most dramatic rate. 
   Two years ago, the Congress set up 10 initiatives in the area of methamphetamine. They have been successful. Yet this administration has zeroed out for all intents and purposes any new initiative in methamphetamine, even though the DEA specifically requested of OMB--part of the administration--and said they needed 10 more initiatives in the area of methamphetamine. I think it was 10. But that was zeroed out by the White House while at the same time they are willing to spend $1.6 billion to buy planes for Colombia. It makes no sense. 
   We know that 85 percent of the methamphetamine that is being sold in Minnesota is smuggled in from Mexico. We know that. We know, if we are going to stop that smuggling, that we are going to have to have a border enforcement capability that can identify it, track it, arrest it, and then prosecute it. But you can't do that if you are going to underfund the DEA, the INS, and the judiciary to such dramatic levels. But the White House has done exactly that. But who have they been willing to fund for initiatives in Colombia? That is not the only instance. 
   The Border Patrol was supposed to receive an increase of 1,000 people a year for 3 years. That is what the Congress asked this administration to do. That is what we actually funded--1,000 people for 3 years. This administration has refused to fill those slots. The administration has basically refused to fulfill its obligation to fill those slots. So the Border Patrol goes undermanned and in many instances underpaid. As I have already pointed out, the facilities and equipment it has are woefully inadequate. 
   The Border Patrol, obviously, does things other than just drug enforcement, but because the Mexican border is the primary vehicle and the Mexican cartels are the primary force behind the drug flow into the United States, the Border Patrol is constantly being drawn into the drug fight. Therefore, adequately funding the Border Patrol is critical to having an adequate drug enforcement policy in this country. 
   My point is simple and obvious. Before we send $1.6 billion to Colombia, before we send this money down there so they can have more planes, goggles, and radar sensors, how about funding the American needs in the area of drug enforcement? How about funding our own law enforcement community and our Judiciary so we can act adequately, interdict and fight drugs in the United States. 
   I believe this administration's priorities are skewed. I think this Congress has an obligation to take a hard look at the Colombian drug proposal when it comes here. In my opinion, we should reallocate significant amounts of those funds so we can appropriately fund and support DEA, INS, and the Judiciary. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

    Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator KOHL to introduce the New Economy Tax Simplification Act or NETSA. Electronic commerce is reshaping our society. In many ways, the strong economic conditions we currently enjoy are a result of the convenience, lower costs, and global connections provided by the internet. The question for us as a nation is how to manage this new enterprise so that it continues to benefit our nation's economy, particularly in regard to the taxation of e-commerce. 
   So far, the government's hands-off approach is working. Our nation's unemployment and inflation rates are at record lows and higher paying jobs are being created at a tremendous rate. Many financial experts attribute the record low inflation rates to the Internet. A University of Texas study found that the Internet economy grew an astounding 68% rate in the past 12 months. 
   Another sign of the good times is the surplus revenue flowing into federal and state treasuries all over the nation. The federal government's budget is balanced for the first time in a generation and the 50 states ended 1998 with a collective surplus of $11 billion. States are seeing revenue increases of more than 5 percent a year through the 1990's. This hardly seems like a compelling rationale for levying taxes on the Internet. Yet a heated debate is raging between those who want to keep the internet free of taxes and state and local governments who seek to impose widespread taxes on internet sales. 
   The Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce (ACEC), set up by Congress last year to develop recommendations on Internet taxes, recently concluded its final meeting but failed to reach the required supermajority to make any formal recommendations. Notably, it did agree by a simple majority vote to extend the current moratorium on Internet taxes for five years. 
   The Commission is set to deliver it's report to Congress tomorrow. It will recommend that we extend the internet tax moratorium for another five years and I fully support this. The Commission will also ask Congress to establish nexus safeguards--to make clear when a State or municipality has the power to levy taxes. Our legislation establishes these important nexus safeguards. 
   Currently, online sales are governed by the very same tax rules that govern mail order sales. The existing rules of the road are based upon two prior Supreme Court decisions--National Bellas Hess case in 1967, and the Quill case in 1992. Both decisions established the power of state tax authority to be limited by nexus--or the scope of a company's connection to the taxing state. 
   Local sales taxes are incredibly complex. There are 7,600 different tax jurisdictions across the country--within these systems about 600-700 rate changes occur per year. There are 46 different sets of rules (45 states and the District of Columbia have state sales tax). If forced to comply with these rules, companies would be filing 425 tax returns each month or 5,100 a year. 
   The Gregg/Kohl bill, the New Economy Tax Simplification Act (NETSA), codifies these mail order tax rules as outlined in the Quill decision, updating this decision for the 21st century. 
   Sales/use tax nexus rules are court-based, and income tax nexus rules are based upon a 1950s federal statute that applies only to tangible goods. The Gregg/Kohl plan would codify nexus standards across the board. This legislation would update and strengthen the nexus standards for the 21st Century economy--ensuring that intangible sales, web pages and servers do not cause nexus. It maintains current constitutional principles and keeps state powers within their jurisdictions, and does not try to pre-empt a state's tax authority within its own borders.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico. I congratulate him on putting together this budget resolution, which was a very difficult task in the present climate. It is ironic; when we are running surpluses, it is almost more difficult to put together a budget than when we are running deficits. But through the adept and able leadership of the Senator from New Mexico, this budget has come forward. It is an excellent effort to address the issues which are critical to our country, especially the issue of protecting Social Security, as he does in this budget, so no Social Security funds are spent for anything other than Social Security, and the effort to protect some of the on-budget surplus so it will be available for debt reduction but also for reducing taxes for hard-working Americans who pay that extra money in that is no longer needed by the Government. 
   The effort we are talking about today is in a number of categorical areas, but specifically today we are mentioning the area of education. I wanted to speak to the Bingaman amendment and some of the comments that were made, especially by the Senator from Massachusetts, first to their inaccuracy and second their inconsistency as to how we address quality education in this country. In fact, I can speak to the remarks of both Senators from Massachusetts who have spoken on this topic because I tend to disagree rather pointedly with both of them. 
   Let me begin with Senator BINGAMAN's amendment. He held up a chart. It has been referred to by a number of Senators on the other side. The chart showed how much of an increase the Democratic leadership proposed in spending, and then they showed the Republican budget on the same account, same chart. They showed our budget being about $5 billion below what they were. What they failed to put up on the chart--which I found ironic and sort of misleading, relative to the way the debate was going--is the President's number. 
   What did the President ask for in education? What the President asked for in education, if they had put it on the chart, would look something like this: The President asked for the greenish-blue line here. I am not sure what color you would call that--aqua, I guess. The aqua line here, that represents the President's request in education. Our request, what we put in the budget for education, is the red line. In each of the years of the budget, the Republican budget exceeds what the President of the United States asked for in education. 
   This yellow insert here--which we had to jury-rig because we did not actually have the chart of the Senator from New Mexico--would be the Senate Democratic proposal. It is a dramatic increase over what the President requested and what we have put in our budget, which is an increase over what the President requested. 
   So there is a bit of inconsistency for the Members of the other side of the aisle to come to the floor and savage the Republicans in this House, and the Republican budget, on the issue of education and not mention the fact we exceeded the President's request. Why didn't they savage the President's budget, too? Why didn't the Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER--she said we did not care about kids--say the President didn't care about kids? Maybe she just forgot. The President's budget was actually less--less than 
   what we have put in our budget for education. 
   I think what we have is a classic attempt at grandstanding, trying to throw more money at an issue and trying to address a problem, not by addressing it substantively but simply by saying: We outspent you on that issue, so you don't do as well as we do on education. 
   Actually, we do very well on education. As I mentioned, we exceed the President's number in each year. It is not the dollars so much; it is the way we spend the dollars that I think is important to note. This is where I have disagreements with both Senators from Massachusetts who recently spoke on this matter, because there is a fundamental disagreement of philosophy on how we should address education. It is not a difference over money, really. As I said, our dollars exceed what the President requested for education. It is a difference of philosophy. 
   Stated very simply, there are two philosophical differences. The first is that on the Republican side of the aisle, we think when the Federal Government says to the local school districts, you must spend a certain amount of money on education and we, the Federal Government, will help you by paying a percentage of the cost of that spending, when the Federal Government puts that type of mandate on local school districts, the Federal Government ought to live up to its obligation. It ought to pay the money it says it is going to pay. Before it starts new educational programs, it ought to pay for the ones it already requires from the States. 
   What am I talking about here? Special education, IDEA. It has been alluded to by the other side of the aisle. It is almost a throwaway line there, at least from the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. KERRY: Oh, sure, the Republicans will talk about IDEA, but we have done more about education; we don't have to worry about IDEA. 
   IDEA is probably the most significant area you could find where the  Federal Government has failed to fulfill its obligations to the school districts of this country. It is the largest unfunded mandate which the Federal Government puts on the States and the school districts, and which therefore causes the States and school districts to have to pay for the Federal share and, as a result, take local resources and reallocate them to pay the Federal obligation and, as a result, skew the local budgets. 
   Local school districts, which would probably want to have better language courses, better computers, maybe more teachers, better trained teachers, smaller classes, can't do any of these things, in many instances, because they are having to take a large amount of their local dollars to pay for the Federal share of special education. 
   On this side of the aisle, we have said that is wrong. We have said it is wrong now for 4 years. Every one of the President's budgets that has come up here over the last 4 years has had virtually no increase in special education funding, even though the Federal Government, when we arrived as a Republican Senate, was only paying 6 percent of the costs of special ed funding in this country when it originally said it was going to pay 40 percent of the costs. Even though the Federal Government was paying such a minimal part of the cost of special education, this administration has never sent us a budget that has 
   significantly increased special education dollars. 
   They have always taken the attitude, and it has been supported by the other side of the aisle: What the heck, let the local school districts pick up the Federal share. We are going to start a new categorical program that says to the local school districts you must, in order to get the Federal dollars, start this new program, too, rather than funding the special ed dollars which were originally owed. 
   The practical effect of that, as I have said, is to skew the local budgets, and too many local school districts have been unable to do things they might have wanted to do because they have had to cover the Federal share of special education dollars. 
   So what did we as a Republican Senate do? We changed that paradigm. In the last 4 years, we have more than doubled the funding for special education. We have gone from 6 percent up to almost 13 percent of the special ed dollars. In this budget, we increase it significantly again. It is our No. 1 priority. Yes, it is our No. 1 priority as a Congress, as a Republican Congress: Fund special education because that is our obligation. We said we would do that back in 1976, when Public Law 94-142 was passed. 
   So it is not a throwaway line for us. It is something we should do. Yes, that is where some of our dollars are flowing. When we exceed the President's budget in education spending, which we do, some of that excess spending in education goes into special ed, a significant amount more than what the President requested. He requested virtually none, no increase. 
   So that is the first fundamental difference. We believe the special ed student deserves to get the funds, the funding support to which the Federal Government originally committed.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, why do we believe that? We believe it, first, because it is an unfunded mandate, but more important, because in our school districts across this country, that special-needs child and his or her parents are being put in the impossible position of going into school meeting after school meeting and being told that resources are being used to pay for their child that should be used to pay for other children in the school district. 
   As a result, the special-needs children and their parents are being put in an untenable position. They did nothing wrong. The people who did things wrong were the President and this administration for failing to fund special ed. 
   We are saying let's give the special-needs children in this country a little relief, and let's fund special ed.

   Mr. GREGG. Ironically, in Massachusetts, from where the Senator who was just speaking comes, 30 percent of their students are coded as special needs. If one looks at it across the country, most special-needs children, regrettably, do come from lower income school districts. They tend to have a higher percentage of kids in special needs.

   Mr. GREGG. The second philosophical difference we have with the other side of the aisle is, again, highlighted by the discussion of the Senator from Massachusetts who said essentially there are a lot of States that do not know what they are doing in the area of education and we, the Federal Government, do know what we are doing; therefore, the programs from the Federal Government should be categorical so that States live up to their obligations to do what we in the Federal Government tell them they should do in education. 
   It is essentially the attitude of ``we know best'' in Washington how to run the school districts across this country; that the people who run the school districts--the local school boards that are usually elected, the local legislatures that are always elected, and the Governors of States who are elected--that these individuals, for whom education is usually their No. 1 priority because it is their No. 1 spending issue, as compared with the Federal Government which has other priorities like national defense, Medicare and Social Security, these individuals who are almost all elected are not capable of doing their job. 
   That is essentially the attitude taken on the other side of the aisle when they say we in the Federal Government know best 
   how to run education and States do not know what they are doing in education; therefore, our programs must be categorical. They must tell the States exactly what they must do with dollars coming to them from Washington. 
   It is a little bit of a disconnect, of course, because the dollars coming from Washington did not start in Washington. They started in the States. They came to Washington. Then we took 15 to 20 percent off the top and sent it back to the States. Maybe they got 80 percent back, but certainly not 100 percent. In any event, it is not our money in Washington. 
   As a practical matter, we do not know more about running a school than the local school districts. I, for example, do not contend I know more about the Epping School District than the people in Epping or the people on the school board in Epping. When they look at their elementary school, they know whether they need another teacher or another classroom, whether they need computers or whether they happen to need a new baseball field or language course. I do not know that. It is not my purpose to tell them how to run their school district. So our philosophy of education on this side is a little different. 
   They say it is a block grant; just send the money. No, that is not it at all. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which we passed in the HELP Committee a couple of weeks ago, will be before the Senate in a few weeks. That bill has a brandnew approach to education. The theme is not that we are going to send the money back in a great big huge block grant and the States can do whatever they want. It is not we are going to send it back with a targeted proposal and tell people what they must do with it. It is a different approach. 
   The theme is, first, that funds should be spent for purposes of the child. The child is the center of our attention.  
   Second, we will look for achievement on the part of the child to be sure they are actually learning. 
   Third, there is flexibility. 
   And fourth, there is accountability. 
   We have reoriented these programs so that we send the money back, yes. For example, in our Teacher Empowerment Act, we send the money back in a rather large lump sum. We take the Eisenhower grants and the class size money and put it together. Then we say: You can use this money, local school districts. You do not have to hire a new teacher if you do not need a new teacher. You can use it to hire new teachers if you want to reduce class size. You can use it to improve the ability of your teachers to teach. You can use it to give teachers more support. You can even use it to pay teachers. They cannot keep the really good teachers in the classrooms because they are being hired by the private sector. This is especially true of our science and math teachers who are leaving because the opportunities are so lucrative outside education. 
   You can pay teachers more to keep them by using bonus payments. You can use it for any of those things, but you have to produce results. We are not going to tell you how to produce results. We are not going to tell you that you must have 17 kids to every teacher. We are not going to tell you that you must have a computer in every classroom. We are not going to tell you that you must have a classroom that is 6 feet by 25 feet or 12 feet by 13 feet. We are not going to tell you how many books you must have in your library. 
   No, we say: You can get the money and use it for these 
   defined areas, and you have flexibility to use it in those areas, but you have to show us that the academic achievement of the low-income child--because that is where ESEA is basically aimed in the title I funds--is improving in relation to the other kids in the school. You have to have tests--not designed by the Federal Government; we are not out to design tests because that means we end up designing curriculum--tests that are designed by the local school districts and the States. Those tests have to ascertain annually whether or not the children in the low-income categories are improving academically. 
   What a radical idea--we expect kids to learn. We are not going to tell schools how to teach. We are not going to tell schools the ratio of their classes. We are not going to tell schools the size of their classes. What we say is take this money and show us that kids are learning something and that they are improving in their academic achievement. 
   That is a very radical idea. It is the idea we are pushing forward as an approach to education. It is not a block grant. It is not: Here is all the money and you can do whatever you want with it. It is: Here are the dollars, but we are not smart enough to tell you, the local school district, how to improve your children's education and what you need because we cannot look into every classroom and guide every classroom, even though they would like to do that on the other side of the aisle. 
   On the other side of the aisle, they want to have a string running from every desk out to every classroom in America; 30,000 strings running off the desks, and pull a string here and there so every classroom in America has to fall into exactly what we outline in Congress. 
   That is not the approach we suggest. 
   The approach we suggest is, take the money and use it in a variety of different areas; have flexibility, but then show us, prove to us, that achievement is improving amongst those children who are targeted with the dollars. That is our approach to education. That is what is funded in this bill. 
   Let me remind you, one more time, what the Bingaman amendment fails to mention: Our funding in this bill exceeds the President's funding in his budget. Therefore, our proposals in this bill make a lot of sense. They address the IDEA issue; they address special ed; they address the need to fund children in schools at a level that is appropriate and actually exceeds the President's level, and, more importantly than that, they expect the kids to achieve. As a result of achieving, we are going to get a much better return for the dollars we spend.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, and I thank Senator SANTORUM for his leadership in drafting it. 
   My colleagues in the Senate may recall that last week, I prepared an amendment to the earnings limit legislation that would have achieved many of the same objectives that are outlined by the Senator from Pennsylvania with respect to this bill. I believe that we have begun a process, an important dialogue involving many interested parties in both the executive and legislative branches, and that the result of this process will ultimately be improved information for the public and for Congress regarding the state of the Social Security program, and the benefits that it can finance. 
   I am pleased by the number of important individuals who have expressed interest in this effort. I am especially gratified by the interest of Senator ROTH and of Congressman ARCHER, the two members of Congress with principal jurisdiction over the Social Security program. They have each indicated that they are willing to explore these informational issues via various means, and to lend their considerable influence to the effort. 
   I am further pleased that various individuals within the administration have sought to work with us on our concerns, and to lay a groundwork for improved reporting to the public regarding the Social Security program. 
   In that context, I would stress that we are not at the end of this process, and that we do not have universal agreement on the best way to proceed. I do not believe that either Senator SANTORUM or I would say that the language in either this bill, or the one that I offered last week, is perfect, and cannot be improved upon. Senator SANTORUM's draft, like my original draft, would seek to include additional information in the annual Trustees' Reports. I do not know whether the Trustees' reports are necessarily the optimal place to report such information, and to the extent that individuals within the administration may have views as to how and where this information is best presented, I know that Senator SANTORUM and I would both be flexible as to how this is done. The important thing is that this information is routinely presented to Congress and to the public in a clear, understandable, helpful way, and the best time and format for this is certainly a matter where reasonable people can disagree. 
   I do, however, want to review the elements of Senator SANTORUM's legislation, and to express why I believe that they are so important. 
   First, it would add important new information to the Personal Earnings and Benefit Statements that individuals are now receiving from the Social Security Administration. Those statements currently tell individuals how much they are promised in terms of benefits, and about their earnings history. Taken literally, however, they could provide a misleading picture as to what current law can actually finance. It is a misnomer to say that ``current law'' would provide a certain amount of benefits, when legally, the Social Security Administration does not have the authority to send out checks without financing. What ``current law'' would literally mandate, according to GAO, according to CRS, and according to everyone else who has studied this closely, is that benefits would be effectively cut sharply beginning in 2037 because benefit checks would have to wait until the available funds came in to finance them. 
   Mr. President, it is unlikely that Congress would permit such a sharp and sudden set of benefit cuts to occur. Of course, neither we nor a future Congress would permit that. But it is also untrue to tell Americans that ``current law'' would provide them with all promised benefits. 
   That is manifestly untrue by any definition. It is neither a true statement of current law, nor it is a true statement of how tax levels and benefit levels would look after necessary adjustments are made to the program to bring it into balance. Social Security beneficiaries certainly have a right to be told the truth about their benefits--the date through which they can currently be funded, the extent to which benefits could be provided under current estimates, as well as the additional revenues that must be collected through tax dollars, when the program first begins to experience cash flow deficits. 
   Currently, there is a great misperception regarding Social Security financing that too many individuals are willing to tacitly encourage--the idea that the existence of a positive Social Security Trust Fund balance enhances the ability of the federal government to pay Social Security benefits. It does not. The Social Security Trust Fund balance is actually a debt owed by the federal government, and it does not in any way finance benefits without requiring that the federal government turn to taxpayers to pay off that debt. Americans deserve to be told the truth about that, and Senator SANTORUM's language includes a statement that would explain the meaning of the Trust Fund, and the options before Congress when the program enters a phase of cash-flow deficits. 
   Many of the paragraphs in the Santorum language, regarding increased clarity in the annual Trustees' report, are somewhat similar to language that I sought to pursue last week. Again, I would simply reiterate that reasonable people can disagree as to the proper venue for the reporting of this information. I personally am of the view that the annual Trustees' Reports should provide to Congress the relevant information that Congress, as the body that must budget for the Social Security program, needs to budget for it in the appropriate way. Congress has a right to insist, in my view, not on how these evaluations should be made, but that all relevant information be presented clearly to the Congress when they are made. However, the most important thing is that we reach an agreement among interested parties with common goals as to how best to do this. 
   Currently, we receive 75-year actuarial estimates from the Trustees regarding the health of the Social Security Trust Fund. We only look at its impact on the overall federal budget over 10 years, through measurements by CBO and other bodies. We don't look out over the long term to judge the larger fiscal problems facing this long-term program and the unified federal budget. That is a problem. It tempts Congress and the Executive Branch to pursue ``solutions'' to Social Security's insolvency that improve the part of the picture that we see--the Trust Fund balance--heedless of the consequences for the part of the picture that we do not see--the impact on the unified federal budget. This is not an adequate method of approaching the problem of financing benefits over the long term. I believe that Congress should insist that portraits of the program's finances evaluate all scenarios on an absolutely level playing field, one that shows all costs borne by the system,  and one that judges all possible solutions in terms of what they would actually cost and what they could actually pay. I commend Senator SANTORUM for his effort here, even as my mind is open on the best way to achieve this objective. 
   Mr. President, I would simply close by saying that the Social Security program is too important to allow to operate in a fog of incomprehension and misunderstanding. There ought not to be resistance to efforts to bring additional ``sunshine'' upon the operations of the Social Security system as a whole. We currently operate, too often, in an atmosphere of selective information--one that measures only benefit promises, and current tax levels, without acknowledging the mismatch between the two, and what they mean for one another. A view that looks only at the Trust Fund balance, and not at the realities of the system's cost to future payers of both income and payroll taxes. This selective presentation of information encourages Congress to remain inactive, because it allows us to pretend that the consequences of current law are not actually worse than the choices that would be made in the course of reforming the program. 
   We can do better than this, and we must, if we are to meet our responsibilities of stewardship for the Social Security program. I commend Senator SANTORUM for his effort.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, back in February of 1993, as we all remember so vividly, the World Trade Center in New York City was bombed. Over 1,000 people were wounded and 6 people were killed. Two years later, the Federal building in Oklahoma was bombed; 168 people died, including many children. 
   These two very tragic events highlight the potential threat this country is subjected to and, in fact, has been subjected to in the area of terrorism. The threat of terrorism was further reinforced with the events in Africa where two of our embassies were bombed 3 years ago. 
   The Commerce, State, Justice, Appropriations Subcommittee, which I chair, directed the Attorney General to develop a plan to address terrorism which would be a Governmentwide plan, an interagency counterterrorism plan. The Attorney General, in a very conscientious effort, put together a 5-year interagency counterterrorism and technology crime plan. It was an excellent proposal. This proposal was put together by the Attorney General 3 years ago. It basically became known as the bible--for lack of a better or more descriptive word--as to how we should proceed in the area of developing a Governmentwide strategy in order to address terrorism, something we hadn't done up until that point. 
   It wasn't just to focus on Federal Government agencies but, rather, it went beyond that and talked about how we needed to integrate the private sector and State and local governments in our efforts to address terrorism. It had a large number of functions within it, a large number of areas that had to be addressed, as was obvious to those of us who took even a cursory look at the issue of terrorism. 
   Unfortunately, we, as a culture, were not ready to address terrorist acts because we are an open culture. The essence of our culture is freedom, the ability of people to move freely among our society. It is very difficult for us to deal with people who are willing to kill indiscriminately simply to make their points of view known. It requires a lot of thought and effort for us as a nation to address a problem such as terrorism. That is why we asked for this 5-year plan to be developed. 
   As part of this 5-year plan, one of the key things we believed we needed to address was the fact that there really wasn't anyplace where all of the issues of terrorism were being brought together. There were something like 43 different agencies addressing some element of the terrorist threat. This was not counting the issues of State and local government involvement and the issue of the private sector. For instance, how would the private sector address a terrorist threat to our power grid and our telecommunications systems. 
   One of the first things deemed necessary to do was to develop a centralized place where people could go, whether they happened to be in the Federal Government, State and local government, or whether they happened to be in the private sector, a centralized place where people could go and find out how to approach the issue of preparing our Nation to be able to handle the terrorist threat. An office was designated to be created called the National Domestic Preparedness Office, or the NDPO. 
   The NDPO was essentially to be a one-stop shopping center on the issue of how we address the threat of terrorism as a nation, a very important activity. It was to include participation by DOD, the Department of Defense, by FEMA, by HHS, Health and Human Services, by the Department of Energy, by the Environmental Protection Agency, by the Attorney General, and by the FBI. State and local authorities were to be included for participation in this office. It was to be a central agency which had all the players needed to be at the table--up and functioning and continually available as a resource to address the threat of terrorism. 
   Unfortunately, this administration has treated the issue of terrorism as a stepchild. When there is a terrorist event, they 
   react. In some instances, they react arbitrarily and ineffectively, as they did in reaction to the African situation where they essentially ended up targeting a facility in Sudan. It is still very much an issue, as to whether the facility was actually producing any chemical weapons. Also, they attacked a facility in Afghanistan. Rather than assisting our ability of tracking down the terrorist Bin Laden, it made it obvious to him that he could never again have a joint meeting of his terrorist forces. Thus, he scattered them to the wind and we have had much more trouble tracking them down. 
   The response of this administration has been a PR response, to be quite honest, on the issue of terrorism at many levels. When it comes to actually substantively addressing the issue of terrorism, this administration's response from the top has been woeful. 
   I will acknowledge, in fact I will cite and congratulate, that at the agency level there is an ongoing, aggressive, and very positive effort to address terrorism. But, for some reason, there is an unwillingness in the White House to genuinely focus on this issue in a way that produces results. 
   One of the most glaring examples of that unwillingness to focus is the fact that the NDPO--the office which was supposed to be the one-stop shopping center for people who wanted to get ready to address a terrorist event--hasn't really been allowed to wither on the vine because they never even planted the seeds to get the vine growing. The office has not been funded. In fact, the travel funds which were supposed to be applied to it have been cut off. The office has been unable to get reprogramming through OMB, even though the Attorney General has requested on a number of occasions to get reprogramming through OMB to allow the office to function effectively.  
   The FBI Director has not been able to get reprogramming through OMB that has allowed the office to function effectively. The State and local advisory groups which were supposed to be set up to bring the first responders--the local police, local fire, local health officials who have the knowledge and the expertise to do the job right and do it in a coordinated way with the Federal Government--in to advise the NDPO has not been energized in any effective way. We do not get the standardization on equipment we need. We are not getting the leadership from the top that we need in the area of making the States and local people as knowledgeable as we can. 
   I will say this: At least in the other areas where we are trying to educate first responders, such as our initiatives across this country in education, we are making progress. But the central management agency has been ignored. 
   We understand the reprogramming that the NDPO needs in order to fund its activities effectively for this year will not be adequately fulfilled. So this agency has been allowed to simply sit there and has not been energized. In fact, as I understand it, the person named director of the NDPO has recently, within the last week, asked to be transferred out of the job. I do not know why he asked for that, but I certainly can guess. I suspect it is because of the frustration of doing a job where he was not getting the support he needed from the White House and from this administration to do it effectively. 
   Terrorism is not a political event. It should not be used for the purpose of initiating press conferences or trying to drive poll numbers. This is an extraordinarily serious issue. We as a nation need to have a Government that doesn't approach this issue in a manner which involves something less than a total commitment. Yet that is the way it is being approached by this administration and its failure to fund, organize, and energize the National Domestic Preparedness Office. 
   This same problem was highlighted in a news story in the Wall Street Journal relative to another issue of terrorism. It was again requested by the subcommittee I Chair in this Congress that there be exercises--much like our military undertakes--to determine our readiness to deal with a terrorist event. During the cold war days, if you were in the Strategic Air Command, every 6 months you knew, if you were on a Strategic Air Command air base, at some point during that 6 months you were going to have a full-scale alert, and you were going to have to act as if you were in a confrontation with the Soviet Union. 
   That was the way we kept our forces current and that is how we found out the problems in our systems. It is the way it is still done in the military. You have what amounts to war games in order to determine whether or not you are ready to participate in a real, live event. Well, terrorism is war. It is war on our Nation, and we know there are people out there who intend to exercise their ability to wage war on America. They have already done it. We need to go through the exercises of determining whether or not the agencies that are going to be responsible to protect the American people are ready to respond in the case of a terrorist event. 
   So we asked the administration, to pursue exercises to determine whether or not we are ready--mock exercises. These were to take place in three different communities across our country. Now, in a recent report in the Wall Street Journal, it was stated that some of the top agencies that are involved in this exercise are basically taking a laissez-fair attitude toward the exercise and are basically saying that they may participate but participate at a very low level of operations, or they are going to participate with very low level personnel--not that they won't be good personnel, but they won't be the personnel who have the final responsibility in the event of a real terrorist event or attack on our country. That would be unfortunate. 
   The Attorney General, I understand, not directly but indirectly, believes she is getting commitments from the various agencies to fulfill their role of having senior personnel at DOD, DOE, HHS, EPA, FEMA, and State, and obviously the Attorney General and the FBI--senior personnel--involved in these exercises, so that we know when we have a problem, the people who can resolve them are physically there on site and can observe the problem and can participate in resolving and developing a response to the problem. 
   Now, the Attorney General tells me, indirectly through my staff, that the news story may not have been completely accurate. But the news story quoted some sources and said certain agencies within the administration were not going to be seriously committed to this exercise. That, again, in my opinion, shows the laissez-fair attitude this administration has taken toward preparing this Nation to address a terrorist event. 
   As I said earlier, terrorism is not a partisan issue, not a political issue; it is a serious threat to our country. It has to be addressed aggressively and professionally by the agencies that are responsible. The Congress can only do so much. We have funded aggressively antiterrorism efforts. We have set up structures, working with the agencies to try to make sure that we have a coordinated response. We have requested that the agencies involved participate in trying to make sure that they are as ready as possible for a horrific event. But all we can do is fund and request. If we don't get cooperation and enthusiasm and commitment from this administration, then we will not have success. 
   So I have come to the floor today to highlight what I am very concerned about and what I think we should all be concerned about, which is whether or not there is a sincerity of effort occurring within this administration to get us ready to address a potential terrorism threat to the United States. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Delaware allowing me to proceed out of order. I very much appreciate that generosity on his part. I also appreciate his courtesy as we develop this piece of legislation and congratulate the Senator for bringing it to the floor. 
   Repealing the earnings limitation is a very important step to assist people who have reached eligibility age for retirement to have a better lifestyle. It allows them to work harder, work longer, work at their option versus at the Government's option, and keep the proceeds of what they earn versus losing it because of this artificial reduction in their benefits, which is presently the law under the earnings limitation test. 
   It is a very appropriate piece of legislation. It is one which I fully congratulate the chairman of the Finance Committee for authoring and bringing forward, and it is something which I have strongly supported for many years. In fact, yesterday I spoke at some length relative to a bill that has been introduced by myself and a number of other Members of the Senate, including members of the Finance Committee, Senator KERREY, Senator BREAUX, Senator GRASSLEY, Senator THOMPSON, and Senator ROBB, along with Senator THOMAS. That piece of legislation is a comprehensive attempt to reform Social Security, to make it solvent for the next 100 years. As part of that comprehensive reform, we included the earnings limitation repeal, which is very appropriate legislation. 
   However, I do think if it were being done in a perfect world it would be done in a comprehensive reform of the entire Social Security system because we well know Social Security is facing disastrous consequences beginning in the year 2008 when the baby boom generation retires, followed closely by the year 2014 when the system actually starts to run a cash deficit and is aggravated to the point of crisis by the period 2020 to 2040 when we actually run up an absolutely massive deficit which will have to be passed on to the younger generation through tax increases or through a cut to the benefits of the older generation, but it would be a deficit in the vicinity of $7 trillion under the present benefit structure. 
   We need to address that. We need to address the whole issue of Social Security reform, in my opinion. That is why  I have worked with Members of the Senate to draft this comprehensive bill. 
   As I said, one element of the comprehensive bill is the repeal of the earnings limitation. That is a very appropriate step and one which should have been taken many years ago, that will be very beneficial for our Nation as our population and the demographics of our population ages so people, as they become older but are still living longer, will have the opportunity to participate in the workforce, be productive citizens without being penalized by the Government and having some of their benefits taken away under Social Security. 
   As part of the earnings limitation repeal, I wanted to introduce an amendment to address some of the issues of transparency, of disclosure, of telling people in America in plain English what the Social Security system's present economic status is and what it is going to be in the future. The proposal I was going to offer was basically a mirror of the proposal which came out of the professional group which oversees reviewing the Social Security Administration, the Technical Panel on Assumptions and Methods of the Social Security Advisory Board, a board put together as an arm of the Social Security Administration to come up with ideas for how to improve the Social Security Administration. 
   They came up in November of 1999 with a whole series of proposals as to information that should be made available to the American public. It was not complicated information, and in fact they stressed it should be put forward in plain English terms so Americans everywhere could understand the status of the Social Security system. 
   But it was important information, such as: 
   What will the program cost each year? We should know that as an American people. 
   What is the projected cash-flow deficit in the program? That is another very important fact we should know in deciding how we are going to deal with Social Security. 
   What are the benefits the system can actually fund? I cannot think of any information that would be more important than that. 
   What is the impact of all of this on the overall Federal budget? That is another very important point of information. 
   All this information should be made available to the American public. That is why the Technical Panel on Assumptions and Methods of the Social Security Advisory Board recommended this type of disclosure occur. So my amendment was going to make as part of the law a commitment we would make those disclosures to the American people through the auspices of the Social Security Administration. It is basic information, critical information for people making informed decisions. 
   Regretfully, I tell the American people that we have a very big problem coming. Maybe there was some resistance because if that type of information were available, people would start scratching their heads, saying, ``Gee, we do have a big problem; maybe we should address it.'' That is the goal I have, obviously--to use this information to energize action and move this Congress, and especially the White House, down the road of substantively addressing the whole Social Security issue rather than this narrow question of the earnings limitation question. 
   However, having stated the outline of the amendment and having gone into much more depth yesterday, I have been working with the chairman, and he has agreed, to try to work this type of language into some other process where it will not complicate his life on this bill but where it will still be language which will at some point become law and which will effectively address the issues raised by the Social Security Advisory Board so we can get full disclosure to the American people. 
   I very much appreciate the chairman's commitment to work with me on this. As a result, I have decided not to offer this amendment. 
   I believe the chairman has requested I yield to him the time which would have been available under my amendment.

   Mr. GREGG. If the Senator from New York will yield, I appreciate those comments. I know the efforts which have been made by the Senator from New York, trying to make the Social Security system solvent. I greatly admire them. 
   I would say, this information would be in addition to the information that is already available. The Senator from New York makes the point, people are now told how much they should receive in benefits. What they are not told and what this information would tell them is, where are we going to get the money and what are the shortfalls in the Federal Government that will be created by paying those benefits, and isn't that what you should be worried about as a recipient: Where is the money going to come from?

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to speak today about the issue we are going to take up tomorrow, the Social Security earnings limitation, and the fact that we are going to pass a bill tomorrow which will eliminate a limitation on the ability of people once they retire to make money independent of Social Security benefits they receive and not have their Social Security benefits reduced. 
   Under present-day law, unfortunately, a retired individual--or not even retired person, a person who has reached eligibility age for Social Security benefits--the age for eligibility retirement is really the wrong term to apply to that individual. That person is penalized if he goes out and gets a job because his benefits under Social Security are reduced if he makes a certain amount of money under that job. 
   That is wrong. It is something I have tried to correct, and a number of Members of this Senate have tried to correct, for a number of years. 
   I have a bill, cosponsored by Senators KERREY, BREAUX, GRASSLEY, THOMPSON, ROBB, and THOMAS. It is a very bipartisan bill, obviously, and is strongly supported by many of the Members on the Finance Committee. That bill is, in substance, a reform bill for the entire Social Security system to allow us to have a Social Security system which is solvent for the next 100 years. It is a creative and imaginative piece of legislation, and it accomplishes that growth which is to create solvency in the Social Security system over the next 100 years and do it without raising taxes. 
   One of the elements of that bill is the repeal of the earnings limitation. It has been something I have supported and I have backed up with legislative language, cosponsored by myself, as I mentioned, and also by other Members of the Senate. Over the years, we have worked in this area. It is a very appropriate area to go into. However, tomorrow when we take up the bill for repealing the earnings limitation, we are going to take it up as sort of an isolated event. We are not taking it up very much as an isolated event but as part of a Social Security reform package. I guess that is where I have my concern, because we know the Social Security system, although solvent today and running very large surpluses, is headed towards the disastrous crash. 
   When the baby boom generation, the Bill Clinton generation, arrives at retirement, which starts in the year 2008 and accelerates aggressively so that by the year 2014 we actually are running a cash deficit within the Social Security system, we will have so many people retired in this country during the post-2008 period that we will have too many people retired for the younger generation to be able to support them effectively under the present structure of the Social Security system. 
   It will cost the next earnings generation--that generation who are my children, the children of the Members of this Senate, and their children's children--over $7 trillion in general fund revenues. We are not talking about Social Security taxes; we are talking about general fund revenues over the period from 2014 to 2034. It will cost $7 trillion of general fund revenues to keep the Social Security system solvent. 
   What does $7 trillion in general fund revenues mean? That means there will have to be tax increases of $7 trillion in order to pay for those benefits, or, alternatively, we will have to cut them. 
   Some of us have said let's not force this crisis on the next generation, let's not turn to our children and say, Here is the problem; we are going to give it to you. Many of us have said let's look at the problem today and try to solve it, let's try to put in place systems that will allow us to build up a process which will protect our children from having to face the catastrophe of having to support our generation in retirement at levels which they could not possibly afford to support and which would put an undue burden on the next generation in the area of tax increases. 
   We have put together substantive pieces of legislation. The one I mentioned, for example, the Gregg-Kerrey-Breaux-Grassley-Thompson-Thomas-Robb--Senator Roth is also on that--is one of the proposals. 
   There is another bill in the House called Kolbe-Stenholm, an aggressive piece of legislation. Senator MOYNIHAN has a piece of legislation. Senator GRAMM from Texas has a piece of legislation. The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Congressman ARCHER, and Congressman SHAW have proposals. Congressman KASICH and Congressman SMITH have proposals. 
   There are a lot of proposals out there. Many of them are very substantive and thoughtful. I would like to think ours is. Almost all of them will do a lot more than we are doing today trying to put in place and under control a system that will address the Social Security problem as it is facing us and as it is facing the next generation. 
   I see the pages down here. These folks are going to end up 
   paying a huge bill as a result of our inaction today in Congress. It is not fair and not right for us to put the next generation in this position. 
   As we take up the earnings limitation repeal tomorrow, it is necessary and appropriate. It is something we should do. But we should be much more aggressive on this issue. We should be addressing the fundamental problems that are facing us in the Social Security system, the most fundamental of which is that it is an unfunded liability. 
   Essentially, the Social Security system says we promise you, the baby boom generation, all of these benefits. But we don't do anything about getting the baby boom generation into a position where we can pay those Social Security benefits. Rather, we go on a pay-as-you-go basis. One dollar taken in today is paid out today, or spent on some other operation of government today. So when the baby boom generation retires, there are no dollars available for them to support their benefit structure. 
   We ought to address that. The best way to address it is to do something which will be called prefunding liability. That is probably a technical term which is sort of lost in its translation. It basically means giving people savings, assets, and gives people something they can physically own and possess, so that when they retire, they will have assets they can use to pay for their retirement benefits under the Social Security system. 
   In our proposal, this is called a personal savings account. Essentially, we reduce the payroll tax today. We say let's reduce the payroll tax today because it is running a surplus, take that money we save on payroll taxes and give it to all of the Social Security earners today, and allow those Social Security earners to save that money for themselves. So that by the time they retire, they will have a nest egg, a physical nest egg that is based in stocks, Treasury notes, and bonds, which will be available to them to spend on their retirement. It is called free-funding liability, so their actual assets are there when they retire. They actually physically own something they can use to benefit them in their retirement and to support the costs of their retirement structure in Social Security. 
   That is the essence of what we propose in our bill--to prefund the liability through personal savings accounts. It is an idea for which the time appears to be coming. 
   I notice Governor Bush is talking about this aggressively. Other people who are running for the Presidency are talking about this aggressively. Regrettably, this administration has not been willing to talk about this aggressively. This administration has walked away from the opportunity to fundamentally reform and improve Social Security so we can past on to our children a solvent system instead of passing on to them an insolvent system. 
   I and a number of Members on the other side of the aisle have great frustrations. I know Senator KERREY from Nebraska has on numerous occasions--and will tomorrow, I suspect, when he offers his amendment--expressed the frustration he feels and many of us feel about the fact we are unable to get White House leadership on this critical issue of moving forward Social Security reform so the next generation isn't passed a sour lemon but is given an opportunity to have a lifestyle that is equal to ours, or hopefully significantly better, and isn't instead passed a huge bill from our generation that they have to pay off in order to support our generation's retirement. 
   I believe  this administration refuses to take any aggressive action in this area for political reasons because they want to keep the issue alive for the next election cycle. 
   Clearly, there is bipartisan support in the Senate. As I mentioned, the Members of the Senate supporting the bill are Senator KERREY, Senator BREAUX, and Senator GRASSLEY--a bipartisan group. Their philosophies are significantly different. We could build a coalition in this Senate to pass substantial Social Security reform which would make the system solvent for the next 100 years without raising taxes on the next generation. 
   If we could get leadership and assistance from the White House, we could do that. Unfortunately, we have not gotten that. Instead, we are getting one little snippet of the Social Security issue, the earnings limitation test. It has been passed by the Senate, passed by the House, and the President says he will sign it if it is a clean bill. 
   What is the effect of taking up one little part of the whole puzzle? This happens to be a part of the puzzle that ends up costing more money to the system. In other words, when we repeal the earnings limitation, we end up actually putting the system in a less financially sound position than it is today. It is an appropriate thing to do because the earnings limitation is bad public policy. We should not be saying to senior citizens: You shouldn't go out and work; or, if you do work, we will reduce your Social Security benefit. 
   That is bad policy, especially bad policy when we have a potentially large soon-to-retire generation, the baby boom generation. When our generation retires, as a nation we are going to need to keep people working even though they may be retiring. We won't have enough workers in this country. That is going to be a demographic fact. 
   The earnings limitation is bad policy. It has a negative impact on Social Security long-term solvency. It aggravates the problem for the next generation by repealing it as a freestanding event. It should, rather, be repealed in the context of an overall reform effort. By doing that, we can adjust for the fact that this may negatively impact the financial situation of the Social Security system, while other things could positively impact it, and we can weigh them off. 
   But we are not going to do that. We are doing just Social Security limitations. If that is all we can do, that is what we should do. But we should be honest with the American people. We should tell them what the effect of it will be. More importantly, we should tell them the present status and the future status of the Social Security trust funds. We shouldn't continue this babble about how solvent the Social Security trust fund is. Although it is running a surplus today, it is as predictable as night follows day, as the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, it is an absolute known fact that beginning in the year 2008, as the large baby boom generation retires, we are going to see the system head toward massive insolvency if we don't have massive tax increases or major benefit cuts. 
   We ought to tell the American people so they know it is coming and they can plan. If the Congress isn't going to plan, if the White House isn't going to plan, at least give the American people the information they need to plan. 
   I hope to have this bill agreed to because I think it is reasonable. I am introducing a proposal which was essentially 
   the proposal put forward in November 1999 by the Technical Panel On Assumptions and Methods of the Social Security Advisory Board. It is a professional group, an independent bipartisan group set up by the Social Security trustees for the purpose of reviewing what should be done with the Social Security system. This Technical Panel on Assumptions and Methods of the Social Security Advisory Board put out a series of recommendations regarding information that should be available in plain English--they stress ``in plain English''--to the American people. I have suggested we amend this effort by putting in place that recommendation, have the panel's recommendations become a requirement of law, and thus they will be disclosed to the American people. 
   What will be disclosed? The following: 
   What the program will cost each year; 
   What is the projected cash-flow deficit in dollars, real and nominal; 
   What are the benefits the system can actually fund as opposed to what we tell the public; 
   What is the impact of all of the above on the Federal budget. 
   These are not complicated. These can be simply stated. But they are very important facts for the American people to know. 
   Some don't want the American people to have this information. They realize if people were actually informed about the significant financial crisis we are facing in the Social Security system beginning when the baby boom generation retires, people would get pretty upset. They would ask: Why hasn't Congress acted? Why isn't the White House displaying leadership? Some would rather not have this information on the table. It is ``vanilla'' information. It is information the American people have the right to know. It is information I am suggesting be made available. It is information the Social Security Advisory Board is suggesting be made available. It is not a partisan effort on my part; it is simply a desire to, hopefully, further the effort to inform the American people of the problems we face if we do not get on this issue of Social Security and begin to solve it. 
   That is the amendment I will offer. That is the bill I am introducing today. I see the Senator from Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee. He has been a leader on the issue of Social Security reform in this Congress. I greatly appreciate his support, cosponsorship, and initiation in drafting the bill which solves the overall problem. I thank him for his support. 
   I thank the Chair for its indulgence, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are about to begin the heavy lifting on the Patient Bill of Rights Conference Committee, and I wanted to come to the Floor of the Senate and lay out some of the key concerns and principles that should guide us in the coming month. 
   First, I want to take a minute and compliment my colleague, Senator NICKLES, for his fine work over, really, the last 3 years. He has been a dedicated leader on this issue. 
   I am confident that as chair of the conference, he will conduct a fair and orderly process for this conference. 
   We are ready. Many of us have worked on most of these provisions for several years. I and my Republican Senate conferees, for one, have worked over the last several months to educate ourselves on the House bill. 
   Let me be clear. We want a substantive conference. As I have said, we have already rolled up our sleeves, and I think we can work through this complex bill and meet the deadline of completing this bill by the end of March. That is our goal and with the cooperation of every Senator and House Member on this committee, I believe we can meet this goal. 
   The stakes are high. I don't think it is an exaggeration to say that the very future of medical care in this country hinges on what we do in this next month. 
   From the very basic and practical question of who a patient calls for help when there is a concern about coverage or some aspect of their health plan--to the delivery of that care by doctors or other health professionals--to who regulates these fundamental health insurance issues--all of these issues will be greatly affected by this bill. 
   First, do no harm. This is the doctor's oath. I believe we serve Americans badly if at the end of the day we do not adhere to that same rule. 
   That is why we cannot enact a bill that unreasonably increase the cost of insurance. We cannot leave American families with no choice but to drop their insurance altogether. 
   Even in our strong economy--the strongest economy that this country has seen since WWII--the number of uninsured Americans has increased by about another 1 million. The latest census numbers available show that 44.3 million Americans were without coverage in 1998. That is one American in six. 
   And employers are facing increases in health care costs this year of as much as 7.3 percent. Small businesses are struggling with even much higher cost increases. Costs are rising for American employers who want to continue providing coverage to their employees. 
   For better or worse, managed care has been the main instrument in this country for making health care more affordable for a vast number of Americans. If we price these products out of the market, with regulations, mandates and lawsuits, the effect will be crippling. 
   We recently heard from some fairly large employers who said that if the House-passed bill were enacted, they would stop offering employees health insurance altogether--resulting in more uninsured. 
   These aren't just some unrecognizable companies with a few employees. Companies like Wal Mart, which employs 800,000 employees, have indicated they would drop health coverage. 
   The Chamber of Commerce announced they would have no choice but to recommend to their member companies to drop health insurance if the House-passed bill were enacted into law in its current form.  
   Overall, I believe about 36 percent of the employers in this country have said they'd stop offering coverage. This Congress must not allow that to happen. 
   Will these bills hike the costs for families and their employers? Both bills will, even though Senate Republicans believe we have come up with a better bill that addresses the complexities of the health care system and gives patients the care they need without unreasonably raising their costs. 
   The CBO has said, in February, that the House-passed bill would cancel coverage for over a million Americans, increasing costs of private health insurance premiums by an average of 4.1 percent above inflation. This driving up of the costs of medicine does little to improve the quality of care. 
   Equally important as costs, is the issue of expanding lawsuits, or the liability debate. I fought to prevent the Senate bill from including an expanded right to sue last summer, and 52 of my colleague agreed with me. 
   They recognized that consumers don't get much from these lawsuits. They don't get greater care. They don't get much money for their troubles either, because the lawyers take most of any settlement or award. 
   If the truth be known, lawsuits have never been a friend of the patient. 
   Nothing confirms this fact better than a recent IOM report, To Err is Human: Building a Safer Health System, that finds unreported medical reports are killing alarming numbers of patients every year. 
   This report, based on the hard work of experts at the National Institute of Medicine, concluded that the threat of lawsuits actually prevents hospitals, doctors, and other health care professional from reporting mistakes and errors that they have made. 
   We are not just talking about a few cases, but the report concluded that as many as 98,000 people are killed each year because of such things as: 
   Poor handwriting by doctors, which often causes pharmacists to misread drug prescriptions and issue the wrong drug and/or dosage. 
   Unfamiliarity of doctors, and health professionals with the rapidly changing and emerging technologies that are being introduced in health care today. These technologies pose new hazards for patients, and professionals simply do not have competency and are not continually retrained. 
   The recommendations suggest that these errors are hidden for fear of malpractice lawsuits. 
   More importantly, the report suggests that doctors, hospitals and other health care providers will never report errors without protection from the threat of litigation. 
   So what is the answer to the horrible fact that thousands of Americans are dying each year because of unreported medical mistakes? 
   The IOM report calls for a national effort, and I agree that we have to work with every aspect of health care in this country to turn those numbers of deaths around. We need our public agencies responsible for the public health, like HHS, HRSA and the Agency for Health Care Policy Research and Quality involved. We need state agencies and public health institutions involved. 
   All of these folks need to engage the entire health care industry in a broad range of quality and safety issues. This is absolutely the direction we must go to prevent medical mistakes. 
   The report suggests that all these folks should work together to develop standards for safety and define minimum levels of performance for every health care organizations. All these efforts should focus public attention on patient safety. We know how to prevent many of these medical mistakes, and real reductions in errors are achievable if we focus on patient safety. 
   President Clinton also wants to require every state to create mandatory reporting systems to collect information on medical errors. However, I haven't really heard very many folks say they support a mandatory system; most don't believe it will solve the problem. 
   Even the Administration official who presented the plan to the Health and Education Committee several weeks ago, acknowledged that a mandatory system of reporting may not be the best approach. Dr. John Eisenburg, director of the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, admitted that some of the criticism of the proposal was ``on target.'' 
   He said, ``Do we know if these programs [mandatory reporting programs] work? No, we don't. We don't know how well they work, and when they work best.'' 
   The Health and Education Committee has had four hearing on this issue, and we have heard one thing time and time again: as long as there is the fear that reported data--whether it is supposed to be confidential or not--will be ferreted out and used by an aggressive trial bar, we will never be able to reduce medical error rates. Unless we do something about liability, there will never be a real and substantial effort made to report medical mistakes. 
   The American Hospital Association had this to day, ``Our concern is around the protection of the information that's contained in those reports. Any enterprising malpractice attorney is going to be able to track back to the caregivers.'' So, the fear of blame and lawsuits is too great. 
   When the American Medical Association testified at this hearing, they opposed mandatory reporting, saying that, ``The president has the cart before the horse. He'd put in place mandatory reporting, then study it and do something different if it doesn't improve patient safety'' 
   My colleague, Senator HAGEL, also specifically asked Dr. Dickey what she thought of the IMM's conclusion that there be some liability protections vis-a-vis this important issue--patient bill of rights. 
   You know what she said? She basically said that they wanted the flawed liability legal remedies and failed legal system that has harmed the doctor's practice of medicine for so many years applied to HMOs, and then and only then should we fix the mess for everyone. 
   Where is the logic in that? That does not sound like the answer to me. Shouldn't we acknowledge that, yes, this system that has caused defensive medicine and cost society in terms of quality health care for decades, and killed people according to the IOM, should be fixed before we expand its breadth to anyone else? 
   So, Mr. President, I say that liability has never been a friend to patients and the unfortunate findings about annual deaths in the IOM report are the best evidence of that fact. This IOM report is very important in our deliberations, and none of us should lose sight of this fact. 
   I also believe that my constituents back in New Hampshire should not have to deal with a greatly complicated regulatory bureaucracy. You know, a patient that has a question about his coverage or some other aspect of his health plan wants a straight answer to a question. 
   I want to highlight this fact: The consumer wants a straight answer. Ultimately, he should be able to call his health plan and receive reliable information. 
   If the answer he gets is not the answer he wants, the patient should have a means of redress. Under the Senate passed bill, we have set a system that lets doctors take a look at what doctors are deciding for patients. 
   Under the Senate passed bill, concerns are addressed by a doctor specializing in the patient's type of problem. The doctor is independent, and makes that decision. 
   There are several levels of independent medical review where a patient can go outside the insurance plan and have another doctor who specializes in the same type of problem look again at the patient's needs and decide if the patient should or should not have the requested service or treatment. 
   This is an approach designed to get the patient care, and get the patient good care. 
   The House-passed bill also has an appeals process, but I am very concerned its design is more about creating more lawsuits, and putting more money in attorneys' pockets. 
   What will patient's get out of this? They won't get the care they need. So we think we have come up with a better idea. 
   In conclusion, let me say that patients really want and need to be put back into the health care equation, and I think that has been acknowledged on both sides.  
   That is why many of the provisions in both bills are very similar. I think the provisions on plan information in both bills are similar and there is common ground from which we can work. 
   We both give Americans expanded new rights to go to an emergency room and get the care they need without worrying about having to fight with their insurer over who will pay for this care. 
   We both greatly expand access to specialists. Both bills allow direct access to a pediatrician for children, and for women seeking primary and preventative ob/gyn care. 
   So, we are close on very many of the issues that are important to most Americans. These are major issues that I believe we can come to an agreement on. 
   Other issues will be difficult to resolve, but I am committed to sitting down with colleagues on the other side of the aisle to discuss these issues, and will promise to negotiate in good faith. 
   We may not agree yet, but I am hopeful. I think Democrats and Republicans share a goal of wanting to ensure individuals have access to safe and appropriate health coverage. So I am positive about this conference.

He has certainly outlined most eloquently the importance of these savings accounts to education and how the dollars that will be going into the savings accounts will have a multilayer effect and grow radically, thus increasing the opportunity for more and more kids and more and more families to experience the American dream of going to college. They are using these dollars for other educational activities. 
   I wish to speak specifically to the amendment of the Senator from Washington State. 
   This amendment is misdirected. It has come to the floor on a number of other occasions and it has been misdirected every time it came to the floor. It has been put forward by the administration as basically a polling amendment. I mean they went out and polled the term and then they concluded that term polled well so they came forward with a program based on that term. 
   It does not have anything to do with quality education. Study after study has shown the issue of quality education is not tied directly to class size. It is tied to the quality of the teacher in the classroom. In fact, there was a recent study done which studied all the other studies; 300 studies were looked at by Eric Hanushek of the University of Rochester. His conclusion was this, looking at 300 different studies on this specific issue: Class size reduction has not worked; the quality of the teacher is much more important than class size. 
   Equally important to that issue is the fact this is a straw dog amendment; 43 of the States in this country already are below what the President wants in class size ratio, 18-1. So the amendment really is not for the purpose of reducing class size; it is for the purpose of putting out a political statement. 
   Let's do something about education. That is what the Republican side of this aisle wants to do. So we have come forward with something called the Teacher Empowerment Act. Rather than having Washington put a straitjacket on the communities where they have to use this money for one thing and one thing only, which is to hire new teachers--many school systems not needing new teachers; what they really need is keep the good teachers they already have and they are having trouble doing that--rather than having this straitjacket from Washington delivered by the Clinton administration and the Members on the other side of the aisle, we said: Let's give the local communities the opportunity to give them what they need, the Teacher Empowerment Act. 
   It says we will take the funds suggested by the Senator from Washington and put them in the proper vehicle, which happens to be the Elementary and Secondary School Act, which is being marked up today, and we will allow those funds to be used by local communities to assist in addressing their teacher needs. They can use it for teacher education; they can use it for paying good teachers more money to keep them there in the school system; they can use it to send teachers out to get better qualifications and more certification or, if they want, they can use it to hire teachers to reduce class size. 
   We give the local school system a series of options, which is exactly what should happen. We in Washington should not be saying to every school system in America that in order to get these funds it has to add another teacher because that may not be what the local school system needs. There are numerous school systems in this country that have great teachers that they are losing because the tremendous demand of the marketplace is taking those teachers out of the school system and putting them in the private sector, especially in the math and science areas. So what that school system needs is the ability to pay them a differential, pay them a little more money. This gives them that option. 
   The Republican proposal is a logical proposal. It is a proposal that addresses the needs of the school systems, the needs of the principals in the school systems, the needs of the 
   superintendents in the school systems and, most important, the needs of the teachers in the school systems and the needs of the parents whose children those teachers teach, rather than addressing some polling data that happens to make a nice political statement but ends up straitjacketing the local communities and the parents and teachers in those local communities. 
   That is the difference. To begin with, the Coverdell bill is the wrong place for this amendment. The amendment is bad to begin with, as I just noted, and I noted why it is bad, but it has no place in this bill. We are in the process of marking this specific issue up in committee. In fact, today we heard from the Senator from Washington; we heard from the Senator from Massachusetts as to how class size was going to be one of the two essential issues they intended to raise in the committee as we marked up the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is very appropriate. That is where the debate should occur. 
   In that bill already is the TEA bill, the Teacher Empowerment Act. They don't like it because it gives freedom to local school districts and they want to keep control in Washington. I can understand that is their political philosophy, but that debate should occur in the committee of jurisdiction on the bill appropriate to the issue. It should not occur on this bill, which is a bill to expand and empower parents and kids so they can go to college, so they can pursue other types of educational excellence activities. 
   The Coverdell idea is a superb idea and it certainly should not be mucked up, the water should not be discolored as a result of putting out what is basically a proposal that has no relevance to this bill.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I begin by congratulating the Senator from Delaware for bringing this bill forward again, and the Senator from Georgia, who is presently in the Chair, for having been the original author of this bill. 
   This is a very strong piece of legislation which, as the Senator from Delaware has so effectively pointed out, is absolutely critical to the parents of this country as they try to assure the one thing that is most important in most parents' lifestyles in dealing with their kids, beyond giving their kids love and a sense of how to deal with reality and a sense of values, and that is the ability to get a good education. The ability to get a good education, once you get out of the public school system in our country today, is tied, to a great extent, to your ability to pay for that education. Postsecondary school education, even under public school systems, can be extraordinarily expensive. 
   These college savings IRA accounts give parents more flexibility. In fact, there was an ad I saw on TV last night which brought home the reality of this so effectively. It showed a baby being born. The theme of the ad was: The first image that comes across the parents' minds is the wonder of the baby. The second image that comes across the parents' minds is, $210,000 is flashed up on the screen because that is what it is going to cost to educate that child, to have that child, who was just born, go to college. The theme of the ad is: What am I going to do to pay that? 
   One way to address it is to pass this bill which was passed and, regrettably, rejected by the Democratic side of the aisle and the President. It is before us again so we can give parents some relief. 
   Nobody is claiming this is the entire rug or the entire makeup of the issue of how we address education. No one is claiming that this is the whole quilt. This is one block within the quilt, one item of the quilt in how we improve education in this country today. It is an important item, and it is an important statement to make that we, as a Congress, are going to, once again, put forward this initiative which we put forward last year as part of our efforts.  
   A couple of Members from the other side of the aisle have come to the floor today and said they would rather debate something else. I guess they do not think college education is that important. They think something else is more important. 
   One Member came to the floor today, the Senator from Connecticut, and said we need to debate special ed; we need to put more money into special ed. We should not be putting more money into this program; we should be putting more money into special ed. 
   That is an unusual argument to hear from the other side of the aisle because there is a certain inconsistency and hollowness to that argument. Let's go through the numbers as to special ed and this Congress since the Republicans have taken over and since we have had a Democratic President. 
   In 1997, the President sent up a budget. How much of an increase did he have for special ed? He had a 12-percent increase. The Republican Senate made a commitment. It said: That's not enough; we have to address special ed. We are going to put more dollars into special ed. 
   As a result, the Republican Congress put forward a 
   34-percent increase in special ed. Why was that? Because we see special ed as being the single largest unfunded mandate, outside the environmental area, this country has. Originally, the agreement was, the Federal Government was going to pay 40 percent of the cost of special ed. When the Congress became Republican, the cost that was being paid by the Federal Government was 6 percent, and it had not been improved at all by the Democratic Congress or by a Democratic Presidency. 
   We made a commitment as a Republican Congress that we were going to get that spending up so more special ed dollars would flow back to the States, so we could fulfill our obligations under special ed of paying a larger percentage of that 40 percent, so local dollars could be freed up for the purposes of spending them on local priorities rather than having local dollars spent paying the Federal share of special ed. 
   As I said, in 1997 the Democratic leadership in this Congress, and through its President, proposed a 12-percent increase in special ed. We raised special ed spending by $783 million that year, or 34 percent. I am pointing this out because the Senator from Connecticut said we have to spend more money on special ed; we should not be talking about this program on the floor; more money should go to special ed. I think that rings hollow in light of these numbers. 
   In 1998, the President put forward a budget with a 4-percent increase in special ed funding. That is essentially enough to pay for all the salaries of all the administrators they want to put on the books. The Senate increased special ed spending that year under a Republican initiative by 22 percent, $698 million. 
   In 1999, it was the same story. The President sent us a budget supported by the Democratic leadership. How much of an increase did they ask for in special ed spending? This time they asked for a .03-percent increase in special ed funding. 
   The Republican majority said: No, that is not acceptable; we are going to increase special ed funding again. We increased it over the baseline by 13 percent in 1999, $510 million. 
   Again, in the year 2000, this year, the President increased special ed funding by what? Seven percent. We said: No, that is not acceptable; more special ed dollars are needed to meet the obligation of the 40-percent commitment we made. So the Republican Senate, with a Republican initiative of this Congress, increased special ed funding by $678 million last year for a 15.7-percent increase. 
   The total increase under the Republican leadership in this Congress in special ed funding has been over 100 percent since the year 1997. We have gone from $2.6 billion up to over $5 billion we are projecting in this coming year in special ed funding. 
   The proposals coming from the other side of the aisle--and we just heard this presentation that said we should be spending more on special ed--were to increase special ed funding over that period by essentially nothing. 
   The Republican majority has taken the issue of special ed funding. We have fulfilled an obligation. We are moving toward full funding of that obligation made by this Congress in 1976 when the special ed bill was first passed, and as a result we are doing what should be done, which is to fund special ed at an aggressive level, something which we have not seen coming from the other side of the aisle or from the administration. 
   When I hear folks come to this floor and say we should not be taking up this bill, we should be funding special ed, there is, I think, a certain hollowness to that argument. 
   The Senator from Massachusetts argued we ought to be taking up this item of education, that item of education, another item of education, and why haven't we taken up all these items of education; we have not done anything in this Congress, including minimum wage. 
   I note, the bankruptcy bill did have minimum wage in it, which we passed, which the Senator, I guess, does not like, and that is why he considers we have not taken it up. The fact is, all the educational items he has listed are presently moving through committee and will be discussed in committee and then will be brought to the floor, as the Senator knows. 
   The Elementary and Secondary Education Act is on the verge of being marked up in committee. In fact, I think the Senator probably, as of today or maybe tomorrow, will be putting together his amendments and will be getting ready for a major markup of that bill the first week in March, which will take up almost all the issues he outlined as not being addressed by this Congress. 
   Would he want us to skip the committee and just bring that bill to the floor without any committee action? As a senior member on the Democratic side of that committee, I seriously doubt that. That bill is not being vetted in committee. I cannot imagine the Senator would want those issues, which are very complex, very important, and involve substantive discussions of education policy, to be thrown out on the floor without committee action. But that seems to be what he is suggesting, that we should have just thrown the bill before the Senate rather than putting it through the proper committee procedure and taking action on it, which is what he has proposed. He knows it is going to be taken up in committee and then brought before the Senate and worked on I suspect for a week or a week and a half, maybe 2 weeks. 
   Why is this bill being considered? Because this bill has gone through the committee process. The chairman of the committee which has jurisdiction over this piece of legislation is presenting the bill. That is why it is here. 
   If the ESEA bill was ready, it could be brought to the floor, but the ESEA bill isn't ready. It will be ready fairly soon. It is going to be one heck of a good bill on which to debate education policy. I will not deny that. 
   The differences between our side of the aisle and the other side of the aisle on the issue of elementary and secondary education in this country are fairly significant. We happen to think after you have spent $100 billion on a program, and kids can be shown to have obtained absolutely nothing from that money, that you have children essentially who are still locked into failure, where low-income kids are still getting the same terrible education children got 20 years ago. 
   Even though we have spent $100 billion on education, unfortunately, the children with whom we started out 20 years ago in this program have ended up coming through a system which has failed them. We are still sticking kids into that system. We are still running them through that system, the same way it has always been--counting bureaucrats instead of counting results; not focusing on the child but, rather, focusing on systems. That is a failure; no question about it. We are going to get to discuss that failure at some length on this floor, as we will in committee. That is going to be a big issue. 
   But to simply bring the ESEA out here and throw it on the floor, as the Senator from Massachusetts, the ranking member, seems to be implying we should do before we take up this bill, abandons the legislative process. 
   The legislative process relative to this bill has worked. It has gone through committee. It has actually gone through committee and through  the Senate and it has been vetoed. Now it is back on the floor. Having gone through the committee, it has come back to the floor to be heard again. It makes sense that we should be taking up this bill. 
   I think the arguments by the Senator from Massachusetts, as much as I respect his understanding of the legislative process--he is one of the people in the Senate who knows the most about the legislative process and has been here the longest of anyone, I guess, other than Senator THURMOND and Senator BYRD. He understands the legislative process, and I am a little surprised, I guess, that he would make the representations he did relative to why this bill is on the floor versus the other issues he outlined as being his preference for being considered on the floor. 
   We will get to those other issues. We will get to them aggressively. We will have a full debate. It is going to be a very energized debate. There will be a lot of differences of opinion. It will be good for this country because the education debate needs to be aired on this floor with intensity and with a full hearing because it is such a critical issue for our Nation. 
   But as of right now, the bill on which we are ready to proceed is this bill. In my opinion, we should not have a lot of ``straw dogs'' put up in the face of it. Let's pass this bill. It is good for parents, it is good for kids who want to go to college, and as a result it will be good for the country. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.

    Mr. GREGG. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000. On January 20, 2000, the FCC approved a new non-commercial low-power FM (LPFM) radio service. In order for LPFM stations to fit in the FM band, the FCC will have to significantly weaken the existing interference protections it developed and has subscribed to for decades. The public commentary and technical analysis shows that LPFM will cause interference with current FM stations, and thus result in a loss of service to listeners. It is imperative that the integrity of the spectrum is protected and that all individuals have access to local news, weather and emergency information free from interference. Both public and commercial radio stations are opposed to the FCC's proposal in its current form. 
   These new FCC rules are inconsistent with sound spectrum management. I believe that this issue requires further study, as well as Congressional hearings, to fully examine the impact that LPFM would have on existing FM radio service. Therefore, I am introducing the Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act. This legislation would repeal any prescribed rules authorizing LPFM and revoke LPFM licenses that may be issued prior to the date of enactment of this bill. 
   While the desire to provide a forum for community groups to have a greater voice is laudable, a multitude of alternatives already exist. Currently, groups may obtain commercial or noncommercial radio licenses, use public access cable, publish newsletters, and utilize Internet web sites and e-mail. It is important that our efforts to create more opportunities for those who support LPFM do not lead to the denial of access for others who depend on FM radio for safety, news, and entertainment. For instance, inexpensive and older radios, particularly vulnerable to interference and most commonly used by low-income and elderly listeners, will sustain the greatest negative impact caused by LPFM. 
   Furthermore, it is not clear whether the relaxation of first, second, or third adjacent channel protection standards will have an adverse effect on the transition to digital radio. Unlike television broadcasters, who are being given additional free spectrum to broadcast in digital format, radio broadcasters must use the current spectrum allocations to transmit both digital and analog signals, making adjacent channel safeguards all the more important. At a minimum, adding a large number of LPFMs to the already congested FM band will make the transition to digital radio increasingly difficult and problematic. 
   Finally, the new low-power proposal makes formerly unlicensed, pirate radio operators eligible for LPFM licenses. This ruling re-enforces their unlawful behavior and encourages future illegal activity by opening the door to new unauthorized broadcasters. The introduction of thousands of LPFM stations not only rewards illegal activity, but is certain to undermine the integrity of the radio spectrum, interfering with current FM service and penalizing the listening public. The radio programming supplied to listeners by existing radio stations provides crucial news, weather, and emergency information, as well as cultural entertainment, which must be preserved.

    Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to mention the efforts of Special Agent Eric Harnischfeger, who has been on detail from the U.S. Secret Service to the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary for the consideration of the fiscal year 2000 bill. Eric has been a considerable asset to the subcommittee, astutely handling some of our more difficult law enforcement accounts. His management of counterterrorism programs, office of justice programs, and  state and local law enforcement accounts is greatly appreciated. Eric's ability to provide keen insight and a friendly manner toward any task he is asked to deal with assured a competent resolution. 
   Eric's professionalism, wit, and jovial manner will be missed. Agent Harnischfeger exemplifies the high standards that the Secret Service is known for and has done an excellent job for us. I just want to thank him publicly for all his efforts over the past year. Based on his performance here, I am sure he has a bright future at the Service. We wish him the very best.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today marks the 1-year anniversary of the Internet tax moratorium and the setting up of a commission to look into the manner in which we tax the Internet. This moratorium was to last for 3 years, and the commission was to meet and begin the process of trying to determine how best to deal with the variety of proposals to place taxes on the use of the Internet, products which are sold over the Internet, and services which are supplied over the Internet. 
   Obviously, the Internet represents a watershed mark possibly in history as to economic activity. It is a period in which we have seen the Internet become an economic engine of immense proportions for our Nation and for the world. The Wall Street Journal reported on October 18 that electronic commerce not only positively affects economic activity but has had a very positive impact on reducing the rate of inflation. 
   Products sold over the Internet are actually forcing down prices as competition occurs and products, such as prescription drugs, have been found on the Internet to be 28-percent cheaper and apparel 38-percent cheaper. The overall index found that products generally were about 13-percent cheaper on the Internet. The Internet has not only been a wonderful economic engine; it also has been a force for maintaining and controlling inflation during this period of dramatic prosperity. 
   Of course, the Internet is growing at an incredible rate. Over the last 12 months, Internet economic growth has been about 68 percent, which is a huge rate of growth compared to a national economic rate of growth which is somewhere in the 3- to 4-percent range, if we are lucky. The role of the Internet in 
   our society is immense today and is getting even more significant. 
   The question is, How do we deal with it in the context of taxes? There is a large number of communities and a number of States in this country that wish to assess on Internet transactions their local sales tax activity, much the same as they attempt to assess catalog sales. There are something like 30,000 jurisdictions which could assess taxes on the Internet. 
   The effect, of course, of having this diffuse and extraordinarily large group of taxing authorities--50 States and 30,000 subjurisdictions of those States--with a potential of taxing the Internet at various rates could, quite simply, grind to a halt this wonderful engine of economic activity and prosperity into which our Nation has gone. 
   Literally, if we allow the Internet to be subject to this variety of taxes and this variety of tax authorities, and the imagination and creativity we always see from various Government entities when it comes to taxing, literally we could end up stopping the Internet as an effective force for economic expansion and prosperity. 
   Furthermore, the concept of taxing the Internet, which is clearly a national and really a global instrument of commerce, appears, to me at least, to fly in the face of our Constitution. The commerce clause of our Constitution is pretty specific. Section 8, clause 3, of the Constitution reads:  
   The Congress shall have Power ..... To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.  
   There can be nothing that is a form of commerce more among the several States than the Internet as it presently is expanding, growing, and becoming a force for economic activity. 
   Thus, the taxing of the Internet by all these different entities would clearly, in my opinion, raise serious constitutional problems. In fact, the Supreme Court addressed this issue when it came to catalog sales in the Quill case, where the Supreme Court essentially ruled that States, unless they have a nexus relationship with the seller of the assets, do not have traditionally the ability to tax that transaction. 
   Secondly, Congress needs to look at the issue of taxation because of the extraordinary, as I have mentioned, chilling effect it would have on commerce generally. We, as a nation, as the creators and inventors of the Internet and, therefore, controllers not only of the initial and expanding technology, but also of the language which dominates the Internet, have put ourselves essentially as a nation on a rocket sled of economic activity. We have expanded and accelerated at an extraordinary speed past the rest of the world towards economic prosperity. 
   I recall, rather vividly, in the late 1980s when the ``woe is me'' crowd was saying that Japan was going to overtake the United States in all functions of economic activity, and that our economic model for prosperity simply could not compete with the Japanese economic model of prosperity, which was intimidating and which remains significant. 
   But the fact is that it did not work out that way. It did not work out that way because America's strength is our entrepreneurship and our inventiveness. We took that entrepreneurship and inventiveness and we created this massive new vehicle for economic activity called the Internet. Thus, instead of being overwhelmed by our friends and neighbors and allies in the industrial world, we have, instead, exploded past them in the ability to produce prosperity and economic activity, in large part because of the Internet and the offspring of technology which it has created. 
   So we do not want to do anything which jeopardizes the unique and special international lead that we have in this area. Yet allowing thousands of different jurisdictions to tax the Internet would do exactly that. It would jeopardize that lead and undermine and, as I said, possibly bring to a complete halt the use of the Internet as an element of commerce. 
   The third thing we must be sensitive to in this area of the Internet is the international implications beyond the questions of trade. It has been suggested by people at the U.N. that the U.N. should start to fund itself by putting in place a tax on e-commerce and e-mail. At first it was an outrageous suggestion, but it is the type of suggestion you get at the U.N. from people  who represent nations which maybe do not have as much of a financial interest in it as we do and know that we would end up paying the tax, our Nation would end up paying the burden. But the fact that has been suggested is just a sort of crack of the door behind which, if it were fully opened, you would see an international initiative of significant proportions to place taxes on the Internet. 
   As a result, if we have essentially come to the table, having already soiled our hands with taxing the Internet, it will be very extraordinarily difficult for us to resist, whether it is the U.N. or whether it is some other nation that also tries to pursue this course of action. It is essential, for the purposes of seeing an expansion of this technology and this form of economic activity, that we dampen down and restrict and as aggressively as we can resist having other nations pursue the path of taxation of Internet transactions. 
   Obviously, the U.N. has no right to step into this ground. In fact, as chairman of the appropriating committee that has jurisdiction over the U.N., I put specific language into an appropriations bill, which hopefully will pass today, that says the United States will not spend any money at the U.N. should the U.N. pursue this course of action, which I am sure they will not. This was some idea put forward by somebody there, but I do not think it speaks to the majority at the United Nations. 
   But those are three core reasons why we have to be extraordinarily sensitive to what the tax policy is relative to the Internet. 
   The reason I raise this is because it took 8 months for the Internet commission to get started. That was not their fault. Really, it was the fault of those bodies which had the obligation of appointing membership to the commission. Actually, under Governor Gilmore, this commission has done an excellent job of meeting. Governor Gilmore's position relative to taxation over the Internet is exactly the position that should be pursued. However, I am not sure he has a majority position within the commission. I hope he does. 
   But in order for us to assure this threat to our commerce does not occur, I believe we should extend this moratorium. Since we had at least 8 months of delay before we got this commission up and running, I think we should have an extension which recognizes that the commission should have the full 3-year period; therefore, we should extend the moratorium for another year, at a minimum, on the Internet. 
   I happen to think it should be extended beyond that, well beyond that, because I believe certainty in the area of taxation is one of the key issues for maintaining economic activity. If people participating in an economic activity can predict what their tax obligations are and what the tax implications will be to an economic initiative, then they are much more likely to be willing to invest capital and take the risks necessary to pursue that initiative. But if they cannot predict their tax liability, then that limits and dampens down the desire to put capital and take risks in a certain economic activity. We have seen that historically. 
   So I do believe very strongly that we should not only be extending this moratorium for a year but that we should be extending it for a series of years beyond the 3-year moratorium that presently exists. 
   Let's face it. The economic benefit which this Nation has seen as a result of this truly revolutionary event--in the history of economics, I suspect this is going to go down with the industrial revolution as one of the most significant 
   turning points in the history of prosperity and the way nations generate wealth. 
   The benefits which we, as a nation, have obtained as a result of this, as a result of being the incubator, the developer, and now the provider in expertise in the area of the Internet, and the use of the Internet for commerce, the benefits which we have received, as a nation, are basically incalculable: the amount of new jobs which have been created; the number of people whose standard of living has been increased; the number of people who have been able to purchase goods at less of a price; and the number of people who have simply had a better chance to participate in prosperity. 
   The Nation as a whole has seen economic activity and economic prosperity that has been a blessing to everyone, in large part because of this huge expansion in e-commerce and in the Internet as a force. Those benefits dramatically exceed any benefit which we would obtain by allowing a large number of different States or municipalities to start taxing the Internet for the purposes of expanding their local governments. 
   It is the classic situation of the goose that lays the golden egg, to say the least. We have confronted a goose that is laying a lot of golden eggs for America, and for the prosperity of America, and for the opportunity of America to create jobs. For America to maintain its place as a world leader, we should not make the mistake of maybe not cutting off the goose's head but nicking that goose with thousands of different taxes which may cause it to, unfortunately, stumble or even be stopped as a result of allowing the creativity and the imagination of our various government units across this Nation to begin to tax the Internet. 
   So I hope as we wrap up this session we will consider this. Obviously, we probably are not going to get it in this major omnibus bill, although I tried to do that and it was rejected in committee--an extension of the Internet moratorium. 
   I do hope when we come back next year this will be a priority item--to make it clear, to make an unalterable statement to the community which is developing and promoting this incredible engine of prosperity that we are not going to stop them by turning loose the forces of government and taxation on them. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his courtesy in yielding me some time. I especially thank him for his commitment to making the American people aware through floor statements of how much we have accomplished and how many positive things have occurred in this Congress. 
   As he mentioned, the most positive is that we have a balanced budget for the first time in generations; that for the first time in years, 20 years or so, the Social Security trust fund money is going to be used for Social Security, which is one of the most important things we could do and thus preserve it for the benefit of senior citizens and the next generation of senior citizens. Something that is really an incredibly positive stride in the way we have dealt with ourselves in this Nation and has led in large part to the economic prosperity that we now experience is the fact that the Government has finally decided to live within its means. That is a result, in my opinion, of a Congress which has aggressively disciplined spending of the Federal Government. 
   In fact, I recall when this Congress was first elected, a Republican Congress, the President had sent up his budget for the year, and it projected $200 billion deficits for as far as the eye could see. I think the year was 1996, and for the next 10 years it was $200 billion of deficits every year for as far as we could see. 
   Well, we in the Republican Congress, the first Republican Congress in 40 years, said that was not acceptable; we were going to have to live within our means. Others said it was not doable. We proved it was doable. 
   That is a positive event. We now have multiple billions of dollars of surplus, a big enough surplus so we will have no impact on Social Security in this budgeting cycle. 
   What I wanted to speak about, however, beyond the good news, is the issue that has caused us to sort of grind through the process of wrapping up the appropriations bills, specifically the demand by the President in a number of areas of appropriations accounts. The first one I wish to talk about is the demand by the President that we expand his classroom teacher proposal. 
   Now, the Congress has fully funded to the tune of $1.2 billion. The amount of money that the President initially requested for class size in his original request was for $1.2 billion, the purpose of which was to add teachers to the classroom. Teachers to the classroom may be a good idea in the $1.2 billion that has been put on the table to accomplish that, but the difference between the two sides is not in the dollars; it is in the way those dollars should be spent. 
   The President's proposal and the proposal coming from the other side of the aisle is that $1.2 billion shall be spent as the people in Washington tell the local people to spend it; it will be spent under a command-and-control process where the administration, the people of the Department of Education, the people of the national labor unions, and the legislators on the other side of the aisle tell the local school districts, tell the States, tell the local principals, tell the local school boards: You must use this money for the purposes of hiring teachers. 
   You must use it for the purposes of hiring teachers. It is a command-and-control, top-down directive  from Washington telling local school districts how to operate their schools. We, on the other hand, on our side of the aisle, have proposed this $1.2 billion be used for schoolteachers, if that is what the local school district wants. But we have also said--and I will read the language to you--``If the local educational agency determines that it wishes to use the funds for purposes other than class size reduction as part of a local strategy for improving academic achievement, funds may be used for promotional development activities, teacher training, and any other local need that is designated to improve student performance.'' 
   What we are saying on our side of the aisle is that we do not think that a one-shoe-fits-all approach; we don't think that a command-and-control, top-down approach is the right way to manage local education or to manage any education for that matter. 
   What we believe very strongly is that we should put the dollars on the table. We should make those dollars available to the local schools. And we should say to the local schools: If you need more teachers, here are the dollars to hire those teachers. But if you have determined, under a procedure for obtaining higher academic achievement, you don't need more teachers but what you need are better teachers, and therefore you want to train your teachers, or what you need is to keep a teacher who is about to leave, and therefore you need to pay that teacher a little bit more money, or what you need is a class that has some sort of teacher's aide capability in it, such an individual, but also computer technologies, you should be able to do that. 
   So we are saying in the context of improving the education, most importantly ``improving the students' performance,'' which is the exact words we use, you can use this money for other areas of teacher enhancement and of assisting teachers to be better teachers. 
   Why are we saying that? Why aren't we saying what the White House and President Clinton say and what the Senators on the other side of the aisle say, which is you must do it our way; you must hire teachers, and that is what will make for better education? Why aren't we doing that? Because that doesn't work. That doesn't work. 
   Study after study has concluded that it is not necessarily the class size ratio that is critical to education. It happens to be more than that. I think anybody who has ever been involved in any level of education knows this. It is intuitively obvious through inspection--which was what one of my professors used to say in college, and we used to make fun of him for saying that--that there is a lot more to a classroom than the ratio of teacher to students. 
   If you have a terrible teacher--I have said this on the floor before--who can't teach you a subject matter, if you put 10 kids with that teacher, or 20 kids with that teacher, they are still not going to learn. If you have an excellent teacher who knows how to handle the subject matter, the odds are that the size of the class, if it varies within five or so children, is not going to affect the quality of that education a whole lot. In fact, this is what studies have shown. 
   In fact, Eric Hanushek at the University of Rochester, 
   an economist, studied 300 other studies that have been done on this issue and concluded as follows: Looking at 300 different studies, class size reduction has not worked. Furthermore, the quality of the teacher is the most important factor in education, and it is much more important to the class than class size.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to respond to some of the comments made on the floor relative to where we are going with the budget. I specifically want to talk about the issue as it relates to a committee of which I am chairman. The committee I chair is the Commerce, Justice, State, and the Judiciary Subcommittee. The President of the United States opted to veto our bill. In his veto message, his representation was that we simply had not spent enough money. That was essentially what it came down to. 
   His representation on the other bills he has vetoed is also that we have not spent enough money as a Congress. In fact, in listening to the President and the proposals he puts forward, we find he is talking about spending billions and billions more than what the Congress suggested we spend. 
   The Senator from North Dakota has come to the floor and said that the Republicans have used gimmicks, that we have forward-funded, which we have, which is not a gimmick; it has been done in the Congress before on many occasions; that we have declared items emergencies, which we have. In fact, the Senator from North Dakota supported, I suspect rather strongly 
   and with enthusiasm, the declaring of the agricultural situation as an emergency. It has been declared an emergency every year since I have been here, so I don't know why it is an emergency. But it has been declared an emergency. It is a way of funding agricultural issues, and there are severe strictures in the agricultural community today. 
   The Senator from North Dakota didn't mention where we are going to get the extra money the President asked for. Where are we going to get it? The Republicans have allegedly used gimmicks so we could not take it from Social Security--which we have not, by the way; we have managed not to take any money from Social Security. Where is the President going to get it from? The President is going to get it from Social Security because the only other option is to raise taxes and we have already seen a vote in the House of Representatives--415-0 I think was the vote--saying they were not going to raise taxes. So that is not an option. It is not even on the table. 
   The President makes these proposals: We are going to raise spending here; we want more money here; we want more money here. The Democratic Members, on the other side of the aisle, say: Hooray, hooray, more money for this, more money for that. When Republicans say, Isn't that coming out of Social Security? there is just this silence from the other side of the aisle.  
   Of course, it is coming out of Social Security because we have no other resource from which to draw those funds than Social Security. So there is a lot of gamesmanship coming from the other side of the aisle on this issue. There always has been, on Social Security, of course. There are literally generations, now, of Members of the other side of the aisle who have demagogged the issue of Social Security. As many of us have tried to put forward substantive Social Security responses, we have found this President, who allegedly wants to address Social Security, has failed to do so in a substantive way. But we hear now he wants to raid Social Security to pay for his new spending and they will not even admit to that. The statements from the other side of the aisle are hollow on that issue, to say the least. But let me go back to the specifics of this proposal. 
   The President has vetoed the Commerce-State-Justice bill, which has under it the Justice Department, the Commerce Department, and the State Department. It also has a lot of agencies such as the Small Business Administration, FCC, FTC, SEC, elements of Government which are critical to the day-to-day operation of the Government and to our maintaining a sound economy and safe society. But the President has vetoed this bill. Why has he vetoed it? Basically, he has vetoed it 
   because we did not spend enough money in some of the programs he wanted and because we did not include language he wanted in a couple of areas. He has vetoed it specifically on the allegations we do not spend enough money on the COPS Program. 
   Let's look at that for a second. This Congress authorized 100,000 cops to be put on the street under the President's request, in a bipartisan way. We have paid for every one of those police officers in this appropriations bill. Not only have we paid for every one of those police officers, we paid for an additional 10,000 or 15,000 police officers in this bill. So we can go up to 110,000 or 115,000 police officers under this bill. 
   What does the President say? He says that is not enough. He says he wants 130,000 to 150,000 police officers, even though there are only 100,000 authorized. That in itself is a bit of a reach, to ask for an extra 30,000 to 50,000 officers when they are not even authorized. But what is really inconsistent about this, and what really shows what a sham statement this is, the administration, although they have the money for 100,000 officers since we paid for 100,000 officers in our bill, has only been able to get out of the door enough money to fund 60,000 officers. In other words, down there in the White House they are now asking for another 30,000 to 50,000 officers when they cannot even undertake the day-to-day administrative event of paying for the full 100,000 we gave them in the first place. They are still 40,000 officers short from the original authorized number. 
   It takes 18 months to get this through the system, to get an officer on the street after they have agreed to pay for that officer. So they are literally a year and a half away at the minimum from even reaching the 100,000 level. So we said, OK, we agree more officers on the street makes sense so we will go over the 100,000 number; we will give you another 10,000 officers. Then the President vetoes it, saying he hasn't enough, when his administration has not even put out on the street the first 100,000. How blatantly political can this administration be? How hypocritical can this administration be? They did not veto this bill over police officers who were not there. They vetoed this bill because they want to put out a press release that they are vetoing bills. It had nothing to do with the actual substance of how many police officers we have on the street or how many police officers we paid for because we paid for every police officer they put out there, and we are willing to pay for another 40,000, another 55,000 if they could put them out. But they cannot because they are not able to do it. It is pure hocum, this language that they want more police officers, and they vetoed it over the lack of funding in this account. It is just a pure political thing. 
   Then they said they vetoed it because they did not get enough money--no, not because they didn't get enough, because we did not give them the money for the U.N. We did not give them the money for the U.N. 
   Every dollar they asked for, for the U.N., is in this bill, every dollar for U.N. fees is in this bill. Every dollar for arrearages is in this bill. Yes, there is not the full money they asked for for peacekeeping, but every other account in the U.N. is fully paid for in this bill. Why can't they get it out? Why can't they send it up to the U.N.? Why can't they pay England the arrearages we owe them? Why can't they pay France the arrearages we owe them? That is where 
   this money goes. It doesn't stay in the U.N. Most of it flows to other countries that have picked up our obligations. Because they have a bunch of activists down at the White House who are focused on a very narrow issue of international Planned Parenthood and are unwilling to release the money to fund the world organization known as the U.N., which is a major international organization, because they are willing to hold up funding over an extraordinarily narrow issue dealing with Planned Parenthood lobbying internationally. It does not have anything to do with the United States. 
   Not only that, but the language which they are holding up the funding over is language which was in existence, which this Government operated under during the Reagan administration and during the Bush administration. It is, to say the least, genuinely innocuous language. But they have activists down there at the White House, activists who are willing to take down the U.N. and our relationship with the U.N. over this narrow piece of language. 
   It is unbelievable they would blame the Congress, which has fully funded the arrearage issue, when it is just a small group of extreme activists serving at the White House who are tying up the release of this money. The money is there. The money is physically there. Every dollar, every cent, is on the table and ready to be sent to the U.N. to pay the arrearages. The only thing that stops us is, I suspect, one or two internationalists, activists at the White House who have decided to make a cause celebre for themselves over this really obscure piece of language which, by the way, as I mentioned, was the law of the land in the United States for the Reagan and the Bush administrations. 
   So the idea the Congress has in any way interfered with the ability to pay the arrearages is, again, pure hocum. This is a classic example of the situation where the individual shoots his parents and throws himself before the court and asks for mercy because he is an orphan. The White House has decided to shoot its parents--in this case the U.N.--and then claim it has no role in the event and is pure when, in fact, it is the reason we cannot pay the arrearages. That is just pure hocum. 
   We now know the two major reasons they vetoed this bill; the COPS reason has no substance to it, and the U.N. language is their problem, not our problem. We put the money in. They are the ones who are holding this up. 
   Then they listed a whole series of little different items, one of which I found most interesting. In the Senate we took up two different hate crime proposals to move this bill through so we could actually get it to conference. Then in conference it became absolutely clear there was no way an issue such as hate crimes, as massive as it is, could be handled in our conference. We had two competing ideas. So we put them aside and sent them back to the authorizing committee. Ironically, the amendments were offered by the chairman and ranking member of the authorizing committee, so one would hope the authorizing committee could straighten this issue out and we, as appropriators, would not have to straighten it out. 
   What does the White House say? It says it wants the hate crimes legislation on this bill. This is an appropriations bill. This is a bill that funds the FBI, DEA, and the INS. Those are real law enforcement issues. They are going to undermine the ability of the FBI to do its job, the ability of the INS to do its job, the ability of the DEA to do its job, so they can get hate crimes legislation? They are going to undermine the ability of U.S. attorneys to do their jobs, the ability of U.S. marshals to do their jobs, the ability of the U.S. court system to do its job, so they can get hate crimes legislation? They are going to undermine the FEC, FTC, and the FCC so they can get their hate crimes legislation? 
   How outrageous. What sort of priority is this from this White House?  What sort of priority puts language on hate crimes ahead of the FBI, DEA, INS, ahead of the U.S. attorneys, ahead of the U.S. marshals, the FCC, FEC, FTC--what type of priority is it when they know in order to get that language they have to go through an authorizing committee anyway? It is beyond belief they would put at risk the law enforcement agencies of this country in order to get hate crimes language, which in the first place is a State issue. 
   I note the State of Wyoming--the Senator from Wyoming is on the floor--is doing one heck of a job in pursuing that issue at the State level. 
   It is first a State issue. The irony of it is, he is undermining the entire law enforcement community of the United States because he wants a new criminal act on the Federal books. 
   Is there a total disconnect at the White House? There appears to be. The veto of this bill--and there are a lot of other miscellaneous points--but the veto of this bill has nothing to do with the substance of this bill. It was done purely for political reasons so the President could look as if he was in charge or he could look as if he was standing up to the Congress. 
   The practical effect of vetoing this bill, however, is to undermine law enforcement across this country, to make it impossible for us to pay our U.N. arrearages, and to make it extremely hard for these agencies, which are so critical to the functioning of our country, to continue to function in an effective way. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank the Senator from Wyoming for the time.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern about the President's latest Social Security proposal as outlined in his recent radio address. I hope Congress will resolve to oppose this proposal unless it can be significantly modified, and it does not appear the President wants to modify it. 
   I am greatly disappointed with the decision by the President to bring forward this proposal. I had hoped to work with the President in a bipartisan manner to resolve the Social Security issue. There are a number of us in the Senate who are willing to go forward in a bipartisan manner on this issue. For example, Senator KERREY, Senator BREAUX, Senator GRASSLEY, and I have introduced a comprehensive Social Security reform bill. I have been pleased with this bipartisan effort, at least in the Senate, but I have been extremely disappointed by the White House's continued partisan approach toward the Social Security problem and especially their most recent proposal, which is, to say the least, a sham proposal. My goal today is to make absolutely clear for my colleagues just why this proposal does not work. 
   This is not an easy task because it is a complicated and confusing issue, but it is something that must be done. Regrettably, I think the complicated and confusing nature of the proposal was intentionally created in that concept so the people would not understand it, so it would be confusing, and so that, therefore, by glossing over it with terms such as ``saving Social Security,'' they could attempt to hide the underlying documents and energy of it, which is to basically undermine Social Security. 
   Thus, it is vitally important that we all understand exactly what is at stake. So I am going to go back to basics and try to simplify this as much as I can. 
   In its simplest terms, the Social Security system has enough money to  pay benefits today but does not have enough money to pay the projected benefits in the future, beginning in the year 2014. That is the entire problem. 
   What will we do in the year 2014 under the current law? We will have to raise additional money through the income tax, through the general revenues of the Federal Government. The gap between benefits promised and the Social Security taxes will get bigger and bigger every year. It will be $200 billion annually by the year 2020 and $666 billion annually by the year 2030. Under the current law, we will simply keep raising revenues every year until the Federal Government has paid everything it owes to the Social Security system in the year 2034. 
   When we reach that point, we declare insolvency, the Government of the United States, and the benefits would have to be cut, and Social Security would basically go into a tailspin. These funding gaps are so large, it would be unfair to a future generation to wait until that time and do the drastic cuts in benefits or radical increases in taxes which would occur in order to pay for the system. That is why so many of us have been calling for a comprehensive reform, a reform that will begin now, when we have time to work on the system and to make it work. 
   What has the President proposed? The President has proposed that as part of any lockbox legislation we accompany the lockbox with a provision that will transfer interest payments to the Social Security system. It is vital that my colleagues understand two things: This proposal would do nothing, absolutely nothing, to fund the future Social Security benefit; in fact, it would undermine the Social Security system by giving the false assurance of improvement. Secondly, this proposal would formally commit tens of trillions of dollars in new income taxes, simply through some accounting sleight of hand. That means that future generations, our children, our grandchildren, would get a tax increase as a result of this President's proposal which would run into the trillions of dollars. 
   To understand why, let me first show my colleagues this quote from the President's budget of last year. It was tucked away on page 337 in the analytical perspective section. Some budget analyst must have experienced an attack of truth in budgeting and included the language. It is definitive.  
   Trust Fund balances are available to finance future benefit payments and other trust fund expenditures--but only in a bookkeeping sense.......They do not consist of real economic assets that can be drawn down in the future to fund benefits. Instead, they are claims on the Treasury that, when redeemed, will have to be financed by raising taxes, borrowing from the public, or reducing benefits or other expenditures. The existence of large trust fund balances, therefore, does not, by itself, have any impact on the Government's ability to pay benefits.  
   That last sentence is the clearest explanation of what the problem is. No matter how large the trust fund stated number is, it does nothing to pay down the benefits, if there are not assets to back it up which can be drawn on without raising taxes. 
   I hope every Member of Congress understands this. I hope the American people understand it. If we use our power to artificially inflate the balance of the trust, it does not do the beneficiaries one bit of good. If we decree that it is a $1 trillion or a $10 trillion or even a nothing number in the trust fund, it has exactly the same financial impact. It has no impact on the outyear benefit structure. So the President's proposal to credit the trust fund with the interest savings will have no impact at all on the structure of the system and the liability which the American taxpayer will have to pay to support the system in the outyears. 
   What it would do, however, is give a false impression that we have taken some substantive action. And that, of course, is the goal of this President--politics over substance. We already have a problem of understanding. Already the Social Security system's problems are papered over by the declaration 
   of actuarial solvency through the year 2034. This disguises the fact that the real problem for us and for the next generation begins in the year 2014. What the President is effectively saying is that we should now paper over the problem even further, that we should wait until the year 2050. 
   Earlier this year, the Comptroller of the United States, David Walker, testified before the Senate Finance Committee. He was speaking about the President's proposal of earlier this year, but his comments are equally valid regarding the most recent proposal he has put forward. He said:  
   ......it is important to note that the President's proposal does not alter the projected cash-flow imbalances in the Social Security program. Benefit costs and revenues currently associated with the program will not be affected by even one cent.  
   In other words, the proposal the President is putting forward has absolutely no impact on the ability to pay the benefits that are going to be required to be paid to maintain the Social Security system in the outyears. 
   Moreover, he went on to say: One of the risks of the proposal is that the additional years of financing may very well diminish the urgency to achieve meaningful changes in the program. That would not be in the overall best interest of the Nation. It would be tragic, indeed, if this proposal masked the urgency of the Social Security solvency problem and served to delay the much-needed action. 
   In other words, even though this proposal would not do anything for Social Security, it would make the representation to the public that we had. This would become a license for irresponsibility. It would break the faith of the Social Security beneficiaries by representing that the problem had been solved for another 50 years, even though we have taken absolutely no real action. 
   Here is a chart that shows the workings of the Social Security system in a simplified form and represents the problems we confront. On the left of the chart, we can see the projections under the current law. On the right-hand side of the chart, we can see projections under the President's proposal. There is absolutely no difference. The President's proposal has no effect on the problems of the system. Current law problems which caused the system to go into insolvency are going to exist in the same form if we follow the President's proposal. 
   The numbers are startling. We term it insolvent in the year 2040 because the cost is so high. Under the President's proposal, it is a $1.1 trillion increase in the year 2040 on the taxpayers of America, which, in my opinion, represents an insolvency event, if we follow the President's proposal. 
   What is the President's argument? He is arguing that his program provides for additional reduction in public debt and that we can justify these additional income tax liabilities by the fact that the public debt has been reduced and debt service has also been reduced. But, once again, the reality is different from the claim. If you study the Social Security actuary's memo in the President's plan written last Saturday, October 23, you would find the following information. I hope the press will pick up on this. Transfers are not contingent on actual amounts of reductions of debt held by the public. Transfers are assumed to be as indicated, regardless of the effect on the budget balances. 
   Now, it may well be the President will yet propose a way to require that only a reduction in public debt will trigger the transfers he has suggested, but that is not what his current proposal says. His current proposal only issues this new debt and these new liabilities and does not make them in any way contingent upon public debt being reduced. This is not a plan to reduce public debt. It is a plan to issue new debt. It creates new income tax obligations, regardless of what happens with the overall budget balance. It has nothing to do with straightening out the Social Security system by reducing public debt. It is simply an increase in income tax obligations as a result of an increase in debt obligations of the Federal Government. 
   One other point: The President believes it is appropriate to reward Social Security by giving it the interest savings from the reduced public debt. Current law already credits Social Security with interest, as if we had saved the surplus, whether we do or do not. This is current law. What the President is proposing is that we give a second round of transfers to the Social Security system. We are already crediting Social Security with interest saved. That is what produced the finding that the system is sound until the year 2034. 
   The President is simply proposing that we arbitrarily issue a second round of credit, not justified or contingent upon anything happening in public debt reduction, and increase the income tax obligations to the program. Remember, again, all the taxes the President is talking about pouring into this program as a result of this accounting process gimmickry are income taxes; they are not payroll taxes. 
   So we are shifting the burden, under the President's proposal, of the Social Security system from being a payroll tax system to being an income tax system, from going to a system where the people who receive the benefit under the retirement process and pay for it during their working lives are now receiving a benefit from the general revenue fund and the income tax fund versus the payroll tax fund. That is a huge change in the basic philosophy of the way we have supported the Social Security system. The President does this with his proposal, which is to create a new accounting mechanism. 
   So the practical effect of the President's proposal is to do absolutely nothing in the way of resolving the fundamental problems that confront Social Security. The practical effect of the President's proposal is to create an accounting gimmick that makes you feel as if you have done something. The practical effect of the President's proposal is to undermine the momentum for fundamental, fair, effective Social Security reform in exchange for a political statement that may get you through the next election but which is going to create major crises for the system in the outyears. 
   The President's proposal fails any form of accounting test. The President's proposal fails any form of a reasonable review. The President's proposal, most importantly, fails the next generation and the generation behind it because what it does is transfer onto their backs, for the sake of a political statement today, a tax burden that will amount to trillions of dollars. It is an action that is absolutely inappropriate and which I hope this Congress and the American people will reject. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join with my colleagues, many who are honoring John Chafee today. He was a proud New Englander and a person, in my opinion, who embodied the spirit of service which characterizes so many of his contemporaries and those who came before him, not only from his State but across the Nation, especially from New England. 
   He came out of a culture which always put public service first. To him, public service was the purpose of being an elected official. He had no other cause or commitment other than doing well by the people he represented and by his Nation. 
   There is a lot of identity I have shared with John Chafee, more in the sense of a father figure than as a comrade or a contemporary, during my years growing up. He went to Yale at about the same time my father went to Yale. Then he went to Harvard Law School about the same time my father went to Harvard Law School. He was elected Governor not too long after my father was elected Governor. So there was a parallel career path. 
   In my household in New Hampshire, the name John Chafee, although it came from the distant State of Rhode Island, echoed with great respect. It was a name that had attached to it an understanding that there was a leader who was committed to his Nation and who understood that to be a good leader, you had to be concerned for others first. He was a person who set a standard for all of us. 
   When I arrived at the Senate and I met Senator Chafee as a contemporary, so to speak, I had great anticipation because he was literally a very large figure for me as I grew up and a large figure within the New England community. I would not have been surprised had he been a person who just sort of smiled at a new Senator and said: Nice to have you here; we'll see you in a couple years when you get your feet on the ground. 
   No, that wasn't John Chafee's style. He reached out to me, as he reached out to so many Senators who had served with him, both new and those who served with him for a considerable period of time. He said: Join me; I have some ideas. Sit down with me and listen to them. I would like to hear your ideas. 
   He brought me into this council he had begun, the centrist group, and treated me as someone whose thoughts and concerns were equal to his and were of legitimate importance and significance. I greatly appreciated that, coming from someone with his senior status and great knowledge on issues such as health care. It was really an experience in how one builds consensus to deal with John Chafee at any time but especially during the first few years I served in this body. My respect for him only grew as I had the opportunity to serve with him over the years. 
   There was no issue he undertook that he did not undertake as a person committed to identifying and obtaining a thoughtful and substantive response to that issue. I never experienced at any time his addressing an issue in a partisan way or in a political way in the negative sense but always in a constructive way and in a manner in which he was looking towards resolution. He would take the most complex issues that this body had to address, issues such as Medicare, the general health care system, environmental laws, issues which created great fervor and intensity on both sides of the aisle. He would sit down and, through the force of his personality, which was one of generosity and intelligence, of sincerity and of commitment, sift through the issue and work with the parties and, more often than not, be able to reach a consensus position--an extraordinarily impressive individual. 
   His greatest strength, I think, was that he was just plain Yankee. He had a way about him that is personified by the Yankee mystique. It can be defined as being honest and committed, patriotic--of course, a lot of other people fall in that category, too--but there was also that willingness to be precise, curt, some may say, the willingness to cut through the large ferocity of this body to the essence of an issue quickly, and the understanding always that our purpose is to serve. His purpose above all was to serve the people of Rhode Island and the people of this Nation. 
   As with everyone else in this body, my heart goes out to Ginny and his family. We wish them, during this time of difficulty, Godspeed, and we are thankful for the time which we had with John as he showed us how to be a good citizen, a good legislator and, most importantly, a good American. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I bring to the floor the conference agreement for the Commerce, Justice, State, and judiciary appropriations for fiscal year 2000. 
   This conference agreement includes $39 billion for these and other related agencies. This is $2.8 billion above last year's level and $7.9 billion below the President's request. Also, it is $3.6 billion above the Senate level, which includes the additional funding requested for the census. 
   To start out with, I want to address the department that comprises almost half of the funding in this bill, the Department of Justice. We provide it with $18.5 billion. 
   Within Justice, we continue counterterrorism measures. A total of $152 million is directed to the counterterrorism program to bolster current counterterrorism initiatives. The conference agreement provides $14 million to the National Domestic Preparedness Consortium for their cooperative efforts. We put emphasis this year on equipment for first responders so that they have what is needed when they arrive first-on-the-scene of any terrorist attack. 
   We also remain concerned about attacks on computer systems, these being a primary target to sabotage.  The conferees agreed to $18.6 million for the National Infrastructure and Protection Center, through the FBI account, which serves as the central clearinghouse for threats and warnings or actual cyber-attacks on critical infrastructures. The FBI has field computer crime-intrusion squads and computer analysis and response teams to combat cyber crime and sabotage. 
   However, I remain concerned by the release of the FALN members by the President, and its effect on our overall counterterrorism policy. In the past few years, the Appropriations Committee has worked closely with all aspects of the law enforcement community to hammer out a united, comprehensive counterterrorism strategy. There has been marked improvement in understanding where we need to go to prevent and to be ready for terrorist incidents. The President's clemency agreement takes that understanding and drives a stake in it. The President chose to release members of a known terrorist organization, against the recommendation of the pardon attorney and the Federal Bureau of Investigations. 
   The FBI is one of the lead agencies on terrorism policy, and the President disregarded their opposition to the clemency agreement. The President's actions went against his own administration and congressional efforts to craft and implement a strong counterterrorism policy. 
   Ironically, his argument was that none of these individuals had been charged with murder. Terry Nicholas was not charged with murder, but 168 died in the Oklahoma City bombing. 
   Unfortunately, the President's actions have created a schism in our terrorist policy that may take years to overcome. 
   Moving to an area that is as horrifying as a terrorist attack, the conference agreement provides funding to address child abductions and missing children. We were able to retain the Senate's Missing Children program, which provides $19.9 million to help law enforcers find and care for missing children. We also fund the FBI's programs to prevent child sexual exploitation on the Internet. These efforts help solve investigations involving missing children by creating specialized cyber units whose purpose is to monitor and react to Internet pedophiles. The FBI works closely with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children to find the victims of these attacks and return them to their families. 
   To protect children in schools, the conference agreement recommends $225 million through the Safe Schools Initiative. The availability of these funds for schools, groups, 
   and law enforcement should encourage communities to work together to address the escalation of violence in schools throughout the Nation. 
   The conferees believe it is also important to encourage out-of-school prevention methods as well. One way to stop juvenile violence is to get young people involved in programs outside of school. The conference agreement includes the Senate number, $50 million, for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. It retains the Senate language regarding the use of the Internet in the clubs. Additionally, $13.5 is provided for Juvenile Mentoring Programs (JUMP), such as Big Brothers and Big Sisters and similar community programs that bring responsible adults together with children in a mentoring capacity. I believe prevention is preferable to punishment, and these programs can redirect the energies of high risk youth into positive activities. 
   The conference agreement provides over $537 million for juvenile programs through the juvenile justice budget and accountability incentive grants. 
   In an effort to combat another problem our society faces daily, the conference agreement supports counter drug efforts by the Justice Department. We provide DEA with $53.9 million for mobile enforcement teams and $17.4 million for regional drug enforcement teams. These teams have the flexibility to go to the hot spots in small cities and towns and provide an immediate, effective response to drug trafficking. They come in at the request of State and local law enforcement and work together to stop drug trafficking. 
   The agreement also includes $27.1 million for the DEA and $35.6 million for State and local enforcement efforts to end methamphetamine production and distribution. 
   Under my tenure as chairman, this committee has been supportive of the Violence Against Women Act Programs. The conference agreement includes the Senate level of $284 million. Within this level, $207 million is available for general formula grants to the States. Within those grants, $10 million will be available for programs on college campuses and $10 million for Safe Start programs. In addition, we retained the increase for court appointed special advocates and provide $10 million. 
   The Senate will be glad to hear we were able to bolster some accounts in conference that had been reduced this year in the Senate bill. The local law enforcement block grant was raised to last year's level of $523 million. 
   The conferees provide $30 million for police corps; $25 million for grants for bullet proof vests; and $40 million for the Indian country law enforcement initiative. 
   The State prison grants were increased above the Senate proposed level to $686.5 million, and $420 million was designated for SCAAP. 
   The last issue I want to address within the Justice Department is funding for law enforcement technology grants. As we approach the new millennium and provide funding for fiscal year 2000, it is important that we ensure that law enforcement is not behind in technology. The conference agreement includes funding of $250 million for law enforcement technology grants. These grants will be available for State and local law enforcement to acquire equipment and training to address criminal activities in our communities. 
   Moving to Commerce, the conferees recommend a level of $25.6 million for the United States Trade Representative. The International Trade Commission is funded at $44.5 million, and the International Trade Administration is funded at a level of $313.5 million. The funding level for the Bureau of Export Administration is $54 million. 
   The conferees provide full funding for the Bureau of the Census at a level of $4.8 billion. The decennial census is funded at the Administration's requested level. The Administration sent a budget amendment to Congress as the Senate's Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations measure was being reported to the Senate. Therefore, the committee was unable to incorporate this amendment in the original bill. A hearing was held on the administration's budget amendment in late July, and the conference report before us today contains all of the funds requested by the administration. 
   The funding for the National Telecommunications and Information Administration includes $26.5 million for the public broadcasting grant program and $15.5 million for information infrastructure grants. 
   The agreement funds the programs of the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) at a total of $639 million for fiscal year 2000. Of this amount, $283.1 million is for NIST's scientific and technical research and services programs. 
   NIST's external activities, the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) and Manufacturing Extension Program (MEP) are funded at the levels of $211 million, including carryover balances, and $104.8 million, respectively. 
   The agreement fund the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration programs at a level of $2.3 billion. This funding level will continue vital funding for oceanic and atmospheric research programs which have such strong support in the Senate.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Nickles amendment of which I am a cosponsor along with a number of other Members of the Senate. 
   This proposal addresses one of the underlying political debates we are confronting today in trying to reach conclusion on our entire budget, which is the manner in which we should handle Social Security surplus. It is a key element of how we can resolve this matter and resolve it in a way that fulfills at least the stated goals of the various parties. 
   We have heard the President say on a number of occasions he wants to protect the Social Security surplus and preserve it for Social Security. It has been our position, as the Republican membership of this Senate, that we should do exactly that. In fact, we have offered time and again something called a lockbox which would essentially guarantee all Social Security surplus be held independent of any other spending and would not be available for any other activities of the Government but, rather, be reserved for the purposes of paying down the debt and being retained in the Social Security trust fund as debt instruments. 
   Unfortunately, as we have moved down the road to address the operating budget of the Federal Government, it has been clear the administration wants to have it both ways: They want to say, on one side, protect the Social Security trust fund, and specifically the surplus which is now being generated by the Social Security accounts; but, on the other side, they want to propose a large amount of new spending which would inevitably lead to using up some portion of the surplus of the Social Security trust fund. 
   Senator NICKLES, other Members of this Senate, and I have 
   come forward with this proposal which is a sense of the Senate and therefore isn't binding. Hopefully at some point it will be put into binding language. It says under no circumstances will Social Security  trust fund dollars or the surplus now being generated by the Social Security taxes being paid be used to operate the general functions of the Federal Government, and that we should have a mechanism to guarantee what is known as a sequester which is a system of saying, if ever we should spend a dollar or it is looking as if we are about to spend a dollar of Social Security surplus funds, there will be a sequester in spending of the general fund, the general operating accounts of the Federal Government, the discretionary accounts of the Federal Government, the ``sequester'' meaning those accounts would be reduced to the extent necessary in order to be sure no Social Security surplus funds would be used. 
   This, of course, is the proper way to proceed because it sets in place a mechanism which makes it clear, and which makes it absolutely a sure thing, that there will be not an invasion of Social Security surplus funds. 
   To step back a second, let's understand what the Social Security surplus funds are. We all pay Social Security taxes on our earnings. They are called FICA taxes. Those taxes go into what is known as the Social Security trust fund. That trust fund is used to pay for the operation of the Social Security system. 
   The Social Security system for many years ran a deficit where the taxes being raised were not enough to support the money being paid to support the benefits, or it was about to run a deficit. Therefore, we changed the tax law and we changed the structure of the benefits back in 1983 so the system was put into a solvent situation. 
   As the baby boom generation grew in its earning capacity and the older generations preceding, the World War II generations, retired, we found the earning capacity of the baby boom generation was so great it was generating a huge surplus. In other words, there was more money going into the Social Security trust fund than was needed to support the people on Social Security. 
   For a number of years, because the operating accounts of the Federal Government, the day-to-day operation accounts independent of Social Security, were running a deficit, the Social Security trust fund was borrowed from to mask the deficit of the operating accounts of the Federal Government. We ended up with the Federal Government day-to-day operations, whether defense, education, or social services, being supported by the Social Security taxes which were being paid into the Social Security trust fund. 
   With the occurrence of the good economy and a strict fiscal discipline put in place by this Republican Congress, we now are in a position where we are running what is known as a real surplus. In other words, the amount of money we are taking in in order to operate the Federal Government in its day-to-day activities is about the same, and it is starting to grow to the point where it is actually exceeding the amount of money necessary to operate the Federal Government. So things such as education, defense, and general social services can be paid for by the general revenues of the Federal Government. It is no longer necessary for us to invade the Social Security trust fund in any way to operate the Federal Government. 
   Yet there is still some pressure, because there is this surplus running up in the Social Security trust fund, to say we can spend a little more on the operations side of the Federal Government--a little more for defense, a little more for education. All we have to do is take it out of the Social Security trust fund to pay for it. 
   That is what this debate is about; there are many of us who believe that is not the proper way to do it. The money that goes into the Social Security trust fund should be reserved for the purposes of preserving and protecting Social Security. Some of us have even gone so far as to put forward major pieces of legislation, bipartisan in nature, which would structure a program to make the Social Security system solvent not only for today but for the next hundred years. 
   In fact, there is a bill that would do exactly that which I cosponsor with Senator BREAUX, Senator GRASSLEY, and a number of other Members, Senator KERREY, BOB KERREY from Nebraska. It would make the Social Security system solvent for years. It would use this surplus in the Social Security trust fund to accomplish that solvency. 
   That is really another story. But it points out it is important the Social Security surplus is preserved for Social Security, the preservation of Social Security, and it is not used to operate the general government. 
   In order to keep Social Security solvent, in order to keep the surplus from the day-to-day operation of the Federal Government, we have put forward this sense of the Senate. As I mentioned, what the sense of the Senate essentially says is, if it occurs that the day-to-day operation of the Federal Government--for national defense, for education, for general social activities--should exceed the operating income of the general government--income taxes, business taxes, various excise taxes we receive--if it should exceed those incomes, then rather than go into the Social Security trust fund to pay for that deficit, we will reduce the spending of the Federal Government to the point where the incomes of the Federal Government meet the expenses of the Federal Government on the operating side of the ledger and the Social Security surplus will, therefore, be kept protected and preserved for the purpose, I hope, of putting in place a large, comprehensive plan I just described to you, that Senators BREAUX, KERREY, and GRASSLEY, and I have introduced. 
   This proposal is a sense of the Senate. It is not even actually a legislative event. I hope someday it will be. But this legislation simply states that the Senate is not going to tolerate the invasion of the Social Security trust fund for purposes of operating the day-to-day functioning of the Government of the United States; that we are going to 
   expect the Government of the United States to meet its day-to-day operating expenses from the traditional resources that are available to it for operations and not from the income that comes from those people who are paying Social Security taxes. 
   Rather than just making that as a statement, we are also taking it a step further, saying we shall create a sequester mechanism whereby there will be an actual reduction in spending on the day-to-day operations side of the account should there ever occur a situation where the Social Security trust fund was going to be used in order to pay for day-to-day operations. Thus, we create this clear, enforceable protection for Social Security and for our Social Security trust fund. 
   It is a very simple idea. It is a very appropriate idea. Most important, it is an idea that is absolutely consistent with everything we have heard from the White House and from the other side of the aisle as it has put forward its concepts of how we should protect and preserve the Social Security trust fund. Essentially, Senator NICKLES, I, and the other Senators who support this legislation, most of whom I guess are Republican, are really doing the work of the administration. 
   We know, for that reason, we are going to be supported both by the administration and Democratic Members of the Senate.

    Mr. GREGG. 
   Mr. President, today I am joined with Senator HAGEL in introducing a bill to allow States and schools districts to switch Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education from a school-based to a child-based program. 
   We will soon take up the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The centerpiece of which is Title I which was created in 1965 to provide extra educational assistance to low-income students. Since its inception, Title I has grown into the largest federal education program for elementary and secondary school students with funding, in this year alone, at $7.7 billion. 
   Unfortunately, after more than 30 years and expenditures of $118 billion, national evaluations indicate that Title I has failed to achieve its primary aim of reducing the achievement gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students. 
   Reading scores in 1998 showed that only 6 States made progress in narrowing the gap between White and African American students and just 3 made progress narrowing the gap between White and Hispanic students. While the gap actually grew in 16 States. In math, nine year olds in high poverty schools remain 2 grade levels behind students in low-poverty schools. 
   In reading, nine year old students in high poverty schools remain 3 to 4 grade levels behind students in low poverty schools. Seventy percent of children in high poverty schools score below even the most basic level of reading. Two out of every three African American and Hispanic 4th graders can barely read. 
   It is time to take a fresh look at this important program to ensure that our neediest students are receiving the services they need. We must provide enough flexibility in Title I for students to receive high quality supplemental educational services, wherever those services are offered. 
   In order to enable needy students to access high quality supplemental services, States and school districts should be given the opportunity to transform Title I from a school-based program to a child-centered program. Which is exactly what my bill does. Let me explain. 
   Currently, Title I dollars are sent to States, then distributed to school districts, and ultimately to schools--this is known as a school-based program. Aid goes to the school, rather than directly to the eligible child. 
   This process of sending dollars to districts and schools rather than students has a serious unintended consequence--millions of eligible children never receive the educational services promised to them by this program. 
   To make matters worse, even schools which have been identified by their States and communities as chronic poor performers continue to receive Title I dollars, despite that fact that well over one-third of eligible children (about 4 million children) receive no services. 
   Today, 4 million children generate Title I revenue for their school district, but never receive Title I services; despite the fact that the school district received federal funds to provide supplemental educational services to those very children. 
   We should not continue the practice of sustaining failed schools at the expense of our nation's children. 
   The very serious problem of under serving our neediest students can be alleviated by giving States and school districts the ability to focus their efforts by directly serving Title I eligible students through a child-centered program. 
   This bill permits interested States and school districts to use Title I dollars to create a child-centered program. 
   Here is how it would work. Interested states and school districts could use their Title I dollars to establish a per pupil amount for each eligible child--any child between the ages of 5-17 from a family at or below the poverty line. The per pupil amount would then follow the child to the school they attend. The per pupil amount would be used to provide supplemental educational (``add-on'' or ``extra'') services to meet the individual educational needs of children participating in the program. 
   Since some schools continue to fail to provide high quality educational services to their neediest students, students could use their per-pupil amount to receive supplemental educational (``add-on'') services from either their school or a tutorial assistance provider, be that a Sylvan learning center, a charter school or a private school. The idea behind this provision is to allow parents to use their per-pupil amount to purchase extra tutorial assistance for before or after school. 
   There are numerous benefits to turning Title I into a child-centered program. It increases the number of disadvantaged children served by Title I. It ensures that federal dollars generated by a particular student actually  benefit that student. It rewards good schools and penalizes failing schools, as children would have the option to go the schools that best meet their needs and take their Title I money with them. A child-centered program decreases the practice of financially rewarding schools that consistently fail to provide a high quality education to their students. And, it ensures that students who are stuck in a bad school have access to educational services outside the school, by permitting parents to use their child's per-pupil allotment for tutorial assistance. 
   In short, this bill creates a much-needed market for change in that it gives families the ability to take their federal dollars out of a school that is not using them effectively and purchase services somewhere else. Families are empowered and schools are compelled to improve in order to keep their students. 
   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill. Turning Title I into a child-centered program puts Title I back on the right track, focusing on what is best for the child first and foremost.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments made by the Senator from Pennsylvania, who has worked so hard to bring this bill to the floor. The bill has been so distorted in its presentation from the other side for the last hour and a half, and the Senator from Pennsylvania, in fairly quick terms, disposed of that distortion. But let me reinforce the point that was made. 
   There is $1.2 billion in this bill for teachers--teacher activity. It is not an authorized program in the bill because this is an Appropriations Committee, and it doesn't authorize. 
   I find it a bit unique to hear the ranking member of the authorizing committee come to the floor and say that he wanted it as an authorization on this appropriations bill when 2 weeks ago--or 5 weeks ago now--we passed an amendment in this body which said we weren't going to authorize on appropriations bills. 
   So the chairman of this subcommittee has appropriately put the money in for teacher assistance--$1.2 billion. And he has not authorized, which is the proper way to proceed. 
   On the issue of class size itself, there are disagreements. Time and again, we heard in the speeches from the other side how they were going to tell the local school districts how to run their business. There is no longer any sugar-coating of this issue. The fact is that the proposal from the other side of the aisle, which originated with the White House, is a proposal specifically directed at telling local school districts how to run their local school districts. We heard terms such as: How can we pass the language in the appropriations bills when there are no strings attached? The Member from the other side said that. How are we going to know it works if we don't put strings on? 
   Yesterday, in the committee, the junior Senator from Washington, Mrs. MURRAY, stated as a metaphor: Well, this is like a parent who gives a child an allowance. If you do not tell the child how to spend that allowance, how are you going to know how the child spends it? She might go out and buy candy instead of buying school lunches. That was the metaphor used in committee yesterday. 
   I point out that the Federal Government is not the parent of the local school districts. The parent in this instance happens to be the parent of the kids. They are the parents. They are the ones who should be making the decision as to how the money gets spent. We are not the parents. 
   We are not the local parents for every school district in the country, although that happens to be the view of the Democratic minority in this House and the White House. They are the great fathers from Washington who come down into the school districts, and say: Oh, school districts. Give us your money so we can take it to Washington, and, by the way, spread a little bit of it out among the bureaucracy in Washington. And then we will send you back some percentage of your money--maybe 85 cents on the dollar, if you are lucky--and then we will tell you how to spend the money. That is the theory that comes from the other side of the aisle. 
   This class size proposal is the ultimate example of that because where do they get the money for the class size proposal? They took it out of special education dollars, which essentially meant that local money which was supposed to be used for local decisions--whether it was to add a new teacher for a school or 
   to add a new wing to the school or to add a new computer program to the school--that local money was lost because it had to go to support special education needs which were supposed to be supported by the Federal Government, while the Federal Government came and took the special education money and put it into a classroom program and said: Here, school district. In order to get your money, you have to take our program as it is presented to you, and in no other way. You must accept a class size program in order to get your money back, money which you were supposed to be getting to begin with to help you with special education dollars, for example. 
   The whole theory of this class size proposal, as it comes from the White House and on the other side of the aisle, is flawed because it essentially is the theory that says Washington knows best. You either do what Washington says or else you are not going to get your money back from Washington--your hard-earned dollars you sent here. 
   We, however, take a different approach on this. We suggest that when you send money to Washington--unfortunately it still goes through bureaucracy--when you get it back, especially in the area of education, the teachers, the parents, the principals, and the local school districts know best how to spend it. 
   Yes, we are going to put in some very broad parameters that basically go to quality. But we are not going to exactly tell you that you must hire a new teacher. Rather, we have proposals such as the TEA bill, which passed the House, which I hope will pass here, which says for this money--$1.2 billion--if you want to hire a new teacher, fine, but if you want to train your present teachers to be better math teachers, you can do that, too. Or, for example, if you have a really good teacher, maybe in the sciences, and a lot of pressure is being put on that teacher to move out of the classroom and into the private sector because they can make so much more, you can  use the money to give that teacher some sort of bonus in order to keep them in the classroom where they are doing such good. 
   Give the local communities flexibility. Let's give some credibility to the idea that the teacher, the principal, and the parent actually know what is best for the kid; that maybe the President does not know what is best for every classroom in America; that maybe the Department of Education does not know what is best for every classroom in America. Maybe it is the people in the classroom and the parents, who have a huge interest in what is happening in this classroom, who know a little bit more about what is happening in that classroom and what the adequate allocation of resources should be. 
   Our proposal is that we put this $1.2 billion in the context of flexibility. Make it applicable to teachers, make it available for teacher activity, but do not say you must hire a teacher. 
   Remember that this is not a debate over money, although some will try to characterize it that way. In fact, this bill brought forward by the Senator from Pennsylvania exceeds the President's request in education by almost $.5 billion. 
   In this account--the issue of the teachers account--the money is the exact same. What the President asked for and what we have in this bill is $1.2 billion. 
   It is not an issue of money. It is an issue of power and who controls the dollars and who makes the decision over how those dollars are spent. We happen to think the parent, the 
   teacher, the principal, and the school district should have the power. The other side thinks they should have the power--specifically right here in this Chamber, with no strings. They have to have strings attached--from that desk right over there; that desk three rows up and two desks over--running from that desk out to every school district in the country; thousands of strings all over the country running out of that desk telling Americans how to spend that money and how to control the classroom. Then we are going to reel in those strings. And when we find at the end of the string that somebody did something we don't like, somebody from that desk three rows up and two desks over will say: You are not educating your kids correctly, and we know how to do it better. So we are going to take your money away. Here, we are cutting this string right here. 
   That is not right. Let's send the money out to the schools. Let's let the parents make the decisions. Let's let the teachers make the decisions. Let's let the principal make the decisions within the context of requiring quality. 
   While we are on the subject, let's talk a little bit about this mythology--that is what it is, mythology--that class size isn't the issue. This has been polled. That is the reason this is being put forward. This is a polling event. It has nothing to do with the substance of the studies that have been done on the education. 
   They keep quoting the STAR study out in Tennessee. The STAR study has been reviewed by a lot of other studies, including the STAR study itself. The conclusion has been that it isn't so much class size that is important, but it is quality of the teacher that is important. One of the conclusions in the Tennessee study was that if you had first-class teachers for 2 or 3 years, then those students' ability to do the work was improved dramatically. It not only was improved dramatically for the years they had first-class teachers, but it carried forward for 3 or 4 years after they got a really good teacher. That ability of that student went up. It wasn't size of classrooms so much as quality of teachers. 
   That is what our proposal does, the TEA proposal that goes to the issue of quality teachers and trying to keep quality teachers in the classroom, and letting the local school districts decide who is the quality teacher and who isn't. 
   It does no good to put a child in a classroom--whether it is 18-to-1, 15-to-1, 10-to-1 or 25-to-1--if that kid is being taught by a teacher who does not know anything about the subject they are teaching or who is an incompetent teacher. 
   It simply doesn't do any good. The child doesn't learn anything because the teacher doesn't know the subject or the child isn't able to communicate with the teacher because the teacher doesn't have the ability to communicate effectively with children. 
   Class size is not the critical function. It is whether or not that teacher knows the subject and knows how to communicate it and deal with the children. That has been the conclusion of study after study. If we are citing studies, there was an excellent study done by the University of Rochester which has led the subject for years. They looked at over 300 other studies on the question of class size and teacher quality. The first conclusion of that study by Professor Hanushek was that class size reduction has not worked. The second conclusion was that Project STAR in Tennessee does not support overall reduction in class size except perhaps in kindergarten. Remember, this study looked at 300 other studies. Third, the quality of teacher is much more important than the size of the classroom. 
   That study is not unique. He looked at 300 different studies. 
   In the State of Washington, there was also a study which came to the exact, same conclusion. In my own State of New Hampshire we did a study. The New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies did the same study and came to the same conclusion. A study in Boston dealt with a charter school and found the same. Studies have been done. The evidence is absolutely clear. It is not size of the classroom; it is quality of teacher. 
   Yes, size may play a marginal function. So we may ask, isn't it obvious size has an impact? We all can agree that size has a small impact but size has been addressed in most States. The President's initiative said we had to have an 18-1 ratio in class size. That is what his goal was. Maybe Members haven't been out of Washington to look at the school systems; maybe they are getting their information from the Education Department or their teacher union friends. But the fact is 42 States have an 18-1 ratio in class size; 42 States already meet the class size requirements. What those 42 States need is a better effort in producing high-quality teachers. What we have in this country is a severe lack of well-trained teachers, teachers in the classroom who are not capable and not doing the job in core disciplines and in areas of education communication. That is where we need help. That is where our teachers need help. 
   More than 25 percent of the new teachers entering our schools are poorly qualified to teach; 1 out of every 4. Mr. President, 12 percent of the teachers entered without any prior classroom experience; 14 percent of the teachers entered our Nation's schools having not fully met the State standards. In Massachusetts alone, 59 percent of the incoming teachers failed the basic licensing exam; 96 percent of those who retook the exam failed again. 
   The issue is not numbers in the classroom. The issue is quality of the teacher, how to get a good teacher into the classroom. This is especially true in mathematics and science where we have a dearth of the talent we need because the teachers are not being adequately trained and science moves so quickly they can't stay up with the science. Forty percent of the math teachers in this country do not have a major or a minor in the field in which they teach. 
   Tell me how it will help a student to be in a classroom 
   with a teacher who has not had algebra, who has no major in algebra, maybe didn't even take algebra? How does it help a student, whether there are 10, 15, or 20 students in the classroom, if the teacher doesn't understand the subject matter? Clearly, we are not going to help the student no matter how many kids are in the class. 
   The issue is not class size. The statistics prove it is not class size. Studies show it is not class size. Even the Tennessee study referred to by the Senator from Massachusetts shows it is not class size. The issue is quality. Yet the President's program and the program of the junior Senator from Washington says to the States: States must reach this ratio, and if they don't reach this ratio, we will take your money away to some other account. And you must hire a teacher to get your money back--the money you sent to begin with. 
   We say that is foolish. It is intuitive. It is obvious if you have a school district with parents involved, teachers involved, principals, and school boards  involved, they will know whether they need another teacher or they will know whether they need another classroom or they will know whether they need another computer science lab or they will know whether they have to send some of their teachers to educational classes that might help them in their capacity to handle certain subjects, or they will know if they have a teacher about to leave whom they think is good and they want to teach. The local school district will know these things. These people are not out there committing their lives to education in order to bring down education. These people are well-intentioned, well-purposed, well-meaning, sincere, hard-working individuals who work in our schools. Yet we treat them, as the Senator from Washington described yesterday in committee, as if they were children getting an allowance. 
   It is insulting to them, No. 1. No. 2, it doesn't work. Obviously, these folks who are running our schools should be given the flexibility to make the decisions within certain parameters so they can do what they think is best for the school district. The parameters we laid out are quality parameters set not by the Federal Government but set by the States. We say: State, you can have this money, but you have to meet certain quality standards and you set those quality standards and test for the quality standards. When you fail to meet the quality standards, you have to take action to correct it. If you don't correct it, then action can be taken by the Federal Government, but not until the local community has had a chance to meet its decisions in the context as to what it sees as its problems. That is a much more logical approach to all of this. 
   I know the Senator from Arkansas is one of the leaders on this subject and wants to speak. I could go on for quite a while because I find the arguments on the other side to be so outrageous and so arrogant in their viewpoint which is: We know best for school districts of America. We know best because we happen to be elected to the Senate or elected President of the United States. We know what is best at the local school districts. 
   That is outrageous. This is not about money. The money is in the bill, $1.2 billion. It is there. The Senator from Pennsylvania has been extremely aggressive in funding education. We have on all sorts of accounts exceeded what the President requested. This is about power and the fact there are interest 
   groups in Washington, specifically major labor unions and the education bureaucracy, who want to control the curriculum and the school activities and the educational structure of our elementary schools across this country. They don't want to give up that control. Every time they create a new program, it is directed at control from Washington, telling the local districts how to spend their money. That is what it is about. 
   We put forth proposals which are aggressively funded which do the opposite: We empower the parent; we empower the teacher; we empower the principal; we empower the local school district. That is the way it should be done and that is the way we improve education. 
   This is a debate which I enjoy engaging in because I believe it is fairly obvious that proposals from the other side are misdirected and do little to improve education--maybe a lot to improve the power of the local unions, the national unions, and the national education lobby, but they do nothing for local education, whereas our proposal does a great deal to help the local school districts help their kids get a better life, a better education. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this is a second-degree amendment to the amendment offered by the Senator from California. What this amendment says is, rather than taking the $200 million, which is new money, brand new money, to be advance funded into next year, and therefore it would be a credit against the 2001 budget--rather than taking that money and putting it into a program which the Senator from Pennsylvania has already increased by $200 million, and which has been aggressively funded, before we start out with an additional doubling of that amount, $200 million, that we begin the process of fulfilling our commitment to the special ed funds. 
   As I have said almost ad nauseam now on this floor, the Federal Government agreed to fund special education, when the bill was originally passed, at 40 percent of the cost of special ed. Unfortunately, as of about 4 years ago, the percentage of the cost of special ed which the Federal Government paid was only 6 percent. Over the last 3 years, as a result of the efforts of the Senator from Pennsylvania, the majority leader, and a number of other Senators, that funding has increased dramatically. In fact, the funding for special education in this bill is up by almost $700 million over the last 4 years. If you include this bill, the funding will be up more than 100 percent over that time period. 
   But there is still a huge gap between what the Federal Government committed to do in the area of special education and what we are presently doing. Thus, before we begin down the road of a dramatic increase on top of another dramatic increase in funding for the afterschool programs, recognizing there is already $200 million in this bill for afterschool programs, an extremely generous commitment made by the Senator from Pennsylvania and by the majority party, I believe we should take any additional funds that are going to go on top of that $200 million and put them into the special ed accounts, which is where the local schools really need the support. 
   It may be when the local school districts get this additional $200 million for special ed, which will free up $200 million at the local district, that the local school district may make the decision with their freed up money, which was local tax dollars, to do an afterschool program. That may be very well what they decide to do with that. They also may decide to add a new teacher so they can address the class size issue. Or they may decide to put in a computer lab. Or they may decide to put in a foreign language program. Or they may decide to buy books for the library. But it will be the local school district which will have that flexibility, because they will have had the Federal Government at least add $200 million more into the effort to fulfill the Federal Government's role in special ed. 
   This is a very important issue. It is one which I have talked about, as I said, innumerable times on this floor and raise again with this second-degree amendment. I think the issue is prioritization. 
   If we are going to start throwing money or putting a great deal of additional money into the Federal effort in education, my view is the first effort, the first priority is that we fulfill the obligations and commitments which are already on the books which the Federal Government has made to the local school districts. The biggest commitment we made to the local school districts which we presently do not fund is the commitment in special education. 
   One can go to almost any school district in this country and ask them what the biggest problem is they have in the Federal Government's role in education, and they will tell you the Federal Government refuses to fund its fair share of the cost of the special education child. 
   The effect of that, of course, is we pit the special education child against parents of children who do not have special education children in an unfair way. It has disadvantaged the parents and the special ed child because they are now competing for local resources which should be used for general education activities because those local resources have to be used to replace the Federal obligation which is not being fulfilled. 
   This amendment is very simple. It says before we start another $200 million on top of $200 million for a new program, a program which is aggressively funded already under this bill, let's do what we have already put on the books as our commitment, which is fund special ed with any additional money. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to say a few words about a good friend of mine upon his retirement. 
   I have known Dominick Giovinazzo, the retiring Executive Director of the Greater Nashua, NH, Boys and Girls Club, for many, many years. During that time, I have regarded him as one of the finest people I know. For the past 28 years, he has worked at the Greater Nashua Club and has dedicated himself to serving the kids who are members there. He is a passionate advocate of child safety and has worked to ensure that no child in the city of Nashua has to spend his or her afternoons and weekends on the streets or doing drugs. He has become an advisor and mentor to the staff of all of the New Hampshire Clubs; his wisdom and experience have guided each Boys and Girls Club in the State to become strong pillars of their communities. Most importantly, he has been a good friend to his own community and to his fellow public servants. Over the years, I have appreciated his friendship, support, and guidance. I can only hope that others will follow his example of charity and dedication. 
   Rarely does one come across another human being who so fully dedicates himself to a life of helping others. It was Dominick who brought the importance and success of the Boys and Girls Clubs to my attention many years ago. And it was because of his tireless advocacy for the Clubs that I have worked so hard to ensure that the federal government helps fund the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. Dominick showed me the importance of giving our youth a safe place to go and dependable, responsible friends to lean on. 
   No other person so richly deserves an easy retirement than Dominick Giovinazzo. I wish him luck in his future endeavors, and I am sure that he will never stop caring about and lending his talents and civic-minded wisdom to his community. He is a valuable resource who I know the City of Nashua, the Greater Nashua Boys and Girls Club, and his other friends and admirers will rely on for years to come.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I may consume. 
   I think, going forward with this debate, there ought to be some facts pointed out for clarification because the resolution of the Democratic leader and the representations of the Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Illinois are not consistent with the facts, as they are presently in existence and on the ground. 
   Specifically, the Republican budget included a dramatic increase for education, and the mark for education under the Labor-HHS bill, which is being marked up this evening, represents a $2.2 billion increase over last year; no reduction, a $2.2 billion increase. 
   Let me go through a few of these programs that have been represented by the other side as being reduced. That is misinformation. It is inaccurate, and it is really inappropriate, that the Democratic leader would bring to the floor of the Senate a resolution which is so totally and grossly inaccurate. 
   In the area of Pell grants, the committee will be marking up a bill which has a $74 million increase over last year's funding; that represents a number of $7.7 billion. In the area of IDEA, the committee will be marking up a bill which has a $701 million increase over last year's funding; that represents a number of $5.8 billion. In the area of IDEA part B, the committee will be marking up a bill which has a committee increase over last year's funding of $678 million, a total budget of $4.8 billion. In the area of the TRIO Program, the committee will be marking up a budget which has a $30 million increase over last year's spending, $630 million. 
   In the area of title I, the committee will be marking up a budget which has a $324 million increase over last year's budget, a number of $8.7 billion for title I. In the area of the safe and drug-free schools, the committee will be marking up a budget which has an increase of $45 million over last year, a total number $611 million. In the area of Head Start, the committee will be marking up a budget which has a $608 million increase over last year, total budget of $5.2 billion. 
   In the area of afterschool programs, the committee will be marking up a budget which has a $200 million increase over last year. When you add these increases up, we are significantly above the administration request. 
   For example, in the Pell grant area, we are $315 million over the administration request. In the IDEA area, we are $375 million over the administration's request. In the IDEA part B area,  we are $675 million over the administration's request. In the title I area, we are $16 million over the administration's request. In the safe and drug-free schools area, we are $20 million over the administration's request. 
   The simple fact is, the representations put forward in this resolution by the Democratic leader are absolutely inaccurate. It is inappropriate that this has not been amended to reflect the markup vehicle which is going forward in the Senate. Maybe the Democratic leader thinks he represents the House of 
   Representatives, not the Senate. In the Senate, these are the numbers we are working from, dramatic increases in funding and a commitment to programs we think are working. 
   Yes, there are significant differences on priorities. As both the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from Massachusetts have said, their priorities are different than our priorities. That is true. There is a different philosophy of government, a different philosophy of approach to education. 
   We happen to believe parents should be empowered. We happen to believe teachers should be empowered. We happen to believe principals should be empowered. We happen to believe local school boards should be empowered to make decisions as to how they operate their schools and where they will put their scarce and valuable resources. 
   The other side of the aisle happens to think they have the best ideas in the world, that all the good ideas come from the national labor unions and from the Department of Education and from the administration; that, therefore, there should be developed a set of categorical grants which will tell the parents, the teacher, and the principal exactly how they will run their local school because Washington absolutely knows better how to do it than the local parents, the teacher, or the school. 
   Well, there is the difference. No question about it. The other side wants to set up a categorical program in the area of buildings, in the area of afterschool programs, in the area of teacher ratio. What we want to do is say to the local school district, to the parents, to the teacher, and to the principal: Here are the dollars. We tell you you must set a standard of education which is an excellence standard, a standard which requires that the children in your school meet the basic elements of education--math, reading, and writing. You have to have those standards. But within the context of meeting those standards, which standards shall be set at the State, not by us in Washington--we don't believe in national tests because we don't happen to think people here in Washington should write the tests; we think people in the States should write the tests--once those standards are set at the local school district by the States, then we say to the States, local school districts, parents, and teachers: You make the decision on where the dollars should be. Should they be in a new classroom or with an additional teacher, or maybe there are some schools out there that happen to want another computer, that happen to want to have another French teacher, that want to have another math teacher, or maybe they want to send their kids to some special program. Maybe they have some new concept of education they think is going to work better. 
   Leave it to the local school district to make that decision. Leave it to the parent to make that decision. Leave it to the principal and the teacher to make that decision. Let us not make those decisions in Washington. 
   Yes, there are priority differences. Our priority is to empower the parent, the teacher, and the principal. Their priority is to empower the national labor unions, the Department of Education, and the great thinkers in Washington who have the answers to everything on every subject and especially on the issue of education. 
   We have, in the proposals we will be putting forward, specific programs which do empower parents, which give parents a chance to do something when their kids are in schools that fail. It is an outrage that in this Nation we have 5,000 high schools and elementary schools combined that are failing schools, by the standards set by the people who run those schools. If you have your kids in those schools, what is your option? You don't have an option. Your kid is stuck in that school. 
   Parents ought to have an option. If their children are in a school that has failed year after year after year after year to teach those children how to write, how to read, how to think, parents shouldn't have to be subjected to sending their kids to those schools. They should have the opportunity to say to that school: OK, we are going to give you 2 years to clean up your act--which is exactly what our proposal does--on your standards. We are not setting the standards. We will not set a bar so high that nobody can reach it. You get to set the standards--you, the State; you, the community. 
   If that school doesn't meet those standards--and I suspect those standards are going to be reasonably stringent; at least they are in New Hampshire--so that an elementary school, once again, for 2 years in a row fails, then we basically put that school on probation. We say to the State: You have to go into that school and you have to straighten it out. You have 2 years to do that. You have 2 years to get those kids an education, which is what the goal is, obviously. 
   If after 2 more years that school still doesn't cut it, then we say to the parents of the kids who are going to be subjected to this horrendous school: It is up to you. You make the decision as to whether you want your son or daughter to go to that school. If you decide you want your son or daughter to go to another public school or to another program that involves afterschool activities and you are a low-income person, we are going to let the funds go with your child. 
   We are going to let the funds follow your child rather than have that school absorb all these funds that will do nothing for you in the way of educating your children. That is a difference of opinion. They want to run the failed schools, keep sending money to the failed schools, and they want to build more failing schools. 
   We say if a school is failing, let's get it under control and make it work; if it doesn't work, let's give the parents some options. We also say: Listen, we have all these categorical programs that almost tell teachers how many pencils they can have in their classrooms. Let's stop that and take a bunch of these categorical programs and put them into a basket of money, and after setting the standards--again, the standards are set by the State, not by us--after setting the standards, say to the local school districts: You can use this basket of money to try to help your kids make the standards. It is called ``straight A's.'' Every school district in this country is for it. The only people against it are the big labor unions in Washington and the Department of Education because they don't want to give up the categorical programs. Why? Because there is political power in those programs. This isn't about education; this is about power, about controlling dollars for the sake of power. 
   We are talking about getting money out to the parents; they are talking about empowering a bunch of people in Washington who happen to be affluent in their field or effectively are elitists, in my opinion. So, yes, there are differences of philosophy. But on the facts, this resolution carries no weight because it is totally inaccurate on the facts. It should be amended because every one of these cuts it lists is not a cut at all. 
   While we are on the subject of cuts, who does make the most significant cut at the Federal level? Is it the Republicans? No, it is not. It is the President's budget, sent up here without any increase in spending for the IDEA program, the special ed program. Let's talk about that a little bit because there is a difference in priorities. Special ed is a very important part of education, a good idea put together back in 1976 under 74-142 or 76-142--I am not sure which; there are so many numbers floating around. But it said, if you have a special needs child, that child has the right to a good education in the educational system, and the Federal Government knows it is going to cost a lot to educate that child, so the Government will pay for 40 percent of the cost of that child's education. 
   What happened? While the Democrats controlled this Congress, year in and year out, that 40-percent number went right down like a roller coaster going down a big hill. The Federal Government's share of education was down to  6 percent when the Republicans took control of the Senate and the House. We recognized that was wrong. What happens when we don't pay the special needs cost is the dollars flow from the local community, who takes over the Federal responsibility, and then the local community no longer has flexibility over the local dollars because they are paying for what the Federal Government was supposed to do in the first place.

However, the Republican Senate and Congress have increased IDEA funding by over 85 percent and, after this year, there will be up to about a 110-percent increase in it over the baseline with which we started.

   Mr. GREGG. The Senator from Maine has been a leader on education issues, also, especially IDEA. 
   To complete my thought on that issue, the President sent up a budget which had no increase in IDEA. He took the money from the special ed kids and he started these new categorical programs--buildings, afterschool, teachers. That money should have gone to special ed to fulfill the obligation of the 40 percent we said we were going to pay in the first place. But, no, he took the money from the IDEA program and put it into the categorical programs, which had the double, insidious effect of making the local governments have to now support the Federal programs, so they lose their local schools. They could have built schools if they wanted to build schools or added teachers or done whatever they wanted to. Now they don't have the dollars because they are supporting IDEA. 
   On top of that, he says to the local school districts: I have taken your dollars for special ed, which we were supposed to pay you to begin with, and I put them in categorical programs; to get the dollars, you have to do what I tell you to do--build a school, or add a teacher, or you have to do an afterschool program. The local school district may not want to do that; they may want to do something else, such as a new French program, or a new computer system. They may want to add to the football team, or put in an arts department. But they can't do it because the money they were going to have to do that with is being spent to do the Federal end of the special ed funds. Now the money that is supposed to come in for that is coming into a categorical grant. 
   It is all about power and who is going to run the education system. Is it going to be run in Washington by labor union leaders and bureaucrats, or is it going to be run by the teachers, parents, and the principals? That is what this debate is about; it is not about money. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking the leaders for their courtesy and thanking the Senator from Massachusetts for his courtesy. I want to respond to some of the points the Democratic leader has made relative to the education issue and talk about some of the agenda items about which we as Republicans are talking. 
   I have not seen the Democratic leader's sense of the Senate, but as I understand it, it is basically a castigation of the Republican majority for our position on education and promotion of the Democrat position on education, which would not be too surprising coming from the Democratic leader. But let me make a couple of points that I think underlie this whole debate. 
   The first is this: There is no amendment on the floor, there is no proposal on the floor, dealing with funding for education. It is my understanding the appropriations subcommittee, of which I happen to be a member, which deals with education funding, is going to be funding the Head Start at a very aggressive level and is going to be funding other education accounts at very aggressive levels. Those levels will be significant. 
   The second point to make: the Democratic membership has come forward with a whole series of new initiatives, most of them put forth by the President. They include class size initiative, afterschool initiative, building of new schoolroom initiatives. All of these are extremely expensive items. What they have not come forward with, however, is a commitment to support the already expensive items which the Federal Government has forced the local communities and the States to spend money on--specifically, special education. 
   On our side of the aisle, we have taken the position that it is much better for the Federal Government to fund already-existing programs, which it requires the local communities to spend money on, than to start up new programs, to force the local communities to spend new money on programs when they are not even getting reimbursed for the programs for which we already asked them to pay. 
   Special education is probably the single biggest drain on the costs of running your local school districts. You can go across this country and I suspect you will not find any school district in this country where the principals and the superintendents, and even the teachers, and especially the parents, do not tell you that if the Federal Government would simply pay its fair share of the cost of special education, then the local schools could do the things they need to do in other areas; whether it happens to be reducing the class size, building buildings, adding computers, adding foreign language courses, or adding new athletic programs. But because the Federal Government has refused to pay its fair share of the cost of special education when the Federal Government originally committed to pay 40 percent for each child in special ed, and today only pays about 10.5 percent, because the  Federal Government has failed to fulfill its commitment in this area of paying the full 40 percent, local school districts have had to take school dollars raised at the local level and apply those dollars to satisfy the Federal obligation, to pay for the Federal obligation. That has skewed dramatically the ability of the local school districts to effectively manage their own budgets and to take care of local education. 
   What has been the administration's response to this? Has the administration said that is wrong? We put on the books a 
   law that said we were going to help the special needs child--a very appropriate law--and the Federal Government would pay 40 percent of the cost of the special needs child, and we are not doing it. We are only paying 10.5 percent. Has this administration said let's take care of that problem, let's address that problem? 
   No. They have totally ignored the special needs child in their budgets. In fact, were it not for the Senate Republicans and for the leadership of Senator LOTT, special education, the special education commitment of the Federal Government, would still be around 6 percent. 
   Over the last 3 years, because of Senator LOTT's support and because of efforts of other Senators such as myself, we have been able to move that number up fairly significantly so we are now supporting about 10.5 percent. We have essentially doubled, in many States, the amount of money coming from the Federal Government, but we are still far short of the dollars that should be going back to local communities to help them with special education. 
   This has had a series of insidious impacts, this failure to fund special education, especially the failure of this administration to step up to the bar and fund special education. What this administration does is it creates or proposes all these new programs, whether it is a new building program or class size program or afterschool program, and it says to the local school district: OK, we are going to send you money for this program--call it a building program for their local school district. Then it says to the local school district, but to get this money you may have to have some sort of match. So the local school district finds itself in an impossible position because the Federal Government, instead of sending it the money it needs for special education, is saying to them: We are not going to send you the money we already told you we were going to send you for special education cases; we are going to take the money we told you we would send you for special education and create a new program; and we are going to tell you that you have to take this new program in order to get the money which you should have gotten in the first place from the special ed dollars. 
   The local school districts are left in the impossible situation of, first, using their local dollars to pay the Federal share of special education, and then in order to get the dollars coming to them for special education from the Federal Government, they have to create a new program and do something they do not want to do; where if the Federal Government did what it was supposed to do in the first place--which is pay for its fair share of special education--they would be freeing up the dollars at the local level that have been used to subsidize the Federal Government, and the local school district can make a decision: Do we need a new building? Do we need more teachers? Do we need afterschool programs? Do we need a foreign language program? Do we need new computers? The local school districts can make those decisions. 
   The Democratic leadership in this Congress and the President do not like that idea. Why do they not like that idea? Because they do not get to call the shots. The education bureaucracy in Washington does not get to make the decisions for the local school districts. That is what this is about. 
   This is not about funding. This is not about adequate resources being sent to support the local school districts. The 
   Republican proposals have put more money into special education than the Democratic proposals ever even thought of doing. We committed more than adequate funding for areas such as Head Start. But what we do not do--and this is what really galls the education establishment; this is what galls the teachers' unions that happen to dominate this city's liberal left and especially the Democratic Party in this city in the White House--is we do not tell them how to spend the money. We return to the States the money we said we would pay them in the first place for special education, and we let the States, then, make their decisions and the communities make the decisions and the parents make the decisions as to how they are going to spend their own dollars--whether they are going to add a classroom, add a teacher, add a foreign language program, add a computer program--instead of saying to them, as this President would have us do and as the proposal from the Democratic leader would have us do: We are going to tell you how to spend the money we send you, and you have to do it our way or you do not get the money. 
   Isn't it about time we, as a government, as a Federal Government, live up to our obligations when we say to local communities we are going to send you 40 percent of the cost of a special ed student's education, we should be sending them the money to pay for that special ed student's education? We require that education under Federal law. We should, obviously, fund it. 
   This administration does not want to do it. Why? It is very simple. It is purely an issue of power. They want to control local education from Washington. They do not like the idea the local school district might have its local dollars freed up so it can make a decision, so a parent can go into a school and say: Listen, we don't happen to have enough books in the library; that's what we need. They do not like the idea that a parent might have that much power with the local dollars. They want to take those local dollars and control them by underfunding the Federal obligation. Then they want to come up with new Federal programs which may have absolutely no need in the local community and which, as a practical matter, really skews the ability of the local community to fund its local education activities. 
   Let's also talk about the merits of some of these programs they are proposing and are going to force down the throats of the local school districts, the towns, and the cities. Let's talk about their teacher program, their class size program. 
   The theory is, if you do not have an 18-to-1 ratio, you do not meet the class-size obligations the Federal Government is setting up, and therefore you must take this money to spend it on additional teachers. 
   First off, 42 of the 50 States already meet the 18-to-1 ratio. So it is almost a meaningless proposal. Secondly, there happens to be very little statistical support for the idea that a class size of 18 to 1 is better than 20 to 1 or better than 15 to 1. It is not the size of the class when you get into those levels of ratio; it is the teacher. Do you have a good teacher? It is the person who is actually standing in that classroom that makes the difference. If you have a terrible teacher in a failing school who has taught there for a long time, you are going to turn out poorly prepared students whether you have 5 to 1, 10 to 1, or 25 to 1. 
   What the Federal Government refuses to do is say to the failing school that has failed year after year: Stop it; stop; 
   just stop; stop it; don't teach our kids poorly any longer. 
   Why not? Because the teachers' unions have such a control over the positions of this administration and the Department of Education that there is trepidation about confronting the failing school and the failing teacher in the failing school. 
   The Republicans have a better idea. We say essentially this. We say if a school has failed for 2 years on standards set by the State, not set in Washington--we are not going to tell the State and local communities how to set the standards, but if it has failed for 2 years so the kids are not getting a good education, then we say the States have to come into that school and direct that school to do a better job with its kids. 
   If after 4 years of failure--and that means almost half a generation of kids going through that school, if it is an elementary school going up to grade 8--if it is still failing and it is not producing results, and the kids coming out of that school cannot read and cannot do math--very basic things; we are not asking them to teach rocket science;  we are asking them to teach the basics of American education--if after 4 years this school still cannot cut it under standards set by the State, then we suggest that it is time to give the parents of the kids in those schools a chance to get their kids out of those schools. 
   We say to the school systems that the dollars that were going to that school system will instead follow the child to another school, to whatever school that parent wants to send that child to so that child has an opportunity to get into a school where they can actually learn and, thus, participate in the American dream. 
   It is unconscionable that the proposals coming from the other side essentially take the attitude that we will continue to support failing schools year after year and, thus, basically deny the kids going through those schools a shot at the American dream because you cannot participate in the American dream if you are not educated. Yet that is the position. That is the position of the President. 
   Why does he take that position? Very simply because there is an education lobby in Washington which refuses to face up to the fact that there are failing schools because they recognize that once they admit that, and once they admit that parents should have the right to take their kids out of those schools, they are admitting that parents should have choice and have a chance to participate in the system of educating their kids. 
   That is something that is an anathema, the idea that parents should actually have some role in choosing where their kids go to school and having the opportunity of making sure their kids get a decent education as a result of having some choice. That is an anathema to the education lobby in Washington. 
   The proposal brought forward by the President, one, shortchanges the special needs child dramatically. It doesn't do anything to help fund the special needs child. Two, it skews the ability of the local school system of the opportunity to use local dollars where they think they should go, whether it is a new building, whether it is a new library, whether it is another teacher, or whether it is a new language program. It makes it impossible for them to make that choice because they are not given the dollars necessary to make that choice and the dollars are taken instead to support the special education obligations the Federal Government requires them to make. 
   Three, they are putting in place categorical programs. The President wants categorical programs which have no relationship, in many instances, to the needs of the local school district.

   Mr. GREGG. They are categorical programs that have no relationship to a local school district's needs, instead of giving the school district and parents the flexibility to make the choices they want. 
   And four, the Republican proposal suggests that parents and schools should have the ability to take action when a school is failing year in and year out. 
   This is opposed by the other side of the aisle. 
   Good education proposals are being put forward in this Congress. They are being put forward by those of us on this side of the aisle who see the need to help special education, who see the need to empower parents, who see the need to give teachers the opportunity to learn and expand their abilities, but also to recognize if the teacher is not doing their job, there should be action taken. 
   These are good initiatives. This education debate is going to be about the difference in opinions. We are looking forward to that debate.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the enthusiasm of the Senator from Minnesota. I think we are all concerned about what has happened with veterans. I certainly congratulate the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from Missouri for their excellent effort to try, in the context of a strict budget structure, to do the most that is available for us for veterans. 
   But I do think in a philosophical discussion here we need to make something clear. ``Caps'' is not some euphemism that just gets thrown out and has no meaning to it. It is not just a term of art. In substance, it is a statement of the difference between spending money that we raise from revenues in the general fund versus spending money that is raised by taxes paid to the Social Security fund. 
   If we exceed the caps--and I am not going to argue the point; I think the Senator from Minnesota and a lot of other folks in this body are intent upon exceeding the caps, either with emergency spending in agriculture or with emergency spending for Kosovo or with advance funding gimmickry or with, possibly, in this case, an amendment that significantly increases funding under this bill over the caps that are available to it. But I think it has to be pointed out that when that occurs, that money comes from the Social Security trust fund. There is no other place for it to come from. Every dollar the caps are exceeded in this budget cycle--this may not be true next year--but every dollar that the caps are exceeded by in this budget cycle is going to be dollars that come out of the Social Security trust fund because we have already spent the onbudget surplus for emergency funds, emergency obligations. Those are already committed. So there are not really any onbudget surplus funds available to us. 
   So when these amendments come forward like this, I think there has to be some integrity in the debate. There has to be some statement of what the implications are of these types of amendments. The implication of this amendment is that the Social Security trust fund and Social Security itself will be hit for the amount this amendment exceeds the caps because the onbudget surplus that is non-Social Security has already been spent. That is the way it is. 
   It is easy to come to the floor and say we have to get rid of the caps because ``caps'' is a term of art nobody really understands. What that really means, a more honest statement would be, we have to take money out of the Social Security trust fund. We have to take money out of the Social Security trust fund. We have to take money out of the Social Security trust fund. That is the proposal. That is where we are. This Congress, this Senate, is going to have to make that decision. 
   Right now, there is a lot of effort to try to avoid that, and I am strongly committed to trying to avoid that event. I chaired a subcommittee, and I had the same problem the chairman of this subcommittee had. We were able, as was Chairman BOND, to bring in a bill that was under the caps, as the Presiding Officer now presiding over the Senate was also able to do with his bill on military construction. We brought it in at the cap level or under the cap level. It was difficult, very difficult, because we had the census in our bill. That was new spending which we had not really any money to pay for. So we have the same problem.  
   But the reality is that ``caps'' is not some arbitrary event here. It is not some term of art that has no meaning. There is significant meaning to the event ``breaking the caps.'' If we are going to have integrity in the debate, instead of using this term ``breaking the caps,'' we ought to say what the event is. The event is using the Social Security trust fund to fund whatever amendments are proposed to break the caps. That is the way it stands because there is not any onbudget surplus available beyond what has now already been committed for emergency funds, primarily to agriculture. So we are left only with Social Security surplus money. 
   So, yes, it pits this amendment against Social Security recipients. That is a public policy decision this Congress is going to have to make though, because on all these amendments that come forward that are not cap related, that are exceeding the cap, what we are basically doing is invading the Social Security trust fund. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GREGG. The Senator knows the President has not signed all the bills. The Senator also knows this Senate has committed significant dollars to, and I suspect the Senator voted for, the agriculture emergency. That takes out the onbudget surplus. So I think the Senator can say: Yes, the President has not signed the bills; therefore, the money has not been spent. The fact is, the Congress has spent the money. It is just that the President hasn't agreed to it.

   Mr. GREGG. I rise today to talk about the recent clemency decision, pardon decision by the President, relative to 16 Puerto Rican terrorists. This occurred on September 10. 
   There has been a lot of discussion in the newspapers and amongst people generally as to the reasons for this, as to the background of why this occurred, and as to the political implications within the election cycle as to what were the real causes. But that is not what I want to talk about. 
   What I want to talk about is the effect of this action by the President on our domestic terrorism policy and our preparedness to deal with domestic terrorism. The committee that I chair, the Commerce-State-Justice Committee, has spent a great deal of time trying to build an infrastructure to address the threat of terrorism. 
   Regrettably, we know as a nation that some time in the coming years we will be subjected to another terrorist attack. That is the nature of the times that we live in. Regrettably, it is even possible that such an attack may be a chemical or biological attack or an even more threatening attack. 
   We have attempted over the last 3 years to develop a coherent, thoughtful strategy for how to get ready for, to anticipate, and to hopefully interdict an attack and, should an attack occur, to respond to such a terrorist event. We have set up a system of developing a policy of addressing the issue of terrorism as a result of that. 
   The decision by the President to free these terrorists who were jailed for terrorist activity has fundamentally undermined this effort at reforming and preparing for the terrorist threat in the United States. 
   Stated simply, the question has to be: How can you claim you are being tough on terrorism if you free terrorists from your jails? 
   Today, we held a hearing in my committee, in the committee that I chair. We heard from the director at the FBI, Neil Gallagher, the director of the bureau dealing with terrorism. He is their expert on it. And we heard from Patrick Fitzgerald, the head of the terrorism bureau in the U.S. attorney's office in the city of New York. These two individuals talked about the policy implications and the effect of the decision by this President to free these terrorists. 
   I want to review a little bit of what the testimony was because it was startling and it was serious, and it shows that the implications of this decision by the President could have a very broad-reaching impact on the lives of Americans. 
   First off, we discussed the issue of what type of terrorist act these folks participated in relative to the decision for clemency. The decision for clemency has been represented in the press by the White House public spokespersons as having been made because these people were not actually involved in a violent act or, if they were involved in a violent act, they were not charged with participating in a violent act; therefore, they really were not that bad is essentially the defense that the administration makes for giving clemency to these 16 terrorists. 
   First off, it should be pointed out the FBI agent recited that these individuals participated in activities which led to the death of five different individuals as a result of bombings and terrorist attacks, which also led to the injury of 83 individuals, many of them U.S. service people who were directly 
   attacked by the organization, the FALN, that also represented millions of dollars of property damage and spanned a period of approximately 10 years of violent action against the United States, citizens of the United States, and military and police personnel of the United States, leading to the death and the maiming of American citizens by the actions which were participated in by these 16 individuals. Yes, they were charged and convicted, in most instances, of something less than actually pulling the trigger--no question about that. 
   So I asked the U.S. attorney from New York, what was Sheik Abdul-Rahman, who was the orchestrater of the World Trade Center bombing, charged with? Was he present at the scene? Did he pull the trigger? Did he light the fuse that blew up the World Trade Center? 
   Of course, the U.S. attorney said, no, he was not there. He is blind. He was charged with seditious conspiracy--the same thing that the Puerto Rican terrorists from the FALN were charged with. 
   Then I asked him: What was Terry Nichols charged with, who was not at the scene of the explosion in Oklahoma City where so many Americans were killed but, rather, who aided the individual who undertook that specific act? And he said he was charged with seditious conspiracy. 
   Then I asked, if we bring to trial Osama bin Laden--and an indictment has been brought back against Osama bin Laden--who perpetrated the attacks on the American embassies in Kenya and Dar es Salaam--and that indictment is not for lighting the fuse or being at the scene of the crime but for conspiracy to participate in the crime--all of these major terrorists who have caused huge harm to American citizens and to the American institution of Government, to our free democratic form of government were not on the scene of the crime any more than were the Puerto Rican terrorists, at least as they were charged and convicted. 
   Rather, they were all, with the exception of Bin Laden because he wasn't American, he wasn't on American soil. But the tenor of the charges being, they were all essentially charged with seditious conspiracy--all 16, I believe, FALN members, the sheik, Mr. Nichols, and Bin Laden. 
   So if the logic of the White House is--the logic of the President is--well, these aren't such bad people because they weren't convicted of actually killing the police officers, of actually maiming the police officers, of actually undertaking the heist of the armored cars, of actually attacking the U.S. Navy personnel and killing them, of actually killing the individual, Mr. Connor, in Chicago, of actually maiming the 83 other people who had been injured by these folks, because they weren't actually charged and convicted of that, and therefore they should be given clemency because their charge is a lesser charge, then the White House and the President are going to have to explain why the White House, why the President, is not giving clemency to Sheik Abdul-Rahman, Terry Nichols, and why they are even going forward with the prosecution of Bin Laden. 
   The defense of the White House on that point simply does not stand. These people participated in acts of terrorism, orchestrated acts of terrorism, and should not be let out early as a result of having not been convicted of actually being physically on the site of the terrorist event any more than we should let out Sheik Abdul-Rahman, Terry Nichols, or Bin Laden should we be successful in prosecuting and convicting him. 
   That was the first point. But it flows into the second point, which is, What is the effect of these clemencies on our ability as a nation to defend ourselves against other terrorist acts?

   Mr. GREGG. U.S. Route 2 is an important travel and commerce thoroughfare in the New Hampshire North Country that runs through New Hampshire, Maine and Vermont. On January 11, 1999, the New Hampshire, Maine and Vermont Senate delegation sent a joint letter to Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater. In this letter the delegation asked Secretary Slater to give consideration to a $13 million joint state grant application funded through TEA-21's National Corridor Planning and Development Program (NCPD) and Coordinated Border Infrastructure (CBI) for U.S. Route 2. The joint New Hampshire, Maine and Vermont application received a total of only $1.5 million in funding for U.S. Route 2. I am sure that the Senator from Alabama would agree that this funding level for U.S. Route 2 is completely inadequate. I ask the Senator from Alabama to join me in urging the Secretary of Transportation to allocate more funding through the NCPD and CBI for U.S. Route

    Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, New Hampshire is a place where community spirit and volunteerism is still a big part of our culture and it is partly for that reason that our state is consistently ranked as one of the most livable places in the United States. One of the reasons why our state remains one of the best places to live is that we try to limit the amount of government intrusion into our lives. Unfortunately that message has not gotten through to some people who work in the Forest Service in New Hampshire. 
   The White Mountain National Forest, which is overseen by the U.S. Forest Service, provides outdoor recreation and economic opportunities for thousands of people who live and work nearby. Preserving this national forest takes a lot of dedication and hard work and many people contribute to keeping the forest in good shape by volunteering their time to clear trails of debris and pick up trash. 
   In fact, over the summer, two retirees, Frank Barilone, 67, and Ted Matte, 66, both of Ellsworth, were cleaning up Ellsworth Park Beach, which had become littered with an old bob house, rotted rowboats, and assorted cans and bottles and other trash. They had been coming to the area for over 30 years and had both recently decided to retire to the area. They took the initiative to discuss the trash problem with the local Forest Service office in Holderness which told them to go ahead and clean it up which they did. As a reward for their hard work, the Forest Service fined them $150 for ``maintaining the national forest without a permit,'' which happens to be a federal offense. 
   It seems to me that the Forest Service has it all backwards. Instead of thanking Mr. Barilone and Mr. Matte for their hard work, the Forest Service gave them a slap in the face in the form of a ticket and a $150 fine. Most people expect the Forest Service to ticket people who pollute the forest, not people who try to clean it up. The Forest Service's decision to fine these two retirees $150 for cleaning up Ellsworth Park will discourage, not encourage, the public to take a greater role in the protection of our state's natural resources. 
   So on behalf of the people of New Hampshire, I thank Mr. Barilone and Mr. Matte for volunteering their time to help clean up our national forest. Their can-do attitude is what makes New Hampshire such a great place to live. Keep up the good work!

    Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to make clear that, while I was not able to vote on S.J. Res. 33, I am very much in favor of this resolution and I am pleased that it passed today. Had I been present, I would have voted in favor of it. It is important for the Senate to voice its concerns about the President's actions when they infringe on our Nation's best interests. Given the long and disturbing history of the FALN terrorists who were recently released, I believe that this President's actions with regard to those terrorists did, in fact, undermine our Nation's policies against terrorism. 
   On January 24, 1975, a New York city tavern was ripped apart by a bomb that killed 4 people and injured more than 50 others. A radical Puerto Rican nationalist group known as the Armed Forces for National Liberation (FALN) claimed responsibility for the act and was later implicated in more than 100 bombings across the United States. Several detectives were maimed as a result of these bombings and suffer to this day from the terrorism perpetrated by FALN. 
   Sixteen FALN terrorists were eventually convicted in the 1980's for violent offenses related to the bombings, including armed robbery, weapons violations, and seditious conspiracy, a rarely invoked but powerful criminal charge reserved for people whose intent is to undermine the Government of the United States. 
   Their history makes it clear that FALN was a dangerous terrorist faction whose members deserved the punishment they received. It is for these reasons that I was appalled when President Clinton offered to give these terrorists an early release from prison, ignoring unanimous opposition from federal law enforcement professionals and  siding with liberal human rights activists and Puerto Rican nationals. Eleven FALN terrorists were released from federal prison last Friday. 
   As you know, Mr. President, I chair the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary, which funds the FBI and other law enforcement agencies that are responsible for our Nation's counterrorism strategy. Over the last few years we have significantly increased the resources available to law enforcement and now have in place for the first time a coordinated, government wide strategy to deter and respond to terrorism. Releasing convicted terrorists before they serve their full sentence sends the wrong message about how our Nation will deal with people who use violence to achieve their political objectives. 
   There is no question that the President has the authority under the Constitution to grant pardons and reprieves for offenses against the United States. Once a pardon or clemency offer is official, no one can reverse or overturn the decision, not even the Congress or the Supreme Court. Given the magnitude of this power, the question that should be asked is why the President would use it to give convicted terrorists an early release from prison, especially the fact that President Clinton has reduced sentences in only 3 out of 3,042 prior cases. 
   Hearings will be held in this body and in the House of Representatives in the next few weeks, and they should aggressively question the administration's reasons for this act. These hearing should explore how the clemency offer supports the State Department's antiterrorism policy which states that the United States shall ``make no concessions and strike no deals and will bring terrorists to justice for their crimes.'' 
   The primary argument for clemency appears to be that none of the 16 FALN members were directly involved in any of the bombings. However, almost all of them were convicted for seditious conspiracy--the purpose of which was to wage a campaign of terror against the United States Government. Osama bin Laden may not have lit the fuse that detonated the bomb, but his participation in a conspiracy to commit these acts would be enough to incarcerate him for life. In addition, the Clinton administration contradicts its tough stance on gun violence by releasing these 
   terrorists, almost all of whom were convicted of various gun violations, including armed robbery. 
   Another explanation floated by the administration is that the sentences are too stiff. The President's early release certainly changes that. Eleven of the convicted FALN members are now free. Two others will serve additional time, and three others will be released from paying the remainder of their criminal fines. However, the sentencing judge's decision to order maximum prison terms was based on the evidence in the case and the fact that none of the FALN members showed any remorse for their acts at the time of sentencing. One sentencing judge indicated that he would have ordered the death penalty for one of the terrorists who showed no regret for his acts, but it was unavailable as an option. It is presumptuous for the President to grant clemency on the grounds that the federal judge who heard the testimony and saw the evidence firsthand imposed a sentence that was too severe. 
   In fact, Oscar Lopez-Rivera, one of the FALN terrorists that President Clinton offered to release early, had this to say in an interview with the Associated Press last year,  
   I have no regrets for what I've done in the Puerto Rico independence movement ..... This onus is not on us. The crime is colonialism. ..... If Puerto Rico was not a colony of the United States, I would have had a totally different life.  
   Mr. Lopez-Rivera was convicted of numerous charges, including weapons violations and conspiracy to transport explosives with intent to destroy government property. 
   Our judicial system also provides an absolute right of appeal for criminal convictions. Superseding the judicial system should be reserved for cases in which the facts are clear and the benefits of release outweigh the dangers. That balancing test is not met in this case. 
   Many people have speculated that the President's decision was an effort to woo the large Puerto Rican constituency in New York where Mrs. Clinton is likely to run for the U.S. Senate. It is not too much to imagine that the Clinton administration would jeopardize our national security to court potential voters based on their record of politicizing federal agencies, so I believe it should be examined during congressional hearings as a possible motivating factor. 
   One of our government's primary responsibilities is to safeguard the freedom and liberty of its people. Given the growing terrorist threat around the world, now is not the time to go easy on convicted terrorists. Over 700 people died last year and more than 6,000 were wounded from the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania last year. The World Trade Center bombing and the Oklahoma City bombing are fresh reminders of the violence that can be wrought by terrorists. Releasing terrorists before they serve their full sentence sends the wrong message and undermines our nation's tough stance against terrorism.

    Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask my fellow senators to join me in offering congratulations to John W. Smart of Nashua, New Hampshire, who is to be installed this month as National Commander-in-Chief of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States in this the 100th Anniversary of the organization's founding.  
   John Smart's election to this position is only the latest in a long and distinguished career in service to our country and to his fellow veterans. Mr. Smart served in the United States Army from October 1970 to April 1973, in Vietnam, where he was assigned to the 176th Assault Helicopter Company (American Division) at Chu Lai. His meritorious service was recognized with the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, a Vietnam Service Medal with four stars and a Presidential Unit Citation. 
   While serving in Vietnam, he joined VFW Post #2181 in Exeter, New Hampshire. Following his return from military service in 1973, he moved quickly through the VFW Department of New Hampshire chairs and earned recognition as an All-American Department Commander during the 1981-82 year. In 1983 he served as Chairman of the National Youth Activities Committee and from 1991-1993 as Chairman of the National Buddy Poppy Committee. In 1995 he was appointed to the position of National Chief of Staff. 
   Mr. Smart served his community of Nashua as a firefighter, retiring after 21 years. He has served as VFW New Hampshire Department Adjutant/Quartermaster since 1985. He is a Life Member of VFW Post #483 in Nashua and in addition to his service to the VFW he holds membership in the Military Order of the Cooties, American Legion, Elks, Retired Firefighters Association and the US Army Association. He has served as Chairman of the Board of Managers of the New Hampshire Veterans Home since 1987 and has served as a New Hampshire State Representative. 
   John Smart is the first member of the Department of New Hampshire Veterans of Foreign Wars to be elected to the office of National Commander-in-Chief. I can think of no New Hampshire citizen more dedicated to his country and to the cause of assisting his fellow veterans. His wife, Mary, his two children, John R. and Cheryl, and his five grandchildren have reason for great pride in this husband, father and grandfather who has so ably contributed his time and efforts toward the service of others. I have been honored to work with John Smart over my years here in the Senate, while serving as Governor in New Hampshire and earlier in the House of Representatives. I commend him to the Senate and know you will join me in extending to him and his family our congratulations, our thanks for his past accomplishments and continuing service and our best wishes during his year of service as the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States Commander-in-Chief.

    Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today marks the sixth anniversary of the implementation of the Family and Medical Leave Act. This act, as my colleagues will recall, was intended to be used by families for critical periods such as after the birth or adoption of a child and leave to care for a child, spouse, or one's own ``serious medical condition.'' 
   Since its passage, the Family and Medical Leave Act has had a significant impact on employers' leave practices and policies. According to the Commission on Family and Medical Leave two-thirds of covered work sites have changed some aspect of their policies in order to comply with the act. 
   Unfortunately, the Department of Labor's implementation of certain provisions of the act has resulted in significant unintended administrative burden and costs on employers; resentment by co-workers when the act is misapplied; invasions of privacy by requiring employers to ask deeply personal questions about employees and family members planning to take FMLA leave; disruptions to the workplace due to increased unscheduled and unplanned absences; unnecessary record keeping; unworkable notice requirements; and conflicts with existing policies. 
   Despite these problems, which have been well documented through three separate congressional hearings, including one I chaired three weeks ago, there are those in Congress and the administration who choose to ignore those problems and instead push for imposition of the law on even smaller businesses and for purposes well beyond those judged by Congress to be the most critical. These proponents of expansion will refer to a report issued by the U.S. Commission on Leave which failed to find significant problems associated with the act. 
   However, the fact of the matter is, the Commission on Leave's report was issued well before the final implementing regulations were in place--regulations which are in fact the source of much of the concern over the act's implementation. 
   Mr. President, to consider expansion at this time is not just irresponsible, it is unconscionable. 
   The Department of Labor's vague and confusing implementing regulations have resulted in the FMLA being misapplied, misunderstood and mistakenly ignored. Employers aren't sure if situations like pink eye, ingrown toe nails and even the common cold will be considered by the regulators and the courts to be serious health conditions. 
   Because of these concerns and well documented problems with the act, I am today introducing the Family and Medical Leave Clarification Act to make reasonable and much needed changes to clarify the Family and Medical Leave Act and restore the original congressional intent.

   Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair. 
   I thank the Senator from Arizona and appreciate the opportunity to join him on this amendment which is one of those amendments that comes to the floor of the Senate supported by logic, common sense, and good economics, but is opposed, regrettably, by the forces who wish to take advantage of the farm program for the purposes of promoting a product in a noncompetitive, nonmarket-type process. 
   The Senator from Arizona has outlined some of the harm that is done by the President's sugar program. Most of that harm is directed at the American consumer who ends up paying $1.4 billion in taxes for all intents and purposes because it is a fee, a cost of sugar, they now incur which exceeds the market price of sugar they end up paying--a $1.4 billion surcharge on the American consumer in order to keep in place a sugar industry which is totally noncompetitive. 
   If you were to describe the sugar industry, you would think you were describing the Cuban sugar industry, not the American sugar industry. The sugar industry sets the price. The price is at least twice the cost of sugar on the world market. And then essentially it guarantees that the sugar grower  and the processors will be able to realize that price. 
   Who pays the burden? The consumer. They end up paying twice as much for sugar as sugar is worth on the open market. 
   What does that describe? That describes a nonmarket system of selling a product. That describes essentially a socialist system of selling a product. That describes a system that might have worked in Eastern Europe 15 years ago or might have been used in Eastern Europe 15 years ago--it obviously didn't work--or a system which may still be in place today in Cuba. But it certainly doesn't describe a system one would expect the United States, the force for a free market economy in the world, would be putting forward for the purposes of producing a commodity such as sugar. The effect, however, goes well beyond the fact that consumers in America are paying this $1.4 billion in extra cost, which is essentially a tax on them. 
   This sugar program stifles competition. Seventeen growers get 38 percent of the benefit of this program, 17 growers. Why is that? Because there isn't any competition in the system. It discourages international trade. We look at our Caribbean neighbors and we say: How can we help you? Then we essentially invade Haiti and spend literally hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars to try to stabilize that economy to no avail, where at the same time we are saying to Haiti and all the other Caribbean nations who are capable of producing sugar, no, we are not going to purchase your sugar because we are going to subsidize our sugar, and we are going to essentially close you out of our markets. 
   It harms the environment. As has been pointed out by the Senator from Arizona, the sugar cane growing in Florida has had a serious impact on the quality of the environment of the Everglades, a key area of natural regeneration in the southern Florida area. 
   It affects jobs. Why does it affect jobs? Because if you don't have a competitive industry, you don't have a marketplace approach, you are essentially putting in a straitjacket the production capabilities of the American economy. 
   Why is America the most productive country in the world? Because we are the most free market country in the world. That free market creates jobs. People have the opportunity to compete. People have the opportunity to grow their industries. In the sugar industry, we have no competition because we have a process which is essentially a socialized system, and it requires unnecessary government involvement in the production of a commodity. 
   Why should the American people have to depend on the Federal Government to price the product of sugar? It makes absolutely no sense. Why shouldn't the marketplace price the product of sugar? That is what we do with everything else. If you go out and you buy a Ford car, the Federal Government doesn't say to Ford: It doesn't matter how many cars you sell or who you sell them to, we are going to pay you $20,000 per car; and if you only sell the cars for $17,000, it doesn't matter because we are going to pay you $20,000 anyway. 
   We don't say it to Apple Computer. We don't say it to Microsoft. We don't say it to the housing industry. But we do say it to the sugar producers in this country. It doesn't matter how much sugar you produce; it doesn't matter if your production costs are twice what they may be in the world market; it doesn't matter. We are going to set the price. We are going to pay you the price and the price is going to have no relation to demand. It is going to have no relation to competition. The only thing it is going to have a relation to is the amount of revenue that is going to fall into the pockets of a very small 
   number of growers in this country today who benefit from this program. 
   It is interesting, as we look at the farm programs in this country, there is only sugar left that has this sort of a protection. It is able to accomplish this because it has diffused the issue of the maintenance of this outrageous subsidy across the entire American consumer base. Rather than having it flow directly out of the American Treasury into the growers' pockets, this program has been structured so that it flows directly out of the consumer into the growers' pockets. Because of that, there has been a winking at this program; this program has sort of slipped through the cracks, where the rest of the farm commodities in this country have been forced to have some relationship, under Freedom to Farm, of having their product production tied to the product demand. Sugar has not been subjected to that test at all. 
   So we have a program that should never have been put in place in the first instance because it is so atypical to a marketplace economy. But clearly, with the passing of Eastern Europe and the concept of a socialized marketplace, it clearly should not be surviving today, yet it does survive. 
   I think the Senator from Arizona may have touched the reason. It is political influence. It is the capacity of the grower community to assert its influence within the legislative process. But it still is not fair, and it is not right. It is not appropriate to ask the American consumer to spend $1.4 billion of their hard-earned money on a commodity simply to benefit a small group of growers--17 growers getting 38 percent of the benefit. 
   That $1.4 billion could go a long way towards educating children, towards getting better child care, towards improving the lifestyle, the health care, even the nutrition of the people who are paying that price. Yet that money is not going to go to those purposes. Instead, that money is going to flow simply to support an industry which has totally separated itself from the free market. 
   I strongly endorse this amendment. I have offered it in the past myself. I hope this time the Congress will step up and recognize that it should vote on behalf of the consumers and abolish this outrageous tax and put to rest this last vestige of Eastern European economics in the United States. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time to the Senator from Arizona.

    Mr. GREGG. Mr President, today I am joined with my colleagues, Senators LOTT, COLLINS, BROWNBACK, HAGEL, COVERDELL, GORTON, MACK, VOINOVICH and SESSIONS in introducing the Teacher Empowerment Act (TEA). This Act is similar to H.R. 1995 which recently passed the House. 
   The bill provides a little over $2 billion annually over 5 years by consolidating funds for Title II of ESEA, GOALS 2000 and Classroom Size into one flexible funding stream for the purposes of increasing teacher quality and the number of high quality teachers in our schools. 
   Over 300 studies have found that the number one contributor to student achievement is a highly qualified teacher. Outside of parental involvement, no other factor has as much impact on determining whether a student will succeed or fail in school. Unfortunately, we know that over 25% of those who enter the teacher workforce are poorly qualified to teach. Furthermore, we know that many teachers who are already in the classroom lack necessary skills or do not possess adequate knowledge of the subject area in which they teach. 
   Since teacher quality is the most significant determinant to student success and there is a shortage of high quality teachers in our schools, it is readily apparent that we need to focus our efforts on increasing teacher quality. Nothing else will improve our public schools or lead to increased student achievement as much as increasing the number of high quality teachers in our schools.  
   TEA improves teacher quality by requiring that professional development activities increase teacher knowledge and skills as well as student achievement. TEA builds upon extensive research on what type of professional development activities improve teacher knowledge and skills. First and foremost high quality professional development activities must be directly related to the curriculum and subject area in which the teacher provides instruction. Second, they must be of sufficient intensity and duration to have a positive and lasting impact. TEA only funds those professional activities that meet these requirements and only if the activities are tied to challenging State content and student performance standards. 
   Not only does TEA improve teacher quality, but it gives school districts the ability to recruit and retain high quality teachers. Many school districts, especially inner city and rural school districts, are unable to either attract or retain high quality teachers. Blanket classroom size reduction proposals, which call for reduced class size at all costs, only exacerbate the situation. 
   A recent Rand study found that California's classroom size initiative led to more uncredentialed, underqualifed teachers and an increase in teacher aides (rather than teachers) providing direct instruction to students. Inner city schools in Los Angeles actually witnessed a decrease in the number of qualified teachers, as many of those that were qualified left the inner city schools when jobs opened up in more affluent schools. 
   Clearly, school districts must be given the resources to not only recruit, but also to retain, high quality teachers. TEA does this through a variety of measures. It permits school districts to award differential pay to retain and recruit teachers in high need subject areas, such as math and science. It permits schools to provide signing bonuses to retain their best teachers and reduce the rate of attrition. 
   It permits school districts to establish incentive programs to attract and hire highly skilled and knowledgeable teachers. It permits schools to recruit individuals who have had careers outside of teaching but whose life experience provides a solid foundation for teaching. And, it permits schools to invest in teacher mentors and master teachers; studies and teacher polls have found that hiring master teachers who mentor new teachers improves both teacher quality and the likelihood that new teachers will stay and thrive at the school. 
   In addition to promoting high quality professional development programs and to giving school districts the ability to retain, recruit and train high quality teachers, TEA also promotes a number of innovative common sense reforms, such as tenure reform, teacher testing, merit-based performance systems, teacher academies, and alternative certification programs. 
   TEA also creates Teacher Opportunity Payments (TOPS), payments that would be provided directly to teachers so they can choose their own professional development. Teachers have reported that professional activities selected by the school districts are often not as helpful as those activities they might have selected themselves. Under TOPS, if a group of teachers is not satisfied with the professional opportunities offered by the school district, they could request that the LEA pay for them to attend a professional development program of their choice, provided the program met the professional activity requirements under the Act. This means that science teachers could attend a local university that has a reputation for intensive professional development programs in math and science; programs that they otherwise might not have had the opportunity to attend. 
   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor TEA. TEA gives States and schools the resources and the flexibility to use those resources to retain, recruit, train and hire highly qualified teachers.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this is the stay-at-home-moms amendment. It basically extends the dependent care tax credit to stay-at-home moms. I note that the Senate voted 96-0 in a sense of the Senate for this proposal. It applies to the first year of the child's life and would apply the dependent care tax credit to that first year, so that mothers who stay at home and raise children are treated the same way as mothers who have to go to work and send their children to day care. 
   I note that it is an amendment that is targeted at middle- and low-income families, with stay-at-home mothers in households with an average $38,000 in income and with two working parents with an average income of about $58,000. It is a proposal the Senate has spoken on relative to the sense of the Senate. Therefore, I hope the Senate supports this proposal. 
   I ask for a voice vote.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to address several important provisions in the tax relief legislation that has been reported out of the Senate Finance Committee. 
   In the last few years, I have taken an especial interest in reforming our federal entitlement programs and our tax policies so as to recognize and to prepare for the retirement of the Baby Boom generation that will begin in 2008. During the last Congress, I was appointed by Majority Leader Trent LOTT to chair a Senate Republican Task Force on Retirement Security, on which Chairman ROTH served, and provided the benefit of his experience and his enduring commitment to promoting retirement saving. Our task force produced a bill, numbered S. 883 in the last Congress, several provisions of which were included in the 1997 reconciliation bill. I am pleased to see that several more have been included in this year's reconciliation bill. 
   I would like to review several of these provisions and to discuss their significance. 
   Chairman ROTH has devoted several years of his career to promoting increased personal saving through individual retirement accounts. His IRA legislation, the Roth-Breaux bill, was included in its entirety as the first title of our comprehensive bill. The Chairman succeeded in passing some of the provisions of this legislation during reconciliation last time around, including the back-loaded IRA that has become known as the ``Roth IRA.'' This time, the Finance Committee mark moves the ball still further forward on expanding the saving in individual retirement accounts. It increases the contributions that can be made to these accounts, as well as expanding the number of individuals who can participate in them. Now more than ever, with the Baby boomers poised on the brink of retirement, ready to move from being earners and investors to being consumers, ``all saving is good saving.'' It is a very propitious time to propose that individual saving be promoted and encouraged. 
   I stress that we score these provisions, for our own accounting purposes, as ``revenue losers,'' but this is misleading. This is not saving that is ``lost"--it is only ``lost'' to the federal government. This saving and investment will result in much-needed contributions to capital formation and to economic growth. This is a far superior use of this money than collecting it to fuel current government consumption.  
   I was pleased to join in cosponsoring Senator ROTH's legislation to expand IRAs, and am further pleased that this reconciliation bill incorporates a portion of that expansion. 
   Senator ROTH's IRA legislation was drafted before the task force began work on S. 883 in the last Congress. But there were several provisions that were original to the task force of which I remain very proud, and I am pleased to see that they have received positive attention from the Finance Committee this year. 
   First of these is the ``SAFE'' plan for small businesses. This is a new type of defined benefit plan that we worked to devise in concert with others who also perceived the need to make such pension plans more attractive to small business owners. Right now, it is too often the case that it is not in the interest of a small employer to offer such a pension plan. The nondiscrimination rules are too complex, and the small employer may not feel that they can afford the fiscal commitment of such a size, uncertainty, and duration. 
   The ``SAFE'' plan neatly balances the need of employers to have a simplified pension structure, with the desire to give employees fair treatment and a pension benefit that they can count on. The rules of the ``SAFE'' plan are very simple. Fair treatment is ensured by simply requiring that the employer fund a benefit that is the same percentage of pay for each eligible employee in the shop. If one year's contributions produce a pension benefit equal to 2 percent of pay for the boss, then it's also 2 percent of pay for the employee--extremely simple. 
   ``SAFE'' is a fully portable, fully funded pension plan that will work. It's portable because the contributions are made specifically on behalf of each employee, so it is easy to track how much of a nest egg each has accrued. If that employee moves on, that balance can move on with them with a minimum of difficulty. It's also fully funded--simple rules dictate how much money the employer puts in for each employee in each year. It has to be enough to fund the promised defined benefit. Each year the accumulation in that account is tracked, and if it falls behind the amount that is assumed to be needed using some flexible and reasonable interest rate assumptions, then the employer will have to make additional contributions to make the employee's pension fund ``whole'' again. The employer meets his obligations in a simple and easily understood way, and has no mounting financing problem at the end of the game. 
   I also note that the ``SAFE'' plan also is an important benefit for long-time employees who have not been covered to date, because it does allow for ``catch-up'' contributions covering an employee's previous 10 years of service. This is a helpful feature because of the assistance it will give to employees who have less time to prepare for retirement. 
   The Finance Committee proposal also includes several provisions to increase the amount of contributions that can be made to SIMPLE plans or to other pension plans. I am pleased to note that it also includes several provisions championed by our task force that would benefit small businesses and the self-employed in particular. For one, it would equalize the treatment of self-employed and larger businesses with respect to loans taken from pension plans. Right now, the self-employed, subchapter S owners, partners, sole proprietors, cannot take loans from their pension plan as can larger businesses, and this puts them at a competitive disadvantage. Our proposal to correct this inequity is included in the Finance Committee bill. 
   We also included a proposal that would remove a disincentive for the self-employed to make matching contributions to their pension plans, and no longer counting such matching contributions towards the annual 401(k) contribution limit. I am pleased that a version of this proposal is also included in the Finance Committee package. 
   I am also pleased to see the number of provisions included in this legislation aimed at addressing the problem of inadequate retirement income for women, who make up the vast majority of our impoverished elderly population. Our task force considered our women's equity provisions to be so important that we introduced them separately in the last Congress as the WISE, Women's Investment and Savings Equity bill. 
   Some of the provisions of WISE were included in last year's reconciliation package, including the liberalization of rules governing contributions by homemakers to IRAs. 
   We also included another provision aimed at giving stay-at-home spouses a chance to ``catch-up'' on pension contributions if staying at home to care for a child interrupted their past contributions. We offered a provision allowing ``catch-up'' opportunities for individuals who had taken maternity or paternity leave. The Finance Committee bill also includes a ``catch-up'' provision. Though not specific to the case of families caring for children, the provision providing for larger IRA and pension contributions once the individual reaches the age of 50 is intended to serve the same purpose--to recognize that individuals often do not have as much money to put aside in saving until their children are out of the nest. Giving parents a chance to ``catch up'' for these lost opportunities is a family-friendly reform. 
   I continue to believe that allowing ``catch-up'' contributions for individuals who missed out on pension contribution opportunities specifically because of child-rearing is an important idea, which I may still wish to pursue. But I am pleased to see the provision in this legislation and to recognize the chairman's effort to serve the same end. 
   Finally, a number of other reforms that I and the rest of the task force have sponsored in the past also appear in this bill--including important portability provisions that would allow individuals in public sector employment plans to take their pension benefits with them when they join a private employer. The current situation is an artifact of the undue complexity of our pension law, and the incompatibility of public and private pension regulations that has interfered with such portability until now. Public employees are often afraid to leave public positions because they do not know whether their pension benefits will travel with them, especially once it has accumulated to a significant amount that is critical to their retirement plans. Everyone's interest will be served by allowing these accumulations to roll over into other types of plans. 
   I simply close by again thanking the chairman for the level of attention that he has given to retirement saving in the Finance Committee mark. As the chair of the Republican Task Force on Retirement Security, I find it gratifying to see that the chairman placed such a high priority for these needs among the competing objectives that Senators brought to crafting this tax bill. I hope that indeed ``the time has come'' for many of these provisions on which we have worked so hard in the past, and I hope that they will be supported throughout this reconciliation process. 
   I thank my colleagues, and I yield the floor.

I now ask unanimous consent that the final 10 minutes of the time be reserved for myself, and prior to that, the 10 minutes prior to that, be reserved for the Senator from South Carolina.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may take on this. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Delaware and his commitment to this program. 
   The committee's decision to end this program was based on a number of factors. The first factor was our allocation, which was so low. We had to simply apply resources where we thought they were most needed. 
   The second factor was basically, in our opinion, the administration had taken the money to fund the COPS Program from some other very important law enforcement initiatives. For example, the administration did not fund the additional 1,000 Border Patrol which we think is critical. They did not fund the expansion of strike team efforts by the DEA. They did not fund the Boys and Girls Clubs initiatives. They did not fund the juvenile block grants. They did not fund the local law enforcement block grants. They did not fund the interagency drug enforcement grants. The money which came out of those accounts was essentially used to expand the COPS Program. 
   The funding which this committee has made to the COPS Program has been extraordinary, and it has been strong over the years. In fact, the original program called for 100,000 cops. This committee has funded 105,000 cops over the years and with our final funding we had in place. 
   We also as a committee, with the support of the Senator from South Carolina, initiated aggressive programs of mentoring in schools using police officers. We think this is an important effort, and in our bill we expanded that amount. That is how we arrived at the number we did. 
   I am willing to look at the extension of the COPS Program, 
   but I think we have to look at it in the context of the resources available to us. When the administration sent up a budget as they sent up and essentially played games with the other law enforcement accounts, things which have to be done, which we knew had to be done and they knew had to be done, and then they underfunded those accounts, that is what created the basic problem in the initial bill.  
   Working with the Senator from Delaware, we have been able to work out this resolution, which I think is a reasonable one and one with which I know the Senator from South Carolina agrees. 
   If there is no further debate, I urge adoption of the amendment.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join with the Senator from South Carolina in his views on this issue. I recognize we will lose this vote, but we have had our brief day in the Sun at least. The fact is NED's time has gone by. For all the arguments that have been made by the Senators who have spoken on this, the bottom line is this is a relic of the cold war. In a time when we have very limited resources, it is very hard to justify funding the Democratic National Committee, the Republican National Committee, AFL-CIO, and the Chamber of Commerce, all of whom have significantly more resources to put into this than we have available for us out of these very limited accounts. 
   Many of the things NED has done during the time of the cold war were wonderful. But now we have moved on 10 years from the fall of the Berlin Wall and it is time for us to say enough is enough. Unfortunately, in my opinion, some of the things NED is doing now are not. They end up being a substitute for initiatives which are both inappropriate and sometimes just simply junkets. 
   That being said, I am concerned, as is the Senator from South Carolina, this will take funds out of the capital budget of the State Department. We have worked hard on this budget. We have taken the State Department from getting a ``D'' in the area of Y2K compliance to now, just 2 years later, it is one of the agencies getting an ``A.'' Two years ago when we started capital budget expansion, which we initiated in this committee--it did not come from the State Department; although they were very supportive of it, they could not find resources for it--a majority of the Embassies around the world were using rotary telephones. They were using Wang computers. They had no decent facsimile machines. We have radically upgraded the electronic capabilities of the State Department. But we have a long, long, long way to go. It all ties into the need to protect our citizens who are working for us out there and their families. 
   So when you hit this fund for $30 million, which represents about 30 percent of the money--and this fund was not increased this year; although I wanted to increase it, we simply could not find the money--you are going to do significant damage, I think, to the State Department's accounts. The State Department, for that reason, is very concerned about this amendment. 
   That being said, the Senator from South Carolina, being one of the best vote counters in the Senate, and I, being a marginal vote counter as chief whip, we recognize we are not going to win this one. I think we should vote on it and move on. If the Senator from Indiana is agreeable to that, I suggest we urge adoption.

   I further ask unanimous consent that no amendments be in order to the amendment prior to the vote. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that the previous consent relating to the pending GREGG amendment remain status quo to recur immediately following the LAUTENBERG vote. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that it be in order for Senator ENZI to offer an amendment regarding the FCC accounting principles and there be 30 minutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote on or in relation to the amendment. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that no amendments be in order prior to the vote. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that the previous consent relating to the pending GREGG amendment remain status quo to reoccur immediately following the vote on the ENZI amendment. 
   I further ask unanimous consent that the ENZI amendment and the LAUTENBERG amendment be voted on en bloc at the end of the ENZI debate time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GREGG. That is correct. We will have a vote on the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey and then the Senator from Wyoming. 
   I rise in opposition to this amendment for a number of reasons. With forward funding of an initiative, the $25 million for advanced appropriations next year, it makes it extremely difficult for the committee to function. 
   When the President presented his budget, he had included a large amount of funding which this committee did not accept because we did not want to put ourselves in that sort of a bind. 
   Independent of the equities of the argument relative to the initiative which was voted on once before in a form not exactly like this but similar to this on the Treasury-Postal bill, I believe very strongly this would set a very poor precedent if we began appropriating in the future on bills for this year. 
   It would avoid the entire budgetary process, which requires offsets. That is our fiscal discipline. Without offsets, we will have no fiscal discipline. Arguably, we could appropriate all of next year's budget on almost any subject that Members wish and create significant problems. 
   I don't support the amendment. I believe the amendment is inappropriate.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy with my colleague from South Carolina, Senator HOLLINGS, the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary (CJS), about an innovative program recently started by the State of Virginia, which I believe falls within the allowable use of funds within the Safe Schools Initiative, a line item that appears in the FY 2000 CJS Appropriations Bill. 
   Senator HOLLINGS, it has recently come to my attention that the State of Virginia has begun implementing a new program to reduce crime in its schools called ``4 Safe VA.'' This program is a public/private partnership, which includes online reporting of school crime, a toll-free statewide hotline, and an extensive training program. 
   Before school begins again in the fall, Virginia will train nearly 3,000 teachers, law enforcement, school resource officers, and other school personnel in school safety procedures. There will be four separate training programs, which are as follows: (1) a training program for school resource officers to prepare them to act as ``first responders'' in crisis situations, such as that which occurred in Littleton, Colorado; (2) a training program for school staff and local law enforcement in communities where there are no school resource officers to prepare them for responding to crisis situations; (3) a training program for 60 Virginia State Troopers to prepare them to support localities should a crisis situation occur; and (4) a training program for custodians, cafeteria workers, and other support staff, who know the students and who are often the ``eyes and ears'' of the school, to prepare them to assist in emergencies. 
   I have looked at Virginia's program plan and have found it to be innovative and thoughtful. I consider it to be the type of program for which we set aside $38 million for community planning and prevention activities under the Safe Schools Initiative line item. It is my hope that the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, which will be administering these grants, will give careful thought to providing the State of Virginia with funds to continue to enhance the 4 Safe VA project.

The Committee further specifies that verification technology will include systemization of promising non-intrusive nuclear topographic techniques including the Fission Assay tomography System and the Gamma Neutron Assay Technique, which together will provide the ability to detect and characterize special nuclear materials while at the same time ensuring that design information is not revealed. The President's budget request is just that--a request for the Committee's consideration--but Congress, within its prerogatives, sets agency funding levels, and sets priorities within those levels.

The Subcommittee approved the increase in the budget for the Office of Advocacy to enable it to assess the economic contributions made by small businesses, to determine the impact of federal regulations and tax policies on small businesses, to dedicate sufficient resources to help carry out its responsibilities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and to undertake reviews of interpretative regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service of the Department of the Treasury and rules issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration of the Department of Labor. 
   It was further our intention to direct SBA to add 5 full-time equivalent employees to the Office of Advocacy for a total of 54 full-time employees for FY 2000. It is our belief this number of full-time staff is reasonable to address the burgeoning responsibilities of this important office.

I know that they have been tireless in their efforts to secure both an end to illegal immigration and to ensure that the federal government assume a share of the financial responsibility for its inability to control illegal immigration. 
   I know, as well, that the senator from California and the senator from Arizona were two of the principal authors of the SCAAP program when it was created by the 1994 Crime bill, and that they both worked very hard to help secure the $585 million which was appropriated last year and in fiscal year 1998 for this important program. 
   Knowing of the great need for adequate funding for SCAAP, it pains me that the Committee was unable to fund it at the level it deserves. I assure the senators that I will make it a high priority during the conference between the House and Senate to secure adequate funding for this program, that does so much for all of our states that are burdened by the costs of incarcerating illegal aliens.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, as we know, the violent crime trust fund was set up back in 1993, and the concept of it was through savings which would occur as a result of the reduction in personnel in the Federal Government, that funding from those savings would be used to expand our efforts in fighting crime in this country. 
   It has been a tremendous success. As a result of the violent crime trust fund, we have been able to undertake a significant expansion of the efforts of the FBI, the INS, the DEA, just to name a few at the Federal level, and also our local and community law enforcement, who are so important to us. This is critical. Without this trust fund, we might have some serious problems as we go down the road maintaining some of these efforts. 
   The President is funding his Community Oriented Policing (COPS) Program from the violent crime reduction trust fund. Later, we are going to get from the other side an amendment which, I presume, deals with the COPS Program, but as a practical matter, I think we have resolved it. I do not think we are going to have a problem on this bill with the COPS Program. The COPS Program was a violent crime initiative, and a good one. It worked. I have to admit, I had suspicions about it when it was first offered, but it has worked out. 
   We move on to other initiatives in the violent crime trust fund: terrorism initiatives; some initiatives to deal with the question of how the FBI is able to identify DNA; and initiatives with local communities, for their efforts to gear up with the technology of today. So, for example, when someone is arrested on the street, a law enforcement officer will have the computer capability to immediately contact the FBI, the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), and get a reading as to whom that person is and in what possible other activity he or she might be involved. 
   These are critical expansions in our efforts in law enforcement across this country. They are proving to work well. As we move down the road, they will work even better, I am sure. 
   We have a number of major initiatives at the Federal level. We just got our Integrated Automated Fingprint Identification System up and running, fingerprinting. The NCIC program is working now. And coming on line--it may take some more years than I would like--is something dealing with information sharing initiative (ISI) which will give Federal agents the computer capability they need to have instant access to what is going on nationally. This is an initiative that is very appropriate. There are a lot of other things that are going to make our law enforcement much more effective as it deals with crime in this Nation. 
   In addition, of course, we have done a lot in the area of DEA and drug enforcement. The violent crime trust  fund plays a major role, and it is about to run out, so we should reauthorize it. That is why I have offered this authorization. I hope the Senate will agree to it. 
   I suggest we set a vote for tomorrow, if that is all right with the Senator from South Carolina.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join with the majority leader in congratulating the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Louisiana for putting forward this excellent proposal on land and water conservation. This is long overdue. I think it is an extraordinarily positive step. 
   The chairman of the key committee, Chairman MURKOWSKI, has decided to put forward this proposal, to support it, and to have the support of the majority leader. 
   Those are two pretty powerful figures in this Senate pushing forward on this extremely positive conservation initiative. From the view of the State of New Hampshire, the stateside land and water conservation fund is something in which we are very interested. There are places in this country today where I think their representative Senators maybe think that the Federal Government owns enough land. Maybe the Member in the Chair is from one of those places, being from Wyoming. But those of us on the eastern seaboard still see critical pieces of land we would like to have protected. We have a huge population, a megalopolis, running from Washington to Boston, that is always moving north. 
   In New Hampshire, there are critical elements of natural resources that need to be protected as we go through these massive expansions and these growth spurts, which are inevitable. The land and water conservation fund, over the years, has always been a positive force for protection and for allowing communities to do things they think are critical to making those communities better places to live--whether it happens to be building a park or a recreational area. Therefore, to refund or replenish the land and water conservation fund using the Outer Continental Shelf is absolutely appropriate and is absolutely critical if States such as New Hampshire, which are, unfortunately, in a wave of population growth, are going to be able to maintain their characteristics of being a rural environment and a pleasant place in which to raise a family. 
   I support Senator MURKOWSKI's bill, and I certainly appreciate the Senator from Mississippi, the majority leader, also being in support of this legislation. That bodes well for it.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce what I truly believe is Congress's ``last, best hope'' to place Social Security on a course of long-term health in this session of Congress. I strongly urge my colleagues to look carefully at this bipartisan, bicameral, fiscally responsible plan, and to give their support to this, our best chance to meet our important responsibility to take action so as to enable Social Security to continue to meet its historic mission of providing senior citizens with insurance against poverty in old age. 
   The proposal that I will discuss was negotiated over several months between a bipartisan group of committed reformers in the Senate. It already has more cosponsors than any other competing proposal. Those cosponsors include myself, Senator BOB KERREY, Senator JOHN BREAUX, Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY, Senator FRED THOMPSON, Senator CHUCK ROBB, and Senator CRAIG THOMAS. 
   What I want to do in my remarks is to describe what our proposal would achieve, and then to provide some details as to how it achieves these goals. It would: s 
   Make Social Security solvent. Not simply for 75 years, but perpetually, as far as SSA can estimate. Our proposal would leave the system on a permanently sustainable path. 
   Increase Social Security benefits beyond what the current system can fund. I will follow up with some details as to why and how. 
   It would drastically reduce taxes below current-law levels. Again, I will provide details as to why and how it does this. 
   It will make the system far less costly than current law, and also less costly than competing reform proposals. 
   It will not touch the benefits of current retirees. 
   It will strengthen the ``safety net'' against poverty and provide additional protections for the disabled, for widows, and for other vulnerable sectors of the population. 
   It will vastly reduce the federal government's unfunded liabilities. 
   It would use the best ideas provided by reformers across the political spectrum, and thus offers a practical opportunity for a larger bipartisan agreement. 
   It will provide for fairer treatment across generations, across demographic  groups. It would improve the work incentives of the current system. 
   I would like now to explain how our proposal achieves all of these objectives: 
   Our system would make the system solvent for as far as the Social Security Actuaries are able to estimate. 
   How does it do this? Above all else, it accomplishes this through advance funding. 
   As the members of this Committee know, our population is aging rapidly. Currently we have a little more than 3 workers paying into the system for every 1 retiree taking out of it. Within a generation, that ratio will be down to 2:1. 
   As a consequence, if we did nothing, future generations would be assessed skyrocketing tax rates in order to meet benefit promises. The projected cost (tax) rate of the Social Security system, according to the Actuaries, will be almost 18% by 2030. 
   The Trust Fund is not currently scheduled to become insolvent until 2034, but as most acknowledge, the existence of the Trust Fund has nothing to do with the government's ability to pay benefits. President Clinton's submitted budget for this year made the point as well as I possibly could:  
   These balances are available to finance future benefit payments and other trust fund expenditures--but only in a bookkeeping sense . . . They do not consist of real economic assets that can be drawn down in the future to fund benefits. Instead, they are claims on the Treasury that, when redeemed, will have to be financed by raising taxes, borrowing from the public, or reducing benefits or other expenditures. The existence of large Trust Fund balances, therefore, does not, by itself, have any impact on the Government's ability to pay benefits.  
   In other words, we have a problem that arises in 2014, not in 2034, and it quickly becomes an enormous one unless we find a way to put aside savings today. This does not mean simply adding a series of credits to the Social Security Trust Fund, which would have no positive impact, as the quote from the President's budget clearly shows. 
   What we have to do is begin to advance fund the current system, and that means taking some of that surplus Social Security money today out of the federal coffers and into a place where it can be saved, invested--owned by individual beneficiaries. That money would belong to them immediately, even though they could not withdraw it before retirement. But it would be a real asset in their name. 
   By doing this, we can reduce the amount of the benefit that needs to be funded in the future by raising taxes on future generations. This is the critical objective, but it allows for flippant political attacks. If you give someone a part of their benefit today, in their personal account, and less of it later on, some will say that it is a ``cut'' in benefits. It is no such thing. Only in Washington can giving people ownership rights and real funding for a portion of their benefits, and increasing their total real value, be construed as a cut. Accepting such terminology can only lead to one conclusion--that we can't advance fund, because we simply have to be sure that every penny of future benefits comes from taxing future workers. So we need to get out of that rhetorical trap. 
   Our proposal has been certified by the actuaries as attaining actuarial solvency, and in fact it goes so far as to slightly overshoot. We are ``overbalanced'' in the years after 2050, and have some room to modify the proposal in some respects and yet still stay in balance. 
   I would note the consensus that has developed for some form of advance funding. This was one of the few recommendations that united an otherwise divided Social Security Advisory Council in 1996. The major disagreements today among policymakers consist only in the area of who should control and direct the investment opportunities created within Social Security. I believe strongly, and I believe a Congressional majority agrees, that this investment should be directed by individual beneficiaries, not by the federal government or any other public board. 
   We have worked with the Social Security actuaries and the Congressional Research Service to estimate the levels of benefits provided under our plan. 
   There are certain bottom-line points that should be recognized about our plan. Among them:

The Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from Louisiana have truly done an extraordinary job of bringing to the attention  of the American public the essential needs to address soon, quickly, and substantively the issue of Social Security reform. 
   I had the pleasure of serving 15 months as cochair, along with the Senator from Louisiana, of a commission of folks put together--a large cross-section of people--who are truly expert in the area of Social Security. As a result of that commission, we produced a bill that was an excellent piece of legislation. We were joined, in a bipartisan way, by Congressmen KOLBE and STENHOLM, Members of the House, on that bill. 
   The Senator from Nebraska has been on his own bill, along with the Senator from New York. They have developed another bill here. Months ago, we decided to get together and see if we could develop an even bigger coalition of membership around one concept of how to reform the Social Security system. That is what we accomplished. It has been accomplished because of the strong and vibrant leadership of those two Senators who are on the floor today, Senators BREAUX and KERREY, and also Senator GRASSLEY, who is not here but may be coming in on a number of other issues that are involved in the Social Security reform matter. His leadership has been excellent. 
   So, first of all, we do have a bipartisan bill. It has been pointed out by the Senator from Nebraska that this bill goes across the aisle, across ideology, and it is a substantive bill. It is a proposal that has been scored by the Social Security actuaries as creating solvency in the Social Security system for the next 100 years, at a minimum. It goes to infinity, but I like to say the next century because it is a more definable event. That is very important. It is a bipartisan effort, which shows it can be done. Second, it works, as scored by the Social Security actuaries. 
   Why is it important? You don't have to look very far to see why. I notice we have many Senate pages with us. These folks are juniors in high school who come here to work. They are either rising juniors, or have completed their junior year in most instances. They come here to work and see Congress in action. When they get finished with their schooling, most of them will go to college. When they get out of college, they are going to go to work. They are going to find that probably the biggest amount that comes out of their paychecks is the FICA tax, a big chunk that comes out of paychecks. They are going to pay that for all their working lives. What are they going to get back under the present system? These wonderful young people are probably hoping I won't speak too long so they can get off for the weekend. But what are they going to get out of this? Actually, they are going to get very little out of it. They will pay out a tremendous amount of taxes during their working lives and they will virtually get nothing back for it. 
   In fact, a person coming into the workforce in their early twenties today--the rate of return on what they pay into Social Security taxes over their working lives, or how much they get back for the amount of taxes they pay, is essentially a wash. They are not going to get any more back than they pay in. That is not much of a return for all the taxes they will pay over all those years. If you happen to be an African American, you actually will get less back, as a group of individuals, than you will end up paying. 
   So the system is broken. Why? It is broken because we have this huge bubble in our society, this huge population bubble called the postwar baby boom generation, of which Bill Clinton is a member, I am a member, the Senator in the Chair is a member, and the Senator from Louisiana is a member. This postwar baby boom generation is the largest demographic group in the history of our country. When Social Security was originally designed, and for all the years it has worked so well, it has always been conceived as a pyramid. It was essentially perceived that there would be many more people paying into the system than would be taking out. So you would have many people 
   earning in order to support the people getting the benefit--a pyramid. 
   In fact, as late as 1950, there were about 15 people paying into the system for every 1 person taking out. By the late part of this century--right about now, in fact--we are down to about 3 1/2 people paying in for every 1 person taking out. When the baby boomers retire, beginning in the year 2008, it starts to accelerate and it becomes an acute situation by 2014, where 2 people will be paying into the system for every 1 taking out. 
   In that sort of a structure, you can see we simply can't support the benefits. Instead of having a pyramid, we basically have some sort of rectangle. The older generation that will be retired--myself included--will be demanding too much in the way of benefits for the younger generation to support. As a result, we end up bankrupting the system. To express it in another way, even though there is a lot of debt in the trust fund, even though the Social Security trust fund, as the Senator from Nebraska pointed out, has literally billions of dollars of IOUs in it, they are simply that; they are paper IOUs. 
   What drives the Social Security problem is the fact that when the baby boom generation retires, there is a benefit that is guaranteed, a defined benefit. As a retiree, under Social Security, when we hit 2010, or whenever I take retirement, I am guaranteed a benefit, a fixed sum of money that I will get under our system of Social Security, a defined benefit. 
   Is there something there to pay that benefit? No, nothing. There are notes held by the Social Security trust, but those notes are not assets in the sense that there is something to back them up that is a physical asset. What backs it up is the taxing of power of the United States. The only way you can pay that defined benefit is to raise taxes on the earners of America to pay the benefits of the retired in America. 
   Because this generation is so huge and the defined benefit becomes so huge, we will have a massive tax increase on the earners of America, starting about the year 2014, and it accelerates radically to the point where we are literally talking, under the President's proposal on Social Security, about $1 trillion annually in new taxes, simply to support those people who are retired by the year 2035--I think it might be a little later. The fact is, it is a huge tax increase. Where do the taxes come from? The earnings of American people. They will come from the general fund, and they will end up essentially bankrupting this country. 
   Something needs to be done. Why have we put this plan forward? You say: It won't happen until the year 2014; that is a long way away; I don't have to worry about that. 
   We have to worry today because we can't answer this type of problem when it happens. We have to anticipate; we have to work to try to correct the problem before we hit the problem. Unfortunately, we are not doing much to get ready for this problem. 
   To address this, we have put forward this bill. What is the basic theme of this bill? The basic theme of this bill is that the way to address the problem of the Social Security liability in the outyears is to begin to save in the early years, say to the American worker today: Start saving for retirement and have some ownership in that savings. Today you think you are saving for retirement under Social Security because you are paying the Social Security taxes, but that doesn't mean anything. The Social Security taxes are being spent by the Federal Government. There is no asset we are building up which the retiree will own. 
   We say under our bill to the wage earner, people earning money in the marketplace--whether the job is a restaurant, a computer store, or whether they are working for the Government--we are going to let you start to save some of the assets you are paying in taxes today for your Social Security. We will allow you to start saving and owning those assets. We will take 2 percent of your 
   present payroll tax and put it in a savings account which you control--you, the wage earner control, which you own. You own that account. You make the decision in a broad term as to how that is invested. 
   We do put limitations on the investment structure so you can't take high-risk investments or speculate. We take an asset, for all Americans paying Social Security tax, which they will physically have and own throughout their earning life, which will grow as they put more into it and which, when they retire, will be available to support  their retirement and to support the costs of the Social Security system. 
   This concept, which is called personal savings accounts, is at the core of what we are proposing as a solution to the problem. These personal savings accounts don't solve the problem completely. I wish we could do it completely with these accounts, but we can't. 
   As the Senator from Nebraska so eloquently and effectively pointed out--I won't retread that water--the fact is, you have to make decisions on the benefit side or you have to make decisions on the tax increase side. That is the only way you can get long-term solvency, unless you have the capacity to refund liability dramatically at a level you can't do because of the cost of supporting the present beneficiaries under the system. 
   There are three ways to solve the Social Security outyear problem: You can raise taxes, cut benefits, or ``prefund'' the liability. What we do is combine two of those. We prefund the liability and adjust the benefit structure. We adjust it in a constructive and effective way, as pointed out by the Senator from Nebraska. 
   The fundamental philosophical change in our bill is giving people ownership over part of their Social Security taxes. We say to folks: You can invest that, you can save it, and when you retire, it will be yours. In fact, it will be yours before you retire. 
   Under the present law, you pay all these Social Security taxes, and if you are unlucky enough to get hit by a train when you are 59 years old, you get nothing, absolutely nothing, from all the taxes you have paid in. What an unfair system that is. 
   We say to people: You are going to have that asset; it will be yours. If you are, unfortunately, hit by a train when you are 59, your family will own that asset. Whoever you want to pass it on to will own that--your wife, your children, cousins, nephews. We give people the opportunity to participate in that extraordinary thing called American capitalism, the marketplace where people can create wealth. 
   Is there a risk? Very little. The way we structured this, we tracked what Federal employees have been doing for years in the Federal Thrift Savings Plan. Any Federal employee can participate in it and have an option of placing some of their pension plan into the marketplace by choosing four different funds in which to invest. Those funds are managed by trustees under the Federal Thrift Savings Plan. One is very conservative, one is a moderate investment, and one is a more aggressive investment. 
   We will use the same type of structure. It will be the Social Security trustees investing these funds. Wage earners will have the right to choose whether they want to aggressively invest, moderately invest, or very conservatively invest. It is your choice. In any event, the rate of return on those assets is going to be dramatically better than the rate of return on the amount of taxes presently paid in the Social Security system. The average rate of return on taxes paid into Social Security is 2.7 percent. As I mentioned, for an earner in their twenties it is essentially zero, and for certain groups it is negative. Under our bill, the lowest rate of return possible is the rate of return of Treasury bills, which is about 3 percent. One could get significantly better than that, obviously. The average rate of return of the equities market over any 20-year period, including the Depression period, has been about 5 1/2 percent. So presume 5 1/2 percent is a number by which one reasonably assumes their assets will increase. 
   That is the essence of what we are doing. We are setting up a plan which, first, is bipartisan; second, it creates solvency in the trust fund for 100 years, the next century; third, it gives people ownership over parts of the assets which they are now paying in taxes over which they have absolutely no ownership. 
   A couple of other points should be made. We do not impact anybody presently in the Social Security system or about to come in the Social Security system. We say to those folks: The system is in place; you are comfortable with it; that is your system; we are not going to touch you in any way. 
   When the scare letters come out from the various groups which use Social Security as a way to try to raise money so people can drive around the city in their limousines and go to fancy restaurants, when the scare letters come out in envelopes looking like Social Security checks, and the letters say they will devastate your Social Security benefits, and they are directed at people already on Social Security, unfortunately, we don't have the wherewithal to send a counter letter. But if people have time to listen, they will know that is not case. We don't impact anyone presently on the Social Security system. 
   Our bill, more than any other that is presently pending on Social Security reform, is progressive. In other words, people at the lower income levels get a much better benefit under the proposal we put forward than people at the higher levels, and they get a better benefit than they would get in the present Social Security system or under any other Social Security proposal out there today, whether they have been scored as solvent or not. It is a progressive system. 
   In fact, a low-income person not only gets to save 2 percent, they can save about 3 1/2 percent in the personal savings account because we set up a system for the next dollar after the 2 percent. They get a $100 match by the Federal Government. 
   It works out so you basically can almost save 3.5 percent if you are in a low-income bracket, and that is a big increase in your net worth over 40 years, a huge increase in your net worth over 40 years, which is the average earning experience in America today. 
   In addition, our plan most importantly treats generations fairly. We are headed into a period, when our generation retires, the baby boom generation retires, when we are simply going to be unfair to younger generations. What we are going to do to them under the present Social Security system is absolutely wrong. We are going to tax this younger generation into a much lower level quality of life in order to support our retirement. Is that right? Of course, it is not right, but that is exactly what is going to happen if we do not address the Social Security problem and address it soon so we can start to build the assets necessary to prefund the liabilities, as I mentioned earlier. 
   Our bill addresses that issue. Our bill tries to right that shift of fairness between our generation and the younger generation, and it does it very effectively, and it is an important effort. 
   Importantly, our bill creates an atmosphere where people will have confidence in the Social Security system. There are a lot of people who say: I am not going to get anything when I retire. I am just going to pay a lot of taxes. I am not going to get anything. 
   And they are right if they happen to be a certain ethnic group or certain age level. Our bill will restore the confidence in the Social Security system, and that is absolutely critical. 
   In addition, we understand women have especially been disproportionately impacted by the present system. They are not treated as fairly as they should be. There are two reasons: No. 1, because many women weren't in the workforce, and No. 2, because they live longer. Our bill makes some very significant efforts in order to address the special needs of women, especially widows, in the Social Security benefits area. These were put together by the Senator from Iowa, to a large extent. 
   They are positive efforts to give women the opportunity to get the benefit structure that is fair to them and also encourage women to raise children at home. It could be a man, of course, but in most cases it would be a woman who wants to leave her job and raise her child for up to 5 years. She will be able to do that without being penalized by the Social Security system for having taken those 5 years out of the workforce and then coming back into the workforce. It is a very important step towards fairness towards women and especially women who decide to raise children. 
   I know the Senator from Louisiana wants to speak on this. He has certainly been a core player, a key player on this issue, as well as so many others. But on Medicare specifically, let me say this. We, as policy people, have an absolute obligation to pursue and accomplish Social Security reform in this Congress. There is no way we can justify passing up this opportunity. We have a President who does not have to  run for reelection, so he is under no political pressure to make a political decision. He has the flexibility and freedom to make the decisions that should be made in order to resolve this type of problem. 
   We know if we do not act, we will begin to run out of time quickly. We know if we cannot set up these personal accounts to start creating assets and letting those assets grow through compounded interest--which Einstein said was the greatest force known to mankind--we know if we do not get those assets started and get those accounts begun, we are going to end up running out of time, and we will not be able to solve the problem effectively. So we know we have to act. It is similar to that old oil filter ad, ``You can pay me now or pay me later.'' We know we have to act now, so we should be taking action. 
   We know it can be done because this bill proves it. It can be done in a bipartisan way and it can be done in a way that can be scored and approved by the Social Security trustees as working, so there is no argument about doing it and being able to do it. All we need now is the political will to do it, and that is going to take Presidential leadership. 
   Although the President has spoken on this issue a number of times, he has not given us the type of leadership we need to accomplish the goal. But if he wants to step forward, this is a great opportunity to do it. This bill gives him the vehicle to do it. I certainly hope he will take advantage of that chance. 
   In any event, I thank my fellow Senators who have worked so hard on this. I believe we have laid out a method that can control and move this forward in a positive way. I hope we can move from only the academic discussion of a bill to the passage of a law. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment goes to one of the critical issues in the Kennedy health care bill that we have been debating for the last few days, which is the fact that the bill dramatically expands lawsuits in this country. 
   Our Nation is already far too litigious; 2.2 percent of our gross national product goes into lawsuits every year. That is literally hundreds of billions of dollars every year absorbed in our legal system--dollars that could be used much more productively. 
   Compared to other nations in the world, we are the most litigious by far. For example, Japan only uses about .8 percent of its gross national product for lawsuits. Canada, our neighbor, uses about .5 percent of its gross national product for lawsuits. These lawsuits that have, for years, been used against individuals and manufacturers accomplish some good, but in many instances they end up chilling events, creating greater costs for consumers and causing such things as research to be retarded, especially in the area of health care. This is a sensitive issue because things such as the development of new devices and the need for doctors to practice defensive medicine are issues that are highlighted and aggressively expanded by the expensive use of lawsuits. 
   Just this week, for example, we saw a $4 billion judgment--$4 billion--against one manufacturer in this country. That type of judgment against a medical manufacturer, for example, would end up being passed on to the consumers through an increase in premiums and an increase in the cost of insurance. 
   We are as a society simply too litigious. In many areas we as a society--as a government--have decided that lawsuits should be not cut off but at least curtailed to some degree. 
   However, the other side of the aisle has come forward with a bill which would dramatically expand the number of lawsuits available in this country. It would essentially be the ``Kennedy Annuity for Attorneys Act'' rather than a health care bill. This bill, as proposed by the other side, would create the opportunity for 48 million more incidents of lawsuits involving 48 million more individuals, which could then be multiplied in a geometric progression. 
   Let's just take one situation. Right here, we have the example of how 137 different doctors might treat one simple type of medical problem, ``uncomplicated urinary tract infection.'' There are 82 different treatments from 137 different treating physicians. If one of these doctors picked a treatment which didn't work, under the Kennedy bill that would immediately open a brand new lawsuit against a variety of different individuals, including the employer, the HMO, and the insurer. That lawsuit could be multiplied literally by hundreds of different treatments and hundreds of different opportunities, because this bill dramatically expands the opportunity for lawsuits. 
   Another example of the expansion of lawsuit opportunity under this bill is this chart. All these different blue lines are new regulatory actions which are available under the Kennedy bill. Fifty-six new causes of action are created under this bill. It is truly an explosion of opportunity for attorneys to bring lawsuits. 
   There would be a whole new business enterprise created in this country, and it would be a massive enterprise, the purpose of which would be to bring lawsuits under the Kennedy bill. And the practical implications of this are that the cost of health care in this country would go up dramatically. 
   The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this bill, the Kennedy bill, because of the lawsuit language which allows attorneys to go out and sue in a variety of different areas--which right now they do not have the opportunity to sue in--would increase the cost of premiums by 1.4 percent. 
   What does that mean? That means that approximately 600,000 Americans would be thrown off the insurance rolls. The practical effect of this expansion in lawsuits is that you would see a dramatic expansion in the cost of health care in this country and an equally dramatic expansion in the number of uninsured in this country. 
   In addition, the cost of insurance for doctors would go up dramatically. Under a study done by the doctors' insurance agents--not necessarily the HMO insurance agents or the health plan insurance agents but, rather, the doctors--it is estimated that the premiums on the errors and omissions policies of doctors would go up somewhere between 8 and 20 percent relative to the ERISA part of their insurance. 
   This means we would see a massive expansion of defensive medicine being practiced. We already know that defensive medicine is practiced excessively in this country, which means procedures undertaken not because the doctor believes they have to be undertaken but they are undertaken to protect a doctor from a lawyer. We would see a massive expansion of this defensive medicine by doctors. 
   What does that do? That drives up the cost of medicine, and it does very little to improve the quality of care. 
   Equally important, what we would see is a deterioration in the availability of doctors to practice specialties, which are unique and needed in rural areas--especially OB/GYN--which we have already seen driven out of many rural areas in this country because of the cost of the error and omissions policies. An 8 to 20 percent increase in the cost of those policies would have a devastating impact on an area of medicine which is already underrepresented in the rural parts of this country. 
   Six-hundred thousand fewer insured people, and what do we get for this expansion in lawsuits? What does the consumer get for this huge expansion in lawsuits? They get a lot more attorneys. There is no question about that. They get a lot more wealthy attorneys. There is no question about that. They will get a lot more attorneys who will be able to contribute to the Democratic National Committee. There is no question about that. The trial lawyers  love this Kennedy bill. They are enthusiastic for this bill. If there is a basic beneficiary for the Kennedy bill, it is the trial lawyers in this country. That is what I call this bill. It is the ``attorneys' annuity bill'' rather than the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   What do the consumers get when they get involved in these lawsuits? They will get very little. Will they get greater care? No. They will have to go to court to get care under this bill. A lawsuit has to be brought. Do they get better results? Absolutely not. The attorneys get 54 percent of the recovery. That leaves the litigants with a combined 46 percent after this, one-half being an economic loss and one-half being compensation for pain and suffering. 
   It makes very little sense when you realize that the only winners under the Kennedy bill are actually the attorneys in the expansion of lawsuits that will occur as a result of the bill. 
   So where does that bring us? We have come up with a better idea in our bill. We say that rather than creating a brand new opportunity to create all sorts of new lawsuits and add a lot of new attorneys to the American culture, who really add very little in the way of productivity--or better medicine, for that matter--let's let doctors take a look at what doctors are deciding for patients. 
   Under our bill, a patient, rather than having to go to court to have their concerns addressed, gets to have their concerns addressed by, first, a doctor in the specialty dealing with the type of problem the patient has within the clinic or the group by which the person is being served. That doctor is independent. That doctor makes a decision: Did that patient have the right care or did that patient have the wrong care? Or should that patient get more care? If the patient isn't comfortable with that decision, then the patient can go outside the clinic, outside the insurance group, and have another doctor, who is appointed after having been prequalified by a certified either State or Federal agency, and have another doctor review that patient's care. 
   If that doctor decides that the patient needs some other type of care--something that the clinic or the interests group did not decide that the patient should have--then that is binding. It is binding on the insurance group. There is an independent review at two different points, one inside and one outside, done by doctors who have a binding decision on the patient. If the patient again is uncomfortable with that decision, then the patient can bring a suit. But it is limited as to amount of damages, and it is limited to the cost of the event. 
   The practical approach they have put forward is to try to get the patient care, and get the patient good care and efficient care quickly, and make sure they have gotten fair treatment and they have had a review by the appropriate doctors. 
   As a result, we reduce the cost of health care. As a result, we keep more people insured. As a result, we allow more people to participate in health insurance in this country. As a result, I admit that we do not create as many opportunities for attorneys to bring lawsuits. That is absolutely right. We do not create a bill that basically underwrites the legal profession in this country. That is absolutely right. We assist patients in getting care. 
   That is a big difference between these two bills. The Democratic bill, the ``Attorneys' Annuity Act,'' the ``Kennedy Patients' Bill of Rights,'' is essentially a bill to promote attorneys. Our bill is a bill to promote health care. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

I do want to point out the Senator from North Dakota, although well informed in most instances, on the issue of suing health care plans of Senators he is not informed. The fact is, under our plan we cannot sue the insurer. We are limited in our rights to sue, and our ability to recover is also  significantly limited--in fact, about the same way it is limited in our bill. I would point that out as a point of clarification.

   Mr. GREGG. I yield myself 5 minutes off the bill. I will be the last speaker, so Members can understand there will be a vote in about 5 minutes--two votes. I stand corrected. 
   There have been a lot of representations in this argument in the last hour and a half or so. Let me make a couple points. 
   First off, once again, the Senator from Illinois cites the wrong number of people covered by this proposal. That does not really go to the core of the issue, but it should be clarified. The Senator from New Jersey said there are only two classes of people who are covered by this type of situation, diplomats and insurance companies. Actually Senators and members of the Government are covered in the same way.  In fact, it was an OPM directive from the Clinton administration on April 5, 1996. I will simply quote from it. It says:  
   Legal actions to review actions by OPM involving such denials of health benefits must be brought against OPM and not against the carrier or the carrier subcontractor.  
   It further states those actions can only be for certain limited amounts of recovery. So essentially we are tracking that proposal which is what Senators are presently covered by. 
   Also, the Senator from Massachusetts said--and this point was made by the Senator from Washington--that, yes, our proposals cost $13 billion and, yes, your proposals cost billions of dollars. 
   But there is a little bit of difference. We cut taxes. We give people assets. We put money in their pockets. We say to your folks: You can go out and use that money to benefit your family. Your proposals increase the cost of premiums and drive people out of the health care system and create more uninsured people. There is a fairly significant difference between the two cost functions of these two bills. 
   But this amendment goes to the fact that the proposal from the other side of the aisle essentially dramatically expands the number of lawsuits which will be brought in the United States, lawsuits which will be brought in all these different areas by aggressive and creative attorneys, lawsuits which today and under our bill would be settled under a procedure which is reasonable, which has independent doctors looking at the issue. Those decisions, by doctors who are independently chosen by independent authorities, are binding, binding on the health care provider group. 
   So we take out all these lawyers, all these attorneys. I think of this one procedure I cited before where you have literally 137 doctors talking about 82 different ways to treat one different type of health complication. That can be multiplied by thousands, if not millions, giving literally millions upon millions of opportunities for attorneys to bring lawsuits because one doctor shows treatment A and another doctor chose treatment A-82 or B-82. 
   The fact is the decision should not be made by an attorney. That decision should be made by an outside doctor who has independence, who is chosen by an independent group, and who has binding authority. 
   The end product of this bill will be to create a lot of new attorneys in this country having a lot of new opportunities to bring a lot of new lawsuits. In fact, there has been an lot of hyperbole on this floor. I want to put it in perspective. It might be hyperbole, but it is still fairly accurate. 
   There is a show on Saturday morning that I enjoy listening to on National Public Radio. Some may be surprised that I enjoy listening to National Public Radio, but I do. The show is 
   called ``Car Talk.'' In ``Car Talk,'' there is a law firm in Cambridge, MA. I know it is euphemistic, but they call them, so far: Dewey, Cheatum & Howe? They represent the folks on ``Car Talk.'' Their offices are somewhere in Cambridge in Car Talk Plaza, and they represent the Tappet Brothers. Today I think they have three attorneys: Dewey, Cheatum & Howe. 
   If this bill is passed, Dewey, Cheatum & Howe are going to have to build a new building in Cambridge, and they are going to have all these attorneys working for them because that is how many people will be needed to bring all the lawsuits that are going to be proposed under this bill as a result of its expansion. 
   What is the serious, ultimate outcome of this? It drives up costs. That is the serious ultimate outcome. It was almost treated as if that was an irrelevancy by one of the other speakers. Well, 1.4 percent of the premiums are going to go up. That does not mean anything? I say 1.4 percent translates into 600,000 people. 
   There have been a lot of pictures brought to the floor about people who have not gotten adequate health care, and I am sure their stories are compelling. But this floor would be filled if we put up the 600,000 pictures of people who will lose their health care insurance--filled right up to the ceiling by people who no longer have health care insurance as a result of all these lawsuits driving up all these costs for health care. 
   As the Senator from Pennsylvania pointed out, what will be the outcome of that? What will be the outcome of all these people being put out of their health care insurance because the cost has gone up so much? These are CBO's estimates, not mine. It will be that somebody will come to the floor from the other side of the aisle saying: We have to nationalize the whole system in order to take care of all the uninsured we just created by creating all these lawsuits for all these attorneys to pursue. What a disingenuous approach to health care, in my opinion. 
   The Republican plan has a constructive way to approach this. It leaves the decision of care to the patient, to be reviewed by a doctor, who is independently chosen, who is in the specialty where the patient needs the care. That decision is binding, binding on the health care provider. 
   I hope Senators will join me in supporting my amendment which voids the language which expands the lawyers' part of this bill. 
   I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I have a question for the Senator from North Carolina which is in reference to the Kennedy bill, section 133, subsection (1)(ii), on page 67:  
   If an applicable authority permits--  
   That will be the State authority--  
   more than one entity to qualify as a qualified external appeals entity with respect to a group health plan or health insurer issuer, then the plan or issuer may select among such qualified entities the applicable plan.  
   So basically if the State picks two or three different reviewers, under your plan, then the plan gets to choose; isn't that correct?

   Mr. GREGG. I, therefore, take it in the Kennedy plan, when it says, ``the plan or issuer may select among such qualified entities,'' that that language is not operative, that that does not exist, that that language is a nonfactor. 
   Let's get serious. This is what your bill says. It says the plans can be selected from the qualified entities. You can pick two or three plans, that the States have chosen to qualify two or three plans, and the people pick the plans. So you are totally inconsistent with your argument.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to comment on the President's proposal relating to Medicare, and specifically relevant to the drug benefit which has been put forward by the President today and by his staff. 
   I think the American people have to look at this in the context of the history of this administration's efforts in the area of health care. We know that when this administration came into office, Mrs. Clinton was assigned the task of developing a health care proposal. She came up with what has become known as ``Hillary Care,'' which was essentially a nationalization of the health care system. It was intricate bureaucracy that basically was so interwoven and so complex that it was totally impossible to recognize. 
   It needs to be noted in evaluating the drug component on this recent proposal on Medicare, the proposal of the  Clinton administration on general health care issues as it came forward under Mrs. Clinton's plan, known as ``Hillary Care,'' was a dramatic invasion of the health care delivery system in this country by the Federal Government. It was essentially a nationalization of the system with huge complexities and huge intricacies. That was followed by a number of other initiatives which were lesser but equally aggressive in their attempts to move to the Federal level control over functions of health care in this country. 
   Then on the issue of Medicare, a commission was set up. The commission was to be balanced. In fact, the President had a large number of appointments to it, and the Senate and House had a large number of appointments to it. It was chaired by a Democratic Member of the Senate, Senator BREAUX. 
   That commission was to resolve this matter. It was to come forward with a proposal to address the long-term solvency of Medicare and, within that, the drug benefit for senior citizens. The commission did great work, yeoman's work. They came up with a proposal. More than a majority, a significant majority, of the commission supported the proposal which had in it a drug component, and the President walked away from the proposal, even though the proposal had been supported by a majority of the commission which he was instrumental in setting up and to which he appointed the chairman, who was Senator BREAUX from this body. 
   The question of his most recent proposal on Medicare, I believe, has to be looked at in that context, and therefore it becomes a question of whether or not the proposal put forward by the President, most recently today, is a serious proposal or is it a political proposal. If it is a serious proposal, why is it not in step with the Breaux commission, and if it is a political proposal, what is its purpose? 
   Let's look at it quickly. Nobody has had a great deal of time to analyze it, but if you look at it quickly, it appears to be a proposal that is turning on its head the basic purposes of a drug benefit. 
   The Breaux commission suggested that the purpose of a drug benefit should be to make sure the beneficiary, the person paying the drug costs, was not wiped out by the cost of the drugs. That is a reasonable position. Essentially, the Breaux commission concluded that we should have some way of saying to a senior citizen who ends up with a huge amount of drug costs that if you are hit with a catastrophic drug cost, there is going to be some protection for you and some coverage for you. 
   This proposal from the President does the opposite. Instead of covering a catastrophic drug event where a senior citizen has to buy a lot of drugs to maintain their health over a period of a year and, thus, runs up huge bills which basically deplete their assets, this proposal has first-dollar coverage. The first-dollar coverage stops when it gets to $2,000, I believe, of drug expenditures, which means that if a senior citizen has a large number of drug expenditures, essentially the senior citizen is still going to be wiped out by those costs. 
   It makes much more sense to approach it the way the Breaux commission approaches it and the way most people have looked at the issue, which is, you say to a senior citizen or anyone else: Listen, you have to be responsible for the cost up to 
   a certain level, and when you get to that level which would threaten your economic solvency, at that point the Federal Government will come in and assist you in paying the drug costs, which would be catastrophic coverage and makes much more sense than the proposal which has first-dollar coverage, if you are putting forward a plan which has as its purpose the actual correction of the present problems occurring in the health care community relative to drug costs. 
   The proposal the President puts forward makes no sense substantively on the issue of paying for drug costs, because it does not benefit anybody if they have a catastrophic amount of drug costs. It may make sense, however, politically because it says to a senior citizen, we are going to cover you for first-dollar coverage of your drug costs, which means you can say to all seniors, you no longer have a drug cost for up to $2,000, which means a lot of seniors will be covered, but of course those seniors who are most at risk, who have lots of drug expenditures, who exceed $2,000 in drug expenditures, are thrown out like the baby with the bathwater, but at least politically you pick up the vast majority of seniors who have lower drug costs. 
   One has to look at that benefit and say that is a more politically driven benefit structure than a benefit structure directed at the problem, which is the huge amount of drug costs on senior citizens and the fact it can wipe out their assets. 
   One has to look at another issue, which is, we all know a drug benefit is very expensive for the Federal Government, and therefore for the taxpayers, and when we are talking about taxpayers, we are talking about younger taxpayers who are paying to support the senior citizens. 
   We have a transfer of income from younger working Americans into senior citizens' accounts, and one would expect, therefore, in looking at that, we would be saying: Seniors who are doing well--and a large number of seniors in our society are, fortunately, because we have been able to create an atmosphere where many seniors have a fair amount of income, and, as a matter of fact, as a matter disposable income, people over age 65 have more disposable income than in their working years when they were in their twenties and thirties. For the most part, you could say those people are doing really well. 
   For example, say, Bill Gates' parents, who probably have a fair amount of stock in Microsoft, may be retired. I do not know if his parents are retired or not. I am using that as an example. Someone who is extremely wealthy who is retired, one would not expect their drug benefits to suddenly be subsidized by somebody who is working in a restaurant, a gas station, or on a computer assembly line in Nashua, NH. 
   Yet what the President has put forward is a plan that does just that. He put forward a plan where working Americans, Americans who are just trying to make ends meet, where both parents are having to work in order to take care of household expenditures, who are under tremendous financial pressure, are going to have to subsidize the drug benefit of all senior citizens, no matter what their income level. 
   A high-income senior citizen, somebody who happens to be a member of a famous family that has made millions of dollars, or somebody who is not even a member of a famous family but happens to have a tremendous amount of wealth--Charlton Heston, for example, I suspect he has been successful--that person's drug benefit under Medicare will suddenly become a 
   subsidized event paid for by a working American. 
   Does that make sense? No; that is upside down. Obviously, if you are going to have a drug benefit for senior citizens, it should really apply to those seniors who need the benefit and who cannot afford it. That happened to be the proposal that came out of the Breaux commission. They suggested people up to 135 percent, I believe, of poverty be allowed to get the drug benefit and have it subsidized and people over 135 percent would not have that event occur. Therefore, people with higher incomes would not end up being subsidized by working Americans who maybe cannot afford to subsidize the drug benefit of senior citizens because they have to take care of their own household expenditures. 
   Yet this proposal from the administration has not taken the tack of the Breaux commission which says: Let's take care of those seniors who need the assistance, but let the seniors who can afford to pay for their own drugs pay for them. They turned it upside down: Let's take care of all seniors at the expense of working Americans, maybe even Americans who have trouble making ends meet. 
   That leads one to the question: Why are they doing this? Is this the substantively right thing to do? Is it the politically correct thing to do? Yes, it is, because we all know when it comes to senior citizen accounts, there is tremendous reticence within the senior citizen activist community in this country to have any sort of means testing, which is what this amounts to, or affluence testing, which is where it would lead to. Yet they allow Americans to subsidize extremely wealthy  Americans, not only for the drug benefit as proposed by the President but, unfortunately, as the President did in part B premiums, they are willing to allow that truly inappropriate action to occur for the political benefit of it. Once again, what we are seeing is a political initiative. 
   Then if you look at the proposal in its outline form, you can see it is going to create an intricate, complex, bureaucratic structure to determine what benefit is covered and is available to be picked up by the Federal Government under the drug benefit cost. There is going to have to be some sort of extremely complex structure. They turned it over to HCFA, which is an agency that has the capacity to develop a complex structure, but there will need to be some sort of national structure set up in order to account for what is and is not covered under the system the President has set up in his proposal. 
   One gets the feeling we are looking again at the use of the Federal bureaucracy as the agency to manage the day-to-day activities of health care. We know from experience that does not work too well. 
   This proposal the President has put forward is, on its face, upside down on core basic issues of better health care, whether it happens to be the premium, whether it happens to be the means testing, or whether it happens to be the bureaucracy. 
   I think the thing that I find most dangerous about this proposal, and the thing I am most concerned about, is the effect on lifestyle of American seniors because it puts us on an extraordinarily slippery slope, in its present structure, which will most likely lead to a diminution of the effort of the American entrepreneurial culture to produce better drugs for seniors. 
   A great number of American citizens today benefit dramatically from the fact that we have the most vibrant, innovative drug research and development industry in the world. We have an industry which is second to none in producing products that make people's lives better. 
   But it is an extremely expensive undertaking. It takes 12 years and hundreds of millions of dollars to bring a drug to the market. The only way that these entrepreneurs can undertake that initiative is if they are able to go out in the marketplace and get the capital necessary to take that type of risk to produce those drugs. 
   When you start having the Federal bureaucracy manage who can and who cannot buy a drug and what drug has to be bought and what drug cannot be bought, as will inevitably be, I suspect, the outcome of this initiative, as it moves into its second- and third-generation event--and was the intention, by the way, of the Hillary health care plan, so we know that we can suspect that is in the back of somebody's mind around here--then your ultimate outcome will be to have a chilling effect, a dramatic dampening effect on the innovative minds of America, on the scientists of America who are producing the new drugs which make people's lives better because those scientists and those innovators are not going to be able to get funds through the capital markets to underwrite their undertakings. 
   Why? Because if you are a capital investor, as Mr. Greenspan has so often told us, the capital markets are the most efficient markets in the world. Money flows for capital where it gets the return that makes the most sense for those dollars. People are not going to invest in drug research and development if they are not going to get adequate return. They are not going to get adequate return on it if you have a Federal bureaucracy taking over the control of the pricing mechanisms or the appropriate drugs to be purchased--both of which are potential outcomes of any plan put forward by this administration because that, as we have already seen, is a goal that is in the back of the mind of this administration. So although it is not a stated risk, it is, in my opinion, a clear undercurrent of risk as we step into this area of drug benefit for senior citizens. 
   The ultimate conclusion of this, of course, is that I think the President's proposal is political, not substantive. If the President wanted to substantively pursue a drug proposal, a drug benefit for senior citizens that would work, that had been well vetted and well thought out intelligently, he would have adopted the proposal of his own commission, the Breaux Commission. That was rejected in order to take the path of the political initiative. I think we should be very suspicious before we step on to that path as a Congress. 
   Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I think it is appropriate to respond to some of the commentary from the other side about the Patients' Bill of Rights--the Republican plan versus the Kennedy bill, the proposal that the other side has put forth. 
   The American public should know and recognize that a majority in this Congress is for moving on an effective proposal and for addressing the needs of the American citizens relative to dealing with HMOs, and that is the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights. It is a very good package of ideas put together after a long and serious amount of consideration. It came out of the committee of jurisdiction with a majority vote, is now on the floor, and has received a majority vote in the Senate. It would significantly improve the situation of patients as they deal with doctors and HMOs across this country. 
   I think, however, that it also ought to be noted on the other side of the coin that what Senator KENNEDY's proposal does is to continue the Clinton health care plan that we saw about 5 years ago--I guess it was 5 years ago now--``Hillary-Care,'' as it came to be known. This is sort of the daughter of ``Hillary-Care'' or son of ``Hillary-Care,'' as put forth by the Senator from Massachusetts. Essentially, if you are going to be honest about the practical effect of the proposal of the Senator from Massachusetts, it is to increase the premiums for private health insurance in this country by at least 4 percent potentially; other estimates have been as high as 6 percent. 
   When you start raising the premiums for health insurance--especially on self-insured individuals--the impact of that is that people drop out of the health care insurance system. Why is that? Because they can't afford it. If you are a small business of five or six employees, if you are running a restaurant, or if you are running an auto shop or a small software company, and your costs go up 4 percent on your health care premium, that can amount to a significant cost increase, and in many instances that is going to be the difference between making it and not making it in some of these small companies. So you have a situation where people drop the insurance. 
   The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the practical effect of the Kennedy health care plan will be that well over 1 million people will drop their health insurance. Why is this important? Why does this tie into ``Hillary-Care''? Because, if you will recall, back in the days when we were debating the issues of ``Hillary-Care,'' the basic proposal was to create a nationalized system where the Federal Government would come in and take over all insurance carriers in this country, for all intents and purposes, with the logic behind that being that there were too many uninsured people in the health market to date, too many Americans simply did not have health care insurance, and therefore we needed to have ``Hillary-Care.'' 
   Nationalization of the health care industry was proposed at that time, and the Kennedy bill was introduced by Senator KENNEDY on behalf the First Lady, and the proposal was, let's nationalize the system so all the uninsured in this country will have a system of insurance. 
   Of course, it failed miserably, because it was incredibly complex, it was incredibly bureaucratic, and it was extraordinarily expensive for the American taxpayer. The cost increase and the tax burden for the American taxpayer would have far exceeded any savings in premium that would have occurred, and the cost in bureaucracy and the loss of effectiveness in the administration of health care in this country would have had a major impact on the quality of health care. 
   So out of common sense, good sense, and good politics, the program was rejected out of hand, and in fact it never came to a vote in the Senate because, quite honestly, a majority on the other side of the aisle was embarrassed by the proposal and they decided to walk away from it. 
   What we have here is essentially is an extension of that, because what we have is a back-door proposal to health care. Unhappy with the fact that they were unable to nationalize the health care system, in order to cover those folks who do not have enough health insurance, they have now decided, by bits and pieces, through small slices--this one is a very large slice but through smaller slices of the pie--to 
   slowly uninsure Americans. So there is such a large pool of uninsured Americans that we will have to come back to a ``Hillary-Care'' system so there will be justification for nationalization of the health insurance industry, because there will be all these uninsured people out there who have been created and, because of a lack of insurance, we will have to create legislation. 
   Because of all of these different actions taken--proposals such as we are seeing today on ``Kennedy-Care,'' which will create another 1 million-plus people who are uninsured--next year we will have another proposal which will create another group of uninsured and there will be another proposal to increase the cost of insurance. And they will add something else to private insurance costs--some new benefit, or initiative--that will have all sorts of trappings of nice political sounds so that they will need to raise the cost of insurance premiums. So more people will step off of insurance, and more and more people will end up being uninsured over a period of time, and we will end up with just more people becoming uninsured as we continue  down the road of adopting these initiatives which are put forward by the Senator from Massachusetts. 
   I will tell you, I think the basic game plan here is to create such a pool of uninsured people in this country that we have to turn the corner and come all the way back so that the Senator from Massachusetts and the First Lady can come to us again and say, now, we really need to nationalize the health care system because we have all of these uninsured people. 
   I think there is a bit of a cynical game plan behind the Democratic proposal, the Kennedy plan. Maybe I am being too suspicious, but, as a practical matter, I think I am being accurate and I am observing what the factual events will be. 
   The fact is that because of the premium costs that will increase, which are going to be driven by ``Kennedy-Care,'' as proposed by this bill, we will end up with more people uninsured, and the more people that become uninsured in this country, the greater the demand from the other side of the aisle will be for a nationalized system of health care. 
   I will tell you, if a nationalized system of health care was a bad idea 5 years ago, it would be a bad idea today, and it will be an idea 5 years from now when we hear from the other side of the aisle how important it is because so many people had to drop off the health care system, because they increased the premiums on the health care system by passing their proposed Kennedy health care bill. 
   I just wanted to make some of those comments in response to some of the comments from the other side. 
   I think it is ironic that we are holding up agriculture appropriations over the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights. I have never been a great fan of the way we fund agriculture in this country, as the Senator in the Chair knows. We have been discussing this issue for a number of years both in the House and in the Senate. I recognize that the farmers in this country are a critical part of our economy and that this agricultural appropriations bill is the reasonable, responsible way of addressing those farmers' needs. 
   We have heard about the crisis in the farm community from the other side of the aisle ad nauseam now for 3 months, and suddenly we are about to pass the agriculture appropriations bill, and on the other side of the aisle Senators from farm 
   States come forward and say, no, we can't do the agriculture appropriations bill. 
   As someone who is not from a farm-community State--I have a few farmers, but they are not the dominant culture in New Hampshire. We wish they were. They are certainly wonderful, hard-working people. But as somebody who is not from a farm-culture State, I have to scratch my head and say, is the crisis real? If these folks on the other side of the aisle, who for months have been telling us about the severe crisis in farm country, come forward when we are about to do the agriculture appropriations bill and delay it for weeks and weeks, and potentially even months, I ask, is the crisis real in farm country? Should I, when we get another supplemental appropriations bill which has another few billion dollars for the farm crisis, take that seriously, or are we being ``gamed"? 
   I think they put into serious jeopardy the reasonable arguments that have been put forward from our side of the aisle by the Senator from Kansas and the Senator from Montana, who understand the farm issue and who make good arguments on behalf of the farm issue. Those folks who are credible on the farm issue on our side of the aisle are having their credibility undercut by this type of action from the other side of the aisle, which really plays games with the farm crisis and really dilutes the arguments on the farm crisis when they are willing to delay the funding of the farm bill for what is clearly a political initiative undertaken for the purposes of trying to generate a higher polling rate than some poll taken in some political election. 
   To me, there is a fair amount of cynicism in this Senate today, and most of it is being promoted by the actions brought forward by Members on the other side of the aisle. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield for a question, I noticed that the Democratic leader held up a list of the vote and pointed out that 54 Republicans voted to overrule rule XVI, and that three Democratic Members, I guess, voted with us. Then that would mean that the balance of the Democratic membership--well into the 40s--voted for maintaining rule XVI. As I understand that argument, we are basically saying those guys were right.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, Senator LIEBERMAN and I today introduce a resolution which asks that June 20, Father's Day, be further designated as ``National Father's Return Day.'' The purpose of this resolution is to highlight the fact that fathers are needed in the family. 
   I heard Governor George Bush speak this past weekend in New Hampshire, and one of the things that really resonated with me was that he said the most important job we have is not being a Governor or being a Senator or being head of an assembly line or working at a restaurant; the most important job we have is to be good moms and pops. That is absolutely true. Unfortunately, in our country today, one out of every three children is currently in a household without a father. That has a devastating impact on the manner in which these children perceive life and the manner in which these children are raised. 
   We all know that in this time of difficult economic activity, where, unfortunately, it does take two parents working to raise a family in many households, there is great stress on the family to begin with and there is always the question of enough family time. There is always the question of having enough time to be with our children and have our children get from their parents the values and the ideas that are so critical. 
   Coupled with the fact that so many children are being raised in households where there is no father, it is absolutely critical that we refocus ourselves on the importance of the father in the household and that we say to those fathers who maybe have left the household and are not spending the type of time they should with their children, who are not coming back as regularly as they should or not taking the extra initiatives, the extra time it takes to be with their children during periods when it is convenient for both the mother and the father: Think about this, think about what you are doing, and think about your obligations as a father. 
   So this initiative which we put forward today, this resolution to designate June 20 as National Father's Return Day, has as its purpose to highlight this fact and to say to fathers throughout our Nation, think about your opportunity as a father, not only fathers outside the home but fathers who are still in the nuclear family,  think about your responsibilities and make sure you are living up to that obligation, because as a Nation I think we must all understand we are never going to be able to be a nation of values, a nation of moral strength, a nation of purpose, unless we give our children, the next generation, a sense of purpose, a sense of values, and a sense of moral strength. The father plays a major role in accomplishing that. 
   So this resolution, which I will not read in its entirety, although it is an excellent resolution, I must admit, has as its resolve clause:  
   Be it Resolved, That the Senate--

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to clarify points regarding the Army Corps of Engineers maintenance dredging projects in the State of New Hampshire. 
   Maintenance dredging of Little Harbor, in Portsmouth, remains a top priority for the State of New Hampshire and is important to regional and recreational commercial boating users who continue to operate with navigational safety hazards. Environmental mitigation matters associated with the federal project have been addressed by an interagency task force. Proposed dredging, dredged material disposal, and mitigation arrangements are currently being addressed by the Army Corps of Engineers in an Environmental Assessment. 
   Piscataqua River shoaling remains a top priority for the State of New Hampshire. Shoaling has occurred in the major shipping lane at Portsmouth Harbor. Last year 6 million tons of cargo, mostly petroleum products, passed through the Piscataqua River. It is imperative for navigational and environmental safety that the shipping lane be cleared at the earliest possible opportunity. The Army Corps of Engineers is currently developing an Environmental Impact Study. 
   Sagamore Creek is also a priority for the State of New Hampshire. Maintenance dredging of Sagamore Creek is important to the New Hampshire Commercial Fishing Industry as it functions as a transit channel and is the back channel to Little Harbor. Appropriated funds would allow the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct required hydrographic and material testing to  initiative project. Sagamore Creek is being abandoned by the New Hampshire Commercial Fishing Fleet due to lack of clearance and navigational safety concerns. 
   I respectfully ask the distinguished chairman to consider the importance of these projects as this bill develops and to help the Corps in addressing these pressing priorities which are so important in my state.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today, I join my esteemed colleagues Senator COLLINS and CONRAD in introducing the Rural Education Initiative Act (REA). This Act represents a bipartisan approach to address the unique needs of 35% of school districts in the United States, specifically small, rural school districts. It does not authorize any new money. Rather, REA amends the Rural Education Demonstration Grants under Part J, of Title X, of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) and retains the current ESEA authorization of up to $125 million for rural education programs. 
   Rural school districts are at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to both receiving and using federal education funds. They either don't receive enough federal funds to run the program for which the funds are allocated or don't receive federal funds for programs for which they have to fill out applications. Small rural school districts rarely apply for federal competitive grants because they lack the resources and expertise required to fill out complicated and time intensive applications for federal education grants, which means that rural school districts lose out on millions of federal education dollars each year. 
   The Rural Education Initiative Act addresses both the problem of rural school districts' inability to generate enough money under federal formula grants to run a program and the problem of rural school districts' inability to compete for federal discretionary grants. 
   With regard to federal education formula grants, REA permits rural school districts to merge funds from the President's 100,000 New Teachers program and several Elementary and Secondary Education Act programs, specifically Eisenhower Professional Development, Safe and Drug Free Schools, Innovative Education Program Strategies. Under REA, school districts can pool funds from these federal education programs and use the money for a variety of activities that the district believes will contribute to improved student achievement. 
   With regard to federal discretionary grants for which rural grants have to compete, the bill stipulates that small rural school districts who decline to apply for federal discretionary grants are eligible to receive money under a rural education formula grant. As a result, school districts would no longer have to go through the application process to receive federal funds. School districts that had to forgo applying for discretionary grants simply because they did not have the resources to do so, would no longer be penalized. As with their other federal grant money, a school district would have broad flexibility on how to use funds provided under this new grant to improve student achievement and the quality of instruction. 
   A local school district can combine their other formula grant money with this new direct grant to create a large flexible grant at the school district level to: hire a new teacher, purchase a computer, provide professional development, offer advanced placement or vocational education courses or just about any other activity that would contribute to increased student achievement and higher quality of instruction. 
   In addition to the aforementioned changes, REA has a strong accountability piece. The bill stipulates that rural school districts may only continue to receive the rural education initiative grant and have enormous flexibility over other federal education dollars if in fact they can show a marked improvement in student achievement. 
   In conclusion, this bill not only builds momentum for driving more federal dollars directly down to rural school districts but marks an important sea change in federal education  policy in that it cedes unprecedented authority to school districts to use federal funds as they see fit, not as the federal government prescribes and it links increased flexibility and increased federal funds directly to student achievement.

   Mr. GREGG. This amendment is really fairly simple. Essentially, it is an attempt to give the middle person, the small businessperson in this country who may, through no fault of their own, be subject to a Federal fine because they didn't comply with some Federal law as a result of the failure of their computer system, some protection from that fine. It says that this can only occur in instances where it is the first time it has happened. In other words, you can't have a bad actor trying to use this to try and get out from underneath the fines. 
   It says that the small business may have a legitimate, provable effort that they tried to protect the computer problem and that they notified the Federal agency they had the computer problem. So there is ample protection to be sure that the system can't be gamed. The purpose of this amendment is simply to protect the small businessperson. This will be rated by the NFIB, I understand.

   Mr. GREGG. I offer an amendment that ensures that small businesses which are hit with Y2K problems will not be penalized by the Federal Government for activities they are unable to deal with as a result of the Y2K problem. 
   An overzealous Federal Government bearing down on a small business can be a very serious problem. I know all Members have constituents who have had small businesses that have found the Federal Government to be overbearing. 
   It would therefore be uniquely ironic and inappropriate if the overzealousness of the Federal Government were to be thrown on top of a situation which a small business had no control over, which would be the failure of their computer system as a result of a Y2K problem. This does not get into the issue of liability, which may be the underlying question in this bill. It doesn't raise the question of whether or not the computer company should be exempt from liability, which I know has been a genuine concern of the Senator from South Carolina. Rather, it simply addresses the need for equity and fairness when we are dealing with small businesses which, through no fault of their own, have suddenly been hit with a Y2K problem and therefore fail to comply with a Federal requirement or Federal regulation and end up getting hit with a huge fine, all of which they had no control over. 
   This amendment is tightly drafted so a small business cannot use it as an excuse not to meet a Federal obligation or Federal regulation. It does not allow a small business to take the Y2K issue and use it to bootstrap into avoiding an obligation which it has in the area of some Federal regulatory regime. Rather, it is very specific. It says, first off, this must be an incident of a first-time regulatory violation, so no small business which has any sort of track record of violating that Federal regulation could qualify for this exemption. So it has to be a first-time event. 
   Second, the small business has to prove it made a good-faith effort to remedy the Y2K problem before it got hit with it. So it cannot be a situation where the small business said: I have this Y2K problem coming at me, I have this Federal regulation problem coming at me, I am going to let the Y2K problem occur and then I will say that is my reason for not complying. Small business must have made a good-faith attempt to remedy the Y2K problem. 
   Third, the Y2K problem cannot be used if the violation was to avoid or resulted from efforts to prevent disruption of a critical function or service. 
   Fourth, the small business has to demonstrate the actions to remediate the violation were begun when the violation was discovered. So the small business has to show it attempted to address the problem as soon as it realized it had a Y2K problem, and it cannot allow the fact it has a Y2K problem, again, to go unabated and use that lack of correction of a problem as an excuse for not meeting the obligations of the Federal regulation. 
   Fifth, that notice was submitted to the appropriate agency when the small business became aware of the violation and therefore knew it had a Y2K problem. 
   The practical effect of this will be small businesses throughout this country, which are inadvertently and beyond their own capacity to control a hit with a Y2K problem, will not be doubled up with a penalty for not meeting a Federal regulatory requirement that they could not meet as a result of the Y2K problem kicking in. 
   It is a simple amendment. It is a reasonable amendment. It really does not get into the overall contest that has been generated around this bill which is: Should there be an exemption of liability for manufacturers of the product which creates the Y2K problem? Rather, it is trying to address the innocent bystander who gets hit, that small businessperson who suddenly wakes up, realizes he has a Y2K problem, tries to correct the Y2K problem, can't correct the Y2K problem, and as a 
   result fails to comply with a Federal regulation, and then the Federal Government comes down and hits him with a big fine and there was nothing the small business could do. It gets hit with a double whammy: Its systems go down and they get hit with a fine. 
   This just goes to civil remedy, to remedies which involve monetary activity, so it does not address issues where a business would be required to remedy through action. An example here might be OSHA. If they had to  correct a workplace problem, they would still have to correct the workplace problem whether or not they had the Y2K failure. If they had an environmental problem which required remedial action, such as a change in their water discharge activities, again they would have to meet the remedial action. 
   All this amendment does, it is very limited in scope, it just goes to the financial liability the company might incur as a result of failing to meet a regulation. It is a proposal which is strongly supported by the small business community. The NFIB is a supporter of this proposal and will be scoring this vote as one of its primary votes as it puts together its assessment of Members of Congress, and their support for small business. 
   It is a reasonable proposal. I certainly hope it will end up being accepted. In any event, I understand under the unanimous consent agreement which has been generated there will be a vote on it Tuesday. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment, which I will agree to have set aside whenever the chairman decides to do so, is to address the issue of the reconstruction of Kosovo and funds that might be spent in Kosovo for reconstruction. The concept of reconstruction, of course, is something that is going to have to be dealt with by the Congress and the President over the next few months, no matter what happens relative to the air war. 
   One of the concerns I have, and I think many Americans have, is that America will end up paying a disproportionate cost of the reconstruction of Kosovo and potentially Yugoslavia. It is my opinion that no American funds should be spent for the reconstruction of Yugoslavia until Milosevic is removed as its leader. 
   It is further my view that America's participation in the cost of long-term reconstruction of Kosovo should be extremely limited, that our cost should be minor, a fraction of the amount of the cost of reconstruction, and that the vast majority of the burden of reconstruction should be borne by the European nations. 
   As a nation, the United States has borne a disproportionate amount of the cost of the war that has gone on in Yugoslavia. It is, after all, a European issue more than an American issue. The United States had no national strategic interest in this part of the world. Not until the hundreds of thousands of refugees were created did we really have any significant interest at all in this part of the world; the refugees, of course, being a function of part of the diplomacy of this administration, which, in my opinion, has been a gross blunder in this region of the world. 
   In any event, this is a European issue which should be addressed by the European nations. Certainly, the reconstruction issue is a European issue which should be addressed by the European nations, and American taxpayers should not be asked to bear the cost of it. 
   What my amendment does is simply state that the emergency appropriations, which we eventually pass for purposes of fighting the war in Kosovo, will be limited in their application so they cannot be used for long-term structural reform of the economy or the capital needs of Kosovo, without the President coming to Congress and requesting those funds be used in that way and without him putting forward a strategic plan which reflects how much it is going to cost us as a nation to reconstruct the Kosovo infrastructure. Until we receive that plan and it is approved by the Congress, these funds would not be made available for that sort of effort. 
   It does not limit these funds being used for humanitarian purposes. It does not limit these funds being used for the immediate needs of our own military, should our own military be interjected into Kosovo for some reason. It does not limit the funds being used for things such as replacing wells and getting people back in their homes with electricity temporarily. 
   What it does limit is any long-term attempt to rebuild Kosovo's infrastructure, which would be part of an overall plan for reconstruction, 
   without us first getting such a plan and knowing  how much it is going to cost the American taxpayers. I do think the administration has an obligation to be honest with the taxpayers and tell us exactly what they are really thinking we are going to have to pay in terms of costs. 
   I have read news reports coming out of the European Union that suggested the European Union position is that the U.S. taxpayer should pay for half of the cost of the reconstruction of Kosovo. To me, that would be unacceptable. I have read other news reports from folks who work for our agencies saying the United States may be willing to pay up to 25 percent of the long-term cost of the reconstruction of Kosovo. We are talking about, potentially, 5, 10, 15 years, with significant capital expenditures in that region of the world, and 25 percent would be a huge number. 
   If that is the administration's position, we need to know what that number is before we start down that road. This amendment is a minor attempt to keep us from starting down that road and to get the administration to be forthright as to what are these costs.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, America is struggling with a disturbing and growing trend of youth violence. While it is true that crime is generally down in many urban and suburban areas, it is equally true that crime committed by teens has risen sharply over the past few years and it is expected to continue to rise. Crime experts who study demographics warn of a coming crime wave  based on the number of children who currently are younger than 10 years old. These experts warn that if current trends are not changed, we might someday look back at our current juvenile crime epidemic as ``the good old days.'' 
   Thirty years ago, DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN, then an official of the Johnson Administration, wrote that when a community's families are shattered, crime, violence and rage ``are not only to be expected, they are virtually inevitable.'' He wrote those words in 1965. Since then, arrests of violent juvenile criminals have tripled. 
   If we have learned anything from this debate and from all the research that has been done on juvenile violence, it is that there is no magic bullet, no single solution or panacea to the problem of rising juvenile crime. Juvenile crime is a complex problem that demands a myriad of responses. It is a problem that demands a partnership solution involving family, community, religious institutions, the media, the schools and law enforcement. 
   The amendment I am offering today with Senator LIEBERMAN is a multi-tiered approach. First, the proposal targets youth who are at the highest risk of leading lives that are unproductive and negative; youth who have been or are likely to be incarcerated. Second, it brings together representatives of local government, juvenile detention providers, local law enforcement, probation officers, youth street workers, local educational agencies, and religious institutions to provide highly intensive, coordinated, and effective intervention services to high risk youth. 
   We provide seed money ($4 million a year with a 30% match) to enable the establishment of a collaborative partnership in 12 cities: Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Detroit, Denver, Seattle, Cleveland, San Francisco, Austin, Memphis, and Indianapolis. We also provide grants to grass roots entities in 8 cities to fund intervention models that establish violence-free zones through mediation, mentoring, coordination with law enforcement and local agency partnerships and the development of long term intervention strategies. 
   Research has documented that this is the approach that yields sustainable results. According to Public Private Ventures, Inc., which has been engaged in the study of programs for children, youth and families, interventions for seriously at-risk older youth and youth who have already become involved with the juvenile justice system require an innovative joining of youth development and crime reduction strategies. This amendment does just that. 
   At the same time we must recognize that government solutions are limited. Government is ultimately powerless to form the human conscience that chooses between right and wrong. Locking away juveniles might prevent them from committing further crimes, but it does not address the fact that violence is symptomatic of a much deeper, moral and spiritual void in our Nation. 
   In the battle against violent crime, solid families are America's strongest line of defense. But government can be an effective tool if it joins private institutions (families, churches, schools, community groups, and non-profit organizations) in preventing and confronting juvenile crime with the moral ideals that defeat despair and nurture lives. 
   This amendment is a step in that direction and I urge its adoption.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the amendment, which has been offered graciously by the Senator from Utah on my behalf, is an amendment which reflects action which this Senate has already taken which has been extremely positive in the area of dealing with the issue of how we protect our schools and our children who are in school. 
   Last year, this Senate, with great foresight, in the appropriations bill from the committee which I chair passed a funding proposal which I called the safe school proposal, which was bipartisanly agreed to and which was worked out through our subcommittee. Senator HOLLINGS, my ranking member, worked very hard on this. Senator CAMPBELL had a special role in this. Senator KOHL from Wisconsin had a special role in this. 
   We produced this piece of legislation, which is a step in the right direction, funded at the level of $210 million, for the purposes of setting up a grant program to allow schools to apply to the Justice Department for grants in order to address the issue of safety in schools.  
   Basically the grants were broken into three main goals. The first was for allowing police officers to work with schools as resource officers or as actual security officers within the school systems so there could be a merger of the law enforcement atmosphere and the teaching community in a way that was constructive and reinforced the positive nature of law enforcement within the school community. 
   The second function of this language was to fund technology basically to allow schools to put in place technology in order to identify hazardous things that might come into the schools such as weapons. 
   The third was to initiate prevention programs, which 
   schools might come up with, which they felt would positively respond to the needs of the school community. This program, which a fair amount of work went into, was part of a larger program which our subcommittee has been undertaking to try to address the issue of safety and children. In fact, our subcommittee has been aggressively funding the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Innocent Image Program the FBI has been running to catch child predators, Boys and Girls Clubs of America, Parents Anonymous, violence against women programs, safe school programs, Big Brother, Big Sister. 
   We have been funding a large number of initiatives. Programs which we found were working well we have tried to put money into, rather than reinventing the wheel. 
   The amendment I have offered today basically takes the ideas that we put into last year's appropriation bills, codifies them, authorizes them, and expands them to some degree, but basically works on the same framework, the initiative here, the Safe Schools Initiative. The concept of it is not for us at the Federal Government level to tell the local communities how they should protect their schools and how they should do a better job of addressing the issue of safety in schools. Rather, we wanted the local communities to come to us, the Federal Government, and say here is an idea we have. This is a creative, imaginative idea. We need some money to run it. Can you help us out with it? 
   Basically, it is a philosophy of giving flexibility to the local school districts in applying for these grants. We anticipated that these grants will be used for a lot of different things. There will be a lot of different ideas that come forward. We expect there will be proposals where money will be used to assist in training of parents, teachers, and law enforcement personnel in order to recognize early warning signs relative to the children who may have violent dispositions. We expect there will be funding that will be used for the basis of innovative research-based initiatives relative to delinquency and violence prevention in school programs. We expect there will be programs to assist schools, for example, if they decide to put in a uniform code. That is a local school district's decision. Where this grant will be of assistance is if a local school decides to go to a uniform code and it needs money in order to help folks in the school system who can't afford those uniforms, they can apply for these grants. 
   It will also support collaborations between community-based organizations, including faith-based organizations, which are doing a good job and have a demonstrated success rate of dealing with troubled youth. This is an area where we think there is tremendous fertile ground. We, of course, already are funding aggressively the Girls and Boys Clubs and Parents Anonymous and Violence Against Women and initiatives such as Big Brothers and Big Sisters, but there are a lot of other great ideas out there. There are people in Boston who have good ideas. There are people in New York who have good ideas, people out in California and the Midwest who have good ideas. These local community initiatives --grants have to come in through a school system--are tied into the school systems and are going to be assisting the school systems. 
   Those are proposals which we think will be very, very positive, and here is a place where they can get some funding to make them successful. 
   We actually, in this proposal, also give preference to proposals that come forward that are a joint effort between the law enforcement community in the town and the school system in the town. I think it is very important when we can join those two mainstays of the community together in a joint effort to try to address the issue of violence in our schools and especially how we deal with troubled children. Those types of programs we would expect to be funded and, in fact, get preference. 
   We also would expect that you will see funding for training people, people who work in the school systems, like teachers, bus drivers, janitors, to identify potential threats they might come across in the school system. We would expect that money might be used here for the purposes of hiring officers who would be resource individuals, police officers, resource individuals within the schools in order to help out and in order to bring safety into the classroom and into the hallways. 
   We also expect that money would be used for assessing security needs or for the cost of making improvements within school systems in order to address their security needs. 
   There are a lot of different initiatives which can result from this proposal. The point is that we already have the money in place. This is not a pie-in-the-sky, theoretical proposal. This is not something that is going to be authorized and not be funded. We have already funded this program to the tune of $210 million. 
   I regret, quite honestly, that the administration so far has not been able to get that money out to the communities. In fact, at last check, none of the $210 million which was appropriated last year and which was specifically addressed to safe school issues, such as putting police officers in the classroom, getting equipment to make sure schools are more secure, helping out with prevention programs, has actually been distributed. This is too bad. It reflects maybe a lack of attention to this issue by the administration. However, with the horrendous events that occurred in Littleton, we are now seeing that a lot of applications are forthcoming. Maybe there will be a higher level of awareness of this problem. 
   Basically, this is a proposal which I think obviously makes a lot of sense. This Senate actually already thought it made a lot of sense, because we voted for the money to be spent on this type of proposal. This authorizing language now makes the money that is already in the pipeline more specifically directed and puts in place authorization which properly accounts for how we proceed relative to the appropriations process. 
   It is obviously, in my opinion, a good step, an appropriate step, and something that should not be at all controversial. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to amend the  Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. This bill improves the administration of the Lamprey River in the State of New Hampshire by adding a twelve-mile segment to its Wild and Scenic Designation. In so doing, New Hampshire residents and visitors to my state will enjoy the many benefits associated with the Wild and Scenic River program, which is administered by the National Park Service. 
   It has been four years since I proudly sponsored the designation of the Lamprey River in Lee, Durham and Newmarket, New Hampshire into the National Wild and Scenic River Program. I am greatly pleased to welcome the Town of Epping into the partnership, and I am honored to offer this bill which will make this possible. 
   Contrary to concerns which are sometimes raised by other rivers' towns, Lee, Durham and Newmarket have told me that the Wild and Scenic program has stimulated a plethora of meaningful benefits to the Lamprey River and to the residents of the towns by which it flows. I applaud the extent to which this work has occurred through volunteer efforts and through monies solicited from towns, the State of New Hampshire and private foundations. As a result, groups like the Lamprey River Advisory Committee have been able to leverage a relatively small federal investment into substantial benefits. 
   Within the past month, the Board of Selectmen from the Town of Epping, New Hampshire, the Epping Conservation Commission, and the Lamprey River Advisory Committee have contacted me to request that I introduce this legislation which will increase the designated area from eleven and a half to twenty-three and a half miles. 
   The Lamprey River is situated in coastal New Hampshire and is the largest of the rivers that discharge into Great Bay, a designated National Estuarine Research Reserve consisting of 4,500 acres of tidal waters and wetlands and 800 acres of upland. Both in physical dynamics and biological productivity, the Great Bay estuary contributes immeasurable economic value to the Northeast and clearly constitutes one of New Hampshire's prime natural areas. The Lamprey's size alone marks its importance to Great Bay. Its good water quality and intact riparian habitat throughout the watershed create an important link between the estuary and inland areas. 
   The Lamprey is considered New Hampshire's most significant river for all species of anadromous fish and it contains every type of stream and river fish you could expect to find in New England. Botanical studies have documented 329 species of vascular plants of which 252 are restricted to wetlands and floodplain communities. In addition, according to the State Architectural Historian, the Lamprey is one of New Hampshire's most historic streams. 
   Perhaps what is most important about this bill is that it will help to assure that future generations will enjoy recreational opportunities on this great river. Undeveloped along most of its entire length, it is a beautiful river to be on and fish. For a quiet retreat into the woods the Lamprey is superb--where one can expect quiet canoe or kayak paddling past densely forested banks of hemlocks and hardwoods. In upstream reaches, people most often use the river recreationally for fishing, canoeing, kayaking, and swimming in the summer. In the winter, people trade in their boats and fishing poles for cross-country skis. This is a truly exceptional river offering a vast variety of activities for anyone who cares for the outdoors and I am pleased to offer this legislation to assure that it will remain in the same condition for generations to come. I ask unanimous consent that my statement and a copy of the bill be placed in the RECORD.

   Mr. GREGG. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Family Forestland Preservation Tax Act of 1999. This bill amends several key tax provisions to help landowners keep their lands in long-term private forest ownership and management. Without these changes, many landowners will continue to be forced to sell or change the use of their land. 
   This bill derives from four years of work by the Northern Forest Lands Council (NFLC). The NFLC was created in 1990 to seek ways for Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York to maintain the ``traditional patterns of land ownership and use'' in the forest that covers this nation's Northeast. The Northern Forest is a 26-million-acre stretch of land, home to one million residents and within a two-hour drive of 70 million people. Nearly 85% of the Forest is privately owned. Times have changed, however, and social and economic forces have begun to affect the traditional patterns of land use with more and more land being marketed for development. 
   This bill will help maintain traditional patterns and, thus, preserve the forest by adjusting several estate tax provisions. This bill would allow heirs to make postmortem donations of conservation easements on undeveloped estate land and allow the valuation of undeveloped land at current use value for estate tax purposes if the owner or heir agrees to maintain the land in its current use for a period of twenty-five years. This bill also would establish a partial inflation adjustment for timber sales by allowing a tax credit not to exceed 50%. This will encourage landowners to maintain their timberland for long-term stewardship, which is both economically and environmentally desirable. Also, the bill would eliminate the requirement that landowners generally must work 100-hours-per-year in forest management on their forest properties to be allowed to deduct normal management expenses from timber activities against nonpassive income. Currently, landowners are required to capitalize these losses until timber is harvested. This legislation, though prompted by the NFLC's work, will benefit not only the four states that make up the Northern Forest, but also all states with forestland and all who enjoy the multiple uses of forestland. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, which will not only protect the historic current use patterns, but also allow the rustic beauty of our forests to be enjoyed by all.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will address what is obviously the issue most pressing on us as a nation and certainly on the Western World. That is, of course, the issue of Kosovo and the war that is being pursued there. 
   First, I think it is important to understand that we as a nation are obviously the sole major superpower in the world and that we have, as a nation, a significant obligation to use our strength in order to promote the betterment of the world and to promote interests around the world which assist our national policy. We should not disengage from the world, we should not be isolationist--just the opposite; we have an obligation to reach out and use our great wealth and our great good luck and our great good fortune to benefit as many people around the world as we can. 
   But I think we must also be sensitive to the fact that we can't be everywhere all the time and that when we ask American troops, men and women, to put their lives on the line, we have to be very specific as to why we are doing it and what the purpose of that effort is, because that, of course, is the most extreme request we can place on any American. 
   We should have a process of putting forward a plan, a test, if you will accept it, as to why we engage with American force. I have always felt that test should have three elements. I have spoken about it before. 
   The first is, is there a definable American interest? In many instances this could be international interests which impact us significantly, such as the gulf war, where European oil was at risk. But is there a definable American interest which is specific enough and which can be justified and which 
   can be explained, quite honestly, in these terms: If an American service person loses his or her life, could you go to the parent of that person, could you go to the wife of that person, could you go to the child of that person, and tell them why the loss of their life was important to America? Could you explain our purpose in terms that would satisfy a grieving parent, wife, or child that their son or daughter had died in a cause which assisted America? That is the first and most important test. 
   The second test is, is the engagement of American troops going to be able to resolve the situation, or is the situation so complex, so convoluted, and so historically intertwined that it probably can never be resolved or never even be, for any extended period, pacified? 
   The third is, is there a plan for getting out? Before you get into something, you ought to know how you are going to get out of it or at least have some concept of how you are going to get out of it. That is absolutely critical. 
   Those are the tests for our engagement. 
   We are now engaged in a war in Kosovo. Unfortunately, in my opinion, none of those tests was met before we made the decision to go forward. This administration could not explain, and has certainly not explained very well, why we decided to step off on this route of military action. 
   The initial statement was that we were doing it in order to bring Milosevic into negotiations, in order to bring the Yugoslav Government into negotiations to try to settle the situation in Kosovo, because a number of people had been killed in Kosovo, hundreds maybe, although the number that had actually been reported was somewhat less than that, and because we were concerned that there would be a great dislocation of population in the Kosovo--or the administration was concerned that there would be a great dislocation of population in the Kosovo province of Serbia if we did not take action to try to force Milosevic to agree to the settlement as had been outlined at Rambouillet. 
   That was the initial purpose of the use of air power against Serbia, and against Yugoslavia, or Yugoslavia and Kosovo and Serbia. The purpose, therefore, was never to go in to occupy and to win a war against Yugoslavia. That was never the original purpose as presented by this administration. 
   One has to wonder, what was our national interest in that region in Kosovo? A legitimate case could be made that humanitarian interests are a national interest. But actually what was happening in Kosovo, although severe and brutal and being shown on TV, was nothing--absolutely nothing--compared to what was happening in Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, Sri Lanka, and a number of former republics, in fact, of the former Soviet Union, where literally millions of people died in Africa as a result of internal civil war. 
   Remember, this was a civil war situation. Kosovo was a province of Yugoslavia, which was an independent state, and is an independent state. 
   So there is the issue of humanitarian interests, although they hardly raised it to the level that justified use of American force when we weren't using American force to settle matters in Ethiopia, in Somalia, in Sudan, in Sri Lanka, or Azerbaijan, or Georgia. 
   So you had to ask, what was in the national interest? Quite honestly, prior to this process--this is all prior to the actual air campaign--I never believed, and I don't think the President ever made clear, because he really couldn't, that there was a dramatic American national interest in Kosovo. In fact, the irony of this situation is that NATO is now using all its force against a region--Albania and Kosovo--and claiming that that region is strategically important, when throughout the cold war when NATO was at its peak--at its absolute peak--of deterrence and purpose, when it had specific purpose, which was to deter East European and Soviet aggression in Albania, which was behind the Iron Curtain, which was an Eastern European country, it was never even considered a factor of threat. Other nations were--East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Russia, Soviet Russia--during the cold war. 
   But Albania was never a factor, because it was such a poor and desperate nation; it had no strategic impact at all. But suddenly it becomes a nation of strategic impact to us. Suddenly Kosovo, a subprovince of Yugoslavia, becomes a nation of strategic impact to us. It is hardly explainable to the American people. It must be found against other strategic events which precipitated the bombing. And what impact do those have? And what is the significance? I think the answer to that is yes, the unintended consequence of this bombing is that we have created significant strategic and national concerns which weren't there before we started the bombing but are certainly there now. 
   Let's name three of them. 
   First, of course, is the humanitarian issue. The huge number of refugees, to whom our heart goes out, and to whom we obviously have some responsibility for carrying forward--and I will get back to that in a second--clearly we now have a strategic and national concern about doing something to care for those refugees. That should have been anticipated before we started the bombing. But it obviously was not by this administration. So we created an event there. 
   The second event, which is maybe even more significant, 
   which absolutely is more significant, was an unintended consequence which this administration clearly didn't expect and can't even represent that it marginally expected, and which has occurred; that is, that we have managed, through this bombing activity and this military action of NATO against the Kosovo region, potentially to be expanded to a greater Serbia--we have managed to dramatically undermine and, in my opinion, destabilize the process of evolution towards democracy in Russia, and certainly the process that Russia was moving towards engaging with the Western nations in a constructive way, including being a partner for peace ancillary to NATO. We have as an unintended consequence managed to invigorate the nationalist spirit within the political system of Russia, which was already under great strain, and a fledgling democracy which is absolutely critical to the future peace of this world and to the prospective activities of us as a nation as we move into the next century. A democracy in which we had invested a great deal has been placed at some jeopardy as to its relationship with us in the West, and we  have clearly undermined much of the goodwill that we built in Russia. 
   Unfortunately, it could get worse, significantly worse. If we were to pursue a course of invasion of Yugoslavia, it would put Russia in an almost untenable position because of the relationship which has gone back for hundreds of years where the Russians consider the Slavic people and the Serbian people to be their brothers. An invasion would clearly make it very difficult for the forces of moderation and reason within Russian society to overcome the forces of nationalism and jingoism. Even worse than that, were we to declare war--which has been proposed by some, because we are at war, but if we were to formally declare war, we would even see a more difficult position placed on the Russian moderates and voices of reason. 
   Let me say this: Our relationship to Russia, our ability to nurture and build that nation as a democracy and a capitalist-oriented, marketplace-oriented society is exponentially more important than what happens in the Balkans. The Balkans are important to Europe. Russia is important to the United States. 
   So that unintended consequence has occurred. We have started the destabilization of our relationship with Russia, and we have dramatically encouraged the forces of nationalism. 
   The third unintended consequence which this administration has created by its actions in Kosovo is that we have dramatically weakened our military capability to fulfill our legitimate obligations in many places around the globe. 
   As a result of this administration's continuous reduction in defense activity and its basic antipathy towards the Defense Department for the first 4 to 5 years of this Presidency, we no longer have the capability to fight effectively in an extensive engagement on two fronts, as was our traditional approach to our military defense. And we know--now publicly reported--that our ordnances are being drawn down and our capacity to support our men and women in military action 
   is at risk. That is a consequence of this event and could lead to serious ramifications, which I have no desire to go into but which are logical. 
   So that is one of the reasons I have called this undertaking by our administration to be one of the--probably the most significant--blunders of the post-world-war period, because we have created a huge refugee population in large part, in good part--obviously not entirely--because Milosevic is a thug--because of the function of our bombing. 
   We have undermined our relationship with Russia and we have degraded our own military capability, all in the name of intervening in a region of the world where our interests were there, obviously, because we are a humanitarian nation concerned about humanitarian needs, but in relationship to other points around the world, whether it be African genocide that is occurring today at a rate--well, it wasn't until the refugee situation anyway--at a rate dramatically greater than what was occurring in Kosovo, or whether it be in our strategic relationship with areas such as North Korea or Iraq, where we have dramatic national interests. Our interests in this part of the world were limited, yet we have rolled the dice there at a level that is extraordinary. 
   So what do we do now? That is of course the question. We have been drawn into this action, and almost on the back of an envelope, it seems. You have watched the administration's different justifications for being there. And they change with the regularity of the weather, it seems, in that part of the world. There is no consistency to their position. One day it is that we are there to help the Kosovars have some form of autonomy within the Yugoslavian system and to avoid refugees. 
   And then there is a huge refugee event, in part because of our--in part, I say, only in part--because of our bombing. And now it is no longer that we are there in order to maintain autonomy. We appear to be moving there, being there, for purposes of obtaining independence, or some greater autonomy than certainly a state relationship, and it is to put the refugees back in a region which has been decimated. 
   The target moves constantly. It is one day that we are trying to bring Milosevic into negotiations. It is another day that we are trying to replace the Milosevic regime. And, of course, we don't even know what it would be replaced with. 
   So it is a policy that has gone arbitrary and, in my opinion, on the back of an envelope process without any definitive purpose that can be subscribed to in a way that we can be assured we can get there in any course or pattern. 
   So what do we do now? 
   One other point that should be made is the cost. One hates to talk about costs when American troops are at risk. Clearly, we will do whatever we need in this Congress to support those troops with whatever dollars are appropriate and whatever dollars we can put towards their efforts. But the fact is, the cost of this is going to be astronomical. This $6 billion request from this White House, which is such an understated and inaccurate figure--it is frustrating to deal with a White House that won't be forthcoming with the American people on this issue, which it has been, clearly, on others. 
   But clearly, on this issue, that cost nowhere near reflects what it will cost in the long run to pursue this policy that they have undertaken, simply because we are going to have to replace all of the ordnance they have used, for one thing, which 
   is accounted for. And, No. 2, we are going to have to rebuild what we have blown up in order to put the refugees back, if it is the purpose of this administration to put the refugees back. Obviously, you can't put them back without housing, without electricity, without water, and without jobs. So the potential of reconstruction costs exceeds the military costs probably by a factor of 2, 3, or 4. 
   The absurdity of this administration coming to us and claiming that $6 billion will get them through the rest of the year just from the standpoint of executing this war is, on the face of it, something the American people should question seriously. So the cost is dramatic. 
   So what should we do? I don't know the answer. If I had the answer, obviously it would be wonderful. But I don't. But let me suggest a couple of options. 
   No. 1, we have the responsibility to the refugees. We have a responsibility to make sure they are adequately housed and fed. I think that is going to mean getting them out of where they are today. We cannot let them sit there as chips at the bargaining table for months, or years, as the Palestinians were left in limbo. Rather, we are going to have to move them someplace where they can survive the winter and where possibly they can be resettled. It may be political asylum for them in many parts of Europe or in the United States, but there has to be a thoughtful, long-range plan for how you handle these refugees. 
   Second, it is going to cost a lot of money, and we are going to have to spend it. Instead of pushing Russia to the brink, instead of engaging Russia in a way that basically undermines the moderate and reasoned forces and accelerates and raises the nationalist forces, let's engage Russia in a constructive way. Let's use the German proposals. Let's use their support and use our contacts with Russia, which has the contact with Serbia, in order to try to negotiate a resolution of this, a resolution which would probably involve some sort of multifinanced force, not NATO related, in the Kosovo region. 
   But, rather than pushing Russia away, let us try to draw them in and let us not put ground troops into this region. How disastrous would that be. This is an area of the world where the people fight, where they believe. We have taken a nation which was a little bit fractured, actually, Yugoslavia, greater Serbia, and united those people. And they will fight. 
   Unless we go in there in a noncombative way, there will be a significant loss of life. And again the question will have to be asked, for what cause? And I cannot answer that question. So I do not see it as being constructive to put ground forces into that region. To authorize this administration to have that flexibility, after this administration has so completely mismanaged the issue to begin with, is, to me, foolhardy. So this is a complex and difficult issue, but it is the issue of the time and we need to address it and that is why I have taken this time. 
   Mr. President, I make a point of order a quorum is not present.

   Mr. GREGG. I think the Senator from New Mexico, as usual, has hit the nail on the head. That is the most significant strategic concern we have on the issue of Kosovo, which is where does Russia end up? Do we end up forcing it down the road towards a nationalist state with maybe irresponsible leadership? Or do we continue it on the path of democracy and marketplace economy? 
   I think that ever since the end of the cold war period everyone has analyzed the Russian situation as being tentative. The biggest concern of everyone who has analyzed it is that they may go the course of a nationalist leader who might use the West as the purpose for uniting a militaristic response, a militaristic nation approach. That is the concern. The Senator's point is absolutely on target. 
   Our biggest strategic interest today is what happens with Russia.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, essentially, no one in this Senate has worked harder--many have worked as hard, but I think I have worked as hard as anyone else to try to get funding for IDEA programs. What this amendment is essentially is a ``don't worry, be happy'' amendment. It is an amendment which doesn't address the underlying problem, which is that this Congress and, unfortunately, some people on the other side of the aisle in this Congress are not willing to set priorities in the area of education. 
   We have in the law, on the books a law that says we should fund IDEA. The only people who have been trying to do that have been on this side of the aisle. In the last 3 years, we have increased funding for IDEA by 85 percent from this side of the aisle. In the DOMENICI budget, we have increased it by another $2.5 billion.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from New Mexico for this excellent bill. I think he has done a superb job of putting together a budget which is responsible and appropriates for the future of this country. 
   As long as we are on the subject, I also wanted to comment a little bit about the proposal of the Senator from North Dakota, because he keeps comparing some sort of lockbox concept on Medicare with the Social Security lockbox which is in our budget, which is in the Republican budget. You really cannot compare the two. You are comparing apples and oranges. 
   The Social Security lockbox that the Senator from New Mexico has created, along with the Senator from Michigan, Mr. ABRAHAM, is a real lockbox. It takes money which is being raised from the wage earner today under the FICA tax, the Social Security tax, and which is creating a surplus in the Social Security fund, and it keeps that money to benefit the Social Security fund. That is a very important point, because there is no money being proposed by the other side that comes from the Medicare fund which would be locked up and protected for Medicare. 
   What the other side is suggesting is that the Medicare trust fund should dip into the general fund, which, for Part A, is not traditionally done. And then we should take money from the general fund and transfer it over to support the Medicare trust fund. This is a whole new concept. It is an invasion of the general fund. It is a use of general tax revenues to support Medicare, Part A. That is the practical impact of the proposal of the other side. 
   If the other side really wanted to address Medicare, if it wanted to address it within the context of the revenue being raised by Medicare, if it wanted to have people who are paying Medicare premiums covered by Medicare, have those premiums fully ensure them, then the other side would have agreed with the Commission that was chaired by a Senator from the other side, Senator BREAUX. Because that Commission put forward a proposal which the majority of that Commission supported, including two of the Democratic Senators, which essentially put in place a structure to assure the solvency of Medicare. 
   It was a good proposal. Yet when that proposal came forward, the rug was pulled out from under the chairman of that Commission, who was a Democrat, and the other members of that Commission, who had worked so hard to put together the proposal. A legitimate way of resolving the Medicare problem was essentially walked away from by the administration and by the other side of the aisle. 
   Now they come forward with this crocodile-tear approach relative to Medicare, which is exactly what it is. If they cared about Medicare, they would have supported the President's Commission. They would have supported the proposal from the President's Commission, and they didn't. They refused to do that. They certainly wouldn't be taking general funds to subsidize the Medicare Part A, which is what they are proposing under this. There is absolutely no comparison between what the Senator from New Mexico has done in absolutely protecting the Social Security trust fund under the lockbox, protecting FICA money to be used for Social Security, as compared with what is being proposed here by the Senator from North Dakota, which is to take general funds to support Medicare.

   Mr. GREGG. If you wanted to help Medicare, if you wanted to make it solvent, you would have supported the proposals that came out of that Commission, the majority of that Commission. 
   There is another point to make here. That is this: You have to look at what was actually proposed by the President to see whether or not there was a sincere effort to address this issue or whether there was a political effort to address this issue. On the issue of Social Security, the President's budget, as it was sent to us, would have spent $158 billion of Social Security funds for general operations of the Government. It would have invaded the surplus of Social Security to the extent of $158 billion. Senator DOMENICI and Senator ABRAHAM's proposal does not allow that to happen. They say the Social Security surplus shall be sacred; it shall be used for senior citizens. 
   They do not say, as the President has said and as the other side has said, if they are supporting the President's proposal, that the Social Security fund is only sacred to the extent that we want it to be sacred, but if we have some special program, whether it is building schools or spending money on defense or, I guess in the case of AL GORE, trying to correct the traffic problems in D.C., we are going to invade the Social Security fund to do that. 
   Specifically, they were going to invade the Social Security fund to the extent of $158 billion. 
   So there is an issue of truth in budgeting here that has to be addressed. Our budget honestly saves the Social Security fund. Their budget didn't save the Social Security fund at all. In fact, it invaded the fund for the purposes of operating the general Government. So there is a lack of consistency, as there is a lack of consistency on this Medicare hyperbole we are hearing from the other side, which is that they want to use the general fund to fund Medicare. 
   I originally rose to address, however, the amendment by Senator ASHCROFT, which I think is an extraordinarily  good amendment. It addresses another element of the President's proposal on Social Security, which is that the Federal Government should become the shepherd of the marketplace, that 
   we should essentially have a reverse nationalization or take the Federal trust funds of Social Security and nationalize the capital markets of this country by having the trustees of the Social Security trust fund invest in the capital markets, in the equity markets, and control those investments as a block. 
   This is a really terrible idea. I mean, bad ideas come through this place occasionally; really, too often bad ideas come through this place. But when a really bad idea comes through this place, everybody should be concerned. You don't have to listen to me to see what a bad idea this is. All you have do is listen to Chairman Greenspan, who says that this would basically pervert the marketplace, pervert the flow of capital, and would inevitably lead to a diminution of our ability as a nation to be more competitive. 
   Or, if you want to listen to some other group that maybe is more liberal leaning, listen to the Democratic leadership of the UAW and the major labor unions of this country. 
   This is their statement relative to the investment of Social Security trust funds surpluses:  
   In particular, we are deeply troubled that stock market investments of the Social Security surpluses would result in public tax revenues being used to finance the construction of runaway steel mills in Thailand, apparel sweatshops in Malaysia, auto plants in New Mexico......  
   The list goes on and on. They oppose that investment. Why do they oppose it? They oppose it because they do not want money of the trust fund being invested in stocks, which they deem to be undertaking political activity that is inappropriate. That is the whole reason not to do it, of course. They are making the case for why we should not have public investment in the stock market by the Social Security trustees. 
   The issue is this. If the Social Security trustees are going to invest and they are going to invest in the equity markets, they should do so in a manner which allows them to invest on the rate of return, not on the basis of some political issue. But the UAW and the USWA and the other labor unions are saying, no, any investment in companies that might be running a steel mill in Thailand or a sweatshop in Malaysia or an auto plant in Mexico or an electronics plants in China, that would be the wrong investment. 
   So we know exactly what is going to happen. The first time the Social Security trustees happen to invest in, let's say, a tobacco company, there is going to be a bunch of folks on this floor who are going to say: You cannot make that investment, Mr. Social Security trustee. You have got to abandon that investment. You have to let go of that investment no matter what the rate of return is. 
   So investments aren't going to be made on the basis of what the rate of return is. They are not going to be made for the best interests of retirees. They are going to be made for the best interests of what happens to be the political fad at the moment. That, of course, is why everyone agrees, except for the President and those who support his plan, that this is a really terrible idea. This is one of those really bad ideas that comes through here every so often and should be killed. 
   Of course, the Ashcroft amendment accomplishes that or at least makes a statement to that effect, that we should not go forward. 
   If you don't think this is a problem, think about the size of the amount of money that may be invested here. By the year 
   2035, you are talking about a $2.1 trillion investment, which would be controlled by the Social Security trustees; that investment being in private equities. This isn't the whole trust fund. This is just the percentage of the trust fund which would actually be invested in the private markets--$2.16 trillion. That is a huge function. Think of the impact that would have on the market if suddenly the Senate said: Well, Social Security trustees, you cannot invest in autos, because we are upset about the automobiles because of emissions; you cannot invest in some sort of food product, because we are upset that there may be a tainted food; you cannot invest in some activity involving electronics, because maybe there is a competition issue, such as Microsoft, you can't put any money in Microsoft. 
   What a perversion of the marketplace it would be if you had that amount of money being invested on the basis of political events. Yet we know that is what is going to happen, because we have already been told by the unions that they are going to make that case. If this ever occurs, they are going to argue that you shouldn't be able to invest that way. They are going to pick different companies that shouldn't be invested in. 
   As a practical matter, the opportunity for creating chaos in our capital markets is huge, if we go down the President's route of allowing the Social Security trustees to control the investment, to control the investment decisions as a unit, as a block. That is why those of us have been supporting--and this is on both sides of the aisle--personal accounts, which give individuals that decision, versus the Social Security trustees that decision. It makes so much more sense. 
   Yes, we should have some sort of investment of the Social Security trust funds in equities. Why? Because if you happen to be 25 years old today and you are working and you are paying FICA taxes, which happen to be very, very high taxes, you are never going to recover the amount of money you pay into the Social Security trust fund. This is especially true if you are an African American. Why? Because the rate of return on those taxes that you are paying is extraordinarily low because, unfortunately, the benefit structure is so high and the generation that is about to retire is so large that they are going to take all that money before you can get there to retire. So your rate of return represents basically a negative rate of return, if you about 20 to 25 years old. If you happen to be 25 to 35 years old, it is about 1.1 percent. If you are 35 to 45 years old, it is about 2.5 percent. Terrible rates of return. 
   We do need to invest the Social Security trust fund in something other than what it is presently being invested in so that we can get a better rate of return. What is the logical place to do it? It is to put it in equity markets. But how you do it is the key. You cannot do it by giving that control over that investment to the Social Security trustees, because then you create an incentive for a perversion of the marketplace by having the market adjusted by whatever happens to be the local political fad at the time. Rather, you have to give control over the investment decision and ownership, most importantly over the asset, to the retiree, 
   so that when you pay your taxes in FICA, you know that some percentage of those taxes--you are actually going to own that retirement benefit. If you die before you turn 60, your estate will get that benefit, and during your lifetime, you are going to be able to make the decisions on how that benefit is invested so that the investments get the best return for you, not the political return for some labor union or some fad of the moment. 
   This proposal by Senator ASHCROFT is an excellent one. It is only a sense of the Senate, but I think it is a shot across the bow of an element of the President's proposal on Social Security that needs to be made, and I strongly support it. I hope it will receive strong support in the Senate. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the issue of Kosovo. It is obviously a topic of extreme importance. It appears that the administration and the President have decided to use American military force in Kosovo in conjunction with NATO. This, to me, is a serious mistake. 
   I wish this administration had a set policy we could turn to and say, ``This is why they have decided to do this.'' But they do not. In fact, the Kosovo decision has many parallels to the Haiti decision, and the Haiti decision, as we know, has turned into a complete disaster, costing millions of dollars--potentially, I think, billions of dollars--although luckily no American lives, but it has not corrected the problem in Haiti in any significant way. 
   Kosovo, on the other hand, has the potential of not only to cost billions of dollars, but also to cost American lives. It is a mistake to pursue a policy of using American force without a doctrine or a guideline or a theorem as to why you are using that force.  
   My belief is that before we use American force in this 
   world today to address issues which are ethnically driven, religiously driven, or which involve civil war type of instances, which are the new threats we so often seem to get involved in--I am not talking about issues of terrorism, which is a separate issue, or state-sponsored terrorism, which is a separate issue. I am talking about regions of the world where we are seeing ethnic, civil, and political violence of such a nature that American forces are considered to be sent into that region. 
   It is my belief that before we make a decision to pursue the use of American force and put American lives at risk, we need to answer three basic questions. 
   The first question is this: Is there a national interest, is there an American interest, which is significant enough to justify risking American lives? Is there a national interest which can be clearly and concisely explained, if it has to be explained, regrettably, to a parent, to a wife, to a child of an American service man or woman who may lose their life because we have pursued the use of American force? Is there a definable American interest of such significance that we are willing to put at risk the cream of America's young people--our service individuals? 
   So far, this administration has set forth absolutely no presentation of doctrine or ideas or position which establishes that there is such an American interest. There may be a European interest, no question about that. Clearly, what is going on in that part of the world is horrific in many instances. But is there an American interest that justifies using American force and risking American life? We have not heard that explained to us. 
   If people are being indiscriminately killed by a group of thugs, then are we not also supposed to be in Georgia or Azerbaijan or Rwanda or any number of other places in this world? In fact, I think there was some tallying up of this, and there is something like 39 places in the world today where there is this type of activity going on, and some of it involving much larger deaths in the way of civilian casualties than is occurring in Kosovo. Of course, any death is a tragedy. 
   The fact is that there has to be a reason for Americans stepping in to try to stop that conflict. In this instance, we have not seen a differentiation that justifies us going into Kosovo versus going into some other of these 39 confrontations around the world. There has been no definition given to the purpose of the use of American military force, other than that this conflict appears on television. This conflict involves a European state. This conflict, therefore, maybe attracts more sympathy from a country which has always identified itself with Europe, but sympathy is not a good reason for putting at risk American lives. 
   The Balkans represent no strategic issue for the United States today of any significance. It is a strategic issue for the European nations, and it is a European issue which should be addressed by the European nations, but clearly there is no definable American purpose for going into Kosovo, and this administration has presented none. 
   I was at a briefing where I heard the Secretary of State say something to the effect, this might lead to World War III if we let this conflict ensue between Serbia and Kosovo, because she was referring back to World War II and World War I which started in this region of the world. 
   The dynamics of the world have changed. There are no alliances which are going to cause the domino effect that is going to bring the death of the Archduke of the Austro-Hungarian Empire into play with Germany, with Prussia. There are no such alliances that exist today. There is no Adolf Hitler who has the capacity to project force throughout Europe as a result of actions occurring in the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia. In fact, the Balkans have been, for all intents and purposes, strategically bypassed. 
   There are other regions of the world where America has significant strategic interest--Iraq is obviously the most apparent at this time, but there are others also--where, if we have to use American force, we should use American force. But to use American force arbitrarily and simply because the region happens to be European and because it happens to be on television, and for no other apparent reason, is a very hard explanation to make, should American lives be lost, to the parent or the spouse or the child. 
   That is the first point we must test. The first test of engagement is, Is there a vital national interest for us? No, there is not. I want to come back to that because there are a couple of other points on that. 
   Let's go on to the second point. The second point is, Can the use of American force stabilize or terminate the conflict? 
   When we are looking at these racial, political, religious, civil war type situations, can the introduction of American force have a long, lasting effect? That has to be the second question. And if it cannot, then why would we put the force in? 
   I think anybody who has done even a cursory study of the Balkans knows that these folks, these cultures, regrettably, have a historic, almost a genetic, attitude which causes constant conflict and which creates tremendous antagonism which leads to violence between these different cultures. 
   I have tried to trace it back a little bit. I was reading the history of the Ottoman Empire. Ironically, it goes back, I think, to Kosovo and a battle that was fought, I think, in 1555 or 1585 where Solyman ``the Great'' fought the Serbs in Kosovo. In fact, just a few years ago, the Serbs dug up their hero of that battle and took his body all around Serbia as an expression of support for that battle and for their hatred of the Moslem empire which had caused that fight to occur. And those hatreds have developed and evolved and have gone forward in every generation, been passed down from generation to generation to generation. 
   We cannot understand it as Americans because we are a melting pot, and we do not have that type of hatred in our Nation. A lot of people came to the United States, however, to get away from it and immigrated here for that purpose. 
   But I remember, I worked in Montenegro one summer, and I would meet people--and this was back a long time ago, back in 1970-something--and I would meet people, the local folks who I was working with, and they would tell me, forthrightly, that as soon as Tito died there was going to be a genocide in that part of the world because the Serbs hated the 
   Croatians. And it was just a matter of fact, a matter of their lives that as soon as this stabilizing force, Tito, died, this was going to occur. They knew it as a culture. 
   So what arrogance do we have as a nation, sitting here across the ocean, that we think we can project arms into a region, putting American lives at risk, and stabilize that region which has not been able to settle things out for hundreds of years--hundreds of years. I think it is foolish for us to presume that. 
   But equally important, I think we have to understand that, in this instance, to put American forces in there is essentially an act of war on our part, because this is a freestanding nation and Kosovo is a province of that freestanding nation. It is as if Canada decided to put troops in Vermont because New Hampshire and Vermont were not getting along. That may be too glib a statement, but the fact is, from a physical standpoint and a political standpoint, that is essentially the same situation. This is a nation which is at civil war. What if the English during our Civil War had decided to set troops down in North Carolina? I don't think the North would have taken that very well. 
   Granted, in this instance, the Serbs are led by a malicious and malignant individual who is acting in a manner which is outside, in many ways, the bounds of any type of confrontation that should occur in the 20th century or the 21st century. But the fact is, for us to put American troops in there will be legally, at least, an act of war because we will be invading a sovereign nation which is fighting within itself relative to a province in that nation which is trying to create independence, and we will be deciding to separate that country by our use of military force. 
   Of course, this administration has not come to this Congress and suggested that. In fact, this administration has not come to the Congress at all. It has violated all sorts of directives, but it has just marched down  this road of arbitrary evolution into a position of confrontation in Serbia and Kosovo. It has set our prestige at risk without having any idea why our prestige should be at risk, in my opinion. 
   But that is the second point: Can you resolve the conflict by the use of American force? I would have to say that history tells us we cannot. A lot like Haiti. When we went into Haiti, a lot of people asked, Are we going to correct this situation? Is this going to improve this situation? Are we putting our people at risk? Are we spending all this money and getting something out of this that is better after we leave? Is it going to change the culture? 
   We have seen it did not. Haiti is back to almost the exact position it was before we put our troops in, except that it has absolutely no private enterprise now because we basically wiped out the private enterprise when we went in and closed all the private enterprise down and pushed it offshore. We wiped out their private sector workforce and capitalist base. So we actually put them in a worse position economically. And politically they are in the same position. 
   I suspect that no matter how long we put American troops in there--and there is no definition coming; and that is the third point of how long we will be there--no matter how long American troops are in that region, there will be no resolution of this problem by the introduction of American troops into that region which will have any long-term impact. They will be back 
   at each other's throat as soon as the opportunity arises, unless we wish to stay there forever, which brings us to the third point. 
   The first point is: Is there a vital national interest for us? The second point is: Can the conflict be resolved by the use of American forces? The third point: Is there an exit strategy or are we committing Americans' tax dollars and the lives of American troops without any--any--idea as to how we are going to get out of this situation? 
   As far as I know, this administration has not really defined an entrance strategy. They have sort of stumbled into that, so, clearly, they have not found any exit strategy. In fact, if you ask them, all they have thought about is the first bombing raids. They have not even thought about the second--they may have thought about the second series of bombing raids, but they have not thought about what they do after that. There is no exit strategy. In fact, there is very little strategy at all other than what the military has been willing to do and has to do in order to prepare itself to execute public policy which is so haphazardly designed. 
   We could be there a long time. I mean, since 1385 or 1355, it has been 600 years. Are we going to stick around another 600 years in order to pacify this region? I think we might have to if our intention is to accomplish that goal. 
   And for what purpose? What is the national interest that justifies that? And remember, this is not like Haiti in many ways. This is a country where people do fight, where people are under arms. This is a country of military-type individuals. This is a country which fought the German army to a standstill; the greatest army in the world at the time they invaded, fought them to a standstill through guerrilla tactics. These are proud people, proud people and militaristic people. I know that. I was there for awhile. It was a long time ago, but I do not think they have changed. They do not seem to change much. 
   So where is this policy going? It appears that it is a policy that is undefined, that cannot give us a legitimate national reason, that cannot proclaim that the introduction of American forces will settle the situation. And it cannot give us a definition as to how they are going to get out of the situation once we get into the situation. 
   It is a bad policy. It is one that, unfortunately, puts many American lives at risk if it is pursued. But this administration seems insistent on going down that road. And I think that is wrong. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont. I want to congratulate the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Tennessee, Senator FRIST, for having brought this bill finally to a vote after what was considerable 
   resistance from the other side and what amounted to essentially a blocking of this bill as initiative after initiative after initiative was brought forward from the other side. 
   I think you have to look at the context of this bill in the context of those amendments from the other side that were offered. The concept of this bill is to give local communities, local teachers, local principals, and local school boards the ability to apply the Federal funds and to be released from the burden, the cost, and the interference of Federal regulations. That is what Ed-Flex is all about. 
   Thus, it is with some irony and significant inconsistency of the proposals that we have seen thrown at this bill from the other side do just the opposite. They create new program initiatives, almost all of which have been subject to no hearings, no disclosure in the sense of the congressional process, almost all of which create brand new, federally mandated, programmatic initiatives which tell the local communities, you must do this in order to get these Federal dollars: You must do this in order to get these Federal dollars. And the directive comes from here in Washington. It says that some group of bureaucrats sitting in the Department of Education, or at the White House, or maybe just the leadership on the other side of the aisle, is going to tell some school district in New Hampshire, or Vermont, or Missouri, or wherever, how to manage their day-to-day activity of managing the education of children. 
   Those proposals, which are being put forward--whether it is the 100,000 teachers, the afterschool program, the school building program--are all fundamentally inconsistent with the underlying purpose of this bill, which is to free up the local communities from the burden of Federal regulation. 
   More significantly than that, every one of those proposals suggests as its funding mechanism taking money from the special education accounts, money that is due the special education children of this Nation under the law that was already passed by this Congress--taking that money and using it for a brand new Federal program instead of putting it where it is supposed to be, which is with the special education child through 94-142. 
   Let's review that issue for a second, because it is so critical to this whole debate. 
   We have put forward an amendment on our side that says: Before you start a new program, before you create a new panoply of Federal regulations, let's do the job that we said we were going to do for the special education kids in this country; let's pay, or begin to pay, a higher percentage of the cost of special-education education. 
   When the special education bill was originally passed, the Federal Government said it was going to pay 40 percent of the cost. It dropped down to where the Federal Government was only paying 6 percent of the cost 3 years ago. And that difference, that 34 percent, was having to be picked up by the local taxpayers. The Federal share was having to be paid for by the local taxpayer. So that skewed education at the local community. 
   So, if the local teacher needed some assistance in their classroom, maybe a teaching assistant, or, if a principal needed an addition onto the school, or needed some new computers, they couldn't buy those kinds of things, they couldn't hire that new teacher. Why? Because the Federal Government wasn't paying its fair share, its obligated share, of the cost of special education. And the local community was having to take local dollars to support the Federal obligation for special education. 
   So what did the other side come forward and suggest? We are not going to pay any more money to special education. We are not going to increase that money at all. This administration set up a Federal budget. Instead of new money for special education, it essentially flat-funded that program and took the money that was supposed to go to special education and put it in all these new programs they created. 
   What does the local school district do now? They get hit twice: First, they get hit by the Federal Government, which refuses to pay for the special education children to the tune of the 40 percent they are supposed to. Then, they get told, if you want to get the dollars from the Federal Government, which is supposed to be coming to you  for special education, you have to follow one of these brand new, great ideas that the President has held a press conference on. You have to follow one of these press conference initiatives, whether it happens to be more teachers, more classroom size, or more afterschool programs. 
   So the local school district, in order to get this money, first loses it, and then it is told, ``Oh, but we will give you the money that we just took from you, but you are going to have to follow what we want you to do here in Washington.'' 
   How arrogant can we get? At what point does the arrogance of this administration stop in the area of education? 
   I do not believe that there is one person in this administration who can name more than maybe one child at Epping Elementary. I do not believe they have any idea what the child in the Epping Elementary School needs for education. When that teacher in the Epping Elementary School walks into that classroom and that teacher knows every child at every desk and knows what the child needs for education and knows that they need more books or more computers or maybe they need another teaching assistant, it should be that teacher who makes the decision as to what is used to help that child's education. It should not be here in Washington that that decision is made. And yet, that is exactly what these proposals suggest: Don't give the local school districts the flexibility to spend their own money on special ed, to spend their own money on general education activities. Instead, force the local school districts to take up the Federal share of special education costs and then tell the local school districts that because we want you to have more teachers in order for you to get the money which was supposed to go to special ed, you have to apply and take on this new Federal program. 
   It is total hypocrisy. It is total arrogance. And yet, it is these proposals that are coming forward. Fortunately, the people in this Congress, at least in the Senate, are going to have a chance to make a choice. They are going to have a chance today, because we are going to give them the option. We are saying that the money last year which was appropriated for the teachers' program, $1.2 billion, let's free that money up so that local school districts can make the choice: Do they want a new teacher or do they want the money to come to the special education accounts? 
   That is the simple choice that comes on the Lott amendment which was drafted by the Senator from Vermont and myself and the Senator from Tennessee, and it is really an excellent idea. We will find out what the local school districts need more. Do they want the dollars for special ed, or do they want the dollars for teachers? It is a perfectly reasonable proposal, and it is flexibility in the tradition of Ed-Flex. 
   So this amendment, this underlying amendment, about which I have heard people on the other side get up and say, oh, I can't support that because it pits one group of students against another group of students, well, ladies and gentlemen, the people who are pitting one group of students against the other group of students is the administration and the people who support these administration initiatives, because what they have done is to say we are going to pit the special ed students, who we are supposed to be funding, against our programs coming from Washington because we are going to take their money and use it. 
   That is where the real conflict comes. So we are going to give you an opportunity. We are going to give you an opportunity to live up to the obligations which the Federal Government put on the books back in 1976 and has refused to live up to. And we are going to give the communities the option of choosing whether they want a teacher, a program directed from Washington, designed by Washington, told to them how to operate by Washington, or whether they want to free up their local dollars by getting more special ed dollars that the Federal Government was obligated to pay in the first place and use those local dollars to either, one, hire a teacher; two, buy books, add new computers, add a new classroom, whatever they want to do with it. That is the ultimate flexibility. 
   The choice is going to be pretty clear here today as to how you want to manage education in this country. You can vote for all these directives from Washington, all these programs which are made for the creation of press conferences but give the local communities no flexibility and no opportunity to make their choices as to how they spend the money, or you can vote to give the local communities true flexibility by funding an obligation that has been on the books since 1976 and thus freeing up the dollars for the local community to either hire teachers, buy books, add classrooms, or create afterschool programs. I opt for the side of giving local communities, teachers who know their kids, principals who know their schools, parents who know their children, the opportunity to make decisions on dollars rather than the Federal bureaucracy or even an American President. 
   Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time back to the floor manager.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, the chairman of the committee and Senator FRIST, who is the author of this bill, in stating that I find it really disheartening that the Members on the other side have decided to use this bill, which was bipartisanly supported, was supported by the President, in order to make political points, not substantive points. 
   The amendments which the other side is offering on this bill are not appropriate to this bill. They basically represent amendments which accomplish obfuscation and delay of what is a very good bill. The underlying bill will give local communities flexibility in how they deal with Federal regulations. 
   I understand that that is anathema to some people on the other side of the aisle. I understand that some people on the other side of the aisle would like to have the ability to regulate and control and direct and have the input into how the day-to-day education should occur in our school systems. That happens to be their philosophy. They want to centralize decisions here in Washington. We want to take decisions and give them back to communities. 
   Their reason for opposing this bill, by throwing out all these amendments, isn't that they actually think these amendments are substantively going to go anywhere. It is because they want to make a political statement, and because they want to slow down a bill which is a good idea and which releases the local school districts from the huge weight of Federal regulation. It really is unjustified. It contradicts the purposes which the President has already subscribed to in saying that he supported this bill.  
   So when the American public asks the questions, ``Why don't we have more flexibility at the local level? Why do we get stuck with all these Federal regulations?'' the answer is very simple. Look to the Democratic membership of this Congress. They are the ones who are slowing up a bill which would give the communities flexibility.

   Mr. GREGG. ``A commitment we have an obligation to keep.'' That is what we are hearing from the other side. ``A commitment we have an obligation to keep.'' Tell the special ed child that. Tell the special ed child, whose funds you are raiding. You are raiding those funds to start these new initiatives. That is where the funds are coming from. Every time the President goes to the podium to propose a new program, where does that money come from in education? It comes from the children. It comes from the special ed child. 
   Why? Because this administration year in and year out has refused to fund special education. In fact, ironically, if you take all of the President's new initiatives, which have been thrown at us on poll number after poll number--every time he takes a poll, he puts out a new initiative. If you take all of his new initiatives on education, they, ironically, happen to add up to almost exactly the amount of money it would take for the Federal Government to fulfill its obligation to the special needs children of this country, an obligation which was made--a commitment, the term used by the other side, a commitment which was not made last fall in order to entertain the concerns of the teachers unions in this country; it was a commitment that was made in 1975--1975--when we passed 94-142, a law which said that the Federal Government would pay 40 percent--40 percent--of the cost of the special needs child. 
   What happened? The Federal Government reneged on that obligation, to the point where it was down to only 6 percent that was being paid by the time the Republicans took over this Congress. 
   We have been able to reverse that trend as a Republican Congress. We have increased that funding by almost 100 percent in the last 3 1/2 years. We have gone from 6 percent up to 11 percent but without any help from this White House. Not once did they send up a budget that has said, let's look at the needs of the special ed child. Not once did they send up a budget that said, we have a 40-percent obligation here; we are only fulfilling 6 percent of it, so let's start to fill up the rest of the obligation. 
   No, every time they send up a budget, it is take the money that should have gone to special education, put it into some brand new program which moves responsibility back here to Washington so we can have more control here in Washington purchased with the money that is supposed to be going to the special needs child. 
   We have another example of it right here on this floor today that is going to be proposed by the Senator from Washington. Let's add 100,000 teachers. How much does that cost? Billions. Does it say anything about taking care  of the special needs child, the 40-percent obligation? No, nothing. Nothing. 
   Let me point out that if we took the money that was going to the 100,000 teacher program proposed by the President and sent it back to the communities to spend on their special needs children, that would free up the local dollars so that the local principal, the local teacher, the local school board could make the decision as to whether they needed a new teacher, a new classroom, a new afterschool program, a new computer, a new science program, a new math program, a new language program. 
   But, no, no, the President and his Members on the other side of the aisle are not going to let that sort of freedom fall into the hands of the local education folks. They are not going to let parents suddenly have some power or teachers have some power or principals have some power. 
   No, don't let that happen. We have to set up a new program and take all the money going to special ed, which would have freed up local dollars, and tell the school districts how to spend it. Tell them that we, here in Washington, know better. My goodness, we all know that the folks down here on, I think it is 600 Independence Avenue, the Education Department, know a heck of a lot more about the kids in the Epping Elementary School than the principal of the Epping Elementary School. 
   We all know that. That is sort of one of those prima facie facts here in Washington, that the bureaucrat in that building, in that back room there on the 15th floor of some office building knows a heck of a lot more about how to educate a child in Epping, NH, or in Concord, NH, or in Nashua, NH, than the teacher who sees that child every day and the principal who 
   works with that teacher every day or the parent who happens to be involved with this child more than every day, obviously, 24 hours a day. 
   No, it is the great theory of self-worth which says that Senators here in Washington and bureaucrats here in Washington, especially the President here in Washington, know more about how to educate the child than the child's parents, the child's teachers, the child's principal, or the child's school board. So they take the money that should have gone to special ed and they put it into these new programs. 
   Let me reiterate what the practical effect of that is, because this is the insidiousness of the proposal that is being made from the other side. You see, if the Federal Government actually funded what it said it was going to fund in special needs, actually paid for the cost of the special education child to the full 40 percent as required, that would free up the local resources, because today what happens is the Federal Government is only paying 11 percent of the cost. It would have been 6 percent of the cost if this administration had been allowed to have its way for the last 3 years. But we changed that. We raised it to 11 percent. 
   So the next amount of the cost, the difference between 11 percent and 40 percent, has to be found somewhere else; that Federal share that is not being paid by the Federal Government has to be found somewhere else. 
   Where is it found? It is found in the local taxpayers' pockets and the State. And so the local school district has a special needs child, or maybe a series of special needs children who are costing them a considerable amount of money, and we should fund that; we should take care of them. And they know that and so they pay for that child's proper education. But when they make the decision to pay for that child's proper education, instead of getting 40 cents back on the dollar from the Federal Government for every dollar they spend, they only get 11 cents back, and so they have to find the difference somewhere else. 
   Where do they find it? Well, maybe they do not hire another teacher that they want for history or art. Or maybe they do not put in a computer room. Or maybe they do not start an afterschool program. Or maybe they do not build a new building or add on to their building. They have to make a decision such as that at the local level. It is a daily decision that is made in this country. All across this country that decision is being made, because the Federal Government refuses to pay its fair share of special education costs to which it has committed. 
   No, instead we have this arrogance of power that says we are going to take the money from special ed; we are going to create a new program; we are going to give it to you but you have to spend it exactly as we tell you. You have to spend it to hire teachers. You have to spend it for an afterschool program. Or you have to spend it to hire consultants, which is the way it usually works out. 
   The local school district, instead of having flexibility to make its own decisions with money that it should be getting from the Federal Government, suddenly finds itself hit twice. First, it does not get the money the Federal Government was supposed to send it. And then it is told that if it wants to get the money the Federal Government was supposed to send it, it has to create a brand new program that they may not even want. It is an arrogance of power. 
   The other side has said, we don't want to pit student against student. We don't want to pit student against student. Tell us about the special needs child and their parents going to a school board meeting in my State. 
   We have town meetings. School budgets are voted in the open in a town meeting. Anybody can go. Anybody can vote who is a member of that town. Let me tell you, student is pitted against student; parent against parent. It is awful. Why does it happen? It happens because we have failed to pay the obligations of the Federal share of special ed. It is absolutely inexcusable that we put special ed kids and their parents through the nightmare of having other kids and their parents saying to them, ``You are taking our money.'' But that is what happens every day across this country because the Federal Government refuses to pay its fair share. 
   So, what does the other side propose? Let's pit more students against students. Let us not increase special ed funding; let's create a brand new program so the special ed kid is once again left out there without the protection of the dollars that were supposed to come from the Federal Government, and once again is thrown into the meat grinder, unfairly and inappropriately being accused by other students and parents in the school district that funds going to that child should be going to the general education activities. 
   So this student-against-student argument is--well, it is like arguing that black is white, to say that this new teacher program is somehow going to relieve the student-against-student issue. It is just the opposite, just the opposite. It is going to create an excessive problem for the special needs child. 
   Do they need teachers? I don't know. I don't know whether the town of Epping or Concord needs new teachers. I do know this: The people in the town of Epping and the city of Concord know whether they need teachers. I am not going to tell them whether they do or they do not. What I am going to try to do is give them the money and the flexibility to make the decisions themselves, rather than have it directed here from Washington. But that seems to be an anathema to the President and to the people who are carrying his water in this Congress; the concept that the local community should make these decisions, the concept that the local teacher or the local principal, or even, God forbid, the parent might know more about what the child needs than we know here in Washington. That is the attitude. 
   That is the attitude that leads to this arrogance which takes the money from the special needs child and moves it over for new programs which happen to poll well, and therefore create some sort of political statement that allows you to create an election event, because that is what this is all about. If this administration wanted to help the children of this country get a better education, the absolute first thing it would have done would have been to fund special education at the full 40 percent, or made a commitment to try to get there. The fact that they did not, the fact that they have not, the fact that the only people who have been committed to this have been on our side of the aisle, reflects the insincerity of their effort in the area of education. It reflects that they are interested in politics, while we are interested in actually producing quality education. 
   This bill, by the way, is another example of that. It stuns me that this bill  would be held hostage for these really blatant political weapons, especially ones which make so little sense. That is what is happening here. This bill is being held hostage so somebody can take a poll and do a focus group and decide we need a new program. I imagine we will get another one after this teacher one, where the Federal Government can tell 
   the local communities how to run their educational system. 
   It is inappropriate, to say the least, because everybody supports this Ed-Flex bill. It is supported by the Governors. It was supported by the President. It was even supported by Members on the other side of the aisle. Why? Because it is a good idea. It gives flexibility to local school districts. It allows local school districts to make decisions as to how Federal dollars are spent without the Federal strings. In fact, I think 12 States are already functioning under this and doing extraordinarily well, and all this bill does is expand it to the rest of the States. It is ironic that 12 States should have this benefit, but the rest of the States should not have this benefit. 
   This second-degree that has been offered, which I think is absolutely on target, takes the money which was stuck in the bill last year for this teachers initiative and moves it over to the special ed accounts, which is where it should be--should have been in the first place. We made a mistake last year. This is an attempt to correct it. This mistake has been confirmed beyond any question by the recent Cedar Rapids decision of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court said just last week that not only do the local school districts now have to pay for the special needs child's educational activities, they are going to have to pay for the medical activities within the school system that are required in order to educate that child. 
   I can tell you, those medical costs are going to be extraordinary. This is an exponential increase on the local school districts in order to pay those medical costs. Those medical costs used to come out of Medicaid in most instances. Sometimes they came out of other accounts, but a lot of these kids were Medicaid qualified, so if they were really high they might have come out of there. But they didn't come out of the local school budget. Now they are going to come out of the local school budget. 
   Many of the New Hampshire school districts, for example, have small numbers of people in them. If you have a child who needs an extreme amount of medical help in order to be mainstreamed--and they should be mainstreamed; this is critical, it works, it is a good idea--but they have to have full-time nursing care, or they have to have very high caliber medical assistance, devices like ventilators or a variety of other things, oxygen, it gets extraordinarily expensive. And every one of those dollars, according to the Supreme Court, is now going to come out of the school budget. 
   Where is it going to come from? It is not going to come from the Federal Government, because we are not going to pay our 40 percent. No, it is going to come from maybe the math/science department. Maybe the decision to buy new computers will be put off. Maybe the decision of hiring a new teacher will be put off. Maybe the decision to add a wing onto the building will be put off. Maybe the football team will be dropped. Who knows? But somebody is going to have to lose, because there is now a Constitutional requirement that the health needs of that child, when that child is being educated, must be paid for by the school department. 
   The Federal Government is not going to come through with its 40 percent of that cost. Instead, the administration is going to take the money which should have gone for that cost and move it into some new program which is going to be directed out of Washington where the local school district will be told from Washington how and when they can hire a teacher, and what sort of qualifications that teacher can have. It is, in light of that decision in Cedar Rapids, absolutely inexcusable that we would be initiating new programs without funding the special needs program first--absolutely inexcusable. It is going to put extraordinary pressure on every school district across this country unless we face up to that reality. 
   So, the $1.2 billion that last year we put into this teachers program should be taken out of that and moved over to special needs and the special needs child's program, in light of the Cedar Rapids decision. To not do that is to really be derelict in our duty as a Federal Government. We have already walked away from that duty by not funding the full 40 percent. But to fail to do it in light of the decision on Cedar Rapids is really to add insult to injury--to rub salt in the wound. 
   So I congratulate the chairman of the committee for offering this amendment. I think it is right on. I look forward to this debate, because this is the issue we should join. Are we going to support the special needs children in this country with dollars, not rhetoric? 
   Or are we going to start new programs, directed by Washington, decided by Washington, under the control of Washington, which take the money from special needs which would have freed up local flexibility and put them into categorical decisions out of Washington? 
   That is the debate here. That is the substance of the education issue and the difference between the two parties on education. It is not an issue of dollars. It is an issue of how local communities get to manage those dollars and where those dollars get spent. There isn't a community in New Hampshire which, if given the option, would take the special ed dollars before they would take a new categorical program from Washington. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I support this amendment. I am an original cosponsor of this amendment offered by Senator JEFFORDS. I think it goes to the essence of what is very much the debate which we are about to embark on here in the Senate and as a country--at least at the Federal level--relative to where we are going in applying the resources of the Federal Government when it comes to education. 
   Now, the President has come forward almost on a weekly basis with a new initiative. In fact, I doubt there is a week that has gone by, or even hardly a day that went by for a while--while we were in the impeachment trial, there was never a day that went by--without a new initiative on some subject. Now we are in a period where it is weekly. 
   Many of those initiatives have been new ideas in the area of education, which would essentially centralize decisionmaking here in Washington; new programmatic ideas that would require Washington's imprimatur of approval before they can go forward, before a State can use them; new ways in which to move into the District of Columbia the control over our local schools and how local schools are either hiring teachers, building additional schools, doing their afterschool activity or exercising their initiatives in the area of dropouts. 
   That is a philosophy of government, and I recognize that--the philosophy that all good ideas in education come from Washington, the philosophy that when you manage the schools at the local level, they should have significant influence from Washington in the decisions and in the process as to how they are run. That is not a philosophy I am attracted to, but it is clearly the philosophy of the other party and of this Presidency. 
   Our position, as reflected in this amendment, is significantly different. Our position is that, first, before we start any other major, new programs in education in the Federal Government, new programs that put new costs and burdens on the local communities, we as a Federal Government have an obligation to live up to what we said we were going to do in the first place. 
   One of the things we said we were going to do back in 1975 was to take care of special ed kids and pay 40 percent of the costs of special education at the local community level. That is one theory we have on our side. Let's do what we said we would do first, let's pay for what we said we would pay for first, before we add a bunch of new programs that may or may not be good ideas, but in any event which we don't have the resources for, unless you take them from programs that already exist at the Federal level. 
   The second philosophy we have is that the local folks--teachers, parents, principals, school boards--know a heck of a lot more about education than we know here in Washington. I can name a couple of kids in my local school district because I know them, but I can't name all of them. I will bet you the principal at Rye Elementary School can name them and that he knows something about every child, knows some of the problems that child may have. Certainly, the teachers know that. They know what they need in order to address that child's concerns. Maybe Johnny Jones has a reading problem and they know he may have to get extra reading. If Mary Smith has a problem with attention, they know they have to get a specialist in for that. Maybe it is just as simple as they may need a computer in order to allow that child to get a little extra help that is self-initiated, or a little confidence in themselves. They know what their children need in order to educate them better. I don't. I can tell you that nobody down at the Department of Education knows, and nobody in this Senate knows better than the parents, teachers, and the principals what those children need in order to make them better students. 
   I will tell you something else. As Republicans, we don't believe that folks here in Washington have more concern for those kids than their parents, teachers, and principals. That seems to be a philosophy we are hearing a lot--that in some way, somehow, because we have been granted the office of the Senate, or because we are serving in  the administration of a President, we suddenly have some knowledge or capability that gives us a better awareness and a more sincere desire to help a child than the parent of that child has, the teacher of that child has, the principal in that school has, or the school board has. That, to me, is a lot of hokum. But it is the philosophy, regrettably, that pervades the proposals that have come from this administration. 
   So these are the fundamental differences we have, and they are joined in this debate over this amendment: One, that we as a government have an obligation to fund what we already have on the books; two, that better decisions are made at the local community level, not here in Washington; three, that we have no special portfolio or no special awareness, no higher level of concern for a child's education, than that child's teacher has, or that child's principal has, or that child's parent has. 
   So this amendment says simply that, back in 1975, the Federal Government said it would pick up 40 percent of the cost of special education in this country. Well, as of 3 years ago, the Federal Government was only paying 6 percent of the costs of the special education in this country, and what did that do? What did that failure of the Federal Government to pay that additional 34 percent do to local schools? 
   Essentially, what it did was it skewed the ability of the local school systems to deliver the educational efforts that they desired to deliver, because the local school districts were having to go out and use their tax base, whether was a property tax or a State broad-based tax; they were having to use their tax base to pay for the Federal share of special education. So they were basically taking dollars that they should have had available to them from their property taxes--in New Hampshire, for example--and instead of spending then on a new classroom, or a new teacher, or a new computer system, or new books, they were having to take those dollars and pay for the Federal share of the obligations to educate special ed children. 
   Now, I happen to be a very strong supporter of special ed. I chaired a center for special needs children; I was president for many years. I am still on the board. I think 94-142 is one of the best laws this country has ever passed. One of the insidious aftereffects of the Federal Government's obligations to pay under 94-142--to pay its 40 percent--is that I saw 
   time after time, in school district after school district, a cost to my State--and I know it happens in other States because I have heard about it from other Senators--that the special needs child was confronted with other parents in the school system who felt that because so much money was being spent on the special needs child, and because so much of the local tax base was being used to help the special needs child, their children weren't getting an adequate education and their children were being unfairly treated. 
   But it wasn't the special needs child's fault. That child was just getting the education they had a right to. It wasn't the fault of the parent of the special needs child, who usually got most of the abuse at the school meetings. They were just asking for what they had a right to have. They were being put in this terrible position of being confronted by other parents who were legitimately angry about the misallocation of resources, as they saw it. Why? Not because of anything the special needs child did, or the parents of the special needs child, but because the Federal Government refused to pay its obligation of picking up the 40 percent of the cost of that child. 
   So 3 years ago, under Republican leadership in this Senate, under the leadership of Senator TRENT LOTT, with a lot of effort by such people as Senator JEFFORDS from Vermont, myself, and Senator COLLINS from Maine, we made a commitment to do something about this, to pay our fair share of special needs. In fact, S. 1 in the last Congress said we were going to put ourselves, as a Congress, on a ramp that would allow us to pay special needs children the 40 percent. It would take us 10 years, but we would get there. Then we backed that up with appropriations. Senator SPECTER from Pennsylvania, 3 years in a row, has dramatically increased the funding for special needs, for IDEA--$740 million in the first year, $690 billion in the second year, and $509 billion last year. I think those are the numbers. It essentially has meant almost a doubling of the commitment to the special needs child by this Congress. 
   Do you know something? The administration didn't support any of it. This administration, which is so committed to education, has not sent a budget up to this Congress in the last 3 years that has called for any significant increase in special ed. They are playing a shell game on education. What they are doing, in fact, is they are borrowing money that should be going to special ed in order to fund all these new initiatives, so that members of this administration can go across the country and say, ``I am for this new program,'' or, ``I am for that new one,'' ``We are going to put a billion dollars into that and $500 million into that.'' 
   Where do they get that money? They take it from the special needs child. How much did they ask for in new funding for special education in this budget? We presently spend $4.3 billion. On special education, how much did they ask for as an increase? $3.3 million. That is what the administration asked for--$3.3 million out of a $4.3 billion budget, which only accounts for, by the way, out of that $4.3 billion, 11 percent of the cost of special education. We are supposed to be paying 40 percent. 
   So, under this Republican Congress, we have taken it from 6 percent to 11 percent. That is good news. The bad news is, we still have a long way to go. The bad news is that still in every school district across this country, local school leaders, principals, PTAs, school boards, are having to take money they would have otherwise used maybe to add a teacher, maybe to build a building--where have we heard that before?--maybe to do an afterschool program, maybe to put a computer in, to put an arts program in, a language program in. Instead of taking the money they would have used for those programs, they are having to take that money and having to use it to fund the gap that remains in the Federal obligation to pay for special education. 
   Just yesterday, the Supreme Court in the Cedar Rapids case made it very clear that that gap isn't going to get smaller, it is going to accelerate dramatically, because the Supreme Court decided that, as a matter of education, the person had a right to health care while in the school system. Many of these children need extraordinary health care. Kids we dealt with in the center I was involved in required immense health care. So that is going to increase the cost of special education even further. 
   What is going to happen for every dollar increase that comes about as a result of the need and as a result of this new Supreme Court decision? The local school district is going to fall further behind. It is going to have to take more taxes than it would have used to buy books and to add teachers and to build new buildings, more of those taxes, and have to move them and reallocate them to special education. So it is going to become worse. The situation is going to become worse. Why? Because this administration refuses to fund special education or even make an attempt to address it in any aggressive way. Instead, it comes forward with program after program after program, borrowing from special education funds to do that, and, as a result, leaves the special education child out on the street while it puts out its press releases. 
   We are going to debate this, as the Senator from Massachusetts said. I look forward to that debate. If the Senator wants to filibuster the Ed-Flex bill, which has been supported in the last Congress, supported in this Congress, supported by the President, and is supported by members of both parties, a bipartisan bill, if he wants to filibuster the Ed-Flex bill, that is his choice. But the fact is that what he is really filibustering is special needs children. What he is filibustering is the ability of local communities to manage their dollars more effectively so that we take care of special needs children and the other children who are in our school system. It is ironic and I think inappropriate to filibuster. But it sounds as if that is what we are going to get. Ed-Flex, a program defended and supported in the last Congress by the majority of the Congress, a program supported by the President, a  program supported by the Secretary of State, is now going to be filibustered because people do not want to fund special education--a very interesting approach to government. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to this debate, I look forward to a lot of it, because I do think that the American people need to learn just how irresponsible this administration has been on the funding of special education.

   Mr. GREGG. I thank you. 
   Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Ed-Flex bill we are going to take up next week, which has been brought to the floor by Senators FRIST and WYDEN and which is an excellent piece of legislation, a commonsense idea. The Ed-Flex bill simply gives freedom to the States to assist local school districts in meeting the particular needs of their particular students. 
   As a former Governor, I was very frustrated when I would receive Federal funds that were chock full of strings and Federal directions--strings that limited the ability of local school districts to address the educational needs of their students. 
   Had Ed-Flex been an option when I was Governor, schools could have chosen whether they would use Federal funds to hire more math teachers or instead if they wanted to use them to hire more reading teachers. Those choices should have been dependent upon the particular needs of each school. 
   They should have been dependent upon the particular needs of the students. Instead, those choices were being made by the Federal Government. 
   Under the current system, 38 States are prohibited from issuing the type of waivers the Department of Education can issue under the Ed-Flex Program. New Hampshire is one of those States. This means that someone at the Department of Education who doesn't even know the name of one student at, for example, the Rumford Elementary School in Concord, NH, has more authority over whether the Rumford Elementary School principal and the Rumford schoolteachers can decide  whether they need math help or reading help for that student than the principals and the teachers have. It is difficult to fathom that some of my colleagues believe that the Federal bureaucrat, however well-intentioned, rather than a Concord school district principal or a Concord elementary district schoolteacher or a parent is a better judge of what a child needs in the Rumford Elementary School than they are. 
   It is hard for me to understand how we can turn to a Federal bureaucracy to make decisions about local schools rather than have the local schools make decisions about how the education should proceed. 
   This philosophy of Federal control over local education is insulting to the principals, to the teachers, to the superintendents, to the school board, to the parents. And more importantly, it is counterproductive because it doesn't put the resources where we need them. It doesn't help the student with the needs that that student has been identified as needing by the local school district, but rather with a set stringent regulated framework which has been determined by a Federal bureaucracy. 
   Furthermore, this philosophy of Federal control is unjustified. Twelve Ed-Flex States, in the words of Secretary Riley, have used their authority to grant waivers ``judiciously and carefully.'' There is no compelling reason to delay expansion of Ed-Flex authority to all the States. In fact, Secretary Riley, President Clinton--both of whom are former Governors--and the National Governors' Association support expanding Ed-Flex to all 50 States. I congratulate the President and I congratulate Secretary Riley for his support of this initiative. 
   With that said, Ed-Flex is a modest but important first step to driving more flexibility and control to the locals, thereby giving them the schools to improve education. However, it still leaves the bulk of decisionmaking and control regarding Federal education programs in the hands of the Department of Education rather than with the States and local communities. I hope that later on in this year we will address those additional regulations. 
   At this time, we are taking up Ed-Flex. That, at least, is a first step and a positive step. Ed-Flex is a bipartisan, widely supported bill with proven effectiveness. We should take this opportunity to provide much needed flexibility to the States. 
   Finally, I take this opportunity to commend Senator FRIST and Senator WYDEN for their diligent, bipartisan effort to expand Ed-Flex to all 50 States. They led the fight last year to ensure that all States benefit from the increased flexibility and innovation that Ed-Flex provides. I thank them for their efforts to bring Ed-Flex again to the floor of the Senate. 
   I believe the very fact that Ed-Flex will be considered on 
   the Senate floor next week sends a clear signal to the American public that the top priority of this Senate is education and educational programs that are sensitive to the needs of the parents, the students, and the local schools. Ed-Flex is proof positive that the Senate is prepared to hit the ground running and promote proven educational reform measures such as the expansion of the Ed-Flex Program. I hope that in a strong, bipartisan manner we can work together to pass Ed-Flex and give the Governors, the local schools, the parents, teachers, and the principals this much needed tool which will free them from much unneeded Federal regulation.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to address the bill that is presently before the Senate. I begin by congratulating the chairman of the committee, Senator WARNER, and the ranking member, Senator BINGAMAN, for bringing this bill forward in the sense that it has addressed the issue of pay raise for our service people. This is important. I think we all recognize that our ability to attract in a volunteer service first-class folks who are going to be willing to put their lives on the line for us requires, in turn, that we pay them a fair compensation which reflects the gravity of the job that they are doing and the importance of the job that they are doing. 
   So the pay raise part of this bill, I think, is a very appropriate element of the bill. In addition, I am very supportive of the attempts to address the health care issues, not only of the service men and women, but of their families, which is critical to the quality of life. Of course, housing needs of service individuals is also extremely important. 
   Those elements of the bill, especially the pay and the health care parts, are, in my opinion, steps forward, and I congratulate the chairman for bringing the bill forward and bringing it so promptly to our attention. 
   But I do have serious reservations about some other elements of this piece of legislation. There are two areas where I think this legislation either creates a new entitlement, which is inappropriate and extraordinarily expensive, or actually is counterproductive to its overall purpose. 
   The first place that I have concern is in the area of the new entitlement for children of service individuals to receive, basically, the GI bill benefits. This is a significant expansion of the GI benefit. It has always been a superb benefit and a well-used benefit, but it has only been directed at the military personnel. Now it can be used by the spouses and by the children of military personnel. 
   The potential costs in the outyears of this are extraordinary because it is an entitlement. They really are not recorded in this bill because this bill only has a 5-year window, and when we get out past that 5 years, this number is going to be extremely high, and I think we will have, in my opinion, expanded this benefit in a way that will put great strain on the Defense Department budgets, which I do not think is the proper way to approach this. 
   Education is important, but the GI bill has always been focused on the soldier, the sailor, the airman. It is not for the children, unless the soldier, the sailor or airman has died in service. 
   We do have a large panoply of other types of educational initiatives in our Government that are available for military children, as well as for all other children, for that matter. It would be better to work an additional benefit for military children through those types of already-existing educational programs which are not entitlement oriented but are discretionary oriented. In my opinion, for that reason, this bill has a very serious flaw. 
   The second problem this bill has, which I really do not understand why the decision was made to go in this direction, is that it reverses the decision we made back in 1986 to drop the 
   50 percent back to 40 percent, the percentage of pay which a person will get on retirement after 20 years. The reason we did that, and the reason it passed so overwhelmingly back in 1986, was because we were trying to retain people in the military service. That is the reason that decision was made. We saw the purpose of that pension structure, 50 percent of pay upon 20 years of completion of service, as being, essentially, an encouragement to cause people to leave the military, and they were. 
   So this bill reinstitutes an initiative which makes no sense if our purpose is to attract people and keep them in the military. I understand this bill also has a $30,000 bonus if you stay in the military and take the 40 percent. But the fact is, going back to 50 percent is going to cause a lot of good officers and a lot of our more senior enlisted individuals to leave the service, because their age is usually in the early forties when they hit that 20 years, sometimes younger, but usually in the early forties, and that is the perfect time to go off and find a new career. 
   If you have an incentive that you are going to get 50 percent of your pay if you go out and find a career, you have a huge incentive to leave the career you are in and go out and find a new career. So it makes much more sense to stay at the 40 percent. I think it would have made a great deal more sense in this bill if we said, rather than bumping it back up to 50 percent, something to the effect that we are going to stay at 40 percent and we are going to give the military, the Defense Department, the flexibility to take the money we would have used to go to 50 percent and use that money to create new programs which will encourage people to stay in the service rather than to leave the service. 
   For example, the bonus is in this bill, but certainly there are other things that could be done that would encourage people to stay in the service after 20 years if there were a big pool of resources available to the Defense Department to set up educational programs or additional benefit structure programs or even a pay increase incentive program for people who reach that 20 years and are thinking of retiring. 
   Instead of doing that, we are doing the exact opposite. We are saying we are going to bump your percentage up to 50 percent and encourage you to leave the military. It makes no sense; plus, it is extremely expensive. It is $2 billion and, once again, when we get outside the 5-year window, the cost is very high. 
   This is an extraordinarily expensive bill. We should not underestimate that it costs $45 million in discretionary money and $14.1 billion in new entitlement spending over the 5-year period. If you were to graph it, it would go up probably horizontally on the entitlements side because of the new entitlements in the education accounts. 
   I think and I am hopeful that when the extraordinarily high quality leadership, which this committee has, takes a look at this bill again as it heads into conference, they will take a look at these two items, because these two items, in my opinion, create serious flaws in a bill that otherwise is very positive and is very appropriate. 
   It seems to me that the first one is an expansion of the entitlement, which is inappropriate, and the 50 percent, which is counterproductive to the purposes of the bill. It would be logical if we go back and visit both of those items. 
   I do have an amendment that I would be willing to offer on the second one, the 50 percent. I am hopeful that this committee, which is so well led--and I do not want to slow up the bill because I think it is a bill, I understand, that the committee wants to move--I am hopeful the committee will take a hard look at this, and if they don't, obviously, I might have to resort to the amendment. But, hopefully, there will be an attempt to take a look at this, at least in the conference stage so we can address what I think are the two flaws in this bill. 
   I thank the President for his time, and yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for his time, and I appreciate his organizing this discussion of the President's budget, because it has some very serious problems, even though we are in superb fiscal times now and it appears the President has put forward a budget which will create for us into the future some fiscal problems of an enormous extent. Many of these relate to his so-called ``resolution'' of the Social Security issue. Let's talk a few numbers to begin with. 
   What the President has proposed in Social Security does virtually nothing to address the underlying problem of Social Security. The underlying problem of Social Security, of course, is we have the post-war baby boom generation that begins retiring in the year 2008, and that generation is so large in  physical numbers that it overwhelms the capacity of the younger generations to support it. Has the President addressed that? No. 
   What the President has done is put forward a major accounting gimmick which is, basically, a proposal that has no substantive effect on the underlying problem, but gives them the capacity, through bookkeeping, to claim that they have addressed the problem. 
   The President has proposed that we take the present surplus, which is projected in the Social Security fund, of about $2.3 trillion and keep that in the Social Security fund. And then the President has proposed a brand new commitment from the general fund to the Social Security fund, a new bookkeeping entry which amounts to new debt of another $2.8 trillion. The practical effect of that, of course, is that nothing happens. But the political effect of it is that the President can claim that by making this bookkeeping entry, he is extending the life of the trust fund for another 8 years or so. 
   Let me try to explain it through this pie chart, because it is a complicated little shell game. It is not a little shell game, it is the biggest shell game ever played in the history of this country, actually. 
   This is the spending which is projected relative to the surplus over the next 15 years. There is $2.3 trillion for Social Security in the President's proposal: $700 billion for Medicare, $500 billion for new USA accounts, and $500 billion of new spending items. Notice there is no tax cut in here for Americans. He decided to skip that for the next 15 years, but that is another issue other Members will talk to. Essentially, that is how he spends the $4.4 trillion surplus, which is projected for the next 15 years. 
   However, in his accounting process, he also spends another $2.8 trillion, which is these new notes that he credits to Social Security. Why does he do that? He does it essentially because he wants to claim he has expanded the size of the Social Security trust fund so he can extend this life expectancy out. But this doesn't exist. This is a bookkeeping event. What it does do is it creates a huge new debt which will have to be paid by later generations to the Social Security trust fund. 
   The practical effect of that debt is that he will be increasing the tax obligations necessary to support the Social Security trust fund as we move into the later years by huge numbers. 
   Beginning in the year 2025, it will take an extra $360 billion in order to maintain the trust fund, and this will have to come from the general fund, which means it will have to come through tax increases. This is in order to meet the obligations created by this new $2.8 trillion bookkeeping entry. 
   In the year 2035, that number jumps to $786 billion. That is just 1 year, coming out of the general fund into the Social Security trust fund. The implications of this are staggering. It moves up to a figure of $2.07 trillion--that is a 1-year number--in the year 2055. The implication is staggering, because it does two things. 
   First, it creates this huge pressure on the general fund which inevitably leads to a huge tax increase. 
   Secondly, it creates a whole new dynamic for the Social Security system. The Social Security system has never gone into the general fund in order to support the Social Security system. That is not the concept of the Social Security system. The Social Security system has always been a trust fund. This creates the Social Security fund as a fund that has a drain basically on the general fund. 
   This all comes down to basically, in my opinion, sham accounting. And you don't have to take my word for it. Ironically, in a spurt of honesty and truth in accounting, the President's submission to the Congress of its budget had this language at page 336. I think it is worth reading.  
   (The Social Security Trust Fund) balances are available to finance future benefit payments and other trust fund expenditures--but only in a bookkeeping sense......  
   So somebody at least down at OMB had the integrity to acknowledge what they were actually doing. They were creating a bookkeeping event for the purposes of claiming an extension of the Social Security trust fund.  
   They do not consist of real economic assets that can be drawn down in the future to fund benefits. Instead, they are claims on the Treasury that, when redeemed, will have to be financed by raising taxes--  
   Which is the item I pointed out here, the trillion dollars in the year 2045, for example--  
   borrowing from the public, or reducing benefits or other expenditures. The existence of large trust fund balances, therefore, does not, by itself, have any impact on the Government's ability to pay benefits.  
   If I had written a critique of what the President proposed, I could not have done a better job. Somebody on his staff had the integrity to truly write the critique, and by mistake, I suspect, they slipped it into the President's budget submission. I am sure they are upset now that it is in there. But it is an accurate statement of what they have done. This is a bookkeeping entry, the practical effect of which will create huge outyear chaos. 
   Why is that? Common sense tells you why it is. You can't address the problem of the Social Security issue with mirrors. You can't say that a problem that is created by having a huge generation retire is going to be solved by having a bookkeeping event occur in the budgeting processes of the Federal Government. But that is what this President would like us to believe. 
   In fact, if you look at the President's proposal on Social Security, as he put it forward, it has absolutely no substantive impact on the underlying problem. He first uses this double-counting event, which does nothing--in fact, it potentially aggravates the problem dramatically in the outyears --and, secondly, suggests we should take the trust fund and invest some portion of it, 15 percent of it, under Federal management in the marketplace, which will create, potentially, havoc, basically a nationalization of our stock market, potentially havoc in our stock portfolios throughout the country, as Chairman Greenspan has correctly pointed out. And then he proposes two specific things to do, both of which cost more money. He proposes we raise the earning limits, which is a good idea; and he proposes we address the problem of elderly women who are at the low-income levels, which is a good idea. But neither of those help the Social Security solvency issue. They actually aggravate the Social Security solvency issue. 
   So his proposal on Social Security is the largest shell game ever put forward in the history of the world and does absolutely nothing to substantively improve the problems which we have with Social Security as we go into the next 20 to 30 years. And those problems are huge. 
   A number of us on our side of the aisle--and I notice Senator DOMENICI is here--have put forward proposals which are substantive, which are legitimate, which address the fact that this is a demographic-driven event and which must be addressed. But we can't move forward with our proposals if the President is going to be so irresponsible with his proposal. The fact is his proposal is used primarily for the purposes of pushing another political agenda. Trying to lower the ability of this Congress to address tax cuts is the primary political agenda behind this proposal, in my opinion. It does nothing as a constructive voice on the issue of Social Security and Social Security reform; and thus it is a great disappointment. And I think the White House is going to go back to its drawing board and come back with another idea, another proposal, if it expects the legacy of this President to be a correction of the most significant fiscal policy which faces this country, which is the Social Security crisis in which we are headed. 
   I thank the Senator from Georgia for his courtesy.

    Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, on October 29th last year, one of New Hampshire's outstanding citizens, William B. Ruger, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Sturm, Ruger & Company, Inc., was honored by The Camp Fire Club of America. 
   The Camp Fire Club of America is one of the most prestigious hunting and conservation organizations in the country. Its code of ethics stresses that the wildlife of today is not ours to do with as we please, but was given to us in trust for the benefit both of the present and the future. They also believe that it is the duty of every person who finds pleasure in the wilderness or in the pursuit of game to actively support the protection of forests and wildlife. 
   The Camp Fire Club awarded its Medal of Honor--its highest tribute--to William B. Ruger. This Medal is awarded to ``one person, who in the judgment of the Board of Governors, has merited such recognition by his career or special work in forest or game protection, or along other lines which are in accord with the object and aims of the club.'' 
   Mr. President, several former recipients of this high honor by The Camp Fire Club are: Colonel Theodore Roosevelt in 1910; Carl Rungius, the outstanding painter in 1931; Horace Albright, former Director of National Parks in 1961; and Laurance Rockefeller in 1967. 
   Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure to bring to your attention the tribute below, made to Bill Ruger on the occasion of his being awarded The Camp Fire Club Medal of Honor. 
   Medal of Honor, William B. Ruger, 29 October 1998 
   I welcome to this room of honor, five former presidents of Camp Fire seated at the head table, the officers and governors (both past and present), family members, friends and special guests. 
   It is a tradition of the Club at the Board of Governors' meetings to take a moment to remember those who are no longer with us. At such a momentous occasion as this, it is also appropriate to take a moment of silence for all our friends, family and companions that have crossed the Great Divide. You may remain seated. 
   At our formal dinners at the turn of the century, the founder of Camp Fire established several principles which they and we have been unable to uphold. To name a few, they were: no drinking, no smoking, no swearing and no long speeches. I will observe one of these this evening and get right to the matter. 
   The Club through its By-Laws permits the active President to award the Presidential Citation for meritorious service. The Board of Governors has the power to recognize members through the Medal of Valor and the John E. Hammett Award for work in conservation. But it is only the membership of the organization that can bestow our highest expression of admiration. In this particular instance, it began with a whisper over ten years ago, and through the Board of Governors ended in the hands of the entire membership's approval. 
   In 1906, the first Medal of Honor was presented and since that time only 24 recipients have been named. They have experienced many walks of life. To name a few, they have included conservationists, preservationists, a painter, a forester (the country's first), a writer, a bird lover, a Senator, an Olympian, an explorer (Polar), a rifleman, a rider of the Chisholm Trail, Founder of the Boy Scouts and a United States President. They all exemplified the spirit and the fellowship that is Camp Fire today. We honor them because we admire their perseverance, fortitude and courage. 
   Like each of the recipients before him, Mr. William B. Ruger has shown this same fortitude and courage to lead. He has willingly accepted these challenges and leads with dignity. He has the unique ability to explain in a clear manner not only to us, who are supporters, but to opponents the importance of retaining personal freedom and our firearm heritage. He embodies a natural sense of justice and a passion for exploration, not only in the traditional sense but in a business sense as well. Through the various and substantial endowments he has created, he has established a way to train and educate the youth in the importance of personal responsibility, conservation and truth; and at the same time has illuminated the way for us. 
   By his generosity, future generations may enjoy the advantages, benefits and pleasures of the outdoor experience and better understand the importance of wildlife and wilderness protection. 
   His distinguished service to the nation, while visible today, will be more fully appreciated and comprehended in the years to come. 
   The Medal of Honor is paramount in its absolute justice. It is a justice free from all influence whether it be of favor, political or sentimental. It is a symbol of life, of loyalty, of integrity and of self reliance. But most of all it is a badge of inspiration, not only to the one who has the honor to wear it, but for those who gaze upon it. 
   The inscription on the back of this gold medallion reads: ``William B. Ruger--Inventor, Manufacturer, Industrialist--In recognition of his dedication to conservation and the Spirit of Camp Fire--29 October 1998.'' 
   As President of The Camp Fire Club of America and representative of the entire membership, it is our great pleasure to bestow upon you the Medal of Honor. Congratulations. The Camp Fire Club of America, 
   Scott T. Sutton, President.  
   I would like to add my personal congratulations to my good friend, Bill Ruger.

   Mr. GREGG. Mr. Chief Justice, I call for the regular order 
   and I ask, as a parliamentary point, whether it is appropriate to argue what I understand is a statement as to the proper reference relative to Members of the Senate. This is not a motion, and if it is a motion, it is nondebatable, as I understand it.

    Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Stephen R. Monier, Chief of Police for Goffstown, New Hampshire. Throughout Chief Monier's 28 year career with the Goffstown Police Department, he has continuously demonstrated all that is honorable about law enforcement and public service. 
   His professional and personal life have been characterized by excellence, leadership and service to others. The resume he has compiled is extraordinary. To no one's surprise, he graduated magna cum laude from St. Anselm College. After joining the police department, Chief Monier rose through its ranks, serving as Patrol Officer, Director of the Juvenile Division, Sergeant and Lieutenant before being appointed Chief on July 1, 1984. In addition, he is past President of the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police and served 9 years on the Council of New Hampshire Police Standards & Training. He is also a member of the New England Association of Chiefs of Police and the International Association of Chiefs of Police. In a well-deserved honor, Chief Monier was selected to the 1996 Centennial Summer Olympics security team in Atlanta. 
   His service to others goes beyond law enforcement. Even while growing up,  this quality was apparent. At Goffstown High School, for example, he served as President of the Junior Class and President of the National Honor Society. This leadership continues to this day. Chief Monier is a past President and member of the Goffstown Chapter of Rotary International and a founding member of Crispin's House, a non-profit organization designed to assist at-risk youths and families. He has also been assistant coach for the Goffstown Youth Basketball League. In his spare time, Chief Monier coauthored ``Crime of the Century,'' a fascinating account of the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby. Although following his example may be difficult to do, it is my hope that everyone will see the Chief as a role model. 
   Finally, I consider Steve Monier a true friend and someone whose advice and support I deeply value. I expect that I can continue to call on his wisdom. I wish him the very best as he moves onto the next challenge in his life. He will undoubtedly approach this phase with the same level of commitment and dedication that has marked his entire career. With this thought in mind, I wish to say thank you, Chief Monier.
