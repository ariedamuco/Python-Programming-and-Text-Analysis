   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thought I would take this opportunity for just a very few minutes to say thank you. I will be leaving the Senate at the end of this Congress. I had assumed, as many of our colleagues had, that this would be the last day of the session. That assumption is very much in question at this point. I just left a conference with members of my caucus, and there are clearly some deeply held convictions and passions that are still unresolved. It may be that we will be here for hours or days. I hope that is not the case, but there frequently are at this particular time in the session those who hold convictions and beliefs so deeply that they do not believe under any circumstance they should leave any stone unturned or any avenue unexplored to advance those convictions and beliefs. 
   While some of those issue are being resolved, I want to take a minute to say thank you, first of all, to the people of Virginia who were kind enough to honor me with 12 years of their representation in the Senate of the United States. 
   I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have given to me and my wife Lynda and members of our family an experience we will treasure for the rest of our lives. The personal interaction with colleagues has been a part of the Senate experience that I will always enjoy, remember, and revere. I express to colleagues again on both sides of the aisle how much I appreciate the many considerations they have shown me. 
   I understand my senior colleague from Virginia took the floor while we were in the caucus. I did not hear his words, but I appreciate his cooperation on many issues, and I appreciate his friendship. We have had some differences; certainly, we have had some political differences; but the degree of cooperation between our offices has always been good and strong when it came to working on behalf of our Commonwealth. 
   The Senate is, for many of us, like a family. That sentiment has been expressed before. It is an extended family, and I say to all of those members of that extended family a very sincere thank you. I thank the floor staff and the officers of the Senate for the cooperation that has been extended to me over the past 12 years. 
   I thank the Cloakroom staff from both sides, particularly my own Cloakroom, who work so closely with us on a regular basis to make sure the institution functions, and that we are here when necessary in order to conduct the nation's business. 
   I express my appreciation to all of those who make this institution work. Some of them are visible, such as our friends of the Capitol Police who are here around the clock in a position, as we learned to our regret and sorrow, to put their lives on the line to provide safety and security. 
   There are many other officers of the Senate and employees of the Senate who are not as visible to the public, but are just as crucial to the operation of the Senate. The employees who work for the Architect of the Capitol who take care of many of the duties that are required to make the institution run. We see and work with them on a daily basis. Many of them have extended courtesies and kindnesses to me over a long period of time that I will long remember. 
   There are the many often unheralded folks who help with the phones, who operate the Capitol switchboard, who handle the maintenance, and who work in the food service we do not see but  who make it possible for all of us to do our jobs as effectively as possible. These people keep the institution functioning, like the maintenance crews who make the repairs and changes that are frequently required and who always seem able to accommodate--all of their good will is very much appreciated. 
   I thank the pages, too, who work and do all of the things they are required to do during the daytime and then get their studies done at night. We frequently see them working on their studies at the same time they are helping to make life a little easier for us. 
   I also express my appreciation to the committee staffs, the professional staffs who work with each of the committees and help me and all of you on a regular basis. We develop personal friendships with many of these individuals whom we will long remember. 
   Finally, I want to say a very personal thank you to the members of my own staff. I have been extraordinarily well served by some very able professionals who have served their Commonwealth and their country in ways that I will always appreciate and for which they can always be very proud. 
   There have been many, and I am not going to attempt to list them all. It occurred to me that maybe, because I have been so fortunate and so well served, I should mention the names only of those who have been with me continuously helping and assisting me my entire term in the Senate, serving with me over the last 12 years. Two of those professionals actually have been with me through my gubernatorial service: Pat Mayer and Susan Albert, now Susan Albert Carr as of last weekend, have been with me for the full 12 years and then some. Matt McGowan, Jim Connell, JoAnn Pulliam, Anne Geyer, Debbie Lawson-Goins, and Jim O'Quinn have all been kind enough to provide for me the kind of professional staff assistance that has made my job easier. We will remain friends. The members of my staff have helped make this an experience I will cherish. 
   I have undoubtedly left out a number of individuals whom I want to thank and I have tried to thank. 
   I also thank the people who have made this a very good experience for my wife Lynda, particularly the prayer groups. She has been associated with several of those. I understand she gets to continue her membership in the prayer groups and the spouses group, even though I will become a former Member and will leave these premises. 
   Mr. President, I say to all of my colleagues that they are a group of principled, compassionate, caring men and women, many of them friends. We may have disagreements. Some of those are principled disagreements. In fact, I just attended what may be the last Democratic conference called by our leader. I say once again, I heard members express in passionate terms their commitment to doing what they believe is in the best interest of their State and the Nation, and I think that is something that may not always be apparent. Again, that occurs on both sides of the aisle. I am particularly grateful to many who have demonstrated the courage to stand up and be counted when it was not always politically popular. 
   Finally, I want to make a brief comment about the leadership. I thank the majority leader for the courtesies he and the members of his staff have extended to me. 
   I conclude with a special note of thanks to someone I consider an extraordinary leader, who is kind enough to be here for these couple of minutes, TOM DASCHLE, the current Democratic and minority leader who will become on January 3 through January 20 the majority leader. 
   As a point of personal privilege, I look forward to that time. 
   He and the team that he has put together have been exceptional leaders. I see the distinguished whip HARRY REID on the floor, as well. They have led by example. They have led by inclusion. And they have led by listening. They have been friends. They have been effective. They have been leaders in the truest sense in that they have caused us to want to work with them to make the institution run and to get the job done. 
   So, Mr. President, to you, as a personal friend, and as a representative of our colleagues, and to all of our friends who have been kind to me and have supported some of the things I have done over the years, may I express my profound thanks. 
   I take leave of the Senate proud to have had the opportunity to serve in this great institution. 
   Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
   Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank the chair. 
   What is it that makes an excellent soldier? I submit to you that it five basic virtues: Devotion to duty; loyalty to country, commanders, and comrades; skill in military arts; personal integrity; and courage. If you have these qualities, you can be an excellent soldier, whether your name of Manursky or Jefferson, Goldberg or Nguyen, Warner, Dole, Kerrey, or McCain. 
   A number of Americans who have these qualities, however, are being excluded from serving their country in the military for reasons beyond fitness or performance. 
   People have told me for some time that they cannot understand how someone who thinks of himself as a gung-ho marine can march to the music of a drummer that I do not hear. 
   Mr. President, the drummer I hear plays the Marine Corps Hymn. It still gives me a chill, and I still stand when it is played. I certainly do not want to detract in any way from the military's effectiveness or performance. 
   Because of that, I cannot stand by and let a policy that I consider less than perfect keep our services from attracting the best and most competent people. The issue should be not what kind of person you are but what kind of soldier, sailor, airman, or marine you are. 
   As a former marine who considers his 34-plus years in uniform and in the reserve to be the proudest affiliation of my life, I well understand those who argue the importance of maintaining morale and good discipline in the ranks. 
   But I would suggest to you, Mr. President, morale is in the heart of each service person. The threat to morale comes not from the orientation of a few but from the closed minds of many. President Truman recognized that when he ordered the services to be integrated by race despite the racial animosity of many then in service. 
   Do some of today's soldiers fear what they do not understand? Certainly, they do. Obviously. But should America's policy be guided by fear, or should be work to overcome prejudice by showing that merit and behavior, not orientations, are what counts in the military? 
   I have spent a great deal of time discussing this with a number of friends, including the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Colin Powell. Some think that I am simply on the wrong side of this issue, and I understand this and other objections to the proposal. 
   General Powell recently drew a difference between discrimination based on sexuality, which he called a behavior, and that based on race, which he called a benign characteristic. But I submit to you that race is obvious, until and unless it is expressed in conduct. And if that sexuality is expressed, it is no longer benign. Then it will run into the existing regulations of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 
   The code offers sufficient protections against much of the conduct that supporters of this amendment fear. And it can certainly be expanded to prevent breaches of decorum or good order. 
   The specter of drill sergeants dancing together is unsettling, to say the least, Mr. President. But some of the amendment's supporters fail to note it is just the kind of behavior already prohibited by the Uniform Code, as is almost all of the conduct presented as a concern by those who are in favor of this particular amendment. 
   The President is the Commander in Chief of the Armed Services, and he sets the goals. Just as many military men were given the goal of ejecting Iraqi forces from Kuwait, and led the plan and implemented that goal, I believe that the military should also be cast with making the President's goal a reality. 
   As a former military commander, I can tell you that if a goal of truly equal access to military service is to be reached, I believe that the military itself will have to come to terms with it. 
   That will best be done if given the proper role of implementing the President's directive. The hearings announced actually last year by the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee will add information and understanding to that process and will let us fulfill the Congress' proper role of ensuring that readiness is maintained while achieving the President's goal. But I ask we not let fear govern our actions. While we may not perfectly understand what motivates individual sexuality, we cannot allow that lack of understanding to block deserving patriotic Americans from service. 
   Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will oppose the amendment offered by my distinguished and very respected colleague, the Republican leader, in this particular instance. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, throughout my career I have been a staunch advocate for fiscal responsibility, believing that as a government we should make every effort to pay our own way and not leave our debts to our children. That same principle of fiscal responsibility compelled me to be an early cosponsor of the bankruptcy reform bill. I believe that, whenever possible, individuals should take personal responsibility for debts that they incur and pay what they owe. 
   Under our current bankruptcy system, debtors can be absolved of their debts even when they may have the ability to pay. I support bankruptcy reform because I believe that if an individual has the ability to repay their debts, they should have an obligation to do so. The conference report we're considering today adheres to that basic principle. 
   While I have supported bankruptcy reform throughout this Congress, however, I'm extremely disappointed with how we got to this point in the process. There has been a lot of talk about the need for bipartisanship recently, but there is little evidence of bipartisanship in the process used to develop this conference report. In fact, that process  represents the exact opposite of bipartisanship. The minority was locked out of the deliberations completely. 
   In addition, I'm concerned that important provisions that I supported and which passed overwhelmingly in the Senate were dropped in conference, specifically the amendment involving violence against abortion clinics and the amendment involving the homestead exemption. I continue to support those provisions, but they were not in the bill I originally cosponsored. And while I had hoped that those provisions would be included in the final package, the absence of those provisions doesn't diminish the basic proposition contained in the underlying bill which caused me to lend my support to the measure in the first place. 
   Let me conclude by acknowledging the help and friendship of many of those who have called me or my office over the last few days urging me to change my position on this legislation. Many of the groups and individuals who oppose this bill are among those with whom I most often find common cause and have supported me strongly over the years. It is particularly painful for me not to be able to oblige them in this instance. But I made a decision in May of last year to cosponsor this legislation, and there have been no major substantive changes between then and now that would compel me to change my position. So while I regret having to say ``no'' to so many of my friends, I cannot in good conscience turn my back on a principle which is so fundamental to me--the principle of personal responsibility. As a result, I will maintain the position I have held since this bill was introduced and will vote for final passage.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, one of the many items that the Senate failed to address during this Congress is legislation that would allow the states to protect themselves from unwanted out-of-state garbage. Three separate bills were offered in the Senate on this issue and each had merit, at least as a point of departure. In fact two of the bills incorporated elements that easily passed the Senate a few years ago. 
   The Environment and Public Works Committee held a hearing on these bills but failed to move any of the bills forward. This is more than disappointing. For a state like Virginia that is now importing over 7 million tons of municipal solid waste each year, with no way to limit the growth of this unwanted import, it is important that the committee and the full Senate act on legislation. 
   Seven million tons of imported solid waste represents 280,000 truck loads of waste moving into the Commonwealth of Virginia each year. The traffic this generates is reason alone to authorize additional state controls. But there are other reasons. Cheap landfill disposal due to an over abundance of capacity, has made us less vigilant about recycling. And although new federal landfill standards protect our environment better than the old standards, today's landfills are much larger than yesterdays, and we are not yet certain that all the engineering improvements we have made are enough. We may not know if these new landfills leak for a few more years. 
   Transporting waste hundreds of miles for disposal is also a senseless use of diesel fuel, and when we are already facing a shortage we should seek to conserve our fuel resources. We are misallocating fuel that could be used to heat homes this winter and using it to hall trash up and down the east coast. I understand from the Federal Highway Administration that the large trucks used to transport waste get about 6.1 miles per gallon. An out of state delivery of trash to Virginia landfills can amount to 680 miles round trip and 68 gallons of gas. If only half the trips to Virginia are that long, over 500,000 gallons of diesel fuel will be used to ship waste several hundred miles. This is a waste. 
   During this Congress, I introduced one interstate waste bill and co-sponsored two others, and if members of the Senate propose other ways to deal with this problem, I am more than willing to work with them to develop something that is workable for all parties. But at this time unless a state chooses, as some have, to simply stop siting land disposal capacity, they lose all control in terms of how long that capacity will last and what kind of traffic it will receive. 
   When we come back next year I will try again to move legislation. I will meet with the exporting States and I will continue to work toward a goal of wiser use of our resources, and that includes recycling, minimizing waste in the first place and certainly finding a way to dispose of it without moving half way across the country.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I add my voice to that of my senior colleague in thanking our colleague from Oklahoma for the way he has worked on this particular problem. For a number of months, this seemed to be one of those intractable problems that was probably not going to be resolved. 
   I know the very strong feelings the Senator from Oklahoma has and brought to bear on this question in particular. We may disagree on other matters, but on this question in particular, he struck just the right balance, represented the long-term interests of the United States in a way that allowed us to come to closure on an issue that might not have closed at all and certainly would have created all kinds of difficulty for the United States in our long-term relations in the hemisphere with the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and others. 
   I add my voice to others in thanking the chairman of the Readiness Subcommittee for his very important and tireless work on this issue.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, the defense authorization bill before us today has historic qualities. It represents another year of real growth in our commitment to national defense and the readiness of the men and women who serve this Nation in uniform. It represents our reinvigorated and growing national consensus on the importance of American military power, and our military's continuing relevance to world peace, stability, and prosperity. Friends and allies around the world will see in this bill America's commitment to leadership and our willingness to keep our military the most powerful ever and equal to the challenge. 
   This bill continues to chip away at the quality of life issues that make service in today's military a greater sacrifice than it needs to be. This bill raises pay, improves housing, authorizes additional bonuses to improve retention, and improves medical care for servicemembers and their families. 
   I am particularly proud that this bill at last acknowledges the promise of lifetime health care made to America's thousands of military retirees and their families. The program put in place by this bill sets the conditions for keeping our promise, but we should have no illusion that this fulfills our debt. The devil, as usual, is in the details and there is much work ahead ensuring that the system we create is up to the requirements of this benefit and accomplishes its purpose. In a respect our real work lies before us, now that we are over the political and budgetary hurdles of keeping the promise. 
   This bill, thankfully but modestly, also increases our procurement, readiness, and research and development accounts. Anyone reading this bill will see our clear intent to deal with our daunting maintenance challenges. Anyone reading this bill will see our clear intent to modernize our tactical aircraft. Anyone reading this bill will see our clear intent to increase shipbuilding rates necessary to sustain a globally capable 300-ship Navy. Anyone reading this bill will see our clear intent to accelerate research and development to bring forward the next generation of aircraft--manned and unmanned, ships, and combat vehicles necessary to our future readiness and security. 
   Unfortunately, the rush, early this year, to massive tax cuts and political fears over new spending worked against us in making the kinds of real and significant increases necessary to address the challenges to our readiness today and tomorrow. 
   There is no doubt that significant increases in the defense top line are ahead. But regrettably, we have missed an opportunity to apply additional resources this year to some of our more chronic military requirements such as aviation spare parts and ship depot maintenance. 
   Equally regrettable, we fail again, in my judgement, to take on the issue of excess infrastructure. 
   One of the best ways we can help pay for current readiness is through reducing the DOD's large ``tail'' of infrastructure and support, which is taking away critical funding for the teeth--  our warfighting troops and equipment that will fight the next year. 
   And the best place to reduce tail is to cut more bases. 
   I am encouraged by the Armed Services Committee chairman's commitment to making additional BRAC legislation his first priority for our next session. It is time to get over the history of this issue and get on with supporting defense establishment requirements. 
   Mr. President, there are very exciting days ahead for America's Armed Forces. The benefits of a strong national economy with projected budget surpluses provide a historic opportunity across the range of national priorities--from paying off our national debt to tax relief. But we also enjoy a historic opportunity to address today's military challenges and reach deeply into the future assuring our continued peace and prosperity. 
   At the same time, we must be careful and have the courage to make tough choices where necessary ensuring that we get the most for our defense dollars. We must not become embroiled in an arms race with ourselves. We are the best already, we need only stay ahead of our greatest threats. 
   Mr. President, for the last couple years one of our greatest readiness challenges has been recruiting and retention. I believe a young American today should see not only a tremendous opportunity to join the best military in the world, but an opportunity to join a military that will get the resources it needs to stay trained and ready. And, more importantly, a military that will get even better. 
   In addition, Mr. President, I rise to talk about events earlier today. 
   The explosion and loss of life this morning aboard the U.S.S. Cole is deeply disturbing and has affected all of us. The U.S.S. Cole, her crew, and their families are homeported in Norfolk, VA, and are proud members of Virginia's Navy family. Our prayers go out to those sailors killed and injured or missing. Our prayers go out to the courageous crew members right now dealing with the aftermath of this attack, and our prayers go out to the families of the U.S.S. Cole who live, as Navy families always have, with quiet courage, with this kind of danger, and in the face of this kind of tragedy. 
   I can confidently report that the extended Navy family in Virginia and around the country is coming together in this tragic moment to support and comfort the families of the U.S.S. Cole. The resources of this Nation will be there for them in this time of great sorrow and need.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President. I would like to say a few words about the Interior Appropriations bill and CARA. The Interior Appropriation is a good bill. CARA is a great bill. CARA brought together a variety of supporters from all parts of the country to develop a program that would provide for wildlife protection, urban parks, green space, coastal impact protection and would guarantee funding for the development of recreation areas for years to come. 
   Elements of CARA have been included in the Interior bill, although the funding for these provisions is paltry by comparison to the House and Senate CARA bills. Other provisions may find a home in other appropriations packages, but one of the most important elements may be orphaned in the end. That is the provision for wildlife and habitat protection. Just as we are cheering our success in securing a place for wildlife, as we celebrate a growing population of eagles on the Potomac River, we are failing to fund the programs that make this possible. State wildlife agencies have clearly demonstrated their ability to bring back populations of threatened and endangered species, such as the pronghorn and the bald eagle. But they lack the resources to repeat the success on thousands of other species. 
   The purpose of CARA was to provide the ounce of prevention that keeps species from becoming threatened. CARA was to protect both game and nongame populations. By providing dependable state based funding we could ensure on-the-ground protection of wildlife, and continued maintenance of habitat for all wild species. It is important to note that there is an educational component in Title III of CARA. We are increasingly becoming an urban nation, and it is important to provide an introduction to wild places and wild things to our children. This introduction will help them become the next generation of good land stewards.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleagues to express my outrage at the treatment of judicial nominees this year. I do so with the same preface as my distinguished friend from Illinois, in saying that I have a good working and personal relationship with the chairman of the committee, but the failure to confirm the nominees at this time is an outrage. 
   I would like to focus my remarks on our efforts to fill one of the vacancies on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has fifteen seats. Five of those seats are currently vacant. 
   We have one seat on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals that has been vacant for a decade--longer than any other vacancy in the nation. 
   Filling this vacancy has been deemed a ``judicial emergency'' by the U.S. Judicial Conference. 
   On June 30, the President of the United States nominated Roger Gregory, a distinguished lawyer from Virginia, to fill this vacancy. Mr. Gregory graduated summa cum laude from Virginia State University and received his J.D. from the University of Michigan. He has an extensive federal practice, is an accomplished attorney, and was described by Commonwealth Magazine as one of Virginia's ``Top 25 Best and Brightest.'' And he has bipartisan support. Senators JOHN WARNER and ARLEN SPECTER have also written to the Judiciary Committee to seek a hearing for Mr. Gregory. 
   Despite the well-documented need for another judge on this court, and despite Mr. Gregory's stellar qualifications, the Judiciary Committee has  stubbornly refused to even grant Mr. Gregory the courtesy of a hearing. In failing to provide Mr. Gregory with a hearing, the Judiciary Committee is abdicating its Constitutional responsibility and is effectively standing in the courthouse door to block this nomination. 
   Article II of the United States Constitution makes clear that the President is to nominate and the Senate is to provide advice and consent on the nomination. It is difficult for the Senate to provide advice or give its consent if it won't even allow the nominee to be heard. Many excuses have been offered for why this nominee won't be granted a hearing. One convenient excuse is that this is a presidential election year. 
   There is nothing in Article II of the United States Constitution, however, that suspends its provisions every four years. We have a constitutional obligation to render our advice and, if appropriate, grant our consent or, if not appropriate, decline to grant our consent. But we cannot just throw up our hands and declare that this provision of the Constitution is rendered meaningless during presidential election years. 
   The supposed logic that underlies this excuse is that the nominee may not reflect the judicial philosophy of the next Administration. But how can we even question the nominee's judicial philosophy if we never hear from him. So even this excuse argues in favor of granting the nominee a hearing. 
   The most recent excuse for failing to act on Mr. Gregory's nomination is that five years ago a gentleman from North Carolina was nominated for this seat, and so the argument goes this seat now ``belongs'' to North Carolina. But five years before that, when this seat and three others were created, a Virginian was arguably nominated to fill this seat--but the Senate only acted to fill the other three seats and this one has been vacant ever since. 
   More importantly, however, seats on Courts of Appeal don't ``belong'' to any state. As I have already noted, there are only ten judges currently sitting in the Fourth Circuit. Four of these ten judges are filling seats that were previously filled by a candidate judge and then from another state. Finally, it's a little hard for the senior Senator from North Carolina to complain that the seat belongs to North Carolina when he is the one who has been blocking a North Carolinian from filling the seat. 
   Rather than hide behind excuses, the Senate Judiciary Committee ought to seize the opportunity to right a historical wrong. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has the largest percentage of African-Americans in the nation. Yet, the Fourth Circuit has never been integrated. In fact, it is the only Circuit in the country that has never in history had minority representation. If we were to confirm Roger Gregory--who is African-American--we could knock down yet another barrier that has existed for far too long. 
   In my view, courts should better reflect the people over whom they pass judgment. We still have time, if only we have the will to act. In 1992, when there was a Republican in the White House and the Democrats ran the Senate, we confirmed 6 Circuit Court judges later than July: 3 in August 2, in September 1, in October. In fact, its instructive to look at the one nominee who was confirmed in October of 1992. Timothy K. Lewis was nominated to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals on September 17. The Judiciary Committee gave him a hearing on September 24. He was reported out of the Judiciary Committee on October 7, and confirmed by the Senate on October 8. 
   Roger Gregory is an outstanding nominee. Rather than standing in the courthouse door, we ought to throw the door open and desegregate the Fourth Circuit. We ought to end this judicial and moral emergency and we ought to do it now. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve any time remaining for those covered under the unanimous consent order.

   Mr. ROBB. Madam President, I intend to vote against the energy and water appropriations conference report this afternoon. I support the vast majority of the bill, in fact, there are a number of projects I have worked for years to have included. But, once again, in addition to those projects, an anti-environmental rider was also attached to this legislation. 
   The President has announced his intention to veto this bill because of that anti-environmental rider. So we will be back here in the next few days considering this legislation again. And I have been assured that when we take up this legislation again, our Virginia projects will be included, since they are not the subject of the dispute. I hope that in the intervening period, we can remove the rider which would prevent the Corps of Engineers from reviewing its procedures to protect the Missouri river and its environment.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to authorize a memorial and gardens in honor and commemoration of Frederick Douglass. Frederick Douglass was a renowned abolitionist and civil rights leader. As a powerful orator, Douglass spoke out against slavery. As an advisor to President Abraham Lincoln, Douglass advocated for equal voting rights for African Americans. Frederick Douglass spent over 20 years living in the Anacostia region of Washington, D.C. and it is appropriate that we dedicate the National Memorial and Gardens to his memory in the community where he lived. As companion legislation gains momentum in the House, it is important that we pledge our support to this worthy endeavor.

   Mr. ROBB. Madam President, the suspense regarding this particular vote is long over, but the date on the effect and implications of PNTR in China is really just beginning. 
   My rationale for supporting PNTR differs in some respects from my colleagues, who have mostly emphasized the positive impact on our economy and exports, and it relates to our ability to change the face of China--not just economically, but in terms of improving human rights, labor standards, and environmental protections, and in ensuring the rule of law. 
   My genuine, and I think realistic, hope is that WTO accession becomes a means for improving the most repressive aspects of Chinese society, eventually permitting our two nations to embrace, in a sincere way, the same cause of global security and peace. 
   It will take a concentrated effort by the next President, however, to institute a policy that uses WTO as a cudgel to aid those who have been repressed, incarcerated, and persecuted in China. 
   I would submit that we need to keep the faith with those brave Chinese who have risked their lives in the name of freedom--at Tiananmen and elsewhere--as China adapts its economy to the rules required of every WTO member. 
   Like the President, I believe the choice between economic rights and human rights, between economic security and national security, is a false choice. 
   But I do not believe that the emphasis of American foreign policy should be on engaging and partnering with any Chinese leaders whose sole aim is to maintain and promote the power of a bankrupt Communist party. 
   Looking back on the last 30 years, I think it would be fair to say that the current administration has dedicated an extraordinary amount of effort and attention toward building a lasting cooperative relationship with China. 
   That is not inconsistent with the policies of Presidents Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush, who appreciated the significance of integrating all aspects of Chinese society into the world community. 
   In this regard I believe that achieving WTO accession is likely to be considered one of the President's single most important achievements during his time in office. 
   The groundwork was laid during previous administrations, but this President demonstrated the instinct and diplomatic skill and judgment to close the deal. 
   He understood the urgency and necessity of bringing the world's third largest economy into compliance with trading rules that nearly all other nations enforce and respect. 
   It is a considerable achievement. 
   The opportunity for foreign equity ownership in China will rise dramatically. 
   Many states subsidies will end. 
   China will have to meet international trade norms. 
   If they break the rules, a WTO panel can intervene with punitive measures. 
   Meanwhile, the United States is not required to change a single tariff, lower a particular subsidy, or alter any of our own invisible barriers to trade. 
   This is a win-win prospect for American businesses. 
   China's leader, Jiang Zemin, while visiting the U.N. a few days ago, had some interesting things to say about the future of his country, and it relates in part to WTO accession. 
   His calculation, clearly, is that one party rule in China can thrive side by side with the economic freedom required by China's membership in the WTO. 
   He believes the two are mutually exclusive. 
   Madam President, that seems paradoxical to me. 
   I don't believe it is tenable to argue that, over the long term, economic capitalism and political communism can coexist, let alone prosper, in the same sovereign country. 
   And it is my fervent hope that in China the former weakens and dissolves the latter. 
   WTO accession for China gets us started in that direction. 
   The legendary Deng Xiao Ping was fond of saying that you should ``cross the river by feeling the stones.'' I think his successors approach WTO with some trepidation, not knowing exactly where those stones are. 
   I would assert that we have a key role to play as WTO rules and regulations penetrate Chinese society, specifically in assisting and supporting and working with newly economically empowered Chinese businessmen, entrepreneurs, farmers, and ordinary citizens. 
   With their profits and financial gain they will be in a position to create the right circumstances for political reform and change inside China. 
   We have a responsibility to do our part in pressuring the regime from outside. 
   Our actions and rhetoric matter on everything from human rights to Tibet to the rule of law. 
   The consequences of failing to ratify PNTR have to be considered as well, and in this case that is why I pledged ahead of time to oppose any and all amendments, even though some clearly had merit. As a practical matter, at this late date in the 106th Congress if the Senate failed to pass a clean version of PNTR it would risk, at least procedurally, getting a measure passed into law by the end of the congressional session. 
   Moreover, I have no doubt that China would misunderstand the reasons for our inability to pass PNTR, and that would, almost inevitably, ratchet up tensions between us even further, and it would create serious national security problems for us and our Asian allies at a minimum. In a larger sense, WTO is about changing the face of China. 
   The economic change will come first, to be sure, but it will lead inexorably  to changes in these other areas--and in my judgment, it will lead to positive changes, from our point of view, sooner than if we were to reject PNTR. 
   And to re-emphasize the consequences of failure to ratify, it will also avoid the certain deterioration in our relationship with China that would take place if we rejected PNTR, which, again, would have serious and long lasting consequences in our national security relationships among all of the Pacific nations. 
   It has been my position that we ought to seek to maintain and promote, on a cooperative basis, our relations with China which represent a slight nuance of difference from administration policy designed to engage China strategically as a partner. 
   We share common ground with Beijing on a broad range of subjects, and it makes absolute sense to work together to solve problems on the Korean Peninsula and the like. 
   But that should not prevent us from recognizing that our values and principles are so starkly different. 
   Implying somehow that we're partners, or wishing that it were so, does not speak truth to power. 
   WTO represents an opportunity for the world community to join with a newly empowered economic class in China, and it ought to be treated as a means for strengthening their hand. 
   The focal point for U.S. policymakers should be to promote, sustain, and enforce broad economic freedoms within China. 
   Only then can we make a difference with our overall national security policies, not just through implementation of the WTO that will eventually lead to the political freedom and liberty that the Chinese people deserve. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   September 12, 1999: 
   Arthur Adams, 41, Philadelphia, PA; Anita Arrington, 36, Charlotte, NC; Robert Bason, 21, Detroit, MI; Keith Brisco, 23, Chicago, IL; Shiesha Davis, 19, Detroit, MI; Clinton Dias, 24, Baltimore, MD; Steve Esparza, 15, San Antonio, TX; Friday D. Gardner, 21, Chicago, IL; Tony M. Gill, 28, Gary, IN; Elaine Howard, 47, Detroit, MI; Greta  L. Johnson, 33, Memphis, TN; Rickey D. Johnson, 36, Memphis, TN; Willie Johnson, 20, Miami, FL; Roberto E. Moody, 30, Seattle, WA; Donald Morrison, 20, San Antonio, TX; Deric Parks, 23, Washington, DC; Harry R. Penninger, 69, Memphis, TN; Albert Perry, 31, Detroit, MI; Artemio Raygoza, 22, San Antonio, TX; Douglas M. Stanton, 33, Chicago, IL; Rodrick Swain, 24, Houston, TX; Ramon Vasquez-Ponti, 56, Miami, FL; Damon Williams, 21, Kansas City, MO; Derrion Wilson, 19, Memphis, TN; Margaret Wilson, 52, Dallas, TX; Dwayne Wright, 28, Detroit, MI; Unidentified Male, 18, Norfolk, VA. 
   One of the gun violence victims I mentioned, 20-year-old Donald Morrison of San Antonio, was shot and killed one year ago today when an irritated driver followed Donald into a convenience store parking lot and shot him in the head. 
   Another victim, 33-year-old Greta Johnson of Memphis, was shot and killed one year ago today by her husband before he turned the gun on himself. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare Glaucoma Detection Act of 2000. I'm pleased to be joined in its introduction by my colleagues Senator CHAFEE and Senator MOYNIHAN. 
   Mr. President, the Medicare Glaucoma Detection Act follows suit in a series of preventive health proposals I've cosponsored to help Medicare beneficiaries take a more active role in their health care. Reforming Medicare by adding preventive benefits recognizes that it is much more cost effective to prevent illness than to treat it. Over the past several years, Congress has expanded Medicare's preventive benefits, adding screening and detection services like mammography, bone mass measurements and screening for prostate and colorectal cancer to help Medicare beneficiaries. It is now time to add another important prevention benefit to Medicare: screening for glaucoma. 
   The Medicare Glaucoma Detection Act of 2000 will give seniors access to the best defense against glaucoma--complete eye examinations on a regular basis. Glaucoma is a significant cause of legal blindness in this country and is the single most common cause of irreversible blindness among African-Americans. In fact, the prevalence of glaucoma is an astounding four to six times higher in African-Americans that the rest of the population. 
   Glaucoma is often called ``the silent thief of sight'' because the afflicted person has no warning sign, no hint that anything is wrong. Over the years, the increased buildup of pressure causes damage to the optic nerve in the back of the eyes. Because the disease does not show any symptoms until considerable damage has been done, coverage of regularly scheduled exams is a critical step in controlling the disease. If detected in the early stages, glaucoma can be effectively treated to prevent loss of vision. 
   The bill I am introducing today will establish a Medicare glaucoma detection benefit that follows the guidelines set forth by the American Academy of Ophthalmology, which recommend that individuals 60 years of age or older with a family history of glaucoma receive a glaucoma screening once every two years. Too many of America's seniors are in danger of losing their vision--an estimated 120,000 persons are legally blind due to glaucoma. This bill is the first step toward reversing that trend. 
   Mr. President, it's important to note that blindness is not simply a medical problem--the costs of glaucoma are both the personal loss of sight and the economic costs to the individual and society associated with blindness. Annual costs to the government associated with blindness are estimated at more than four billion dollars. Moreover, eyesight is a gift that allows seniors to maintain their independence. By helping preserve the ability of seniors to cook, to shop, to drive, to care for themselves and to recognize family and friends, the Medicare Glaucoma Detection Act of 2000 will allow seniors to stay independent longer. 
   We do not yet have a cure for glaucoma, but blindness from glaucoma can be prevented through early detection and treatment. I urge each of my colleagues to support this bill's passage.

    Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'd like to take a moment to pay special recognition to a good friend of mine and a distinguished former jurist, Robert R. Merhige, Jr. of Richmond, Virginia. Now in private practice after serving as a U.S. District Judge, Bob was recognized a few months ago in an article in The National Law Journal as the driving force behind the resolution of the Dalkon Shield Claimants Trust. The article details Judge Merhige's efforts to resolve over 400,000 claims, and it's clear that he accomplished this difficult task by working towards a fair result with skill and intellect. He kept his eye on the ball until the job was concluded. I ask that the article be printed in the RECORD.  
   $3 Billion Later, Dalkon Trust Closes Shop: Mass Tort Clearinghouse Seen by Some as the Best-Run Outfit of Its Kind  
   RICHMOND, VA.--The numbers are impressive, even by mass tort standards. 
   More than 400,000 claims reviewed. Nearly $3 billion distributed. Administrative costs just 9%, including lawyer fees. 
   Even more impressive, the job is done. 
   The Dalkon Shield Claimants Trust closed on April 30 with a claim to being the best-managed mass tort plan so far. 
   Retired U.S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige, Jr., now of counsel at Hunton & Williams, gets much of the credit for what many view as the success of the trust, as well as the blame for what others see as its shortcomings. 
   The trust emerged from the 1985 bankruptcy petition of A.H. Robins Co., which sold 3.6 million intrauterine birth devices called the Dalkon Shield between 1971 and 1974. Robins took it off the market under government pressure. 
   Robins and its products liability insurer, Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., were overwhelmed by allegations that women had suffered perforated uteruses and pelvic inflammatory disease that left them sterile. More than 326,000 women filed claims in response to a worldwide ad campaign. 
   Judge Merhige's 1987 estimate that the liability wouldn't top $2.475 billion set off a bidding war, won by American Home Products Corp. It acquired Robins by providing about $2.3 billion for claimants, to be paid by the trust, and $700 million-plus in stock to Robins shareholders. 
   Claimants' payments were based on amounts Robins paid to settle cases before the bankruptcy and based on their medical records. With interest, they totaled nearly $3 billion. 
   Robert E. Manchester, of Burlington, Vt., who represented 3,500-plus claimants, said of Judge Merhige, ``He shaped the solution by tapping into people who were willing to be constructive.'' 
   ``There was a significant number of people who felt they were treated badly by the process''--mostly atypical claimants --plaintiffs' lawyer Stephen W. Bricker, of Richmond said. 
   James F. Szaller, of Cleveland's Brown & Szaller, said that Judge Merhige ``sometimes took unusual courses, but he did get it done. The result for the vast majority of people was good.''

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, in these last few weeks of this Congress, there is much to be done. I would like to focus this morning on our constitutional responsibility to confirm judges. 
   Virginia is one of the five states covered by the Fourth Circuit for the U.S. Court of Appeals. Today, one third of the seats on the Fourth Circuit are vacant. One seat on the bench has been vacant for ten years--longer than any other seat in the country. The U.S. Judicial Conference has called filling that seat a ``judicial emergency,'' and Chief Justice William Rehnquist has warned that ``vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary.'' 
   One reason for the high number of vacancies on the Fourth Circuit is the claim that the appellate court doesn't need any more judges. Those who oppose filling the vacancies argue that having more judges will make decision-making more cumbersome and difficult, and that keeping the number small leads to more efficient deliberations. 
   The problem with this argument is that it substitutes ``efficiency'' for ``justice'' in our judicial system. Certainly it would be more efficient to have criminal cases decided by one juror instead of twelve, but our Founding Fathers wisely determined that a variety of views in the jury room would be more likely to yield a result that was ``right,'' and ``fair''. It's the same reason our Supreme Court is made up of nine jurists, instead of one. And it is difficult to believe that justice is being served fully in a circuit that hears oral argument on only 23 percent of its  cases--the lowest percentage of any other circuit--and dismisses 87 percent of its appeals in brief, unsigned opinions according to the Washington Post. While efficiency is laudable, justice is the goal. 
   On June 30, 2000, the President nominated Roger Gregory to fill the vacancy on the Fourth Circuit that has been open for a decade. Roger Gregory is a highly qualified and well respected attorney from Richmond, Virginia. He graduated summa cum laude from Virginia State University and received his J.D. from the University of Michigan. He has an extensive federal practice, is an accomplished attorney, and was described by Commonwealth Magazine as one of Virginia's ``Top 25 Best and Brightest.'' 
   When he is confirmed, Roger Gregory will fill the longest-standing vacancy in the nation. He will bring energy and insight to the Fourth Circuit. In addition, as an African-American, he will bring much-needed diversity to the bench. 
   The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals does not look like America, and it never has. No African-American has ever served on the Fourth Circuit. In fact, it is the only circuit court in the nation without minority representation. 
   This should trouble all of us. Justice cannot be served without a diversity of views and experiences expressed in the rooms where decisions are made. 
   As the Supreme Court noted when it barred discrimination in the selection of juries, the exclusion of minorities or women from the deliberative process removes ``qualities of human nature and varieties of human experience, the range of which is unknown or perhaps unknowable.'' 
   The absence of minority representation on the Fourth Circuit is especially troubling, however, since the Fourth Circuit has the largest percentage of African-Americans of any circuit in the nation. In our circuit, twenty-three percent of our population is African-American. Yet not one of the judges on the Fourth Circuit is African-American. Mr. President, it's time for a change. In fact, it's past time. 
   There have been several efforts in the past to integrate this circuit, but these efforts have been blocked. The Administration has tried since 1995 to integrate this circuit, but the ``blue slips'' for these nominees simply weren't returned, effectively thwarting those nominees. 
   I have argued for years that Virginia deserves another seat on the bench. Finally late last fall, we in Virginia were given an opportunity to fill one of the vacancies. We seized the opportunity and after an extensive and thorough search and vetting process--including time-consuming ABA screenings and FBI background checks--Roger Gregory was nominated by the Administration. We now have a chance to correct this gross inequity on the Fourth Circuit. Roger Gregory has the support of both Senators from Virginia. 
   There is time to move this nominee. Immediately before we began our August recess, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing and three judges were voted out of the Committee just six days after they were nominated. Of the last 12 judges confirmed by the Senate, 11 were confirmed within three months of nomination. 
   In 1992, another presidential election year in which the White House was controlled by one party and the Senate by another, Senate Democrats confirmed 66 nominees to the federal bench. Eleven of those were Circuit Court judges, and six of the Circuit Court judges were confirmed later than July of that year. Three were confirmed in August, two in September, and one in October. 
   And presidential candidate George W. Bush has called on the Senate to approve judicial nominees within 60 days. The sixty days for Roger Gregory passed on August 30. It is time to grant Mr. Gregory the courtesy of a hearing. 
   The late, renowned Judge Spotswood Robinson integrated the D.C. Circuit in 1966. He, too, came from Richmond, Virginia. It is time for another Richmonder, Roger Gregory, to break another barrier. We have already waited too long. 
   I urge the Judiciary Committee to move the nomination of Roger Gregory, and grant him a hearing. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, Rabbi Israel Zoberman, the leader of Congregation Beth Chaverim in Virginia Beach and President of the Hampton Roads Board of Rabbis, recently offered some inspirational comments on the selection of our colleague, Senator JOSEPH I. LIEBERMAN, as the Democratic Nominee for Vice President of the United States. I ask that Rabbi Zoberman's comments be printed in the RECORD.  
   Jewish Candidate for VP: Local Rabbi Sheds Tears of Joy  
   The Jewish response to events tends to fluctuate from the extreme of elation, of mazal tov!, to the extreme of despair, of oy vey! It is no wonder since the Jewish condition poignantly reflects the tension between the two poles of the human experience; bringing about either a Messianic exaltation concerning sheer survival or a painful note acknowledging a harsh reality. 
   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is quoted as saying in the past that when you give a Jew optimistic news he turns pessimistic. This exaggeration by the hitherto highest ranking Jewish American, a refugee from Nazi Germany, who lacks Senator Joseph Lieberman's proud religious attachment, is rooted in Jewish caution given the trying lessons of its historical experience. It was no surprise then that upon Senator Lieberman's nomination to the National Democratic ticket, there were those Jews who felt that the ever feared specter of anti-Semitism of pre-World War II days might rear its ugly head again. However, the hardcore anti-Semites on the very fringes of society, already assert that the Jews control the world. 
   There were those whose first impulse was to give thanks for the ``miracle'' of finally removing a remaining barrier carrying much symbolism. Since American Jews have already made it in our great land, it serves as a significant reminder that not all doors have been fully open. For most Jews, it probably was a mixed response, weighing all possible consequences to the historic act. 
   Who could remain neutral to Senator Lieberman's own genuine joy mingled with deep, though inclusive, religious expression, and his wife Hadassah's touching sharing of her family Holocaust background. I myself, son of survivors who spent his early childhood in a Displaced Persons Camp in Germany, was moved to tears witnessing a great American drama unfold, reaching a new high. 
   Indeed we have reason to rejoice in America moving closer to fulfilling its promise to all its citizens with renewed hope now that the highest offices in the land will be available to qualified minority candidates of all groups. 
   At this turning point, America has the curiosity and opportunity to learn more about the heritage of its fellow Jewish citizens, with its various spiritual movements, in the way that only this breakthrough event can provide. American Jews, at the same time, are poised to hopefully become more reassured about their own religious and ethnic affiliation in a country where their major challenge is not being rejected as Americans in this, our most hospitable home, but rather retaining their Jewish identity in face of unprecedented easy assimilation into the mainstream. 
   The possible reinvigoration of the political process because of the presently injected excitement, in spite of yet to be proved American response and maturation over the religious factor, is certainly a worthy plus. What our nation urgently needs is less apathy and more involvement by all in an environment with diminished interest in politics and an embarrassing low voting record, which ultimately are the dangers facing our democracy. Civil disagreement, too, on important issues ought to replace the evident cultural war which threatens to tear apart the precious pluralistic fabric of the enviable American quilt--with church and State separation the golden thread keeping it together.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am supporting the fiscal year 2001 Defense Appropriations Act with a very mixed sense of frustrated resignation and expectant hope for the way we are resourcing our national defense. A major source of frustration this year is that we will have missed yet another opportunity through the decision made in the budget process to meet our new, growing or neglected national security requirements. 
   We should have been able to fix our military medical health care system and keep our promise of health care to thousands of military retirees who feel they have been cheated by the nation. We should have been able to raise the pay of our service members to bring it more in line with the private sector faster. We should have been able to fund our dangerous ship and aircraft maintenance backlogs. We should have been able to lay the foundation for increasing our ship construction rate to ensure we keep our 300-ship Navy strong and ready. We should have been able to increase our funding of basic science and technology to set the conditions for the rapid development of the next generations of ships, aircraft, and land combat forces. 
   It is a source of continuing disappointment to me that there is still too much parochial, pork-barrel spending in the defense appropriation process. Last year, the Defense Appropriations bill was so overburdened with pork, I voted against it in protest. Increasing defense spending, so necessary to the demands of our national security today and into the future, will not improve our military capability and readiness if money is funneled into projects that serve parochial interests, not the national interest. 
   My views on the need to increase defense spending and my objections to pork-barrel spending are well known and I regret the missed opportunity this appropriation represents. Yet, having said that, there are many elements of this defense appropriations act that are critically important and which I fully support. This appropriation continues the trend and our commitment in the Congress to increase spending for our national defense--$15 billion above last year's appropriation and $3.3 billion above the President's request. Most importantly, it does more to take care of our most important national security resource--people. This appropriation increases pay for our service men and women by 3.7 percent, increases housing allowances for military families, increases quality of life enhancements, and increases enlistment and retention bonuses to deal with critical challenges in personnel. 
   This appropriation supports important ship construction and maintenance requirements to keep our Navy strong and ready. It provides full funding, $4.1 billion, for our next aircraft carrier CVN-77 and $1.7 billion for procurement of a third Virginia Class for New Attack submarines. Very importantly, this appropriation increases the President's request for ship depot maintenance by $142 million, and appropriately makes these funds immediately available to the Navy as a matter of emergency to deal with a critical ship repair backlog. 
   We need to take a lesson from this session's consideration of how Congress provides for the common defense. We need to take advantage of historic budget surpluses to objectively and aggressively deal with the challenges of defending America's interests in a still very dangerous world. We need take advantage of a political and popular willingness to invest in today's and tomorrow's security and ensure that we fully resource our armed force's requirements for a good quality of life, training, equipment, maintenance, and modernization. Finally, Mr. President, we need to take advantage of an opportunity to keep our promise of health care to the thousands of military retirees who gave the best years of their lives to the defense of this nation. I regret we missed this opportunity, but on balance, this bill satisfies many of our national security requirements, and merits support.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, last month, the Finance Committee reported a bill by voice vote to provide treatment for low-income women identified as having breast or cervical cancer through a federal screening program. I rise today to urge the Senate to expeditiously take up and pass this legislation. 
   In 1990, the Senate unanimously approved establishment of the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, a CDC program which has expanded screening for these diseases to over one million women. Unfortunately, after receiving diagnosis, many of these women find themselves without health insurance and with no one to turn to for treatment. This is unconscionable--it's time to finish the job. 
   Earlier this summer, I hosted women's health forums in Virginia to discuss with women health concerns of priority. Breast and cervical cancer survivors asked me to come to you and my distinguished colleagues and urge your support for swift passage of this legislation. I was pleased to support the bill in Committee, and I am happy to echo their words to you. 
   73 Senators have cosponsored this proposal and the House of Representatives, in May, passed companion legislation with overwhelming support. Mr. President, on behalf of all women, I urge the Senate to take up and pass this legislation as soon as possible.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a new legislative proposal to help level the playing field for small businesses that try to provide health insurance for their employees and make health insurance more affordable for all Americans. 
   While our economy is the strongest it's ever been, the number of uninsured Americans has gone from 32 million in 1987 to more than 44 million today. And that number is rising. While our nation continues to forge ahead in improving the world's greatest health care system, we face the increasing problem of having a significant percentage of our population that has no way to access it. 
   One of the largest sectors of the uninsured is employees who work for small businesses. While small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy, they also face some of the greatest challenges--particularly when it comes to providing health benefits for their employees. While the number of uninsured among employees who work for companies with more than 500 people is 1 in 8, that number soars among companies with fewer than 25 employees--to 1 in 3. This is because large employers can spread the costs of providing health insurance among their multitude of employees, while smaller companies have a much more difficult task. We need to help small business owners--and the employees who work for them--better afford quality health insurance. 
   Today, I propose that we lend a hand to the hardworking small businessmen and women of America, and their employees, to help them erase the gap in coverage between large and small businesses. The legislation I am introducing--the Health Insurance Equity Act--will give small businesses with less than 50 employees a 20% tax credit toward the cost of buying health insurance for their employees. To encourage small businesses to pool together and take advantage of the same benefits that their larger counterparts have, the credit will increase to 25% if the businesses join new ``qualified health benefit purchasing coalitions'' that can help them easily administer their new health plans and negotiate better rates with insurers. 
   In addition, this legislation makes a change in the tax code to ensure that these new coalitions can enjoy the full benefit of charitable contributions from private foundations. While some private foundations have indicated that they are willing to help fund some of the start-up costs of health purchasing coalitions, current law does not specify that these sorts of contributions would qualify as a charitable donation. For this reason, private foundations have been reluctant to make grants or loans to these coalitions. The bill I am introducing today will clarify that aid to qualified health benefit purchasing coalitions are entirely tax-deductible, which can help encourage private foundations and other interested parties to help the coalitions with their important duties. 
   By helping people get better access to basic health insurance--before they get very sick--we can save money for both hospital and patient, while helping millions of Americans live more healthy lifestyles.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today simply allows for a land exchange between the National Park Service and the Central Intelligence Agency. This exchange will enable the CIA to address security issues at the entrance to their complex, while preserving access to the Federal highway Administration's Turner-Fairbanks Highway Research Center. 
   The exchange is currently the subject of an Interagency Agreement between the National Park Service, George Washington Memorial Parkway, and the Central Intelligence Agency. This is a simple exchange that I am sure can be acted on in short order.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Creating New Markets and Empowering America Act of 2000, which is designed to strengthen and revitalize low and moderate income communities across America. 
   Because we made some tough choices to balance our budget, we have the first federal surplus since Lyndon Johnson was President. And now is the time to give some back, particularly to those who have missed out on so much of our economic prosperity. This legislation would pump new capital into our nation's inner cities and isolated rural communities--areas that have had a difficult time building up from within. 
   The legislation contains three ``New Markets'' initiatives designed to attract and expand new capital into low to moderate income areas. First, a New Markets Tax Credit would infuse $15 billion in investments over the next 7 years through a 30 percent tax credit for businesses who provide capital to lower income communities. Secondly, the bill authorizes the designation of America's Private Investment Companies (APIC's) which would receive federal matching funds for private investments made in lower income areas. This provision would allow $1 billion in federal low-cost loans to match $500 million in private investment. Thirdly, the bill would create a new class of venture capital funds to assist with the operation and administration of ongoing businesses in lower income areas, who have growth potential, so they can continue to expand.  
   The bill also requires mandatory funding for Round II Empowerment Zones (EZ's) and Enterprise Communities (EC's) and creates a new set of Round III EZ's. 
   Mr. President, the mandatory funding of Round II Empowerment Zones is critically important to the citizens of Norfolk and Portsmouth, Virginia. The Federal Government made a commitment to these two communities--they need and deserve the funding--and I am determined to get the check in the mail to them. With this legislation, the Norfolk-Portsmouth Empowerment Zone would be guaranteed the remaining $94 million it was promised when it competed for the Empowerment Zone designation. 
   The legislation I'm introducing today also creates 40 Renewal Communities--which reflect the agreement between President Clinton and Speaker HASTERT--along with a host of tax provisions to expand and revitalize housing. 
   Very important to my home state of Virginia, this bill contains legislation I introduced earlier this year (S..2445) to assist communities affected by job loss due to trade. The Assistance in Development for Communities Act (AID for Communities Act) both assists communities in developing a plan to retool their economies and offers financial assistance and tax incentives to help communities implement those plans. 
   Mr. President, the AID for Communities Act is immensely important to the people of Martinsville, Virginia--who have suffered economic devastation from the recent closing of a Tultex plant. This bill would give the citizens of Martinsville the urgent assistance they need to strengthen their economy and create a more vibrant future for all who live there. 
   Finally, Mr. President, this legislation includes two new initiatives to help religious and other community organizations better participate in federal grant programs. Specifically, it requires the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to provide assistance in a manner similar to HUD's Office of Community and Faith-Based Organizations to assist faith-based and community organizations in applying for federal grant funds to provide substance abuse treatment. It would also require the IRS to provide guidance and make information available to assist religious and community organizations in establishing tax-exempt entities that can be used to operate social services. 
   Many of these organizations are unfamiliar with the process necessary to set up a tax-exempt organization and are, therefore, unable to participate in federal grant programs. This provision would provide them with the necessary information and assistance. 
   Mr. President, the ``Creating New Markets and Empowering America Act of 2000'' will spur economic growth in low to moderate income communities across our nation. As such, it will improve the lives of countless Americans. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I want to join my senior colleague today in introducing legislation that will establish a Federal commission to commemorate the founding of the English colony at Jamestown nearly 400 years ago. Jamestown, the first permanent English Colony in the new world, holds enormous significance for us as a nation. We are an English speaking nation and our laws are based on English law. The history of Jamestown is the earliest history of the United States, and our culture still reflects those beginnings. 
   Jamestown was the capitol of Virginia for 92 years and was the center of cultural activity for the new colony. The celebration of the 400th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown is important to Virginia, and the Nation. In order to ensure that the celebration be conducted in a way that all Americans can appreciate and share in the history of Jamestown, we propose to establish a federal commission that will assist in developing federal activities that will complement those programs and activities undertaken by the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
   Currently the Commonwealth of Virginia and the federal government, through the Department of Interior, work together at Jamestown to tell the story of the early colonial times. The commission will provide additional assistance, and coordination and will provide support for the scholarly research that is ongoing at the Jamestown site. The commission can help ensure that the celebration of our earliest history is accessible to a broad range of Americans, and not just those in the immediate vicinity of the original colony. 
   The authority for the Commission will terminate one year after the Jamestown celebration in 2007 and after completing a report on its activities. The report will not only tell the story of the Jamestown celebration, but will provide guideposts and information for national celebrations in the future. Having an end to the commission's work will ensure that the organization will not outlive its usefulness. The planning for this wonderful celebration has already begun, and so I ask for quick consideration of this legislation so that we can move forward together.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act of 2000 with Senators GRASSLEY, DASCHLE and COLLINS. This important legislation will correct several imperfections in our Tax Code that unfairly tax the victims of civil rights violations at a time when they are most vulnerable. I'm pleased that it accomplishes this in a fashion that has bi-partisan Congressional support and has been endorsed by civil rights organizations as well as the business community. 
   The Civil Rights Tax Fairness Act contains several provisions. The first section excludes emotional distress awards received in discrimination cases from the gross income of the recipient. Due to a change in the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, damages received for emotional distress in civil rights cases are taxable, while those received in slip and fall accidents are not. There is no defensible reason for this disparity and it must be changed. 
   The bill would also allow employees who receive lump sum awards for back wages for civil rights violations by their employers to take advantage of income averaging. Currently, if an employee receives a large award it will generally push that person into a higher income bracket for that year due to the income spike from the damages. The result is that the victim may be taxed at a higher rate than they would if they had received the income as wages in the normal course of business. This is the wrong tax treatment and should be corrected. 
   Finally, this legislation ends the double taxation on attorney's fees that are awarded to a victim in a discrimination case. Mr. President, even though the attorney ultimately gets the fees, not the victim, present law not only taxes the attorney on the fees that they receive when they take them into income, but also requires that the victim include them in computing their gross income. Even though they are supposed to be able to take a corresponding deduction, due to limitations on miscellaneous deductions and the alternative minimum tax, in most cases the victims cannot get the entire amount. This is not fair and cannot be the intended effect. 
   I look forward to working with the senior Senator from Iowa in getting this bill signed into law. It is time to bring our Tax Code into the 21st Century. We must implement tax policies that help to eradicate discrimination.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an amendment that I submitted on Friday to the marriage penalty bill, which the Senate will take up and vote on later today. My amendment, which is cosponsored by Senators KENNEDY, GRAHAM and BRYAN, follows up on a similar proposal I offered in April to the Senate budget resolution that would have required Congress to enact a new Medicare prescription drug benefit before considering any massive tax cuts. While a procedural hurdle prevented that amendment from passing, fifty-one senators voted to waive a budget point of order, indicating they favored it, and sending the American people a strong signal that a majority of the U.S. Senate thought we should put the needs of our nation's seniors before excessive tax cuts. 
   The majority, however, has moved in the opposite direction since then. This past Friday, we passed a large tax bill that would phase out the tax on the estates of those seniors who die, but did nothing to provide needed prescription drugs that can preserve the lives of those seniors who are living. Because I had cosponsored earlier legislation to ease the estate tax burden in order to preserve family farms and small businesses, I voted for this bill. Even though all of our Democratic amendments were defeated--and look forward to crafting more equitable legislation to address these same concerns after the President vetoes the bill we passed Friday. 
   The bill before the Senate now, however, is very different. Under the guise of eliminating the ``marriage penalty,'' the majority has brought a bill to the floor that would devote over half of its benefits to people who either aren't married, or who are actually receiving right now a tax benefit, or ``bonus,'' for being married. As I have stated previously, Mr. President, this takes a lot of chutzpah. 
   Mr. President, I believe we ought to eliminate the marriage penalty for those who actually suffer the marriage penalty and need the relief most. With all the rhetoric from the other side of the aisle about eliminating the marriage penalty, one might think that they'd share my view, and want to pass a bill that would actually focus on the penalty. 
   But a closer examination of the Republican bill reveals that it isn't quite what it's described to be. Mr. President, there are in fact 65 provisions in the current tax code that contain a marriage penalty, including Social Security. The bill reported from the Finance Committee on a straight party-line vote takes care of one marriage penalty provision completely and two others partially, and leaves the other 62 marriage penalties untouched. The Democratic bill addresses all 65 provisions, and takes care of the entire penalty for almost everyone. 
   Mr. President, it's time that we set our priorities straight. We ought not to be devoting billions of dollars of the surplus to individuals who currently suffer no marriage penalty whatever when we've done nothing to help those that suffer from the ``senior citizens' drug penalty''--the high prices our nation's seniors are forced to pay for prescription drugs. 
   The amendment that I've offered would force Congress to address these priorities. It simply says that the tax bill before the Senate today won't take effect until Congress has also fulfilled its responsibility to enact a meaningful Medicare prescription drug benefit. My amendment won't prevent Congress from enacting marriage penalty relief this year, nor will it keep a single married couple from enjoying the tax benefits in this bill. What it will do is ensure that we don't backtrack from the Senate's vote to enact a prescription drug benefit before we do major tax cuts. 
   Let me say, Mr. President, that this isn't just rhetoric. The problems faced by our nation's seniors in affording prescription drugs are immediate and real. I'd like to remind the Senate of a story I heard from a physician in my state recently about a patient who was splitting her doses of Tamoxifin--a breast cancer drug--with two of her friends who also had breast cancer, but couldn't afford the medication. As a result, all three women had inadequate doses of the medication. 
   Or consider the story of a disabled father of three from Pennington Gap, Virginia, who broke his neck several years ago, and went from making $50,000 a year to $800 a month in disability benefits. While he qualifies for Medicare, he's forced to choose each month between spending nearly half of his disability benefit on prescription drugs, or helping out his family, because Medicare offers no coverage for his medications. 
   These Virginians are not alone in their troubles. The average Medicare beneficiary will spend $1100 on prescription drugs this year. Most of them won't have adequate prescription drug coverage to help them cover these crushing costs. And the numbers of those that do have coverage are dropping rapidly. 
   Despite the suggestions of some of my colleagues, this problem isn't limited solely to the poor. One in four Medicare beneficiaries with a high income--defined as $45,000 a year for a couple--has no coverage for prescription drugs. And while some seniors do have coverage, nearly half of them lack coverage for the entire year, making them extremely vulnerable to catastrophic drug costs. 
   Complicating this matter for the elderly is the ``senior citizens' drug penalty'' that seniors without drug coverage are forced to pay. Most working Americans who are insured through the private sector pay less than the full retail price for prescription drugs. This is because insurers generally contract with private sector entities that negotiate better prices for drugs, and pass on the power of group purchasing to their customers. 
   Seniors lack this option, however, and must still pay full price for their drugs. One recent study showed that seniors without drug coverage typically pay 15 percent more than people  with coverage. And the percentage of Medicare beneficiaries without drug coverage who report not being able to afford a needed drug is about 5 times higher than those with coverage. 
   This ``senior citizens' drug penalty,'' in my view, is unconscionable. Senior citizens are more reliant on drugs, and have higher drug costs, than any other segment of the population. They deserve to have the same bargaining power that benefits other Americans. 
   Mr. President, in April, the other side spoke against my budget amendment, claiming that there was already adequate language in the Republican budget resolution to ensure that we pass a prescription drug benefit this year. At the time, they pointed to the $40 billion reserve fund which was included in the budget resolution that the Committee had reported, arguing that this would provide ample money to enact a prescription drug benefit and offer tax relief. 
   Republicans asked, in essence, that we trust them that the Senate won't put tax cuts before our nation's seniors. Let me say that I do trust my good friends on the other side of the aisle. But to borrow a line from Ronald Reagan, I believe we should trust--but verify. That requires deeds as well as words. 
   Mr. President, our nation's seniors deserve better than this. In April, at least fifty-one senators felt the same way. I urge every one of them, as well as senators who opposed my amendment then because they thought the $40 billion reserve fund would guarantee a prescription drug benefit, to support my amendment now. With its passage, we'll be able to eliminate both the true ``marriage penalty'' and the ``senior citizens' drug penalty.'' 
   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, recognizing this is the last rollcall vote of the evening, I will not take the time of this Chamber. It is a very simple amendment. A majority of this body has already gone on record saying that we will make certain we pass a prescription drug benefit for seniors before we pass all of these other tax cuts. We passed a major tax cut on Friday. We are proposing to pass tomorrow morning another major tax cut. 
   All this amendment says is, before these tax cuts go into effect, we will have actually delivered on the promise to provide a prescription drug benefit. 
   I hope it will be the pleasure of this Senate to adopt this amendment and keep the faith with our seniors.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I supported final passage of the Death Tax Elimination Act. I'm a cosponsor of similar legislation, and I've long believed that simply dying shouldn't be a taxable event. Death and taxes may be inevitable, but they don't have to be simultaneous. 
   Because we've been willing to make some tough decisions over the last seven years, we now have the first budget surplus we've seen in this nation in a generation. We need to continue making those tough decisions. We need to keep the prosperity going by investing in our schools and roads and paying down the debt. We need to strengthen Social Security and modernize Medicare by adding a prescription drug benefit. We need to bolster our nation's defenses, which includes improving the quality of life for those who now serve in our military and honoring our commitment to provide health care for life for those who've already served. And we need to provide targeted tax relief. 
   To address these many needs, we in Congress ought to establish our priorities first. I continue to believe that before we enact massive untargeted tax cuts, we should make sure that Social Security is strong and that Medicare contains a prescription drug benefit. I voted today to phase out the estate tax because I'm committed to making sure that no one loses their farm or their small business because of the way we tax gifts and estates. We know this legislation we passed today will be vetoed. Once the bill is vetoed, I hope we can come to the table in a bipartisan way to address a few of our more pressing national priorities and construct a fair way to protect family farms and small businesses from having to be broken up or sold just to pay estate taxes.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I will speak for a minute--the time remaining allocated to the Senator from Florida--in support of his amendment. 
   The resources that were allocated to the Budget Committee were simply insufficient to deal with the problem of providing adequate prescription drug coverage under Medicare. This particular amendment will make it possible to provide adequate, affordable, available prescription drug coverage to our seniors. We cannot do it under the constraints of the current amendment. 
   The chairman of the Finance Committee has offered a good faith effort to try to resolve that problem but is constrained by taking away from Part A and Part B, causing beneficiaries to have to make a choice. They should not have to make that choice. They should not have to make the choice between food and medicine. 
   This will give us an opportunity to solve a problem that is long overdue. With the robust condition of the economy, we finally have an opportunity to do it. I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the amendment offered by the Senator from Florida. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from Connecticut for his words. I regret to say that I rise in opposition to the new markets initiative as it is currently structured. I agree with the Senator from Connecticut. With additional work, we can find common ground. It is critically important that we pass a new markets initiative. My staff has been working for some time with several other offices on a bill that reflects the compromise the President and the Speaker entered into. This bill is going to be dropped next week, and I welcome input from all offices on both sides of the aisle. 
   This is complicated tax policy, and it ought to go through the Finance Committee. We ought to have a hearing. In the House, the Committee on Ways and Means is working a bill to mark up, and we ought to be doing the same thing. 
   I regret that the characterization of this bill is one that I cannot agree with at this particular moment. It seems to me it adds too much to the renewal communities at the expense of the already established empowerment zones. 
   Most importantly, the legislation as it is currently drafted would allow every recipient of Federal grant funds to discriminate against those they hire based on the applicant's religion. This Chamber has fought for the last 40 years to eliminate discrimination. I simply cannot support legislation that turns back the clock. 
   With that, I yield such time as I have remaining to the distinguished Senator from New Jersey.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce a bill that will protect one of the most beautiful areas of Virginia. Today, with my colleague JOHN WARNER, I am introducing the Virginia Wilderness Act of 2000. This Act will provide wilderness status to two exceptional areas of Virginia. These areas, the ``Three Ridges'' and ``The Priest'' have long been recognized for their outstanding vistas, deep valleys and rugged beauty. 
   After receiving wilderness designation these areas will remain available for hunting, fishing, hiking, picnicking, and other traditional uses. Wilderness protections will ensure that ``The Three Ridges'' and ``The Priest'' remain available for the full enjoyment of our children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 
   This action is now fully supported by the Virginia delegation, and the communities closest to the proposed wilderness areas. I hope we will see quick action on this bill through the committee and that we can move it to floor and complete action on the bill this year.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I have visited the Carver Neighborhood of Richmond in my state. This neighborhood is a low-income community that thanks to collaborative efforts among the community, city, and federal government, has seen a tremendous decrease in crime, helping to spur a major community revitalization. 
   We've seen this trend more and more in cities and communities across America. Much has been accomplished in our efforts to revitalize our communities--but more needs to be done. We should build on our past successes and focus our resources on keeping our children safe and our neighborhoods free of fear. We should take what we know works and apply it in our fight against illegal drugs. 
   It is in this spirit, Mr. President, that I rise to introduce the Community Oriented Policing Services Against Drugs Act. As part of our continuing battle against the proliferation of drugs in our nation's communities, my bill seeks to provide $500 million over five years in federal funds from the COPS Program to state and local law enforcement authorities across the country to eliminate or reduce drug crime in America. We know the COPS Program works, and I'm proud to have expanded it to provide our schools with more than 2,600 police officers to combat school violence. 
   Specifically, this new program will provide federal funds to hire 1,950 more police officers to enhance existing community policing initiatives throughout approximately 65 cities across the country. Newly hired police officers will be charged with developing and implementing community policing initiatives to combat the production, manufacture, distribution, importation, or use of illegal drugs in our communities. 
   There are dozens of cities across the country, such as Richmond, Norfolk, and Williamsburg in my state, that are committed to providing a safe environment for citizens to live, work and raise a family but need additional resources to help eliminate drug trafficking and drug-related crime, including violent crime. This legislation will build upon the successful COPS Program and focus an aspect of its community policing initiatives against the scourge of illegal drugs in our neighborhoods.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by several of my colleagues in support of the Truthfulness, Responsibility and Accountability in Contracting Act, or the TRAC Act. We look forward to dropping our bill when the Senate returns from the July 4th recess.  
   The TRAC Act simply stated, seeks the best value for the federal dollar. Its main objectives are instituting public-private competition and tracking costs. My colleagues and I agree that improvements to service contracting should be made, and this bill is one way to achieve that. 
   Our bill directs federal agency certification before entering into new contracts. These standards include establishing agency-wide reporting systems to report contracting efforts; requiring public-private competition; and reviewing contractor work and recompeting that work if appropriate. 
   Why the new standards? So we can better ascertain what the federal government is spending for government services. David Walker, Comptroller General for the General Accounting Office, stated recently in a June 1st Washington Post piece by David Broder that ``..... it is not clear that the remaining federal employees are capable of monitoring the cost and quality of the outsourced activities.'' The ability to monitor costs is essential if the Congress is to exercise proper oversight of federal funds spent to carry out services by either contractors or federal employees. 
   We also want to ensure an even playing field between contractors and federal employees when competing for work. The public-private competitions required by the TRAC Act will determine how best the federal government can save money on its many critical services. Our bill doesn't guarantee any pre-determined outcome in a public-private competition, but rather ensures that these competitions occur. 
   Contractors have historically played a role in delivering government services and will continue to do so. Therefore, our bill will allow the federal agencies to see who completes work most effectively, regardless of who delivers the service.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, a majority of this body--myself included--just voted to table both the Landrieu and Jeffords amendments, each of which have the laudable goals of increasing funding for disadvantaged and special education students. The problem with both amendments is that they rob Peter to pay Paul. Both amendments reduce the amount of funding in Title VI, which has been substantially increased this year. The distinguished Chairman, the Senator from Pennsylvania, has indicated that the $2.7 billion allocated for Title VI this year is for the continuation of our class size reduction efforts and for funding, for the first time since the 1950's, a massive school modernization effort. The effect of these amendments is simply to reduce the number of new teachers schools can hire or reduce the money they'll have available to fix fire code violations or upgrade old schools with new technology. That's not the answer. What we ought to be doing is making a greater overall investment in public education. 
   I have co-sponsored a bill to increase the amount of Title I funding from $8 billion to $12 billion in this year alone, and I have co-sponsored a bill that puts us on track to fully fund our federal commitment to IDEA within ten years. Our economically disadvantaged and special needs students deserve more of a commitment from the federal level, but they also deserve small class sizes and safe, modern schools. It's simply wrong to pit these objectives against each other, because in the end, our children are the ones that suffer and that is why I voted to table two amendments that I would otherwise support.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, this past April when the Senate was debating its annual budget resolution, I offered an amendment which stated that if Congress was going to consider massive tax cuts this year, it must first pass legislation that modernizes Medicare through the creation of a prescription drug benefit. Fifty-one Senators voted in favor of this amendment, in favor of putting our Nation's seniors before massive tax cuts, including six of our colleagues from the other side of the aisle--Senators CHAFEE, SPECTER, ABRAHAM, DEWINE, BURNS, and the distinguished occupant of the chair. 
   I rise today to follow up on the vote that we took in April and to urge a majority of our colleagues to, once again, come together across party lines for our Nation's seniors. Putting seniors before tax cuts was the first step. 
   Now the Senate needs to take up and pass a comprehensive affordable prescription drug benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries. Unfortunately, it is now mid-June and neither the Senate Finance Committee nor the Senate itself has considered a Medicare prescription drug benefit. With so few legislative days left in the year and so much work to be done, it is crucial that we take this issue up now. 
   The amendment I am offering today will commit this bill back to the Appropriations Committee with instructions that they report out a new bill that provides a universal, comprehensive, dependable prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. 
   The Medicare Outpatient Drug Act, a bill that I introduced 
   this week with Senators GRAHAM, BRYAN, CONRAD, CHAFEE, BAUCUS, ROCKEFELLER, and LINCOLN, is a moderate bipartisan, commonsense piece of legislation. It combines the best elements of prescription drug proposals offered by Members on both sides of the aisle. 
   More important, the Medicare Outpatient Drug Act will help every senior better afford the prescription drugs which they so badly need, and the need is real. 
   Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes of the 15 minutes that are allocated to the affirmative position on this amendment. 
   Mr. President, for the benefit of our colleagues, I would like to summarize this amendment as succinctly as I can. It is a bipartisan bill that would guarantee access to a comprehensive, meaningful prescription drug benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries. Unlike other drug proposals, our bill would guarantee total coverage for seniors, without any limits or gaps. 
   Let me say, however, to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, that this benefit is not some ``big government'' solution to the Medicare prescription drug problem. In putting this proposal together, our bipartisan group opted to rely on private sector, market-based mechanisms to deliver medications to seniors. Competition and choice are at the very essence of our bill. For those who suggest that we need to take a centrist approach, I say that this bill is that logical bipartisan compromise. And we need to act on it now. 
   Mr. President, today is June 22. With the Senate deep into the appropriations process, we have very few legislative days left in this session. If we are going to get a prescription drug bill to the President's desk, we need to consider one now. 
   Mr. President, I've spoken previously today about the stories I heard in a series of health care fora held in my state over the past month. In one of them, I spoke to a physician who was prescribing the drug Tamoxofin for women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer and who were Medicare eligible. One woman was sharing her prescription with two other women who simply could not afford it--a travesty by any health care standards. I've heard many other stories of similar magnitude. 
   Prescription drugs are clearly a part of modern medicine today. They are a necessity, not a luxury. I ask that our colleagues respond affirmatively to this chance to provide modern medicine to those who are eligible for Medicare. 
   I reserve any time not used.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, the amendment offered by Senator MURRAY and Senator SNOWE renews our debate, once again about women's reproductive choice and access to safe, affordable, and legal reproductive health care services. I commend the sponsors of this amendment for their eloquent advocacy on behalf of women in uniform. 
   Mr. President, the Murray-Snowe amendment repeals the ban on privately funded abortions at overseas military medical facilities. Simply stated, this legislation would ensure that women service members and military dependents stationed overseas have access to the reproductive health care services guaranteed to all American women. Under the current policy, women who volunteer to serve their country and are stationed outside the United States have to surrender the protection of these rights. They can't use their own funds to obtain abortion services in our safe military medical facilities. It is ironic that active-duty service members who are sent abroad to protect and defend our rights are unnecessarily denied their own in the process. 
   Mr. President, the Supreme Court has, time and time again, affirmed that reproductive rights are constitutionally protected rights. Roe v. Wade is still the law of our land. Congress has even passed legislation making it illegal to prevent or hinder a woman's access to clinics that provide abortion services. And yet we are here again trying to protect the constitutional rights of a group of women who are willing to die to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans. This is a fight we shouldn't have to wage in this chamber, Mr. President. 
   I'd like to respond to some of the arguments that have been made against this amendment. This amendment does not advocate Federal funding of abortions. Women service members, not the American taxpayer, are entirely responsible for the cost of these services. Furthermore, as per current policy, this amendment would not force any individual service member to perform a procedure to which he or she objects. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and give military service members and their dependents the same protections whether stationed in this country or abroad. The women of our Armed Forces should not be forced to risk their health, safety, and well-being via back-alley abortions or substandard foreign health care services. The Murray-Snowe amendment provides the women who have volunteered to serve this Nation and are assigned to duty outside the United States with the range of constitutional rights that they have when they are on American soil. We owe this to our American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to support the Smith-Kennedy legislation. This legislation will simply strengthen existing hate crime laws by enhancing the Federal Government's ability to assist State and local prosecutions. It is a little bit like Project Exile, which is so much in vogue and which has been practiced so successfully in Richmond, VA. This will allow the resources of the Department of Justice to be made available where appropriate to investigate and prosecute those in our society who commit acts of brutality based on hate. The dragging death of James Byrd, Jr., an African American man in Jasper, TX, the torture and death of Matthew Shepard, a homosexual male in Laramie, WY, shocked the national conscience. Hate crimes have occurred in the Commonwealth of Virginia as well. 
   In 1999, a man was sentenced to life in prison and fined $100,000 for his role in the death of an African American man who was beheaded and burned in Independence, VA. And a homosexual man was murdered and his severed head was left atop a footbridge near the James River in Richmond, VA. It is hard to imagine the pain and suffering of the victims and their families. 
   This legislation does not allow individuals to be prosecuted for their hateful thoughts; rather it allows them to be punished for their hateful acts. Willfully inflicting harm on another human being based on hate is not protected free speech. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and demonstrate our commitment to eradicate the hate. 
   I reserve any time remaining to the Senator from Massachusetts.

    Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'm introducing a bill that will help clean up and restore our nation's waters. This bill, The National Clean Water Trust Fund Act of 2000, creates a trust fund from fines, penalties and other monies collected through enforcement of the Clean Water Act. The money deposited into the National Clean Water Trust Fund would be used to address the pollution problems that initiated those enforcement actions. 
   A highly publicized case in Virginia illustrated the need for this legislation. On August 8 1997, U.S. District Court Judge Rebecca Smith issued a $12.6 million judgement against Smithfield Foods for polluting the Pagan River in Isle of Wight County, Virginia. The judge stated in her opinion that the civil penalty imposed on Smithfield should be directed toward the restoration of the Pagan and James Rivers, tributaries to the Chesapeake Bay. Unfortunately, due to current federal law, the court had no discretion over the damages, and the fine was deposited into the Treasury's general fund, defeating the very spirit of the Clean Water Act. 
   Today, there is no guarantee that fines or other money levied against parties who violate provisions in the Clean Water Act will be used to correct short and long term damage from water pollution. Instead the money is directed into the fund of the U.S. Treasury with no provision that it be used to improve the quality of our water. Pollution from spills or illegal discharges can have a profound effect on our environment and can degrade our public water supplies, and recreational areas. Water pollution causes long term damage to fish and shellfish habitat and destroys the livelihood of watermen, and leads to the long term degradation of scenic areas. While the Environmental Protection Agency's enforcement activities are extracting large sums of money from industry and others through enforcement of the Clean Water Act, we are missing an opportunity to pay for the cleanup and restoration of pollution problems for which the penalties were levied. To ensure the successful implementation of the Clean Water Act, we should put these enforcement funds to work and actually clean up the nation's waters. 
   This legislation will establish a National Clean Water Trust Fund within the U.S. Treasury to earmark fines, penalties, and other funds, including consent decrees, obtained through enforcement of the Clean Water Act that would otherwise be placed into the Treasury's general fund. The EPA Administrator would be authorized, after consultation with the States, to prioritize and carry out projects to restore and recover waters of the United States using the funds collected from the violations of the Clean Water Act. This legislation would not preempt citizen suits or in any way preclude EPA's authority to undertake and complete supplemental environmental projects as part of settlements related to violations of the Clean Water Act or any other legislation. The bill also provides court discretion over civil penalties from Clean Water Act violations to be used to carry out mitigation and restoration projects. In this bill, EPA is directed to give priority consideration to projects in the watershed where the original violation was discovered. With this legislation, we can avoid another predicament like the one faced in Virginia. 
   Mr. President, it only makes sense that fines occurring from violations of the Clean Water Act be used to restore the waters that were damaged. This bill provides a real opportunity to improve the quality of our nation's waters.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, at a health care forum I sponsored in Virginia, a doctor told me of a woman with breast cancer splitting her Tamoxofin pills with two other breast cancer patients, because the drug was so expensive that the other two couldn't afford it. This is a touching story from the perspective of a woman trying to help two peers, but from a health care perspective, it's an abomination. Not only does splitting a dose for one person into three negate the effects of the drug for all three women, but the lack of access to this drug only makes them sicker. 
   Unfortunately, stories like these are all too common today. Modern medicine has become more and more dependent on prescription drugs, yet the Medicare program, which provides health care for our nation's elderly and disabled, has not changed with the times. As a result, Medicare often finds itself in the position of paying for expensive hospital care, yet not paying for the prescription drugs that could help keep a patient out of the hospital. And as prescription drugs become more essential to seniors' health care, we hear many stories like the one I've told you today. 
   It's time we did something to change this. While over 90 percent of private sector employees with employer-based health insurance have prescription drug coverage, the 38 million Medicare beneficiaries in America today have no basic prescription drug benefit. At the same time, the average Medicare beneficiary fills eighteen prescriptions each year, and will have an estimated average annual drug cost of nearly $1,100 in 2000. We have an obligation to our seniors, and future generations of seniors, to strengthen and modernize Medicare by adding a prescription drug benefit. 
   Unfortunately, both the House and Senate have made little progress toward passing a drug benefit this year. By and large, moderate, bipartisan solutions have been absent from the debate. 
   I am pleased to join my colleagues Senator GRAHAM, Senator BRYAN, Senator CONRAD, Senator CHAFEE and Senator BAUCUS in introducing a bill which we believe will break this logjam, the Medicare Outpatient Drug Act, or MOD Act, of 2000. In crafting the MOD Act, we have combined the best elements of insurance-based plans--which aim to promote competition and innovation--and the President's plan--which offers a dependable, universal benefit to all seniors. The result is a bill that all sides should be able to agree on. 
   Like the President's plan, our bill will offer a defined Medicare benefit that will be available to all seniors, regardless of their health status or place of residence. But unlike the President's plan, our bill will allow private entities to compete for Medicare beneficiaries--allowing seniors and the disabled to choose from a variety of options that are custom-tailored to their specific prescription drug needs. 
   Moreover, the MOD Act is the first prescription drug bill to offer Medicare beneficiaries a comprehensive drug benefit, with no gaps in coverage, and full protection against sky-high out-of-pocket costs. The MOD Act gradually increases its level of coverage as beneficiaries get sicker, so that the greatest assistance is devoted to those who need it most. 
   There is only a handful of legislative days left in the Senate this year, and if we're going to get anything done on the prescription drug front, we'll have to settle on a proposal that is moderate and bipartisan. The Medicare Outpatient Drug Act is that bill, and I urge each of my colleagues to give it their full support.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the conference report on the Millennium Digital Commerce Act, a bill which I believe will help us remove one of the most imposing barriers to the growth of electronic commerce--the lack of a way to verify the validity of contracts entered into over the web. 
   As the Internet becomes more ubiquitous in society and the lines between paper and electronic worlds blur, it is crucial that we find ways to adapt older regulatory structures such as contract law to the new world of Internet commerce. By providing a framework for digital signatures, the Millenium Digital Commerce Act will do just that, and I'm pleased that we're about to send it to the President's desk for signature. 
   I'm particularly pleased that the conferees were able to work through some of the complicated consumer protection issues on this bill. Throughout the conference negotiations, there were those who suggested that we should use this bill to relax some of our most important consumer protection laws. I appreciate the efforts of Senators LEAHY, MCCAIN, ABRAHAM and others in working to temper these efforts, and believe that the final product is much better for it. 
   While I strongly support this legislation, I regret that a prior commitment will prevent me from being here tomorrow to vote in favor of it. In my absence, I urge each of my colleagues to support this landmark agreement, which will help the Internet realize its full potential.

    Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'm pleased to honor the service of Ms. Mary Moran and Ms. Victoria Metz, the outgoing Parent Teacher Association (PTA) co-presidents at the Arlington Traditional School, a public alternative elementary school in Arlington, Virginia. 
   For the past two years, both Mary Moran and Victoria Metz have dedicated themselves to educational achievement by assisting the students, parents, teachers and administration of Arlington Traditional School. They have appeared on numerous occasions before the Arlington County School Board to discuss educational issues and sustain support for the Arlington Traditional School. Ms. Moran and Ms. Metz have also frequently met with individual members of the School Board to answer questions and have reached out to other local PTA presidents. 
   During the tenure of Mary Moran and Victoria Metz as co-presidents, the Arlington Traditional School PTA has played an integral role in the following activities: Math Night, Science and Technology Night, the DARE Program for 5th Graders; Black History Month, Hispanic Heritage Month, Asian Pacific Heritage Month, Native American Month, the Fall Family Get-Together, Holiday Open House, Parent-Teacher Conference Luncheon and Dinner, Summer Reading Challenge, Back to School Night and Staff Appreciation Week. The PTA generously purchased computers for student use at the Arlington Traditional School. 
   Mary Moran and Victoria Metz were also responsible for the Arlington Traditional School PTA's outreach efforts into the community. The PTA made significant contributions to the Arlington Community Temporary Shelter, the Animal Welfare League of Arlington, UNICEF and the Red Cross's International Relief Fund. 
   Mary Moran and Victoria Metz have truly made a difference at the Arlington Traditional School. Their success illustrates that our public schools benefit and prosper when parents take active leadership roles in supporting education.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a concurrent resolution urging Congress to enact meaningful hate crimes legislation. Today marks the sad second anniversary of the killing of James Byrd, Jr., the victim of a vicious hate crime in Texas. Mr. Byrd, a 49-year-old African-American man, was dragged for approximately two miles while chained to the back of a pickup truck by his white assailants. As a result of this brutal attack, Mr. Byrd's head and right arm were severed from his body. 
   Reflecting on this terrible act of deep hatred against the dignity of a human being should strengthen our resolve to combat acts of bias in our society. We will not get to where we need to go in this country until we have eradicated the discriminatory hatred that lies in some people's hearts. While we cannot legislate away the prejudice in a person's heart or soul, we can certainly punish those who act upon their feelings of hatred and commit acts of utter brutality. Hate crimes tear at the very fabric of American society and often scar, not just the victims, but the families and communities involved as well. Those who harbor hatred must know that America will punish them for their actions and that we will not tolerate their acts of inhumanity. 
   Our Nation is composed of a great diversity that contributes to our economic and educational preeminence in the world. We will never achieve all that our Nation is capable of accomplishing unless we are united in addressing the scourge of prejudice and hate crimes in our society. The Congress can lead on this issue by enacting comprehensive legislation, such as the Hate Crimes Prevention Act, that expands existing hate crimes law. Not only should those who are victimized by hate crimes because of their gender, sexual orientation, or disability be afforded access to appropriate justice, but we as a Nation should also pursue swift and serious punishment against violent hate-mongers to send a message that we will not tolerate their hate. 
   Today, I join with colleagues from both the Senate and the House to introduce this concurrent resolution and spur action to combat the crimes motivated by bias which continue to shock the conscience of our civil society. Federal hate crimes legislation provides another avenue for prosecuting the perpetrators of violent hate, and I look forward to enacting a comprehensive Federal hate crimes statute. I am confident that our abhorrence of hate crimes will move the Congress to action.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, as we approach the 56th Anniversary of D-Day, June 6th, 1944, we should pause to reflect on the valor and sacrifice of the men who died on the beaches of Normandy. In the vanguard of the force that landed on that June morning, was the 116th Infantry Regiment, 29th Infantry Division. In 1944 the 116th Infantry Regiment, as it is today, was a National Guard unit mustering at the armory in Bedford, Virginia. They drew their members from a town of only 3,200 people and the rich country in central Virginia nestled in the cool shadows of the Blue Ridge Mountains. 
   On the morning of June 6th, 1944, Company A led the 116th Infantry Regiment and the 29th Infantry Division ashore, landing on Omaha Beach in the face of withering enemy fire. Within minutes, the company suffered ninety-six percent casualties, to include twenty-one killed in action. Before nightfall, two more sons of Bedford from Companies C and F perished in the desperate fighting to gain a foothold on the blood-soaked beachhead. On D-Day, the town of Bedford, Virginia gave more of her sons to the defense of freedom and the defeat of dictatorship, than any other community (per capita) in the nation. It is fitting that Bedford is home to the national D-Day Memorial. But we must remember that this memorial represents not just a day or a battle--it is a marker that represents individual soldiers like the men of the 116th Infantry Regiment--every one a father, son, or brother. Each sacrifice has a name, held dear in the hearts of a patriotic Virginia town--Bedford.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague from Michigan in recognizing the eloquence of the statement just made, very much from the heart, by the Senator from Oregon. I concur in his remarks. 
   Once again we are on the floor of the Senate debating the strength of the U.S. commitment to peace and stability in the Balkans, and once again we are being asked to weigh the benefits and costs of our current commitments. 
   I do not like to find myself at odds, especially on national security matters, with my friend and senior colleague from Virginia. We share so many of the values that shape our view of the world and the critical role of the United States in that world. We also share an unshakeable conviction in the importance of the moral and physical leadership of the United States in a dangerous world and the belief that a strong United States is the best guarantor of peace. 
   Likewise, I have enormous respect for the other coauthor of the amendment which is currently incorporated in the military construction appropriations bill we are now considering. There is no other Member of this body who is more knowledgeable, when it comes to the history of our Constitution, or who has fought harder to uphold the constitutional role of the Congress and of this body in relation to the executive branch than the senior Senator from West Virginia. 
   I understand and share our colleagues' frustration with the costs of our commitments in the Balkans, not just in terms of dollars but also the wear and tear on our armed forces around the world. 
   I understand and share our colleagues' frustration with the glacial pace of progress toward reconstruction in Kosovo and the establishment of a capable civil police force. But we knew the risks going into this effort to stop the killing and give peace a chance to take hold in this troubled land. We know from experience that these types of efforts defy deadlines. We know from experience the consequences of setting conditions that let other countries control our destiny. 
   Each time we have debated deadlines, I have argued against them. Each time we have proposed statutorily binding deadlines, I have voted against them. I believe the provisions in this bill establishing a deadline for the withdrawal of ground troops from Kosovo undermine U.S. leadership around the world and raise understandable anxiety about our commitment to peace and stability in the Balkans. They play directly into the hands of those in the region who depend on conflict and chaos to achieve their ends. 
   The situation in Kosovo defies a simple calculus for withdrawal of U.S. forces. The situation in Kosovo defies a simple calculus for those whose burdens are greater or smaller, fair or unfair. 
   We know from experience that the requirement of our physical presence and our relative share of the burden will shift with changing conditions on the ground--either through reduced threats or improved stability. 
   Setting statutory deadlines now, in my judgment, will only undermine the confidence of our allies. Setting statutory deadlines now will only shake the world's confidence in our leadership. Setting statutory deadlines now will only encourage those who oppose peace and stability in the region. 
   The deadline framework established by this provision in the military construction bill tells our adversary what combination of actions or manipulation of conditions by which he can ``control'' U.S. and NATO policy. 
   Although the authors argue that this provision has no automatic triggers and that there are escape clauses allowing the Congress to undo what this provision would do, the advantage of knowing the limit of our commitment transfers the advantage and the leverage to our adversary. 
   Under this provision, July 1 becomes a magic date--either this year or next; or some other date, if it happens to be switched in conference--against which he can plan, organize, and execute efforts to pursue regional destabilization. 
   Under this provision, in the mind of our adversary, we trade the certainty of our commitment to stability, and our military capability to enforce it, for the certain knowledge of our limited determination and the eventual unhinging of the political and military cohesion of our coalition. 
   I am concerned that regardless of when the deadlines may be set in this provision, our perceived lack of will could put at risk militarily our coalition troops on the ground in Kosovo.  
   I have been proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with my friend and senior colleague on many issues involving our Nation's national security interests. But I cannot do so on this issue because I believe it would undermine our position of world leadership and place us in an untenable position regarding the Balkans. 
   In support of our men and women in uniform in the field, and of America's enduring open-ended commitment to peace and stability, I must, therefore, oppose the provision currently included in the bill and urge our colleagues to support the motion to strike offered by the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
   With that, Mr. President, I believe my time has expired. If not, I reserve any remaining time. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, the Navy's ship maintenance problem is large--and growing larger. Scheduled heavy maintenance for fifteen ships has already been canceled this fiscal year. Without the funds provided by this amendment, the Navy will either cancel or drastically reduce work scheduled for eighteen more. The individual cases are striking: 
   The amphibious assault ship Bataan should be undergoing $17 million of work at Norfolk Naval Shipyard. Instead she is deployed to Puerto Rico. 
   The amphibious transport dock ship Shreveport ran aground recently and was repaired overseas for $1.5 million  just to get her home. Her subsequent $6 million shipyard availability has been canceled. 
   The backlog of work for the fast combat support ship Detroit--declared ``unsafe for underway operations'' by Navy inspectors last August--climbed to $68 million, nearly twice previous estimates. 
   All of this unprogrammed funding must come out of this fiscal year's budget. 
   The Pacific Fleet canceled $20.6 million of work on the amphibious assault ship Bonhomme Richard and $13 million on the amphibious transport dock ship Denver. They may have to skip availabilities for three aircraft carriers--two of which, the Kitty Hawk and the Constellation, are nearly 40 years old. 
   Mr. President, we should not be surprised. Since the end of the Cold War we have reduced the size of the fleet, yet we are running our Navy at unprecedented levels in support of worldwide national security requirements--over eighty contingencies just since 1990. 
   Ship maintenance challenges have a direct and adverse impact on Navy retention rates. Admiral Vernon Clark, Commander of the Atlantic Fleet and nominee for next Chief of Naval Operations, routinely points out that retention is all about our sailors' quality of life and quality of work. Sailors spend valuable time chipping paint; time that should be spent training, going to school or enjoying their families. 
   Consider this example, just to provide a sense of this retention relationship. The anchor and chains of the destroyer USS Briscoe were refurbished in 1995 and supposed to last twelve years. Within three years, rust was bleeding through. A ten sailor detail was mustered from the ship's crew to redo the job. The chains were lowered to the pier one link at a time, dragged to a barge, then scraped by sailors with vibrating wire needle guns--a total of 1,530 feet of chain. The job took ten sailors working six weeks to finish, a job that should not have been needed until 2007. Clearly, time-consuming and spirit-sapping work. Clearly, the Navy is not getting all the tools, time and parts to do the job right. 
   Mr. President, there is no question, we are at a crisis point in keeping our magnificent fleet safe and ready. The $220 million in this amendment will provide some immediate relief for the Navy and our sailors around the fleet. The Senate Armed Services Committee, under the capable leadership of Senator WARNER, and the Seapower Subcommittee under Senator SNOWE's leadership, have committed to fully fund all of the Navy's fiscal year 2001 projected maintenance requirements. 
   It is important to recognize, however, that additional funds are only a part of controlling our ship maintenance problems. 
   The Administration, the Navy and the Congress must address the larger issues that will continue to erode our fleet's readiness. Aging ships, more deployments, chronic underfunding of maintenance accounts, inefficiencies in the maintenance management system, reductions at our public and private shipyards, and lower retention rates for sailors with maintenance ratings--all compound this situation. 
   Mr. President, we have a lot of work ahead of us if we are to set the conditions that will ensure the capability and readiness of our Navy today and in the years ahead. 
   Our shipbuilding rates are too low to sustain the size of the fleet necessary to meet our security requirements. 
   We need to accelerate the insertion of new and improved ship technologies that will reduce maintenance requirements. 
   The Navy's maintenance management system needs modernization, arguably a new way of thinking of why, how and when ship maintenance is scheduled. 
   Modern sailors work too hard and are too valuable to waste time chipping paint--we need to protect them from mind-numbing heavy maintenance that should be done right the first time in the nation's shipyards. 
   This amendment is only part of what should become a comprehensive approach to the challenges of Navy ship maintenance--but it is a critical part. We cannot afford to allow the backlog to grow. 
   With this amendment and the resources we provide for fiscal year 2001, we make a national commitment to fully fund our ship maintenance requirements, and to keeping our fleet safe and ready.

    Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, today I rise to honor Col. William ``Dave'' Miller upon his retirement from the U.S. Army and to thank him for his 27 years of faithful and honorable service to the Army and the Nation. 
   Serving in positions of increasing responsibility, Colonel Miller has displayed remarkable leadership and superb knowledge throughout his entire career. Colonel Miller's exceptional abilities were notably acknowledged when he was selected as Commander of the Data Systems Unit, White House Communications Agency. As the Commander, he was the driving force behind the development of a host of automation modernization programs, which significantly improved the crisis management decision process of the Nation and placed the Command upon the cutting edge of the information revolution. Colonel Miller routinely interacted with the National Security Council, White House Military Office, and the White House Staff. The consummate professional, he demonstrated the ability to work successfully with each of these offices and build consensus thereby ensuring mission success. 
   Upon completion of the Program Manager's Course, Colonel Miller served as the Commander of the U.S. Army Research, Development and Acquisition Information Systems Activity, where he directly supported the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Research, Development and Acquisition. Colonel Miller introduced a myriad of initiatives that resulted in dramatic improvements in the daily operation of his organization. Chief among these was his ability to reduce base operations costs by 38 percent which translated into a yearly savings of over three hundred thousand dollars. 
   Colonel Miller culminated his career as the Commander of the United States Army Information Systems Software Center, a centrally selected Command with over 900 military and civilian personnel supported by over 400 contractors. He managed a budget of over $115 million. Colonel Miller, a recognized leader in the acquisition and automation communities, did an exceptional job of leading his command through a difficult period of downsizing and budget cuts while continuing to improve automation support to the Warfighter. 
   Colonel Miller is one of the Army's most outstanding automation officers. His selfless dedication, consummate professionalism, and visionary leadership have enabled him to lead his Command to unprecedented heights, eliciting praise from field commanders Army wide. He personifies the very best character attributes of the Officers' Corps. The Army will be greatly diminished the day that he retires. 
   I am honoring Colonel Miller today as a way of thanking him for his faithful and honorable service to the Army and to the citizens of the United States.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of the Alternative Fuels Tax Incentive Act. This legislation will help accomplish two things. First, it will promote the production and use of cars that use clean fuels, and will consequently improve air quality. Secondly, the tax credit will improve our energy independence. I honestly believe that one of the best things we can do for this country is to find a way to fuel transportation that is cleaner, and more reliable. Our automobile emissions get cleaner every year. But there are more of us on the road every year, and we drive more miles every year. So we have to keep increasing our efforts in the direction of more efficient vehicles and cleaner fuels. 
   Earlier this year, we experienced a sharp spike in fuel prices, courtesy of OPEC. It wasn't the first time and it won't be the last. It is imperative for our country to keep moving in the direction of energy independence, and I am convinced that it can be done without sacrificing convenience, mobility, or the environment. But we need to find a substitute for gasoline, and we need to combine the most efficient technologies in a way that provides convenient transportation. 
   New automotive technologies are being developed by automobile companies, in concert with some of our fine engineering schools. All these technologies show promise, but after the pilot stage and before achieving mass appeal, there is a critical phase at which we can help a new idea grow, or we can ignore it and perhaps let it fail. This tax credit is a tool that can be used to bridge the gap between an experimental vehicle and a commercially available vehicle. It encompasses the kind of creative thinking that we need to employ if we are going to reach a new standard of efficiency in automotive technology. 
   I look forward to a full discussion of the benefits of this bill, and hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill, and move for quick passage.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Coal Accountability and Retired Employee Act for the 21st Century. This legislation would authorize a transfer of interest from the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund to the United Mine Worker Combined Benefit Fund so that we can keep our promise of paying for our retired coal miner's health benefits. 
   In the 1992 Coal Act, a promise was made to retired coal miners and their families that they would have health benefits. In a few short months, the available funds for these health benefits will be exhausted. We cannot allow this to happen. We made a promise--we must keep it. 
   Last week, Senator ROCKEFELLER introduced similar legislation to authorize a transfer from general revenues to pay for the shortfall in the retiree health benefits fund. Senator ROCKEFELLER has been a leader on this issue for many years and I strongly support his approach. Last year, thanks to the dogged determination of Senator BYRD, we were able to postpone the inevitable by getting additional funding. This funding, however, will run out in several months. The time has come to make good on the promise to the retired coal miners. This legislation will give retired coal miners and their families the health benefits they deserve.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I wanted to say a few words about the Medicare Expansion for Needed Drugs, or MEND Act, which our leader, Senator DASCHLE introduced today. The MEND Act an important first step toward modernizing Medicare through the creation of a voluntary, affordable, universal prescription drug benefit. 
   While the bill has many elements that I support, I am also interested in looking at ways that we might create a prescription drug bill that distributes its benefits for senior citizens in a more targeted way. I am working with several of my colleagues on the Finance Committee to create such a bill, and hope to introduce it in the next two weeks. With it, we will have two strong options for giving our seniors the help they so desperately need with the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs. 
   Mr. President, I applaud the minority leader for his determination in working to help our nation's seniors with the high cost of prescription drugs, and for his efforts in bringing this bill to the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, we may not have any more important debate this session than the one we are having now on the reauthorization of the major piece of federal legislation affecting K-12 education, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I was pleased to support the Democratic alternative last Thursday because it contained many of my highest priorities for education. It continues our commitment to class size reduction, an initiative that will give our children more individualized attention with a qualified teacher. It provides substantially more money for professional development for teachers and administrators, so we can help build our teachers up, rather than tear them down. It contains more money for schools to make urgently needed safety-related repairs to their facilities, so our children are not in schools with leaky roofs or fire code violations. It contains increased investments in equipping our schools with modern technology, so our children can learn the language of the new economy--the information technology language. It contains increased funding for school safety initiatives, because we can't have good schools, unless we have safe schools. I am pleased that the New Democrats were able to work with our Democratic Caucus to significantly enhance and strengthen the accountability measures contained in the Democratic alternative. Although the amendment was defeated, I believe it contained a better approach, frankly, to the reauthorization of ESEA than that which has been offered by our distinguished colleagues on the other side of the aisle. 
   The Senate new Democrats under the leadership of the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Senator LIEBERMAN, and the Senator from Indiana, Senator BAYH, and others, as has already been stated, have been working for many months on a proposal to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in a way that will truly help our Nation's students and improve our Nation's schools. We have offered this proposal as an alternative to the way we think about the Federal role in K-12 education. The goal of this alternative approach is the principle reason why we should have an Elementary and Secondary Education Act at all: to improve student academic performance and readiness. Two critical factors on the federal level in achieving this goal are investment and real accountability. 
   In 1994, Congress took a monumental step toward encouraging standards-based reform across the states--a movement which really began in 1989 when President Bush convened a summit in Charlottesville, VA with our Nation's Governors to explore ways to improve our public education system. When we considered the Goals 2000 legislation in 1994, we reiterated the principle of that summit: that education is primarily a State and local responsibility, but it is also a national priority. We recognized that if the Federal Government is to be a meaningful partner in education reform, we must give greater flexibility to States in the use of their funds in order to foster innovation and to help States design their own standards-based reform plans. 
   During the floor consideration of Goals 2000, I voiced my support for Goals 2000 funding and said:  
   [w]ith this new funding States can, if they choose, work to establish tough academic standards, create a system of assessments to put real accountability into our schools, and expand efforts to better train teachers and give them the tools they need to teach our kids.  
   As a result a result of Goals 2000, 48 States have now developed standards and many are in the process of aligning their curricula and assessments to those standards. But we need to help even more than we are now, because only about half of the States this year will meet their student performance goals. And what is more troubling is that there continues to be a startling achievement gap between low-income students and more affluent students. 
   Now that the vast majority of our States have standards in place, we need to help them meet those standards. Our Three R's amendment emphasizes the need to reinvest in our schools, to reinvent the way that we partner with States and localities, and to recognize that we, as a Nation, have a responsibility to ensure that our children are receiving the very best education that all levels of government can collectively provide. For the first time, 
   this amendment attempts to hold States accountable not for filling out the right forms or for writing good grant proposals, but for actual increases in student achievement. 
   The Three R's approach ensures that States are held accountable for yearly improvement in student academic performance. States will set their own yearly targets for improvement. Our hope is that these performance goals will help all children become proficient in reading, mathematics, and science. States will be required to take dramatic corrective action in the event that school districts in their States chronically fail to make the grade. Failing schools can be shut down. They can be reconstituted with new administrations. They can be turned into charter schools. There are a variety of options available, but the point is simple: failing schools are failing our children, and our children deserve more. States that meet or exceed their performance targets will be rewarded with even more flexibility in the use of their funds. 
   But a demand for more accountability must be accompanied by increased investment--increased investment in our students, increased investment in our teachers, increased investment in our administrators, and increased investment in our schools themselves. This amendment calls for an unprecedented $35 billion increase in elementary and secondary education funding over the next 5 years. Currently, the Federal Government only spends $14.4 billion per year on K-12 education. To put that in some perspective, last year we spent $230 billion to pay interest on the national debt. The fact that we pay 15 times more money on debt that is akin to bad credit card debt, when we could be building schools, or training teachers, or hiring school safety officers, is shameful. 
   Our amendment would increase our current spending by $7.2 billion next year alone. Instead of pumping this money into more programs, our amendment distributes most of the new Federal funds to States based upon a formula, rather than to those States and localities who can afford to hire savvy grant writers. The distribution of funds is targeted to where the funds are needed most--to our neediest schools and students, that are so often left behind. The Three R's approach increases teacher quality funding to $1.6 billion, which is a $1 billion increase from our current spending. It substantially increases aid for economically disadvantaged students by 50 percent--from $8 billion to $12 billion. We continue our commitment to reducing class size by providing a guaranteed stream of funding for this important initiative which has so far provided States with enough funding to hire over 29,000 new teachers. And we get serious about helping Limited English Proficient students not only master English, but achieve high levels in core subjects as well. Our funding for LEP students is increased  from $380 million to $1 billion. Finally, we provide $2.7 billion to expand after-school and summer-school opportunities, to enhance school safety, to improve the technological capabilities of our students, teachers, and schools, and to fund innovative school improvement initiatives designed at the local level. 
   We need to invest in our teachers so they are the best in the world. We need to invest in our schools so they are safe and modern. We need to invest in our students so they will develop the skills they need to succeed. The Federal Government can provide these resources and we believe that it should. At the same time that we do this, we need to ensure that the Federal role in K-12 education is one that actually promotes improvement in academic achievement. 
   That is accountability with real meaning. 
   This amendment is also meant to provide a starting point for a bipartisan effort. Our education debate has a tendency to devolve into partisan battles with the extremes on both sides drawing hard and fast lines that either abandon public schools by promoting vouchers or continue the status quo by funding myriad small programs--programs which, however well intentioned, often dilute the effectiveness of the limited Federal dollars we have to spend on education. We have to get beyond these differences to better serve our children. 
   There is more to the education debate than just these priorities. Last month, the Senate new Democrats held a hearing about the RRR approach. The panelists were former Reagan Education Secretary William Bennett; former Chief Domestic Policy Advisor to President Clinton, William Galston; Seattle Superintendent Joseph Olchefske; Amy Wilkins, principal partner of the Education Trust, an organization dedicated to the education of disadvantaged children; and Robert Schwartz, president of Achieve, Incorporated, an organization formed by the Nation's Governors and corporate leaders to improve public education. 
   Despite the philosophical diversity among the panelists in many areas, all of the panelists agreed that focus on increased investment in exchange for real accountability was necessary and prudent. 
   Perhaps William Bennett summed it up best by saying:  
   The Three R's has the potential to bring about a new era for the Federal Government and education, an era that actively emphasizes results over process and favors success over failure.  
   I believe our RRR amendment combines the principles upon which so many of us can and do agree. It is perhaps more aptly described as the ``III''--investment, innovation, and improvement. This really should be the model for the Federal role in elementary and secondary education in our country. I hope colleagues from both sides of the aisle will seriously consider this approach. 
   I yield the floor and reserve any time remaining.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to offer a Senate resolution designating May each year as the Month for Children. Children are our nation's future, and it is important that we recognize the significant contributions that children make to their homes, schools and communities. Unfortunately, we continue to be plagued by school violence that is devastating our communities. Furthermore, parents who are struggling to make ends meet find themselves with less time to commit to their children. It is imperative that we as a society rededicate ourselves to exalting our children--supporting their efforts to succeed and providing positive role-models for them today and in the future. We must show that we care for them, and in their honor, I submit this resolution.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, last week, I offered an amendment to the Senate budget resolution that would have required Congress to enact a new Medicare prescription drug benefit before considering any massive tax cuts. While a procedural hurdle prevented my amendment from passing, fifty-one senators voted to waive the budget point of order, indicating they favored it, sending the American people a strong signal that a majority of the U.S. Senate thought we should put the needs of our nation's seniors before excessive tax cuts. 
   Yet only a week after this vote, Mr. President, we are considering a massive tax cut that will spend $248 billion of the surplus over 10 years, without doing anything to modernize Medicare. Under the guise of eliminating the ``marriage penalty,'' the majority has brought a bill to the floor that would devote over half of its benefits to people who either aren't married, or who are actually receiving right now a tax benefit, or ``bonus,'' for being married. This takes a lot of chutzpah. 
   I believe we ought to eliminate the marriage penalty for those who actually suffer the marriage penalty and need the relief most. With all the rhetoric from the other side about eliminating the marriage penalty, one might think that they would share my view and want to pass a bill that would actually focus on the penalty. 
   But a close examination of the Republican bill reveals that it is not quite what it is described to be. In fact, there are 65 provisions in the Tax Code that have a marriage penalty, including Social Security. Their bill takes care of one provision entirely and two others partially, and leaves the other 63 marriage penalties exactly the way they are. The Democratic bill addresses all 65 provisions, and takes care of the entire penalty for nearly everybody. The Democratic bill accomplishes all this but costs half as much. 
   It is time that we set our priorities straight. We ought not to be devoting $140 billion of the surplus over 10 years to individuals who currently have no marriage penalty when we have done nothing to help those who suffer from the ``senior citizens' drug penalty'' the high prices our Nation's seniors are forced to pay for prescription drugs. 
   I intend to offer a motion to recommit this bloated bill to the Finance Committee, with instructions to report out a new bill by June 1 that focuses its dollars on taxpayers who actually face a marriage penalty, and that devotes $40 billion over the next 5 years to a new prescription drug benefit. This motion will not prevent Congress from enacting marriage penalty relief this year, it will just ensure that we do not backtrack from last week's vote to enact a prescription drug benefit before we do major tax cuts. 
   I want to share again a letter I received from a woman in St. Stephens Church, VA which illustrates why the prescription drug amendment is so important. She writes:  
   My husband and I are both retirees and rely on Social Security and Medicare. Recently, we both had to go to our family doctor, and the drugs that were prescribed for us would cost us out of pocket approximately $300 per month. Due to the cost of the two prescriptions, we are forced to choose not to take the medication and live with the illness.   
   Another woman from Scottsville, VA writes:  
   My husband's income consists of his Social Security and a small pension from his former employer. We spend over twice as much for prescriptions as we do for groceries, and it's getting harder and harder to stretch our income 'til our checks arrive.  
   These Virginians are not alone in their troubles. The average senior citizen will spend $1,100 on prescription drugs this year. Most of them will not have adequate prescription drug coverage to help them cover these crushing costs. The numbers of those who do have coverage are dropping rapidly. 
   Despite the suggestions of some of my colleagues, this problem is not limited solely to the poor. One in four Medicare beneficiaries with a high income--defined as $45,000 a year for a couple--has no coverage for prescription drugs. And while some seniors do have coverage, nearly half of them lack coverage for the entire year, making them extremely vulnerable to catastrophic drug costs. 
   Complicating this matter for the elderly is the ``senior citizens' drug penalty'' that seniors without drug coverage are forced to pay. Most working Americans who are insured through the private sector pay less than the full retail price for prescription drugs. This is because insurers generally contract with Pharmaceutical Benefit Managers--or PBMs--that negotiate better prices for drugs and pass on the power of group purchasing to their customers. 
   Seniors lack this option, however, and must still pay full price for their drugs. A study released earlier this week showed that seniors without drug coverage typically pay 15 percent more than people with coverage. And the percentage of Medicare beneficiaries without drug coverage who report not being able to afford a needed drug is about 5 times higher than those with coverage. 
   This ``senior citizens' drug penalty,'' in my view, is unconscionable. Senior citizens rely more on drugs, and have higher drug costs, than any other segment of the population. They deserve to have the same bargaining power that benefits other Americans. 
   Last week the other side spoke against my amendment, claiming that there was already adequate language in the Republican budget resolution to ensure that we pass a prescription drug benefit this year. At the time, they pointed to the $40 billion reserve fund which was included in the budget resolution the Committee reported, arguing that this would provide ample money to enact a prescription drug benefit and offer tax relief. 
   Republicans asked, in essence, that we trust them that the Senate will not squander the surplus on tax cuts before we have helped our nation's seniors. Let me say that I do trust my good friends on the other side of the aisle. To borrow a line from Ronald Reagan, I believe we should trust--but verify. That is what my amendment last week did. It required deeds as well as words. 
   Seeing what happened in the budget resolution conference committee, it has become clearer than ever why we need to verify the promises that the other side gives us. Because despite both chambers setting aside a $40 billion reserve fund for a prescription drug benefit, one of the first things that the conferees did was cut this fund in half, to $20 billion--a number far too low to enact any sort of universal benefit for our nation's seniors. The conferees then took this other $20 billion, which is vitally needed to fund a universal prescription drug benefit, and said that it should be used for other Medicare reforms, such as another round of adjustments to the payment rates for Medicare providers that were hit hard by the cuts in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. But after touting this reserve fund as the key to a prescription drug benefit, they have essentially neutered themselves. 
   Even worse, the conferees removed the one provision that would have helped push a prescription drug benefit forward. The Senate budget resolution set a date of September 1 for the Finance Committee to report out a prescription drug bill. This deadline would have guaranteed that the Senate would at least consider prescription drug legislation this year. But the conferees stripped this deadline out of the bill. They have basically said: it is not important for the Senate to pass a bill to eliminate the ``senior citizens' drug penalty.'' 
   I am by no means opposed to taking another look at the decisions we made in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I worked very hard last year in the Finance Committee on the Balanced Budget Refinement Act. And there ought to be room, in the context of a balanced budget, to provide further relief to health care providers who were hit hard by the cuts in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 
   We ought not to be limiting our Medicare reform efforts to $40 billion, however, simply to free up additional funds for tax cuts. With this new limit, Republicans have essentially pitted a prescription drug benefit for seniors against additional relief for doctors, hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care providers. Republicans have decided that two important priorities must square off, so that we can provide billions of dollars in so-called ``marriage penalty'' tax relief to individuals who do not even incur a marriage tax penalty on their taxes. 
   Our nation's seniors deserve better than this. Last week, at least fifty-one Senators felt the same way. I urge every one of them, as well as Senators who opposed my amendment last week because they thought the $40 billion reserve fund would guarantee a prescription drug benefit, to support my motion to recommit this bill. With its passage, we will be able to eliminate both the true marriage tax penalty and the ``senior citizens' drug penalty.''

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I regret that I am unable to support the budget resolution that is before us today. Our annual budget resolution supposedly represents our nation's fiscal blueprint, but this document comes up short in terms of what our priorities ought to be. Instead of large, untargeted and unwarranted tax cuts, we ought to be dedicating our resources towards rebuilding our nation's schools, providing Seniors with affordable medication, strengthening Social Security and building up our national defense--in addition to paying down the national debt, so that the federal government can stay out of the capital market and be better equipped to handle dips in the economy in the future. In all of these categories the budget resolution falls woefully short. Through fiscal discipline the past seven years, we finally have the ability to begin to address our real needs. We cannot allow this golden opportunity to slip through our fingers. We owe it to our children and our parents to do a better job.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'm pleased to introduce the Assistance in Development to Communities Act. This bill addressed the importance--and need--for community-based, economic development to assist areas in trade-related, economic transitions. 
   Despite the increased globalization of our economy, many communities nationwide are still one-company or one-industry towns. If that company or industry is adversely affected by trade, the entire community faces economic strain. When these communities lose a major employer or industry, they sadly also lose something far more valuable--they lose their way of life, and too often their strong sense of community. 
   Currently, when an individual loses a job because of the effects of trade, the federal government provides Trade Adjustment Assistance or NAFTA-Trade Adjustment Assistance to help with income support and worker retraining. But what good is that training without jobs? 
   While we continue to open new avenues of free trade, the federal government has an obligation to help trade affected communities attract good jobs. Unfortunately, prospective employers don't automatically appear on the community's doorstep. Workers have mortgages, car payments, health concerns, family obligations and ties to the community, so relocation isn't always feasible. Local officials must find a way to lure industries to the area. Yet, they are caught in vicious cycle--employers are reluctant to move to economically depressed areas, but without jobs, communities will never recover. 
   This is an on-going reality in the Martinsville/Henry County region of Virginia. In January, I spoke with local officials about the steady stream of job losses they've endured, including the loss of the number two employer in Martinsville. They've faced double-digit unemployment--something that's virtually unheard of in this strong economy. They told me they need help. 
   This legislation is borne from their ideas. The AID to Communities bill give local communities the resources they need to implement their own ideas for attracting new employers--quickly and easily. It does this by providing an automatic, one-time grant to help affected communities formulate an economic development plan. This grant, up to $100,000, gives communities the resources they need to develop a long-term plan to readjust their economic base. Once that plan has been developed, the AID to Communities bill establishes a second, competitive grant program to help affected areas implement their plans. These grants can be used in a variety of ways, from expanding commercial infrastructure to establishing small business incubators. 
   My bill also offers two incentives to attract prospective employers. The first incentive would expand the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC) to provide employers with a tax credit if they hire someone who lives in an affected community and has lost a job due to trade. My bill would also make explicit that the New Markets Tax Credit, which provides incentives for private sector investment and capital access in certain areas, is available for trade-affected communities. 
   Finally, the bill makes the federal government a better partner be creating a one-stop, easily accessible clearinghouse of economic development information. This clearinghouse would provide access to cross-agency economic development tools, such as grants or low-interest loans, for affected communities so local officials don't have to hunt through each federal agency for the information they need. 
   Our neighbors in places like Martinsville/Henry County, Virginia are eager to enjoy the economic prosperity that the rest of the country enjoys, yet has so far eluded them. The AID to Communities bill is one way to help. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that this bill becomes law and that the people of Martinsville/Henry County, and in so many other small towns across America, get the help we owe them.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the substitute Budget Resolution introduced by Senator LAUTENBERG. Unlike the Republican Budget Resolution, Senator LAUTENBERG's Democratic alternative puts real teeth into priorities such as prescription drugs, Social Security, education, and paying down the debt. I support the Democratic proposal because it focuses on our national priorities first. But I want to add a word of caution. Our national defense is underfunded in both resolutions. We cannot afford, as a nation, to continue to underfund our nation's security. Freedom has a price. We can't take it for granted. We're not building enough new weapons platforms and systems to be able to meet our obligations here at home or our commitments to our allies abroad. We can't recruit and maintain the soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines we need. We can't adequately modernize, much less revolutionize, our Armed Forces without putting more money into our defense budget. I look forward to working with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to meet our responsibilities in this area.

   Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   We had an opportunity to discuss and debate this particular amendment last night to accommodate Senators. Very simply, this is an amendment to reduce the amendment for the tax cut by $5.9 billion over the next 5 years. It doesn't call for the passage of any specific school construction or renovation proposal that has been discussed. It simply sets aside the money to pay for them. Five years ago, the unmet needs in our schools nationally totaled about $185 billion. Today, those unmet needs total over $306 billion. 
   We hear a lot about State surpluses. If we used all of the fiscal year 1999 surpluses from all of the States, we would still only address about 10 percent of the unmet backlog in terms of school construction and school modernization. 
   I showed this picture last night. I will show this one again. This is a picture of Loudon County High School, just outside the beltway. This is a trailer being put in place in the parking lot. There are a number of trailers in the parking lot. There are over 3,000 trailers currently in use in Virginia alone. Loudon County needs 22 new schools at an average cost of $18 million each. That is over $400 million for one county alone. 
   School enrollment is at record levels. Currently, there are 53.2 million students in the United States. In the next 10 years, it will increase by another 1 million students. The average school today is 42 years old. The last major investment in schools was made back in the Eisenhower administration. It was a $1 billion investment then. The same amount of money 
   today, in current terms, would be $5.4 billion. This amendment simply sets aside $5.9 billion over the next 5 years to accomplish at least a portion of the pressing unmet school construction needs in this country today. I hope it will be the wisdom of my colleagues to agree to this particular amendment and vote for schools. 
   I think I adequately covered the amendment last night. I yield to my distinguished colleague from Georgia or others who may wish to address this particular amendment.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I respond to my distinguished colleague from Georgia by saying, first of all, this is not an amendment to raise taxes. This is simply an amendment to give up $5.9 billion of the tax cut that is in the resolution. 
   Second, there are no Federal strings attached. One of the benefits of this particular approach is we are not dealing with school policy, which can be very sensitive. We are dealing with bricks and mortar. For the most part, we are doing this through a tax credit that leverages the money so they can get a whole lot more bang for the buck. It is a way to keep us from being involved in local school policy. It provides maximum flexibility in the way the funds are used. 
   Finally, with all due respect to my distinguished colleague, he talked about less attentive. You can translate ``less attentive'' into ``less resourced.'' Most of the Federal programs designed to help are for those localities and institutions that simply don't have the resources to meet the critical needs of their students. This is designed to help some of those localities, including localities with very old schools that have leaking roofs and simply don't have modern heating, air conditioning, ventilation, and other accommodations that are part of the modern school system or could not have the modern technology. 
   This gives them a chance to compete on a more equal footing. I hope it will  be the pleasure of our colleagues to 
   set aside this part of the tax cut for the very important purpose of investing ultimately in our children, by investing in a nonintervention, nonintrusive way in school policy, in the bricks and mortar that will provide the kind of environment where they can learn. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Georgia. I did not see the movie ``Groundhog Day,'' but this reminds me of ``Groundhog Day.'' We have been here before. We wasted an entire week of the Senate's valuable time on the precise bill that the distinguished Senator from Georgia is now presenting to us as an alternative. 
   I listened as the clerk read the language of the initial part of the bill, taking all the amounts that would be put aside to help schools and reducing them to a single dollar. In Virginia, we call that the shad treatment: You leave the skeleton but you surgically remove the entire skeletal structure so there is nothing remaining. Then you substitute a piece of legislation that has already passed this body, notwithstanding the fact that the authors and proponents of the legislation knew from the very beginning this particular bill would not be signed by the President. 
   With all due respect to my distinguished colleague from Georgia, he knew and they knew from the beginning we were wasting a week on that particular legislation. To suggest this is a possible new development or a surprise now, with all due respect, is a bit disingenuous. 
   We have the same problem as before. We are trying to do an end run to bring about vouchers. With this legislation, this Senate would be finding a way to put a disproportionate amount of money--if I recall the figures; I do not have them in front of me--about $37 or so per family for those students who, for the most part, are already sending  their children to private schools or parochial schools and about, if I recall, $7 for those in public schools. 
   This is designed to get around the difficulty the distinguished Senator found in incorporating a voucher provision. Vouchers address 10 percent of the population. Our responsibility is to the 90 percent of the children who are in schools in America who do not have access to them. Even if we were to make vouchers available to every schoolchild in America, we only have infrastructure that can support a little over 10 percent of the population. This takes money that would otherwise be available, in this case, for much needed school construction which the States cannot afford and which, by his own admission, would help disproportionately those school districts that do not have the resources, that do not get a chance to play on a level playing field. 
   It would take the money we could use to leverage to build even more schools and renovate even more schools to run the voucher route, again, in a bill that will not even go to the President. This particular resolution does not go to the President for signature. It will have no impact on whatever the President chooses to do about the particular legislation the Senator and those who supported his position passed last time around. 
   Let's not support vouchers in another form to find a way to make it impossible for the Federal Government, without strings attached, to provide support for bricks and mortar in local school districts and divisions that need the assistance. We want to move away from a situation where we have trailers instead of classrooms. If colleagues support the underlying amendment, they will be supporting school construction and renovation. If they support the substitute, they will be supporting school vouchers. I hope it will be the pleasure of this body to reject the substitute and support the underlying amendment. I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I will be very brief. 
   I thank my colleague from Georgia for the clarification. I did not suggest that this was a voucher. I suggested it was an end run around the difficulty in establishing vouchers. The fact is that three-quarters of the benefits under the education IRA that the distinguished Senator from Georgia was able to pass through this body, which will be vetoed by the President of the United States, would go to people who are already enrolled in private schools. So it may not be a duck, but it certainly looks, talks, and walks like a duck. 
   With respect to the need, I suggest to the Senator from Georgia--and I do this in a friendly spirit--looking at all of the schools and the current estimates, Georgia faces an $8.5 billion shortfall for school modernization, which includes $7.1 billion for infrastructure and $1.5 billion for technology needs. There is projected a 26.5-percent increase in this shortfall in the decade ahead. Georgia would be among the States to benefit from this particular provision. 
   But the bottom line is that we have a choice between a plan that we know the President would support and sign, which would provide some 6,000 schools built or modernized and some 25,000 schools repaired, as opposed to the alternative, where we would have 198 schools built or modernized and none repaired. 
   At the same time, we would be transferring funds that could be used to support public education that would be supporting private education. It is as simple as that. I ask our colleagues to reject the substitute and support the underlying amendment. 
   With that, I yield to the distinguished Senator from Nevada.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I first thank the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from North Dakota for their statements. 
   The bottom line is this particular provision in the resolution before the Senate locks in as a matter of law a permanent tax cut that would gobble up all but 2 percent of the on-budget  surplus that is available. No matter how much we talk about the desire to do something in terms of prescription drugs for seniors, after the stories we hear about choosing between food and medicine, the bottom line is we lock in a tax cut and we take all the money that would otherwise be available. Notwithstanding the expressed good intentions, it just won't work. 
   This is a matter of priorities. 
   I am delighted to yield to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, this amendment is designed to help ensure that no child attends a school with a leaky roof, or crowded classrooms, or that lacks access to the latest technology and the Internet. 
   In the words of Yogi Berra, ``It's deja vu all over again.'' Last year's debate about our Budget Resolution is almost a carbon copy of this year's debate. There are few times in the legislative process that the contrasts between ideologies are more clear than in our debate on the Budget Resolution--and this year is no exception. While some  would have us focus on funding a massive tax cut which will likely be directed to those who need it least, others would focus on strengthening Social Security and Medicare, paying down the debt, and making critical investments in areas like education. While, understandably, there are bound to be philosophical differences about achieving these objectives, I am again disheartened that education is not higher on our list of fiscal priorities. While I compliment the Chairman for including $2.2 billion dedicated to IDEA funding, I'm back again to urge that more of my colleagues to support an amendment which reduces the size of this massive tax cut to help finance school modernization efforts. Mr. President, education should truly be a common priority--we certainly know that it's a national priority. 
   Mr. President, I'm sure that none of us could imagine holding Senate proceedings in a trailer, nor could we imagine having to place buckets around our desks to catch rainwater leaking in through the Capitol dome. We simply can't imagine what it would feel like to hold our summer debates in a chamber that wasn't air-conditioned. And Mr. President, if we couldn't stand the heat, we'd get out of the chamber and take a recess, but our nation's students simply don't have that luxury. A heat-related recess for them means fewer math lessons. It means less time with a qualified teacher. It means reduced learning. And Mr. President, I'm sure our dedicated clerks here in the Senate couldn't imagine doing their jobs today without being able to scan our amendments into a computer, making them accessible to staff and the nation at a moment's notice. We shouldn't then expect our nation's children to master core skills as well as information technology skills if we don't give them the keys to the information highway. 
   Mr. President, five years ago, the GAO estimated that our national school modernization needs totaled $185 billion. This year, that figure has risen to $307 billion, according to a recent report by the National Education Association. The report indicates that the State Departments of Education across the country are reporting a 65% increase in school modernization needs over the last five years. That translates into $66,849,315 a day. Much like our national debt clock, the tape is also running on our school modernization needs. With record enrollments, deteriorating facilities, and the immense need to modernize our schools with the latest technology, we simply can't afford to sit back and claim that the federal government can't or shouldn't help. 
   There is an often used argument that the federal government should have no role in building or renovating schools. And if you look at last year's federal outlays for capital expenses, school construction occupies the smallest slice of that pie. Of the 
   $400 billion the federal government spent on national infrastructure, only one-tenth of one percent--this little piece right here--went to education, training, and employment capital expenses. Roughly 55 percent of our capital costs were spent on highways, 15 percent on housing, 13 percent on community and regional development, with the remaining portion allotted to mass transit, airports, and pollution control facilities. 
   With over $300 billion in unmet needs, Mr. President, I believe we need to expand this pie and invest more in our schools. Our capital costs over the years can vary from category to category, depending upon what our needs are. Today, the average age of our nation's schools is 42 years. The last time we made a major investment in our nation's educational infrastructure was under the leadership of a Republican President, Dwight Eisenhower. Over the course of his tenure, we spent roughly $1 billion specifically for school construction--due to the boom in our student population. Well, Mr. President, we're in the Baby Boom Echo now; those children now have their own children in our schools. We have a record 53.2 million children now enrolled in our schools today and by 2009, we'll add about one million more. We need to make a commitment similar to the one made by our parents and grandparents in the 1950's. A billion dollars in 1953 would be about $5.4 billion today, if you adjusted for inflation. This amendment merely seeks to set aside $5.9 billion over the next five years. 
   For every one million students, our nation must build about 1300 schools, and at an average cost of over $12 million per school, we're talking about $16 billion. That's on top of the costs to remedy safety code violations, retro-fit schools to accommodate technology, and relieve overcrowding. 
   Mr. President, in Virginia, there are over 3,000 trailers in use. This is a picture of Loudoun County High School in Leesburg, Virginia, just 33 miles from here. You see a crane hoisting just one of a whole line of trailers that sit in a parking lot of this Northern Virginia high school. Loudoun County alone needs to build 22 new schools over the next six years to accommodate their skyrocketing enrollments. At an average cost in Northern Virginia of about $18 million per school, that's almost $400 million for just one county!

   Mr. ROBB. I thank the distinguished Senator from Nevada. A similar statistic could be quoted by any one of our 99 colleagues in this Chamber. Many of those colleagues have similar stories to tell. 
   This amendment is not an attempt to dictate what kind of school modernization legislation we should pass; it merely reserves enough funding to pay for such an effort. Given the fact that the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Sen. ROTH, has reported at least three tax bills within the last year or so which contain tax incentives for school modernization and the fact that Republican and Democratic members alike have various proposals to use discretionary spending as a vehicle to finance school modernization, there is clearly an interest on both sides of the aisle to find a way to do this. 
   Even more illustrative of the momentum to fund school modernization legislation was the introduction last Tuesday of a truly bipartisan school construction and renovation bill in the House. It's sponsored by Representatives NANCY JOHNSON and CHARLIE RANGEL and has 130 other co-sponsors. School modernization has been a top priority of the education community for the past three years. And this community is joined by engineers, architects, mayors across the country, civil rights groups, and even some religious groups. 
   Mr. President, Let's make it a priority this year. This amendment reflects a commitment similar to the one that our parents and grandparents made a generation ago. I hope we can summon similar courage in this generation.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, today, we begin our annual debate over our Nation's budget. This is an important debate. Because when you set aside the partisan squabbling and political posturing, this debate is crucial: it is about establishing our priorities as a nation. 
   Throughout my career, I have fought for fiscal discipline and tried to stop the Federal Government--and during the time I served as Governor of my State, State government--from spending more than it takes in. 
   Maintaining fiscal discipline means meeting Government obligations without borrowing from future generations. The budget resolution allows us to determine the nature and extent of our obligations by establishing our priorities. The question, then, is, What sort of priorities will Congress set for the American people this year? Will we opt to continue our path of fiscal discipline? Or will we enact a budget that ignores our $5 trillion-plus debt in our haste to provide politically appealing tax cuts? Will we choose to make new investments in education? Or will we simply decide to maintain the status quo? Will we modernize and strengthen Medicare? Or will we choose instead to use those dollars on a risky tax cut that endangers Medicare and erases the surplus? 
   These are the sort of decisions the Senate will make over the next few days. I believe we need a budget that will make America stronger and one that will address our most vital priorities. 
   I rise at this time to speak on the second-degree amendment I just offered, an amendment that will address one of our most pressing priorities--the need to bring Medicare into the 21st century. It is very similar to an amendment I offered last year. 
   This amendment states, simply, that if Congress is going to consider tax cut legislation, it must first pass legislation that will modernize Medicare through the creation of a prescription drug benefit. 
   Thirty-five years ago, President Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare into law. At the time, our country transcended politics and put our differences aside to come together, as a nation, to do the right thing with regard to acute care for our Nation's seniors. Few programs in our Nation's history have had such a lasting, positive effect on so many lives. Poverty among seniors, for example, has fallen nearly two-thirds since Medicare was first created in 1965. 
   Today, seniors live longer and better than they ever have before. But while Medicare is still a success today, the program has become hopelessly outdated. New technology and new health practices have changed medicine. The private sector has responded by integrating them into modern medicine. Perhaps the greatest change has been the emergence of prescription drugs as an integral part of modern medicine. Today, thanks to years of biomedical research funded by both Government and the private sector, prescription drugs have enabled us to treat, and often cure, all sorts of ailments and sicknesses in ways we could only dream of back in 1965. Yet while Medicare will pay for so many other parts of medicine--surgery, visits to the doctor, physical therapy, durable medical equipment, et cetera--Medicare has stayed wedded to the 1965 model of not paying for prescription drugs, even when the drugs clearly help prevent seniors from having more complicated and expensive health problems. That doesn't make sense. 
   Think about it. While our engineers used slide rules in 1965, we certainly would not expect them to go without the latest computer technology today. Likewise, medical equipment has advanced by leaps and bounds. We would not think of using a 35-year-old heart monitor on a patient; nor would we think it is sound policy to deny a patient access to a CAT scan simply because the technology wasn't around in 1965. Yet today many seniors are forced to go without needed medication because Medicare offers no 
   coverage for outpatient prescription drugs. 
   To illustrate this point, I want to share with colleagues a letter I received 2 weeks ago from a constituent in Williamsburg, VA, a veteran who served our country in Vietnam. He writes:  
   I have gone for almost two months without my blood pressure medicine ..... because I can't afford the $150 a month to get it refilled ....... I constantly feel feverish and have a splitting headache. I'm afraid I'm going to have a stroke.  
   Another woman from St. Stephens Church, VA, writes:  
   My husband and I are both retirees and rely on Social Security and Medicare. Recently we both had to go to our family doctor and the drugs that were prescribed for us would cost us out of pocket approximately $300 per month. Due to the cost of the two prescriptions, we are forced to choose not to take the medication and live with the illness.  
   It is time we did something to change this. While over 90 percent of the private sector employees with employer-based health insurance have prescription drug coverage, the 38 million-plus Medicare beneficiaries in America today have no basic prescription drug benefit. At the same time, the average Medicare beneficiary fills 18 prescriptions each year and will have an estimated average annual drug cost of nearly $1,100 this year. 
   We have an obligation to our seniors, and future generations of seniors, to strengthen and modernize Medicare by adding a prescription drug benefit. Unfortunately, the Republican budget resolution does not require that Congress spend a dime on this vital benefit. However, their resolution does require that we pass $150 billion in tax cuts. This is an issue where we need to reassess our priorities. 
   Let me state for the record that I am not opposed to all tax cuts. This past Congress, I have introduced or supported several targeted tax cut proposals, including bills to repeal the estate tax, eliminate the true marriage penalty, repeal the 3-percent telecommunications excise tax, and extend  the R&D tax credit, among others. What I am opposed to, however, is using our surplus for tax cuts before we have also addressed our other critical obligations--because a surplus, by definition, is what you have left over once you have met all your obligations. 
   The question is, Do Senators want tax cuts, or do they want to help our Nation's seniors? Our friends on the other side say they would like to do both, but the language in the budget resolution suggests differently. 
   Reading their resolution, they require the Finance Committee to report out a giant tax cut bill by September 22. Yet when it comes to adding a prescription drug benefit for seniors, there is no such requirement--although the resolution has a reserve fund that would allow the Senate to consider a drug bill on the floor if the Senate Finance Committee has not reported a bill by September 1. 
   This resolution makes the Republicans' priorities very clear: The Senate must pass tax cuts, and as for prescription drugs, well, we hope we can find some time to take it up later in the year. Maybe we can take it up if we have any money left after the tax cuts. 
   My friends on the other side of the aisle have suggested this is not the case. They have said they want to pass a prescription drug benefit this year. They have claimed there is ample money in their budget resolution to add a drug benefit to Medicare and enact their massive tax cut. 
   But a close examination of their budget resolution reveals that it would be impossible for them to do anything but enact a massive tax cut this year. The Republican budget resolution assumes $150 billion in tax cuts over the next 5 years. Combined with the interest America will pay from this revenue loss, the total budgetary impact will be $168 billion. Given that their budget resolution only assumes $171 billion in total surplus over this same time period, all but 2 percent of the on-budget surplus will be devoted to tax reduction. This leaves virtually nothing for prescription drug coverage, much less other priorities, such as defense or education, unless Congress makes deep cuts in other domestic discretionary programs. 
   As we have seen in past years, these cuts are simply unrealistic; they will never materialize, and they pose a real threat of a raid on Social Security. 
   How do they propose to help our seniors access prescription drugs when they have devoted 98 percent of the surplus over the next 5 years to tax cuts? 
   We ought not to be enacting major tax cuts until we have first fulfilled our obligation to our seniors to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. Let's get our priorities in order and put seniors before tax cuts. 
   I urge all Senators to support this amendment.

    Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, it is my privilege to be a co-sponsor of S. 2234, a bill which recognizes the exceptional service of two former Congressmen from Northern Virginia, Joseph L. Fisher and Joel T. Broyhill, by renaming two area facilities of the United States Postal Service in their honor. I'd like to say a few words about one of the honorees, the late Joseph L. Fisher. 
   I knew Joe Fisher well. He was a friend, colleague and mentor. Joe epitomized the very best in public service--with his integrity, first-rate intellect, decency and compassion for others. 
   It was Joe who provided me with my first formal entry into Virginia politics when I hosted a reception for his re-election bid to the Arlington County Board in 1971. He earned the respect of his fellow Arlingtonians with his ten years of service on the Board, including two terms as its Chairman. In championing regional solutions to many of the issues that faced Arlington County, he was ahead of his time. At various points during his tenure on the Board, he represented Arlington as Chairman of both the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority and the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. 
   My first time handing out literature at the polls in Virginia on Election Day was for Joe's first successful campaign for Congress in 1974--I remember the experience well because it rained most of the day. We were all proud of Joe's service in the U.S. House of Representatives. He was a recognized leader in Congress on tax, energy and budget issues. Joe was appointed to the Ways and Means Committee in his first term, and he facilitated the work of seven tasks forces in writing the Energy Policy Act of 1978. 
   In 1982, the year I took the oath as Governor of Virginia and about a year after the end of his service in Congress, I persuaded Joe to join my Cabinet as Virginia's Secretary of Human Resources. As in every other endeavor he undertook during his lifetime, Joe led the Department of Human Resources with distinction. He succeeded in eliminating Virginia's Medicaid deficit which had resulted from recession and cutbacks at the federal level. Joe also left a legacy of improvements in Virginia's prevention efforts in such areas as health, social services, mental health, rehabilitation, job training and independent living. After serving in my Administration, Joe spent the remainder of his professional years as a professor of political economy at George Mason University where he inspired many a student. 
   However, Joe Fisher's service as a public official only tells part of the story. He served his country in the Pacific during World War II. Joe worked his way through college as a professional boxer and was also a semi-professional basketball player in the Northern New England League. He was a Harvard trained economist and led the Unitarian Universalist Association. 
   Joe passed away in 1992 from cancer. He left behind his most important legacy--a wonderful family. His wife Peggy, an exceptionally talented individual in her own right and the secret to Joe's success, remains a valued friend to me and my family. Joe is also survived by seven children, sixteen grandchildren and two great grandchildren. 
   In a sermon he wrote entitled ``Endings and Beginnings,'' Joe referred to ``the only immortality we can count on'' as ``the immortality of the good and worthy life whose influence lives on in the hearts and minds of those whom it touches.'' Joe Fisher lived this ``good and worthy life'' and his influence will always live on in those whom he had such an indelible impact.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would like to say just a few words about the Estuary Partnership Restoration Act of 1999, which was passed by unanimous consent on Thursday March 30th. This bill contains language that reauthorizes the Chesapeake Bay Program. The success of the Bay program, and the partnerships that have been established as a result of that program, have led to improved water quality in the Bay, enhanced the lives of those of us lucky enough to live in the Chesapeake watershed, and added to the body of scientific knowledge that we have about estuaries, fisheries, and watersheds in general. 
   As Governor of Virginia I negotiated the original Chesapeake Bay Agreement. Last week, I had the opportunity to see that the Senate recognizes all the successes that have come from that program. The fact that the Chesapeake Bay program has enough support to be passed by unanimous consent is gratifying indeed. I am also excited at the prospect of expanding the oyster restoration program, which will enhance Bay water quality in a number of ways, and will continue to work for that expansion. 
   My only regret is that John Chafee, the original architect of the Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act, was not here with us. His leadership on these issues was steadfast, his ability to convince us all to take right action remarkable. I was thinking of John Chafee, last week, wishing he could have joined in the happy moment that he helped make possible. I was happy to have the opportunity to contribute to his legacy, and know that his work will be with us for years to come.

    Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor the late Lieutenant Colonel Margaret L. Ellerman, United States Army Retired. 
   A native of Michigan, Lieutenant Colonel Ellerman entered the Army as a private in 1964, after seven years of teaching in parochial schools. Following attendance at basic training and advanced individual training, she was selected for Officer Candidate School, from which she graduated in 1966. 
   Lieutenant Colonel Ellerman served as a Finance Officer for most of her career in a variety of command and staff positions. In 1968, she was selected for overseas duty in Germany, in an era when military women were virtually hand-picked for duty outside the United States. Other overseas assignments followed in Thailand and Turkey. Lieutenant Colonel Ellerman received numerous military honors, awards and decorations. Among these were three awards of the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army Commendation Medal and the Good Conduct Medal. 
   While on active duty, Lieutenant Colonel Ellerman, received her Bachelor of Science Degree in 1972 from Eastern Michigan University, and her Masters in Business Administration from Northwest Missouri State University. In addition, she was a graduate of numerous professional military finance and resource management courses. In 1977, Lieutenant Colonel Ellerman was a graduate of the United States Army Command and General Staff College. 
   After retirement from the United States Army in 1986, Lieutenant Colonel Ellerman entered civilian employment at the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, from which she retired in 1998. Upon this retirement, she founded her own corporation, Partners In Success, which assisted individuals establish their own businesses. 
   From 1991 until her death in March 2000, Lieutenant Colonel Ellerman continued to serve her country and the women who had, are, and will serve in the military forces of the United  States. She lent her considerable energy and economic knowledge to the Women In Military Service For America Memorial Foundation on the Board of Directors. Joining the cause in 1991, Lieutenant Colonel Ellerman worked tirelessly to see that this Memorial, housing and showcasing the achievements of all women who serve our nation in military service, was funded, erected and dedicated in October 1997. Through her ``behind the scenes'' efforts, this Memorial stands as a monument to our countrywomen who freely choose to dedicate their lives in military service to the United States. 
   Lieutenant Colonel Ellerman never stopped sharing the part of her that made her a dedicated teacher, career Army Officer, and philanthropic entrepreneur. Her charismatic character continues to inspire the men and women who knew and worked with her. The Department of Defense and the American people were well served by this selfless and dedicated Army soldier and civilian citizen.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today first of all to commend those members on both sides of the aisle who have worked so hard to bring this important loan guarantee bill to the floor. It is the final piece--and in my view, the key piece--of a lengthy effort to enact comprehensive reform of our nation's satellite television laws. 
   Last year, we passed a bill that I was proud to cosponsor, the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999. It restored service to thousands of Virginia households who had been cut off from their network signals, and more importantly, allowed satellite television companies to finally provide local network services to consumers. My only disappointment about the Act was that a last-minute deal removed a provision which would have made it easier for viewers living outside of major metropolitan areas to get satellite broadcasts of their local television stations. 
   As a result, the only market in Virginia that can receive local-into-local service is the metropolitan D.C. area, leaving over 94% of satellite households in my state without this crucial service. The satellite industry is not required to start offering local service to all their customers, and they've made it clear that they don't intend to do so, leaving many Americans without this important service. 
   I believe that every household in Virginia, and, indeed, across America deserves the same quality local television service. This isn't just a matter of helping rural areas get the latest episodes of ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' or ``NYPD Blue''--it's about ensuring that all consumers have access to vital local public safety information, school closings, weather and news programming that we've come to rely on. 
   There's no question that the market is out there for these services--I've been inundated with thousands of phone calls, letters and post cards from Virginians who want to subscribe to them. Unfortunately, many companies and cooperatives who are interested in providing new local television services have held back because the financing can be a bit tricky. 
   The bill before us today will help to address this problem. By providing loan guarantees that support new satellite services that serve rural areas of the country, we can help facilitate the transmission of local television signals to areas of the country that are not able to receive this service. Earlier today, I joined Senators JOHNSON and THOMAS in introducing an amendment that would significantly improve the loan guarantee program by expanding it to include those entities that are most adept at providing rural utilities. I'm very pleased that a modified  version of this amendment has been accepted, and believe that it will go a long way toward bringing affordable local television signals to unserved areas in Virginia. 
   Mr. President, I'd also like to talk for a moment about a second amendment which I've cosponsored, along with Senators BAUCUS and LEAHY, to address the issue of the emerging ``digital divide'' between urban and rural America. While many people generally think of Internet access as something that you get over telephone lines, consumers are increasingly able to access the Internet at much faster speeds through the same systems used to transmit cable and satellite television. 
   Our amendment simply clarifies that this new loan guarantee program should look at ways that the same systems which are deployed in rural areas to deliver local television services can also be used to deliver new broadband communications services. At a time when television and the Internet are heading in a direction where they may soon converge, we ought to have the foresight to look at ways that new communications systems can support multiple services and technologies, particularly when the government is helping to finance the deployment of these systems. This amendment has also been accepted. 
   Again, Mr. President, I strongly support the underlying bill, and commend those on both sides of the aisle who have helped move it to the Senate floor. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that we take steps to further enhance the range of choices consumers have in the marketplace.

    Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with several of my colleagues on the Finance Committee to repeal the telephone excise tax that originated during the Spanish American War. Fiscal discipline in the past seven years has put us in a position that we could not have imagined even a few short years ago. We now have opportunities to strengthen Social Security and Medicare, pay down our burgeoning national debt and make investments that keep our economy rolling. Along the way, we will have opportunities to correct inequities in the Tax Code. Currently, all users of telephone services pay a 3% excise tax on their use. Repealing this tax will make phone service and internet access more affordable for hardworking families. In order to decrease the expanding digital divide, we must eliminate policies that discourage families from connecting to the internet. While I continue to believe that the best use of our growing surplus is to pay down the debt and strengthen Social Security and Medicare, I am pleased that we are entering a period where we can consider legislation that will sustain our high technology growth at the same time that we are shrinking the digital divide.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, thank you. I thank my distinguished colleague and fellow Vietnam veteran from Nebraska for his words. It is an important topic. 
   Mr. President, when I came home from Vietnam a little over thirty years ago, I came home to a nation divided. I was assigned by the U.S. Marine Corps to head up a major officer recruiting program on college campuses all across America. It was 1969 and anti-war fever was consuming the nation. As you can imagine, my Marine uniform on a college campus became a lightning rod for protests and protesters. In this assignment, Mr. President, incoming bullets, rockets and artillery were replaced by insults, jeers and demonstrations. At times, it was tough. 
   I had just spent a tour of duty, which included commanding an infantry company in combat, and over 100 of my men received the Purple Heart, almost a quarter of them posthumously. Like all other warriors who served in uniform, it wasn't their job to question the policy that sent them to Vietnam, but they answered the call and those that died, did so with honor, for our Nation. 
   So while I did my best to reason with the crowds that came out to greet me on college campuses, I didn't appreciate the instinctive disrespect that was shown to me and the uniform I wore. 
   But Mr. President, I rise today to defend the rights of those individuals 30 years ago to protest me and my uniform. 
   Freedom of speech is the foundation of our democracy--and silencing that speech would have been against everything I had fought for in Vietnam. To  paraphrase an old saying: I didn't agree with what they said. But I had been willing to die to protect their right to say it. 
   Mr. President, I am repulsed by any individual who would burn the flag of my country to convey a message of dissent. It is an act I abhor and can barely comprehend. But in the democracy that our forefathers founded, and that generations of Americans have fought and died to preserve, I simply do not have the right to decide how another individual expresses his or her political views. I can abhor those political views, but I cannot imprison someone for expressing them. That's a fundamental tenet of democracies and its what makes America the envy of the world, as the home of the free and the brave. 
   Mr. President, when we frame the acceptable context for conveying a political message, we qualify freedom in America. We chip away at the extraordinary freedom that has distinguished us from our enemies for 200 years. 
   Last week, I received an e-mail from a retired U.S. Marine Corps Colonel from Virginia. Like many Americans (and many American veterans), he had struggled with this issue and searched his conscience for what's right. In his message to me, he said: ``I have seen our flag torn in battle, captured by our enemies, and trampled on by protesters. In all those events I never felt that the American way of life was in grave peril ..... for whenever our flag fell or was destroyed there was always another Marine to step forward and pull a replacement from his helmet or ruck sack.'' 
   He continued: ``The Constitution is the bedrock of America, the nation ..... the people. 
   It is not possible to pull another such document from our `national ruck sack.' We have but one Constitution, and it should be the object of our protection.'' 
   Mr. President, there is no question that it is precisely because the flag represents those sacred ideals that define our democracy, that we are so angry to see one being trampled or torn or torched. What angers us the most is the message of disrespect that desecration conveys. The ingratitude of the desecrater is tangible and we simply cannot help but be outraged. How can anyone be so shallow and so ungrateful that they would destroy the flag of a nation so great that it gives them the freedom to commit such a despicable act? 
   In fact, Mr. President, it is the motivation of the flag burner, not the burning of the flag itself, that makes us so angry that we want to punish that individual and throw away the keys. We know that when an American flag is old and tattered, or damaged and no longer fit to fly, we don't bury it, or throw it in the trash. We burn it. That is the proper, respectful method of disposing of a flag. So it is not the burning of the flag that stirs us to anger. It is the reason why the flag was burned that gets us so upset. And the reason why the flag is burned (to convey a message of dissent) is the reason why the Constitution protects it. 
   It is precisely because the act of flag burning sends a message that elicits such a visceral and powerful response that it is undeniably speech. Vulgar, crude, infantile, repulsive, ungrateful speech, but undeniably speech. 
   Mr. President, since speech that enjoys the support of the majority is never likely to be limited, the Bill of Rights, by its very design, protects the rights of a minority in key areas that the founders held dear. And it is the freedom to dissent peacefully that separates the greatest democracy the world has ever known from other regimes like those in China, Cuba, Iraq, and others where political dissent has been met with imprisonment and sometimes death. 
   We've applauded the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to individuals in other countries willing to risk their lives to peacefully protest their government. And we know that the first sign that freedom is in trouble anywhere around the world is when the government starts locking up its dissenters. 
   If we reach past our natural anger and disgust for a few publicity-hungry flag-burners, we know in our hearts that a great nation like ours, a nation that defends liberty all over the world, should not imprison individuals who exercise their right to political dissent. And we know in our hearts that a few repulsive flag-burners pose no real danger to a nation as great as ours. 
   Mr. President, a great defender of freedom in the world, General Colin Powell, had this to say in letter last year about this amendment:  
   I understand how strongly so many of my fellow veterans and citizens feel about the flag and I understand the powerful sentiment in state legislatures for such an amendment. I feel the same sense of outrage. But I step back from amending the Constitution to relieve that outrage. The first amendment exists to insure that freedom of speech and expression applies not just to that which we agree or disagree, but also to that which we find outrageous. I would not amend that great shield of Democracy to hammer a few miscreants. The flag will still be flying proudly long after they have slunk away.  
   Mr. President, our flag stirs very deep emotions in me. It never fails to inspire me. I still get a chill down my spine when it passes in a parade. And I've handed it, folded, to too many widows not to revere it to the core of my being. 
   I fully support the Citizens Flag Alliance and especially my fellow members of the American Legion for all their hard work to instill in our people a greater respect for our flag. I understand why so many of my fellow veterans support this amendment. But I want the same thing they want. I want all of our citizens to respect our flag and all that it stands for. 
   Mr. President, I want that flag to be the proud symbol of a nation that is truly free. And for it to be that proud symbol, we must also protect the sacred freedoms placed in the first amendment of the Constitution by our forefathers. 
   Mr. President, I am a proud veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps. And I learned many lessons serving in combat in Vietnam. I served with Marines who loved this country and were great patriots. They were often young and sometimes scared. But they risked their lives in Southeast Asia. 
   Some of those brave warriors died for our nation. On two separate occasions, I had men literally die in my arms. 
   Those who made the ultimate sacrifice may have died keeping faith with their country. They may have died so that others might be free. They may have died for an ideal or a principle or a promise--sacred intangibles that transcend time. Some might say they died for the flag. But I was there, Mr. President, and they did not die for a piece of cloth (however sacred), that eventually becomes worn and tattered and eventually has to be replaced. No. They died fighting for all that our flag represents. 
   My fellow veterans who died in combat sacrificed their lives for these intangibles that are the core values of our democracy. They died for liberty and tolerance, for justice and equality. They died for that which can never burn. They died for ideals that can only be desecrated by our failure to defend them. 
   In opposing this amendment, I truly believe that I am again called upon to defend those intangible ideals--like freedom and tolerance--for which so many of us fought, and too many of us died. I am in a different uniform today, in a different place and time. But I feel as if, in some way, I am again battling the odds to defend principles that, as a younger man, I was willing to die for. I'd still put my life on the line today to defend those principles. 
   I say that because the flag represents freedom to me. But the first amendment guarantees that freedom. And when we seek to punish those who express views we don't share, then we--not the flag burners--we begin to erode the very values, the very freedoms, that make America the greatest democracy the world has ever known. I support our flag, and the republic for which it stands. But I cannot, with the faith I have in that republic, support this constitutional amendment. 
   I thank the Chair. And I thank my distinguished colleague from Nebraska who has received the highest honor our country can bestow on any who has defended America in battle; the Medal of Honor. I am proud to appear with him. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act. This bill contains some welcome new tools to help manage risk on the farm. It is not a perfect bill, but it is a very good bill. Virginia farmers will have more risk management tools available to them than ever before, and these tools will be able to cover more crops than ever before, making the crop insurance system more equitable and more available. 
   In particular, I thank the members of the Agriculture committee for their hard work on this bill. I know that the discussions have been contentious, and that different regions of the country view risk management in entirely different ways. I for one am thankful that the necessary compromises were made to bring this bill forward for a vote. It is gratifying to know that on the important issues, and this is a very important issue, that we can still work together and do what is necessary to improve the lives of the people we represent. 
   So, I say thank you Chairman LUGAR, and Senators KERREY, ROBERTS, GRAHAM, LINCOLN, LEAHY and MACK, the rest of the committee, and all of your staffs. You have done the hard work. The country, our food supply, and our farmers will all benefit. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New York. I am delighted to join, as I just mentioned to him, the ``amen'' chorus. 
   I rise to support my friend from Nebraska in his continuing effort to strengthen Social Security for the long term. I commend him for his tireless work on behalf of the seniors of this country, as well as their children and grandchildren, as he fights to both strengthen Social Security and lessen the burden of debt we leave to future generations. 
   I share Senator KERREY's frustrations over the failure of this body to strengthen Social Security. I am pleased we can now afford to repeal the earnings test. I fully support this bill. But this is only one of many steps that need to be taken. We cannot continue to deal with a program as large and as vital as Social Security on a piecemeal basis. We owe both our seniors and our children so much more. 
   The facts are simple. By the year 2013, payroll taxes we collect will not be sufficient to pay for Social Security payments. By the year 2034, the program will only be able to pay for 72 cents out of every dollar of benefits we have promised senior citizens in America. Worst of all, these figures are based on our economy continuing to click along at the same pace it is right now. If we have a sudden downturn or period of stagnation, we will be in trouble much sooner. 
   It is time to start telling the American people the truth. If we do not strengthen our Social Security program, we will have to either cut benefits or increase payroll taxes--or both. We cannot afford to let that happen. 
   Even worse, from my perspective, the bills would have to be paid by our children and grandchildren. They deserve a better legacy from us than a mountain of debt. 
   The good news is, slowly but surely, we are making progress. In the past several years, we have been able to remove the Social Security trust fund surplus from the calculation of the onbudget surplus. While I am pleased we have taken this first step toward fiscal responsibility, we need to do much more. Setting aside the surplus in the Social Security trust fund is prudent, but it does not take care of the underlying and very fundamental problems. 
   Now is the time to act. We need to strengthen the Social Security program so today's senior citizens get the benefits they have been promised. We need to strengthen the Social Security program so our children and grandchildren are not unfairly burdened with our debt. We need to do more. I support what we are doing today, but we need to do more. 
   I conclude my remarks by thanking the distinguished senior Senator from New York, who is, regrettably, in the judgment of many of us, going to be retiring from this institution, and the distinguished senior Senator from Nebraska, who, equally regrettably, is going to be retiring from this institution. Both will be sorely missed. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I take a moment to recognize a milestone we reached today that was simply unthinkable eight short years ago. While it has gone largely unnoticed, in my view it represents real hope for our children's future. 
   Today, for the first time in 70 years, we bought back part of our Nation's debt. It was a relatively small amount--$1 billion--compared to our $5.7 trillion debt. But at least it shows that we are willing to pay down the mortgage the federal government took out on our children's future over the last 30 years. 
   We hear a great deal about wasteful spending, and we need to remain vigilant to root out wasted taxpayer dollars. But in my view, the most wasteful federal spending is the money we are forced to spend on interest to support our publicly held debt--debt which represents all the tough choices we did not make. Last year, we spent nearly $230 billion on interest payments on the debt. That compares with the roughly $38 billion the federal government spent last year on education. 
   Those of us who care deeply about keeping government from spending more than it takes in need to continue to make fiscally responsible choices so we can remove the millstone of debt from the necks of our children as quickly and responsibly as possible.

   Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I thank my friend from New Jersey for yielding time. 
   Mr. President, for the third time in as many years, I am forced to express in this Chamber my strong opposition to a congressional proposal to meddle with Virginia airports. I will have to oppose the FAA conference report, most of which I strongly support and I believe is long overdue because it breaks a promise to the people of Northern Virginia--a promise that Congress would permit us to manage and develop our own airports. 
   While I will again vote against this bill to protest congressional interference in the operation of Virginia's airports, I would like to make clear that I fully support FAA reauthorization and release of the airport improvement funds. In fact, as someone who has long believed that we need to substantially increase our investments in transportation, I commend the conferees for crafting a conference report which does just that. 
   Under this bill, annual funding for many airports in Virginia will nearly  double, providing for critical safety improvement and expanding airport capacity. Nonetheless, I will have to vote against the bill. 
   By forcing additional flights on Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, this measure breaks the 1986 agreement among the Congress with Virginia and the local governments to leave National Airport alone and to get Congress out of the business of managing airports. 
   Even at the time of the 1986 agreement, however, there was skepticism that Congress would keep its word. In the words of then-Secretary of Transportation William Coleman, ``National has always been a political football.'' Perhaps he should have said: National will always be a political football. I hope that is not the case. But I am dubious. 
   While I worked hard to oppose the addition of slots and expanding the perimeter at National, I am not going to engage in any purely dilatory tactics because I believe these issues should be decided on the merits. In this case, I believe the merits are simple and compelling. 
   Increasing slots at National creates delays for the majority of the people who use the airport and undermines the quality of life in communities that are near the airport. 
   People have a right to expect their Government to keep its end of the bargain. By injecting the Federal Government into the running of the airports once again, this bill scuttles an agreement we made with this region more than a decade ago and breaks a promise to the people who live here. 
   Mr. President, I yield any time remaining on the side of those in opposition. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would like to spend a moment talking in support of my colleague from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, in his efforts to maintain at least a semblance of fiscal discipline at a time when many of our colleagues are thinking primarily about how to spend the surplus on new programs or major tax cuts. As the baby boomers head toward retirement, we have a responsibility to address their future needs. The current Social Security and Medicare programs simply are not equipped to handle our aging population. We need to strengthen these programs, but we cannot do that with our current national debt. Conventional wisdom has always been, in times of prosperity we save for the bad times. It is hard to fathom more prosperous times than we are currently enjoying. Yet we continue to avoid making tough choices that will prepare us for the future. 
   Until we muster the political courage to strengthen Social Security and Medicare, we need to focus on paying down the debt. There are three ways to pay for our priorities. We can borrow from our parents by using the Social Security trust fund, we can borrow from our children by adding to our Nation's debt, or we can pay for our priorities ourselves. In my view, the only responsible approach is to pay for our priorities ourselves. How can we even consider tax cut legislation that is not paid for when we have not even determined how much of the budget should be allocated to tax cuts?  
   We are still several weeks away from the actual debate on the budget resolution and even further away from an agreement. If we are going to vote tax legislation off the floor before the budget resolution is in place, it should be paid for. That is 
   the only responsible thing to do. 
   Currently, the public debt is more than $5.75 trillion. In order to maintain this debt, we need to dedicate billions of dollars to making interest payments. Last year alone we paid over $230 billion in interest payments on the publicly held debt. Can you imagine what we could do if we were able to use even one-tenth of this money on our Nation's schools? 
   We can argue all day about the proper role of the Federal Government in public schools, but I assume we all agree something needs to be done. We owe it to our children to give them the best head start possible. Mr. President, $230 billion would go a long way toward solving this problem. 
   We need to remember that the surplus is what we have left over once we have met all our obligations. We have not yet decided what our obligations are, so how can we know how much our surplus is going to be and how much extra money we are going to have? 
   I urge our colleagues to support the Graham amendment when it comes up for a vote. I yield any time that may be allotted to me. 
   I thank the Senator from Georgia for his courtesy.

   Mr. ROBB. I thank the Chair. 
   I thank my distinguished colleague from Iowa for his statement this morning and for his continued leadership in education. 
   Mr. President, we are now considering amendment No. 2861. It is an amendment I sent to the desk yesterday afternoon but agreed to debate this morning. 
   I always welcome any opportunity to talk about education, about its importance to our society, about ways we can improve our system of education, and about how we at the Federal level can be better partners with our States, our localities, and our families. 
   We met yesterday morning with the Governors of our 50 States. During my own term as Governor of Virginia in the early 1980s, we took a great deal of pride in being able to pump over $1 billion of new money--over and above the baseline projections--into public education. That was back when $1 billion was still serious money. 
   Education is not the only engine of innovation fueling opportunity for economic prosperity; it is one of the most critical tools in maintaining a democracy. Thomas Jefferson said that ``an enlightened citizenry is indispensable to the proper functioning of a Republic.'' So when we have an opportunity to talk in this Chamber about education, we are really talking about our future as well as our past. 
   To my dismay, the opportunity we have today to engage in really productive and constructive debate about education is really a mirage. We have traveled this road before. 
   We have debated this same bill and others similar to it, and the President has exercised his veto power and has promised to veto this bill again if it arrives in its current condition. 
   The Affordable Education Act, while it contains many admirable provisions that would primarily enhance the affordability of higher education, also contains a poison pill, one that many of us are simply unable to swallow. This bill, in essence, would allow the diversion of public moneys to private elementary and secondary schools. As stewards of public taxpayer dollars, any policy that diverts public money away from public schools, it seems to me, is both unwise and inequitable. 
   We have heard many times the figures about education savings accounts. The average tax benefit to parents whose children attend private schools would be $37 a year while the benefit to families whose children attend public schools would be just $7 a year. Yet we know that 90 percent of our schoolchildren attend public schools. We also know our classrooms are overcrowded and many are dilapidated to the point of being unsafe. We know we face a very real and imminent teacher shortage over the next 10 years. We know we need to continue our efforts to help States finish the business we started with Goals 2000. We need to help States align their new standards and assessments with their curricula. We know we need to encourage more professional development for teachers and administrators. I believe we need to give even greater flexibility to States and localities in the use of Federal dollars in exchange for improved academic performance. We need to do all of these things and more. 
   I wish to talk about one specific area that demands our immediate attention. As a member of the Finance Committee, I have frequently mentioned the need to build and modernize our Nation's schools. In fact, I introduced school modernization legislation last July. It has 21 cosponsors and has been endorsed by over 50 organizations, from education groups to professional organizations to the National Conference of Mayors. 
   Without good, safe, and modern facilities, the rest of the education debate becomes practically moot. When a roof collapses, teachers and administrators really care most about fixing the roof and reopening the school. When fuses blow because of poor electrical wiring, administrators know  they can't buy more computers before first rewiring the schools. Trailers may be a cheaper temporary fix to the problem of overcrowded classrooms, but even the most modern trailers are not adequate to accommodate 21st century learning. 
   One of the largest investments Congress ever made in our national infrastructure occurred under the leadership of a Republican President, Dwight Eisenhower. In the 1950s, we spent roughly $1 billion to build and renovate our Nation's schools. That was a time when $1 billion really meant something. My friends in Fairfax County tell me it now costs them over $25 million to build just one high school. My friends in Loudoun County need 22 more new schools in the next 5 to 6 years because of skyrocketing enrollments. 
   There are a lot of problems we face in the education arena, but we simply can't ignore the massive infrastructure problem we have anymore. Everyone, from civil engineers to architects to construction firms to the education community, recognizes that we have to help and we have to help now. All of our talk about reducing class size and improving technology education and investing in school safety really puts the cart before the horse when there are no new classrooms for the newly hired teachers, no electrical upgrades to handle the new computers, no new roofs to ensure the safety of our children. 
   Instead of talking about legislation which clearly is destined for defeat or veto, we could be talking about reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Instead of talking about giving greater tax benefits to 10 percent of American families, we could be talking about how to better serve the 90 percent of American families who want the best education system that all levels of government can provide. Instead of talking about pouring money into private schools, I would rather be talking about pouring foundations for public schools. 
   So I offer an amendment with Senator HARKIN, Senator CONRAD, Senator LAUTENBERG, and Senator BINGAMAN that would authorize $25 billion in tax credit bonds for school modernization and renovation. The amendment would also authorize up to $1.3 billion a year for the next 5 years in grants and zero-interest loans to needy school districts so they could make urgent repairs such as those required to remedy fire code violations and other urgently needed safety repairs. 
   This amendment still helps families save money for college. It still increases the annual limit for education savings accounts to $2,000. It also helps our States and localities meet a massive infrastructure need. 
   In 1995, the GAO estimated we had $112 billion in repair needs and $73 billion in new construction needs. In a study just released by the National Education Association, the total unmet school infrastructure needs across the country now total $307 billion. These numbers were gathered from the individual State departments of education across the country. These are the dollars our States admit they can't come up with despite their surpluses. Even if every State used all of their available surpluses, that amount would still only meet 7.1 percent of the school construction needs that exist now 
   nationwide. 
   I don't think this Congress has taken seriously the enormity of this particular problem. We can't just sit by and do nothing. Without the pending amendment, the school construction assistance provided in this bill is negligible. Our amendment would help build 6,000 schools and help make urgent repairs to some 25,000 schools. The underlying bill we are considering today will only build or renovate 200 schools. That is a stark contrast. 
   With over 12 million children attending schools with leaky roofs, our students deserve better. With over 3,000 trailers being used in my State of Virginia alone, our students deserve better. In Alabama, it is reported that the roof of an elementary school collapsed just after the children had left for the day. In Chicago, teachers place cheesecloth over air vents to keep lead-based paint flecks from getting into their classrooms. In Maine, some teachers are forced to turn out the lights when it rains because their wiring is exposed under leaking roofs. The list goes on and on. 
   Helping States and localities build schools doesn't interfere with local school control. We know the overwhelming majority of school districts face this particular infrastructure crisis. I simply do not accept the argument that the Federal Government cannot and should not play a role in this crisis. The needs are simply too great. If we can help States and localities build roads, we can certainly help them build schools. Both are critical to our sustained economic success. 
   We should expect great things from our Nation's schools and our Nation's students. They should expect real debate and results from Congress. But by choosing to rehash the same old debate about helping wealthy families pay for private school, we send a message to America that this Congress is more interested in sound bites than in solutions. 
   The American people, and many Members here, are thirsty for solution-oriented dialog. If this bill is passed without addressing some of the most urgent needs, we are not meeting our obligations and we are missing a very real opportunity to make a difference. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I wish to address a couple of the issues raised by my distinguished colleague from Delaware. One of the issues the Senator from Delaware suggested was that this creates a whole new bureaucracy. But with all due respect, it does not create a whole new bureaucracy. States only have to keep a tally on how much bonding authority they have used. That is it. That is not a whole new bureaucracy. 
   Talking about the concern about assessments and making additional assessments, the truth is that most of the States have already made those assessments. So we are not talking about any additional burden.  
   When we talk about the QZAB as not having been used, 94 school districts in 15 States have utilized the QZAB, and that, indeed, is the model upon which these school modernization bonds are featured. We are not talking about an untested bill. 
   With respect to the number of students that we are trying to help under the circumstances, currently we have 52.7 million students in America's schools. In 8 years, that total will climb to 54.3 million students in our schools. We are talking about a significant increase in the number of students at the same time we are trying to decrease the number of students in individual classes. We know the schools are getting older and older, with the average age of the schools in this country today being 42 years old. We have a pressing, urgent problem. 
   With all due respect to my distinguished colleague from Delaware, I would recommend a visit to a number of the schools because the schools in many cases are in desperate need of infrastructure repair. And this is designed to provide Federal assistance in ways that do not get involved in local school control. I recognize and respect that particular feature. 
   This is simply designed to assess the financing of those greatly needed improvements, which I believe the Senator from Delaware and any other Senator in this Chamber will find if they visit the schools in their districts. They are old and getting older, and we can't meet the reduction in class size. The school population is increasing. Most of the children we are talking about for the years 2007 and 2008 are already born. We know the numbers. We have to be able to respond to the need. This is a way to do it without interfering with local control. 
   The basic difference between the two of us is whether or not we ought to put public moneys into private education or whether as stewards of the public purse we have a responsibility to make sure we fund public education first. 
   I respectfully request that my colleagues support this particular measure and stand up for the students and the future of education in America. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, today I rise to honor Sergeant Major Annette Cashaw who will retire from the United States Army in June 2000, after more than 26 years of dedicated service. 
   Serving in positions of increasing trust and responsibility, Sergeant Major Cashaw has displayed remarkable leadership, technical knowledge, and superb planning abilities throughout her entire career. Sergeant Major Cashaw's exceptional abilities were notably acknowledged when she was selected as the First Sergeant for the Data Systems Unit, White House Communications Agency. In addition to being responsible for 141 joint service personnel, she ensured that 9 million dollars in hand receipt items were maintained without loss. Her direct involvement in maintenance operations resulted in a net saving of over one hundred thousand dollars to the Army. 
   Upon completion of the Sergeant's Major Academy, Sergeant Major Cashaw assumed the position of Sergeant Major for the Army's largest software development organization, the Information Systems Software Development Center at Fort Lee. Her exemplary performance of duty there resulted in her selection as the Secretary of the General Staff (a position normally held by a Major) for the 19th Theater Army Area Command in Korea. 
   Sergeant Major Cashaw culminated her career as the Sergeant Major of the U.S. Army Information Systems Software Center. Her expert knowledge of all Army regulations and policies made her invaluable to the entire command. Soldiers benefitted from her mentoring and went on to win CECOM 2nd Quarter, 3rd Quarter, and 4th Quarter boards and CECOM soldier of the year in 1998. 
   I am honoring Sergeant Major Cashaw on the Senate floor today as a way of thanking her for her faithful and honorable service to the Army and to the citizens of the United States.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues Senators DEWINE and WARNER to introduce a bill aimed at preserving an important part of our national heritage. The Presidential Sites Improvement Act will help preserve and protect some of our nation's greatest historical treasures, homes and other places close to the lives of U.S. Presidents. Mr. President, the Commonwealth of Virginia is the birthplace and home of some of our most illustrious presidents. We have honored those Presidents by preserving their homes, and we honor our history by maintaining those homes and using them to educate and remind ourselves of what has gone before. Mount Vernon, Monticello, and Montpelier are famous for providing historic perspective on what the nation was like during the years when their owners served our country. 
   Not all Presidential homes are as grand as Mount Vernon, nor were all Presidents as well remembered and honored as George Washington. But each President has an important place in American history, and their homes and other sites related to their lives, remain an important part of our nation's story. 
   Many of these sites are owned by private citizens, small community organizations, universities, and historical societies. These organizations don't always have the funds available to keep the sites in good repair, provide fire protection, handicap access, and develop interpretive displays that teach our nation's history. The Presidential Sites Improvement Act is aimed primarily at those sites. We want to lend a hand to those local organizations and individuals who work to preserve the story of individual Presidents in order to preserve the story of America's growth, and America's greatness. 
   Mr. President, I also want to thank each of these organizations for preserving our country's history, and for providing our generation and future generations with information on the backgrounds and influences that tie each President to his time in history, and his place in the national mosaic of our great democracy. 
   I am pleased to be an original sponsor of this bill, and I hope the Senate will join us in supporting this legislation, and moving it to quick passage.

    Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, today with Senator MOYNIHAN I introduce legislation that will continue our fight on urban sprawl by encouraging the use of public transportation. The Commuter Benefits Equity Act of 2000 increases the tax exemption for transit and van passes to the same level as parking. Currently, we allow employers to provide up to $175 a month in tax-free parking benefits, but only $65 a month for transit. This makes no sense when our goal is to reduce the amount of traffic on our highways. 
   The Commuter Benefits Equity Act of 2000 raises the limit on transit and van passes up to the current limit for parking passes, $175 a month. Both of these benefits will then be adjusted for inflation annually. To ensure that federal employees can also take advantage of this benefit, the bill also eliminates an outdated provision that currently precludes an employee from cashing out his employer-provided parking pass and using an employer-provided transit pass instead. It is important that federal employees have the same access to public transportation benefits as do private sector employees. 
   While this is but one step towards dealing with traffic congestion and the more comprehensive problem of sprawl, it is an important one. I will continue to push for sensible legislation, like this bill, that continues to improve our quality of life.

    Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, on January 17, 2000, I attended the dedication of a memorial monument to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in Norfolk, Virginia. I want to read into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD the remarks offered at the dedication by Rabbi Israel Zoberman, spiritual leader of Congregation Beth Chaverim in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and Chairman, Community Relations Council, United Jewish Federation of Tidewater:  
   Our God of Blessings, My Cherished African American Sisters and Brothers, Dear Dignitaries and Friends, 
   Indeed, ``This is the day the Lord has provided for us, let us rejoice in it.'' We have come together one family to give thanks for the life of a great son of America and humanity, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and for his legacy that will never die. With joy and pride we dedicate this towering monument to the lasting spirit it represents--to bring shalom's gift to the world through the non-violent means of hope, healing and harmony. On the threshold of a new decade, century and millennium, it is an essential guiding beacon of light and enlightenment, soothing pain and discovering promise. 
   Standing on the giant shoulders of our martyr for peace, we gratefully acknowledge the Biblical fountain of living truth spoken by Israel's prophets that nourished, sustained and inspired the prophetic conscience of Dr. King, a Nobel Prize laureate, teaching that human dignity is one and indivisible. No one is to pass by this sacred site untouched by it, for it is symbol of our collective mandate to transform the world--transcending limitations and breaking barriers that still divide us, keeping all children of Moses' God of Freedom from rightfully fulfilling their potential to be a blessing. 
   We are deeply moved by the extensive labor of love and faith finally giving birth to this grand accomplishment, now and forever gracing our beloved City of Norfolk and the Hampton Roads community. May the entire nation hearken anew to the compelling message of the Book of Deuteronomy, ``Tzedek tzedek tirdof lemann tichye'' (Justice, justice shall you pursue that you may live). 
   Dr. King, we pledge to you and one another to continue your most noble historical mission, rising to meet your high stature. We can do no less. We shall never give up marching to the Promised Land you so abundantly and sacrificially dreamed of, leaving behind slavery in all its manifestations. Together we shall yet overcome, O God Almighty, we shall yet overcome. Amen.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'm pleased to join today with my friend from Tennessee, Senator FRIST, to introduce the Know Your Caller Act of 2000--a bill that will make a real and immediate difference in the lives of all Americans. 
   Not a week goes by that I don't hear from Virginians about the intrusion of telemarketers into their homes. Although Congress passed the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA, in 1991, the law is widely abused--telemarketers openly disregard the law, refusing to identify themselves when asked, and ignoring requests to be placed on ``do not call lists.'' 
   In recent years, consumers have turned to caller ID services to help them screen out unwanted calls and report those who violate current law to the authorities. Unfortunately, most telemarketers actively block their number from being displayed on caller ID systems, making it difficult to determine the name and employer of the telemarketer. We already require telemarketers to identify themselves when they call, and we should apply this same requirement to their caller ID information. 
   The Know Your Caller Act of 2000 will prevent companies from blocking their identities on caller ID. Our legislation will require every phone solicitor to reveal the name of the telemarketer who is making the call, as well as a valid telephone number where that company can be reached for purposes of being placed on the do-not-call lists required under current law. 
   It's time that we gave consumers a way to fight back against these intrusions into their homes, and this bill is the perfect way to do so: by putting an end to caller ID blocks, we can empower the consumer to take action against violators of the TCPA and regain control of their telephones. I urge all of my colleagues to join Senator FRIST and me in supporting this important consumer protection bill.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would like to begin by thanking my colleagues, Senators TORRICELLI and GRASSLEY, for their leadership in putting together the bankruptcy legislation that is before us today. I was one of the co-sponsors of the initial bankruptcy bill and continue to support the legislation that is before us today. I'm concerned, however, that we are including a tax provision which runs counter to the entire essence of the bill. 
   As we finish debate on this measure, we ought to focus on one overriding theme: responsibility. In the context of bankruptcy, this includes both financial and social responsibility. Debtors need to be more responsible when making decisions about purchasing goods or services. And just as we expect those who purchase goods and services to pay for these benefits, we expect lenders and sellers to be responsible in their business practices. This is going to be a difficult balancing act--both sides are going to have to give a little bit. Right now, I hope that we are closer to fixing many of the problems that needed to be addressed. 
   Financial responsibility, however, is not just relevant for our debate today--it needs to become a theme for this Congress. This bankruptcy bill is based on a simple premise: if you are able to pay your debts, you should. I believe this premise should also be applied to the federal government. For decades, the government spent more than it took in. It ran up a $5 trillion debt. We are now in a position to pay our debts. Before we go on a massive tax-cutting or spending binge, we should focus on reducing our debt. It rings hollow for us to insist upon financial responsibility from individuals and then fail to exercise financial responsibility ourselves. 
   We should start this session exercising fiscal restraint, and we should begin with this bill. It is ironic that this bill contains a tax cut that costs more than it should and fails to hit its target. Although the tax package contained in this bill is being described as helping small businesses, it is poorly targeted and will provide little help to the businesses that will be most affected by the minimum wage bill. 
   If minimum wage legislation continues to move forward, I urge my colleagues to look once again at S. 1867, The Small Business Tax Reduction Act of 1999, the bill that Senator BAUCUS and I introduced last November. This tax package offers real relief to those employers who will be most affected by the minimum wage increase. That was the purpose of the minimum wage tax bill, and our bill accomplishes that goal. 
   For instance, our bill would accelerate the full deduction for self-employed health insurance so that it takes effect immediately instead of delaying it for several more years. Our bill would increase the expensing limit for small businesses so they can purchase new and better equipment. We would also raise the business meals deduction from 50% to 60% to help restaurants accommodate increased labor costs. 
   At the same time, we would provide estate tax relief for small family-owned farms and businesses. Death is an inappropriate catalyst for the forced sale of a family-held business or farm. Farmers would benefit as our bill would be sure that income averaging does not increase a farmer's potential Alternative Minimum Tax liability. We also provide farmers with a longer period to use their net operating losses if they have them. These are real tax provisions that help real people. 
   The Small Business Tax Reduction Act of 1999 also contains provisions targeted to geographic areas with the greatest need of economic assistance. The New Markets proposal, for example, would reward employers who operate in economically distressed areas, where the minimum wage is the most prevalent. It also includes a credit that encourages employers to give their lower income employees information technology training. We also expand current empowerment zones credits so that more communities and more people are able to take advantage of these credits. These are all provisions that will provide assistance to areas that are most in need of help. 
   Moreover, the pension provisions in our bill are designed to address the needs of small employers struggling to  develop effective retirement plans for their employees. For example, we would allow small businesses to take plan loans as large businesses can, and we have included Senator BAUCUS' proposal to provide a credit for new small business pension plans. Everyone benefits when small businesses are better able to offer their employees retirement plans. 
   In short, the tax package I offered accomplishes the purpose of providing relief to those employers who will have higher costs when the minimum wage increases. And it is responsible. It does not squander the surplus that we have fought so hard to achieve, but rather maintains it for debt reduction. At the same time, it protects Social Security Trust Funds from being misallocated to other programs and expenditures. The tax package that is currently contained in the bill is not responsible and must be substantially improved in conference. We are going to face several tough issues this year. I hope that our colleagues agree that this is the time to start.

    Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to once again address the issue of the interstate movement of municipal solid waste. This is an issue that I have been working on for over five years, Mr. President. In 1994, I proposed legislation (S. 2126) that would have authorized localities to impose reasonable limits on imports of municipal solid waste from other states. That legislation did not pass, and even though most communities now negotiate compensation from landfills that imports waste, they negotiate with no real authority to power. In 1997, I re-introduced that bill (S. 448). In 1999 during the 106th Congress, and working with Senator WARNER, I introduced new language that I had hoped would spur discussion and perhaps some creative approaches to solving this problem. 
   I have tried, as have many other Members including Senators WARNER, BAUCUS, Coats, SPECTER, VOINOVICH, BAYH, CONRAD, SANTORUM, of course Senator CHAFEE, to come to grips with this issue in some reasonable way. We have all tried to come up with legislation that would provide states and localities with some method of refusing the detritus from other states when it becomes an imposition, or a hazard. The Environment and Public Works Committee did have a hearing last summer on this issue, but unfortunately no mark up was held after that hearing. All of our efforts, singly and in concert, have had little effect. 
   As of today Virginia remains the second largest importer of waste in the US, with the level of waste imported increasing from approximately 2.8 million tons in 1997 to 4.6 million tons in 1998. The figures for 1999 are not in yet but we can safely assume that they are higher still. On May 29th 1996, Mayor Giuliani and Governor George Pataki announced that in December of 2001 the Fresh Kills landfill will close. Fresh Kills remains the point of disposal for much of New York City's waste. Let me quote from a 1997 report prepared by the Congressional Research Service on this looming closure.  
   How the city will replace Fresh Kill's capacity is unclear. At present, there are few options other than an expanded recycling program and out-of-state disposal. A 1996 report for the city's Department of Sanitation concluded that, given current disposal sites, the city would consume virtually all of the available disposal capacity located within a 365-mile radius.   
   New York City and the state of New York have done virtually nothing since that time to increase in-state capacity. I would pose this question to each Senator. Envision the largest city in your state with a solid waste disposal problem of this magnitude, can you imagine your state government, and the mayor of that city simply ignoring the problem and failing to do anything about it? Admittedly, we have some tussles in Virginia, but when we have a problem, we try our level best to solve it ourselves, before we ask the rest of the Union to carry the weight. 
   This session it is critical that we get something done on this issue. Because when Fresh Kills closes we can expect a lot of additional waste to come our way. Each additional 1 million tons of waste that comes to Virginia will result in 40,000 additional tractor trailer trips on Virginia highways, if the trucks observe the legal weight limit. If they don't, we will have fewer, but more dangerous trucks. 
   Mr. President, a principle of public health protection embodied in the most basic practices of solid waste disposal is that waste should move as quickly as possible from point of origin to point of disposal. Moving waste over 300 miles through the most congested portion of this country makes no sense, but it will continue unless we move to stop it. Therefore, Mr. President, I urge that the Environment and Public Works committee move to mark up a bill that will help those of us in Virginia, and Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Maine, and other unwary states to cope with, and put reasonable restrictions on waste coming into our states. 
   I have proposed an alternative option, but if that can't or won't be taken up by the Environment and Public Works Committee, I am ready to support any and all legislation aimed at empowering states to have some control over waste imports. To that end I ask that I be added as a co-sponsor to both the Specter and Voinovich bills. I will be willing to support any other legislation that serves my stated purpose. 
   In 104th Congress we came very close to passing an interstate waste bill. Senator SMITH of New Hampshire worked tirelessly on that bill, and was integral to its passage in the Senate. I hope as chairman, he will take up this issue once again, and move a bill through committee for consideration by the full Senate. 
   We were sent here to tackle complex issues and solve problems. We need to work together, and start now, so that an interstate waste bill will be one of the accomplishments of this year.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'd like to commend the efforts of those of my colleagues who joined in the effort to make an important change to the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999. As initially drafted, the conference report on H.R. 1554 caused many of us great concern because it included two provisions which could have discriminated against Internet and broadband service providers by expressly and permanently excluding any ``online digital communication service'' from retransmitting a television signal or other audiovisual work pursuant to a compulsory or statutory license. Like many of my colleagues, I was deeply concerned that in the race to adjourn, Congress would neglect to fix these potentially damaging provisions. 
   Under the agreement which has been reached on this bill, these provisions have been deleted. This was the right thing to do: these two provisions had been added to the conference report late in the process, after agreement had been reached on the fundamental parameters of the bill, and without any public debate. Now that the provisions have been removed, the committees of jurisdiction will have an opportunity to consider the proper application of the compulsory and statutory licensing  provisions of the Copyright Act to Internet and broadband service providers. 
   Given the enormous importance of the Internet for enhancing consumer access to programming, it is essential that Congress give full attention to this issue early next year. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that we take steps to further enhance the range of choices consumers have in the marketplace. 
   I also wanted to take a moment to commend Senator BAUCUS and others for their efforts in securing an agreement to address the problems that small-market and rural areas now face in obtaining satellite broadcasts of their local television stations. By my estimates, the only market in Virginia that will get local-into-local service with the current bill is the metropolitan D.C. area, leaving over 94% of satellite households in my state without this crucial service. All Virginians, however, and, indeed, all Americans, deserve quality local satellite service, and I intend to make this issue a top priority when Congress returns next year.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, as we near the end of this session of Congress, there are some accomplishments we should celebrate and some disappointments we should work to remedy in the next session of the 106th Congress. While there are many items in the appropriations and tax bills that benefit our nation, there are a few I'd like to highlight. This year's final budget package will continue to provide more crime reduction and school safety funding so our children are safer in their neighborhoods and in their schools. It will continue our efforts to reduce class size so our children get more individualized attention from a top-quality teacher. And it will provide what I hope will be the first installment of school modernization funding so that our children's schools are safe and equipped for the future. 
   With the passage of the appropriations and tax measures this session, Congress will uphold its commitment to continue reducing crime on our streets and in our schools. We've come a long way from the original Senate committee bill that would have killed the COPS initiative, which has placed 100,000 new police officers in our communities since 1994. This year's appropriations bill provides enough funding to hire another 50,000 officers over the next few years, and it sets aside $225 million in Department of Justice funding for school safety initiatives. The first obligation of government is to provide for the safety of every man, woman, and child, and I believe our funding levels for COPS and school safety programs live up to that obligation. 
   We will also be living up to the commitment we made last year to hire 100,000 new teachers so our children's class sizes are smaller and their individual time with their teachers is greater. We made a down payment last year and hired 29,000 teachers. This year, we will provide $1.3 billion to states so we can keep those teachers in the classroom and hire even more. But as we all know, school systems can't hire new teachers if they don't have the extra classrooms. So, I'm especially pleased that we have finally recognized the school infrastructure crisis in America. 
   The tax package we will pass today will provide an additional $800 million in zero interest bonds under the Qualified Zone Academy Bond Initiative. These bonds will help our neediest schools renovate buildings that are relics of the past and turn them into schools of the future. It will help them purchase new equipment--from classroom computers to new, safe school buses. It will help them train teachers and develop challenging curricula to raise expectations and achievement scores of our nation's students.  
   The continuation of this school renovation initiative is just one component of the school modernization bill I introduced with many others in July, and I am grateful to so many education, labor, and professional organizations for their unwavering support. I thank my colleagues who co-sponsored the legislation, Rep. Charlie Rangel for his work on similar legislation, and the administration's commitment to ensuring that our schools are safe and modern havens for learning. We're sending the right message to our nation's school boards, teachers, parents, and students: that we see the leaky roofs, that we see the cracked walls, that we see all the trailers--and that we're willing to help. 
   But there remains much unfinished business. Over 14 million children attend schools in need of extensive repair or complete replacement. Twelve million children attend schools with leaky roofs, and 7 million children attend schools with safety code violations. Our schools are on average over forty years old. They're overcrowded, they're under-equipped with technology, and many are unsafe. In Virginia alone, there are over 3,000 trailers being used to hold classes. In short, our national renovation needs total $112 billion and our new construction needs total $73 billion. Given these tremendous needs, I view the $800 million in the this year's tax package as the first installment of the nationwide renovation and modernization of our children's schools. 
   Mr. President, the other major disappointment of this session concerns one of our nation's most important transportation arteries. I am quite dismayed that this Congress has not lived up to its responsibility to fund the replacement of the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. This is the only federally owned bridge in the entire country. It is a major gateway in the Washington metropolitan area, and a critical route for commerce along the entire east coast. We have an obligation to support its replacement. 
   I worked closely with the administration to advance this project, and I was gratified by the fact that funding was among the administration's top priorities during the budget negotiations. Unfortunately, however, Congress declined to provide funding, so we will revisit the issue next year, when construction is scheduled to begin. We have become all too familiar with the devastating effects of traffic jams in this area--on our economy, on our environment, and most importantly, on our quality of life. The unresolved matter of funding for the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Bridge project continues to threaten the region, and I intend to continue the fight next session to be fiscally responsible and responsive to our region's biggest transportation need.

    Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'm submitting a resolution today expressing a sense of the Senate regarding a heinous crime affecting a family in Virginia and a growing problem in this country. With this resolution, I seek to bring to your attention the plight of child abductions by noncustodial parents, and to encourage the United States and Saudi Arabia to immediately locate Nadia Dabbagh and return her safely to her mother. 
   Ms. Maureen Dabbagh of Virginia Beach has not seen or heard from her daughter, Nadia, in 6 years. When Nadia was just 3 years old, she was illegally abducted by her father, Mr. Mohamad Hisham Dabbagh, and the State Department believes they are currently in Saudia Arabia on temporary visas. Throughout this ordeal, Maureen Dabbagh has been aided by many caring people, groups, and government agencies, but despite FBI, State Department, and Interpol efforts, Nadia is still separated from her mother. 
   According to the Department of Justice, 983 children are abducted by noncustodial parents every day. I greatly sympathize with Maureen Dabbagh and with all parents facing similar situations. I believe that we, as Members of Congress and as parents, ought to use all available resources to locate missing and abducted children. I ask that we redouble our efforts to bring Nadia home.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I join many others in this body in expressing my support for miners and for mining communities. In Virginia's Southwest region, mining creates the jobs that provide enough income to lift the next generation, that put the sons and daughters of miners through college, and that gives the region options other than coal. 
   Virginia miners have expressed deep concerns that the broad application of Judge Haden's ruling would result in the devastation of the mining industry in the Southern Appalachian coal fields. The Judge's decision is not limited to the mountain top mining that was the subject of the original suit. It would apply to the use of valley fills from other forms of mining, including underground mining. The practical effect of this ruling is a virtual moratorium on mining in mountainous regions. We need to protect the environment and we also need to protect the livilihood of those hardworking families. I had hoped we could reach a compromise on this issue that would effectively allow us to do both. 
   I have reviewed the Memorandum of Understanding between the federal and state agencies that could be used to mitigate the consequences of valley fills if they were allowed to continue. It was signed by the EPA, Department of the Interior, Army Corps of Engineers, and the State of West Virginia. All the signatories are sworn to protect the nation's water. I am convinced that if the MOU stood, the agencies involved would work diligently to mitigate any negative consequences from mining in the West Virginia coal fields. Nevertheless, it is imperative that we continue to be vigilant on the effects of mining on the environment, and work to minimize its effects. 
   I have also reviewed Judge Haden's ruling and see in that ruling the underlying conflict between what the regulations intend to do, and the actual costs of applying those regulations. It demonstrates once again how essential acting on regulatory reform is going to be in this Congress. It is imperative that we set in place a method of analyzing the true cost of the regulations, before they are put into place. I am certain the agencies involved want to do the right thing, by both miners and the environment. The rules as I read them make that virtually impossible. I am hopeful that this conflict can be resolved as quickly as possible. In the meantime, I intend to support the miners of Southwest Virginia. 
   I must however, voice my strong opposition to the language on hard rock mining that has been added at the last minute to this amendment. My vote on this amendment stems only from my concern for the immediate effect Judge  Haden's ruling would have on the economy of Southwest Virginia. I have opposed and will continue to oppose efforts to delay the review and revision of the nation's hard rock mining standards. My vote in no way supports the inclusion of hard rock provisions in this package. 
   I ask unanimous consent that this statement be placed in the RECORD before the vote on Amendment No. 2780.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be joined by my colleagues, Senators SARBANES and MIKULSKI, to introduce legislation to pay overtime to federal managers and supervisors more equitably. 
   I'm proud of our federal workers. Despite seemingly constant assaults, our nations's civil servants have persevered to provide government that is working better and more efficiently than ever. We've seen a streamlined federal government that's continually asked to improve services to its customers--the American people. But with smaller staffs and the push to increase the federal government's productivity, workloads continue to grow. As federal employees' duties grow, the need to work more overtime hours increases as well. Managers, supervisors and other FLSA-exempt employees within the federal government can receive overtime, but the current overtime cap presents two problems to these employees: they earn less working on overtime than they do for the work they perform during the week and they earn less while working overtime than the employees they supervise. Who then, can blame prospective candidates for supervisory or management positions for declining promotions when remaining in their current, non-supervisory position can mean more money for their families? If the federal government is to continue to recruit and retain a top-notch workforce, then the present overtime cap is one issue that we need to address. 
   Our legislation will ensure that supervisors and managers neither make less working overtime than they would during regular work hours nor make less working overtime than those they supervise. This bill increases the overtime cap from GS-10 step 1 to GS-12 step 1, the first adjustment in the overtime cap since 1966. Our bill doesn't mandate that overtime be paid; overtime pay will be implemented as it is currently, based on personnel decisions made by individual agencies. 
   We should encourage incentives to attract bright and capable workers to join the management ranks of the federal government, and this bill is one such incentive. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure its consideration and favorable recommendation as quickly as possible.

   Mr. ROBB. Madam President, on Friday, November 5, Senator BAUCUS and I introduced the Small Business Tax Reduction Act of 1999. We drafted this legislation to complement Senator KENNEDY's minimum wage amendment, and under the unanimous consent agreement, it was incorporated into that amendment which is now pending. 
   The Small Business Tax Reduction Act of 1999 is targeted to provide tax relief for those employers who will be most affected by the minimum wage increase, even more than the proposal to be offered by the other side of the aisle. 
   Our package adheres to two principles that had to be reconciled: First, that tax relief should be provided to those who need it most; and, second, that any tax relief package be fiscally responsible. 
   To make sure that our package benefited those who need it most, we focused primarily on small businesses, those most likely to experience higher costs as a result of an increased minimum wage. 
   To make sure the package was fiscally responsible, we used true offsets, not the surplus, to pay for it. In this way, we have remained true to both principles: This is a good tax package; it is a responsible tax package. 
   Admittedly, deciding what provisions to include in such a bill required some compromises. In almost all cases, I have sponsored, or cosponsored, legislation that would go beyond the tax relief in many of the areas addressed by our bill. I will continue my efforts to move on these broader provisions. 
   However, our commitment to paying for the tax bill and not either borrowing from our parents by using the Social Security trust fund or borrowing from our children by increasing our debt burden, precluded us from doing more at this time. 
   In some respects, our tax package is similar to the Republican proposal. For example, both packages accelerate the 100-percent deduction for self-employed health insurance; both packages increase section 179 expensing for small businesses; both packages extend the work opportunity tax credit; and both packages raise the business meals deduction from 50 percent to 60 percent. 
   But in other ways, our packages are quite different. For instance, we have included in our amendment some estate tax relief for small family-owned farms and businesses. Inflation has left the current exemption simply insufficient to give adequate relief to farmers and small business owners. This is one of the areas where we clearly need to do more, but some relief is better than none. 
   We have included provisions targeted to geographic areas with the greatest need for economic assistance. The new markets proposal, for example, would reward employers who operate in economically distressed areas where the minimum wage is the most prevalent. 
   There is also a credit that encourages employers to give lower income employees information technology training so we can begin to close the so-called digital divide. I was at an announcement this morning that will also make a major step in that direction. 
   We also expand current empowerment zone credits so more communities and more people are able to take advantage of these credits. The empowerment zone credit provides a dual benefit. It helps those who may not yet be reaping the benefits of our expanding economy, and it helps revitalize our cities which, over the long term, may be our best tool for reducing the pressures that lead to suburban sprawl. 
   Another area we devoted our attention to is retirement security. Increasingly, people are apprehensive about their retirement. Many small businesses are struggling to provide retirement security for their employees. 
   The pension provisions in our bill are designed to address the needs of these small employers who are trying to develop effective retirement plans for their employees. 
   For example, we would allow small businesses to borrow from their plans, just as large businesses can, and we have included Senator BAUCUS' proposal to provide a credit for new small business pension plans. Everyone benefits when small businesses are better able to offer their employees retirement plans. 
   Finally, we need to help our communities meet their increasing demand for new and upgraded schools. Across the Nation, there are pent-up needs for new schools to make room for smaller classes, for schools that have access to the latest technology, for schools that have decent heating and plumbing and leak-proof roofs. 
   To help meet those needs, we have included a provision to help communities modernize their public schools. In this bill, we propose extending the Qualified Zone Academy Bond Program, or QZABs, for an additional year. This program helps with school modernization efforts and deserves to be extended. 
   Again, this effort is important, but we need to do much more. While we could not squeeze more on school construction into this vehicle, I am determined to find one that is large enough to accommodate our Nation's schoolchildren, who, frankly, deserve better than what they have gotten from Congress this year. 
   Let me close by reiterating why we decided to pay for this bill and not just take the money from the surplus. 
   First of all, I believe both sides understand we made a bipartisan commitment to stop dipping into the Social Security surplus to pay for current spending outside Social Security. Honoring this commitment is important both to maintain pressure for fiscal discipline and to prevent further cynicism about the way the Federal Government operates. 
   As for the non-Social Security surplus, we believe our first priority should be paying down the over $5 trillion debt we have accumulated by failing to exercise fiscal discipline in the past. The need to keep up the pressure for fiscal responsibility is clear. 
   Congress has been breaking the spending caps at breakneck speed. CBO recently advised us, not only had we already spent the small surplus expected for fiscal year 2000, we are already $17 billion in the red for the next fiscal year. Until we can agree on a comprehensive package that balances our spending, tax relief, and debt reduction priorities, we should pay for the spending and the tax cutting we propose and not take the easy route of spending the surpluses that may or may not actually materialize. 
   If we do not put the brakes on piecemeal tax cuts now, we could easily face a runaway train of politically popular proposals that are not likely to be in the best long-term interests of the Nation. When we are ready to put everything on the table and consider the various priorities--such as using the surplus to pay down the debt--we can engage in that discussion. Until then, we should focus on achieving the current objective, which is to assist employers, particularly small employers, who may be adversely affected by the minimum wage increase. 
   In short, this tax package accomplishes its purpose of providing relief to those employers who are most likely to have higher costs when the minimum wage increases. It is responsible. It does not squander the surplus we have fought so hard to achieve but maintains it for debt reduction. At the same time, it protects Social Security trust funds from being misallocated to other programs and expenditures. This is a good tax package, and I urge our colleagues to support it. 
   With that, Madam President, I reserve any time remaining and yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I had hoped that this year, we could have a reasonable and orderly appropriations process, where we would make the tough decisions that are required to live within our means. I had hoped that we could prioritize our spending, increasing funding for defense to strengthen our nation's readiness, investing in school improvements, devoting needed funds to science and basic research, enhancing our transportation system, and reducing our seemingly inexhaustible demand for pork-barrel projects. 
   Instead, we are now at the end of the appropriations process and we are facing the prospect of spending even more than we have taken in--despite the fact that revenues exceeded estimates and an on-budget surplus was available to us. At this point we face a Hobson's choice. In order to fulfill a commitment to protect the Social Security surplus that both political parties made to the American people we have to vote for a process that is abhorrent to any concept of responsible budgeting and legislating. In order to fund unwanted and unneeded legislative pork we're taking money from every legitimate program we've already funded--including crucial defense spending and reducing class size. 
   Rather than making the hard choices throughout the process, and foregoing popular parochial spending that is not critical to our nation's needs, we are forced to make an across-the-board cut in order to meet our commitment. This is not the responsible way to govern. In fact, it's indefensible. We haven't done our job, Mr. President. We're playing rhetorical games and posturing artificially in order to keep this little secret from the American people. 
   I will vote for this bill very reluctantly because it's the only measure on the table that meets our commitment. Once the President vetoes this bill, then we can get back to the business of making the hard choices. Cutting spending is never easy or popular, but it is necessary if we are to keep our promises. 
   I oppose spending the Social Security trust funds because I believe that when we voted years ago to take the Social Security trust fund off-budget, we did so in an effort to impose fiscal discipline on ourselves. Although it has taken years to get to a point where we didn't have to rely on Social Security surpluses to pay our bills, we are now at that point, and we've promised the American people that we will refrain from using Social Security and Medicare taxes to fund other government programs. I support the promise because it helps strengthen our spine to cut unnecessary spending. But strengthening Social Security and Medicare for the long term will take more than just placing the trust funds ``off limits.'' 
   Mr. President, we have once again limped pathetically to the end of the appropriations process, past the deadline and over the budget. The mere fact that we have to do an across-the-board cut is a testament to the failure of this budget process. If we have to choose between thoughtful budgeting and honoring a commitment, I will vote to honor the commitment. But that shouldn't be the choice. 
   I will vote for this bill, knowing that it will be vetoed, to send a strong and clear message: government should not spend more than it takes in.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I send to the desk legislation that will permanently extend the research credit and increase the alternative incremental credit 1% per step. It will also expand the credit to companies operating in Puerto Rico. Mr. President, research and experimentation are the foundation of a vibrant economy. While there is some initial cost involved, studies have shown that a permanent extension of the R&E tax credit pays for itself over time due to increased federal revenues generated by a rise in productivity and economic growth. Without a permanent extension of the R&E credit, businesses are less likely to make long term investments in research that is necessary for scientific and technological advancements. Instead, decisions must be made on an annual basis which, over time, have the effect of slowing progress. In order to guarantee that our country remains the leader in cutting edge technology we need to permanently extend the R&E credit. The advantages of increased research and experimentation are simply too overwhelming to ignore. 
   I intended on offering this bill as an amendment in the Finance Committee to the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999, (S. 1792), but I was persuaded by members on both sides of the aisle that amendments in Committee threatened the whole deal. I decided, instead, to address this issue on the Senate floor. I still strongly support the tax extenders bill that was reported out of Committee, but I believe, as I have for some time, that we need to address this one deficiency. Without certainty, our nation's investments in research will suffer. Permanent extension of the R&E tax credit is the only way to provide that certainty. Despite recent setbacks, I will continue to work with all of my colleagues to extend this credit permanently.

The corridor which follows ``Our Nation's River'' includes both the boyhood home and Mt. Vernon estate of our first President, George Washington, significant greenways and parks, and nearby centers of commerce which are vital to the economic vitality of Virginia and the capital region. 
   I congratulate the National Park Service, the Potomac Heritage Partnership, the Northern Virginia Planning District Commission and other advocates of this National Scenic Trail in persevering in their efforts to increase opportunities for enhancing commerce, conservation and cultural initiatives along the Potomac River. I wish them continued success in the years to come.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I fully support a significant increase in defense spending, and I support the core of the defense appropriations bill we're considering today. Indeed, it includes many critical provisions--including pay and benefits changes--that I and my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee worked hard to pass in the defense authorization bill. For that matter, this bill includes many projects important to the Commonwealth of Virginia that were included in the authorization bill. But this is simply not the way we should legislate. Tacking extraneous provisions onto necessary legislation is exactly what fuels the cynicism of the American people. 
   I have regularly supported Congressional increases to the defense budget. But this legislation is a perfect example of what's wrong with the Congress. And it reinforces the need for a line-item veto. The bill contains the usual billions of dollars of congressional spending not requested by the Department of Defense. My colleague from Arizona, Senator MCCAIN, observed earlier this morning that some $6 billion in unrequested pork are part of this bill--perhaps the largest amount of unrequested pork ever. This is money that could have gone toward desperately needed improvements in our national defense, including more training, more spares and ammunition, more maintenance, and better quality of life for our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. 
   But beyond spending on unneeded projects, the bill employs some budget gimmicks that make a mockery of fiscal discipline. The bill designates--arbitrarily--$7.2 billion as emergency spending just to avoid the pain of dealing with the budget caps. I believe we ought to make the tough decisions to keep our spending under control. But if the Congress cannot discipline its spending, it ought to be forthright and acknowledge what it is doing. Avoiding hard choices with smoke and mirrors, however, is not responsible governing. 
   The bill authorizes 15 military construction projects that the Armed Services Committee decided not to authorize in its conference report. The authorization of military construction projects is the responsibility of the Senate Armed Services Committee. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I serve as the Ranking Member on the Readiness Subcommittee, where military construction matters are considered. We have been successful in limiting military construction spending to projects that meet certain strict criteria--including whether the military plans to build these facilities at some point in their future years defense plan. The appropriations bill added 15 projects, of which at least half were not even on the Pentagon's books for eventual construction. Only the Armed Services Committee, with its longer-term, policy-oriented focus, can avoid this kind of spending that does little to improve the capabilities of our armed forces. 
   For these reasons, I will reluctantly vote against this bill knowing it will pass overwhelmingly. Since I know the bill will pass, my vote will not jeopardize national security. It will not preclude the Department of Defense from spending the additional funds included in the bill to provide more pay and benefits, more spare parts, increased training, and better maintenance. As I said before, I have fought long and hard to see those increases in the defense authorization bill. And if my protest vote would determine the outcome, I would act differently. But voting against this bill is one of the few means I have available to register my protest forcefully. I simply cannot acquiesce to a process which misdirects funds crucial to our national security to those who are seemingly more interested in their political security. No one should doubt my commitment to a strong national defense, but no one should doubt my commitment to fiscal responsibility as well. We cannot continue to squander so much of our scarce resources on unnecessary pet projects when our needs for improved readiness are so great. And as I stated when I voted against the pork-laden Kosovo supplemental earlier this year, just because we have troops in harm's way does not give us an excuse to go on a spending binge. 
   Hope springs eternal. Hopefully next year we can stem the pork, avoid the gimmicks, and respect long-standing committee jurisdictions.

   Mr. ROBB. I thank the Chair and thank the distinguished Senator from Delaware. 
   Mr. President, on balance I personally believe the arguments for ratification of the CTBT are far more persuasive than the arguments against ratification. But I recognize the legitimacy of some of the arguments made against ratification. I recognize the credibility of some of those making those arguments. I respect the sincerity of colleagues who believe that ratification would be a mistake. 
   Having said that, I will not repeat all of the reasons that I would vote for ratification, if we are, indeed, forced to go ahead with the vote scheduled for later this afternoon. I would simply appeal to colleagues who oppose ratification not to let their feelings--their personal feelings--toward our Commander in Chief or their desires for a decisive political victory to weaken the role of the U.S. leadership in the international community or encourage additional testing by nations that might not otherwise do so, and thus make the world less secure and more dangerous. 
   On the politics, opponents of ratification at this time have already won. No one contends that 67 Senators are prepared to vote for ratification. No one is suggesting that this President or any future President is going to bring the treaty up for ratification again unless and until they have those 67 votes. 
   I happen to be one of the 10 Senators who engaged in an extended discussion of this treaty with the President and his national security team last Tuesday evening. Many others have been actively engaged in the debate from the very beginning. As I recall, there were six Republicans and four Democrats; and we were equally divided on the question of ratification. 
   I wish to commend all of the Senators involved in that process and throughout, but particularly those Republicans who stated during that meeting, very forcefully, why they oppose the treaty and why a ratification vote would fail but nonetheless were willing to help find a way to pull us back from the brink--for the good of the country and in the interest of a safer world. 
   In this instance, the President has acknowledged that if we go ahead with the vote, he will lose. But he is asking us not to defeat our own national interest as well by voting down this treaty. 
   The Senate, in pressing its case, however, for an up-or-down vote at this point, in my judgment, injures the  country's ability to lead and strikes a blow at American leadership around the world. Far more is at stake than defeating the policy and agenda of this particular President. Make no mistake, allies, friends, and enemies would view the defeat of the CTBT as a green light for more nuclear testing and further development of nuclear weapons, either strategic or tactical. 
   Defeat of the treaty will not be perceived as a signal of restraint. Just the opposite. Delay of consideration of the matter at least gives us the opportunity to address continuing concerns about monitoring and verification, as best we can, while delivering the message to other nations that we should proceed with yellow-light caution in regard to testing and development of their programs. 
   I have carefully reviewed the intelligence community's analysis of our CTBT monitoring capabilities--including the 1997 national intelligence estimate and the updating of that document--and admittedly, there are no absolutes when it comes to our ability to detect and identify some tests at low yields with high confidence. 
   The more critical issue at hand, however, is the significance of possible evasion and the rationale that underlies such action and what it means for the inherent advantage we currently maintain with our nuclear arsenal. 
   I urge our colleagues to weigh very carefully the views of the intelligence community. The intelligence community believes we can effectively monitor the CTBT. We approved the Chemical Weapons Convention aware of the fact that denial and deception techniques would prevent us from confirming absolutely that production, development, and stockpiling were not going on. But as with the CTBT, we were able to approach the subject of monitoring with a high degree of confidence that signatories were not violating the CWC. As a result, implementation of that pact is contributing to our national security. 
   Senate hearings this past week suggest an emerging story at Novaya Zemlya but not outright violations of CTBT provisions. Transparency is lacking there, and perhaps a delay in consideration of the treaty will aid our efforts to sort out ongoing developments in this particular location. But defeating the CTBT on the concerns we have about this one site would represent a failure to understand what is in our broad national interest. Creating a normative global standard not to test will do enormous good and will act as a powerful force to stop would-be cheaters in their tracks. 
   It is reasonably clear to our intelligence community that Russia and perhaps others would not necessarily make gains in their thermonuclear weapons program through an evasive low-yield testing program without risking exposure of such tests to the international community. Given that reality, it simply begs the question: Under what substantive rationale would Russia or another country proceed in light of the outcry and condemnation that would surely follow? 
   I believe this matter is ripe for an agreement we can negotiate among ourselves in the Senate, through unanimous consent, that delays CTBT consideration until the next Congress. I am prepared to support CTBT regardless of the political affiliation of the Commander in Chief. But due to the untenable circumstances in which we now find ourselves, we should honor the request of this Commander in Chief and delay a vote. 
   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from Iowa. Senator HARKIN and I have offered a sense of the Senate amendment relating to school construction, as Senator HARKIN has just explained. The amendment is not unlike the amendment Senators LAUTENBERG, HARKIN, and I offered to the Budget Resolution earlier this year. That amendment assumed that given the levels in the budget resolution, Congress would enact ``legislation to allow States and school districts to issue at least $24.8 billion worth of zero-interest bonds to rebuild and modernize our nation's schools, and to provide Federal income tax credits to the purchasers of those bonds in lieu of interest payments.'' The actual cost as it was scored was referred to by the Senator from Iowa. That amendment was accepted and put the entire Senate on record as supporting the concept of providing federal assistance in the area of school construction and renovation. 
   Understanding that Rule 16 prevents us from doing anything of significance at this time with respect to school construction, Senator HARKIN and I in just a moment will withdraw our amendment. But every day that passes, this Congress misses an opportunity to help our States and localities fix the leaky roofs, get rid of all the trailers, and install the wiring needed to bring technology to all of our children. These are real problems--problems that our nation's mayors, school boards, and families simply need some help in addressing. 
   While school infrastructure improvement is typically a local responsibility, it is now a national need. Our schools, as the Senator from Iowa has indicated, are over 40 years old, on average; our school-aged population is at record levels; and our States and localities can't keep up, despite their surpluses. 
   Abstract talk about State surpluses provides little solace to our nation's teachers and students who are forced to deal with wholly inadequate conditions. In Alabama, the roof of an elementary school collapsed. Fortunately, it occurred just after the children had left for the day. In Chicago, teachers place cheesecloth over air vents to filter out lead-based paint flecks. In Maine, teachers have to turn out the lights when it rains because their electrical wiring is exposed under their leaky roofs. 
   Mr. President, we are missing an opportunity to help our States and localities with a pressing need. 
   I will continue to work for and press forward on this issue because I think it's an area where the Federal Government can be extremely constructive. When our children are asked about ``Bleak House,'' they should refer to a novel by Dickens and not the place where they go to school. 
   In my own State of Virginia, there are over 3,000 trailers being used to educate students. And there are over $4 billion worth of unbudgeted, unmet needs for our schools. This is a problem that is not going to go away, and it's a problem that our nation's schools need our help to solve. And I regret that Rule 16 precludes us from considering legislation which would reaffirm the commitment that we made earlier this year. 
   I thank the distinguished Senator from Iowa for his continued work on the subject of school construction, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I want to discuss my support for an amendment Senator MURRAY and I offered which puts the entire Senate on record in favor of removing one of the greatest obstacles to quality care that women face in our insurance system today: inadequate access to obstetricians and gynecologists. 
   I understand that our provision will be included in the manager's amendment to this bill, and I want to thank the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, HHS and Education, Senator SPECTER, for his work both in including our amendment in his bill, as well as his leadership on this issue. He has been one of the most outspoken members in this body in favor of helping women have better access to women's health services. 
   We know today that for many women, their OB/GYN is the only physician they see regularly. While they have a special focus on women's reproductive health, obstetricians and gynecologists provide a full range of preventative health services to women, and many women consider their OB/GYN to be their primary care physician. 
   Unfortunately, some insurers have failed to recognize the ways which women access health care services. Some managed care companies require a woman to first visit a primary care doctor before she is granted permission to see an obstetrician or gynecologist. Others will allow a woman to obtain treatment directly from her OB/GYN, but then prohibit her from obtaining any follow-up care that her OB/GYN recommends without first visiting a primary care physician who serves as a ``gatekeeper''. 
   This isn't just cumbersome for women, it's bad for their health. According to a survey by the Commonwealth Fund, women who regularly see an OB/GYN are more likely to have had a complete physical exam and other important preventative services like mammograms, cholesterol tests and Pap smears. At a time when we need to direct our health care dollars more toward prevention, allowing insurers to  restrict access to the health professionals most likely to offer women preventative care only increases the possibility that greater complications--and greater expenditures--will arise down the road. We ought to grant women the right to access medical care from obstetricians and gynecologists without any interference from remote insurance company representatives. 
   Earlier this year, Senator MURRAY and I offered an amendment which would do just that. Unfortunately, a number of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle objected to some of the specific wording in our bill, and the amendment was defeated. 
   Since that vote, we have reworked our amendment to address these concerns. We had hoped to offer an amendment which was identical to language included in a patient protection bill crafted by a Republican Congressman, Charlie Norwood, and that was approved by the House earlier today by an overwhelming vote of 275-151. 
   Yet despite this consensus on this issue by Republicans and Democrats on the House side, my colleagues from the other side of the aisle threatened to challenge our amendment under Senate Rule 16. Senator MURRAY and I are cognizant of the problem this created, and we've opted to offer a Sense of the Senate resolution in place of the amendment we had hoped to see approved. 
   This Sense of the Senate, which has been accepted by both sides, puts the entire Senate on record in favor of legislation which requires health plans to provide women with direct access to obstetrical and gynecological services, without first having to obtain a referral from a primary care provider or their health plan. It is a strong step forward in our efforts to improve women's access to the type of health care they need. 
   To my Republican colleagues who objected, I say: your party joined with Democrats to hammer out this compromise language on the House side. Now that the Senate is on record as well, let's get behind this same amendment at the earliest available opportunity in the Senate and pass a provision which will help all women in this country get better care.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from Arizona for accepting three out of four of the amendments I have proposed. I had hoped we might someday find a way he could accept the fourth. I am very much aware of the fact, however, that he and some others are not inclined to do that. I have, therefore, sent to the desk an amendment, just read by the clerk in its entirety, which simply strikes the section of the amendment that deals with the number of additional slots at National Airport. 
   In this particular case, this amendment offered by the Senator from Washington, while a step in the right direction from the original bill language which would have required that an additional 48 slots be forced on the Washington National Airport Authority, nonetheless cuts that in half and it gets halfway to the objective I hope we can ultimately achieve in this particular case. 
   The amendment would reduce to zero the number of changes in the slots that are currently in existence at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. 
   My primary objection to this section is that it breaks a commitment to the citizens of this region, by injecting the Federal Government back into the management of our local airports. 
   Before I discuss this issue in detail, I wish to make clear that I fully support nearly all of the underlying legislation and have for some period of time. Congress ought to approve a multiyear FAA reauthorization bill that boosts our investment in aviation infrastructure and keeps our economy going strong. There is no question about that. I have supported that from the very beginning, and I thank the managers for their efforts in this particular regard. 
   I have long believed that funding for transportation, particularly mass transportation, is one of the best investments our Government can make. For our aviation system, in particular, these investments are critical. 
   As Secretary of Transportation Rodney Slater noted:  
   ..... aviation will be for America in the 21st Century what the Interstate Highway System has been for America in this century.  
   It has been suggested that as part of our preparation for the next century of aviation to promote competition and protect consumers, we ought to impose additional flights on the communities surrounding National Airport. 
   It has been argued that the high density rule, which limits the number of slots or flights at National, is a restriction on our free market and hurts consumers. I do not dispute the fact 
   that flight limits at National restrict free market. I believe, however, that the proponents of additional flights give an inaccurate picture of the supposed benefits of forcing flights on National Airport. 
   Before I go on to discuss the impact of additional flights on communities in Northern Virginia, I would like to deflate the idea that more flights will necessarily be a big winner for consumers. 
   Based on the number of GAO reports we have had on this subject, some of our colleagues may think slot controls are somehow the primary cause of consumer woes. When we look at the facts, however, this simply is not the case. 
   I understand reports by the GAO and by the National Research Council argue that airfares at slot-controlled airports are higher than average. However, the existence of higher-than-average fares does not tell us how slot controls may contribute to high fares at a specific airport. Many other factors, such as dominance of a given market by a particular carrier, or the leasing terms for gates, play a role in determining price. Also, simply noting the higher-than-average fares do not tell us whether slot controls are really a significant problem for the Nation.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from Arizona, with whom I agree on so many issues but disagree on this particular question. First of all, I will let the Senator know that I am not in any way affiliated or associated with an effort to get people to write the Senator from Arizona or anybody else. There may be others with good intentions. 
   But I submit to my friend from Arizona that the letter he just read makes the point we are trying to make; that is, the letter--which I haven't seen yet--talks about it was worse back in the early 1960s when we had a slots agreement which limited the number of planes. We had a decrease in noise because of the aircraft noise levels in the stage 3 aircraft. All of this is consistent with what has happened. Why most of the individuals who live in these areas want to continue to have the protections that were afforded to them by the 1986 agreement is precisely what is included in the letter my friend from Arizona just read. 
   I ask my friend from Arizona to react to my reaction to a letter previously unseen, but it seems to me to be directly on point and makes the point as to why we are pursuing an attempt to keep my friend from Arizona from breaking that agreement.

<TEXT>
   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I ask my friend from Arizona if 
   he would address the other two principal concerns that have been raised--delays and the breaking of a deal. He has in part addressed the breaking of a deal. He says the deal in effect was political. Indeed, there are some political implications in almost anything that is struck, particularly as it affects jurisdictions differently in this body, as the Senator well knows. But it was a deal entered into by the executive branch, Congress on both sides, the governments of the local jurisdictions involved, and all of the local communities. That was the deal that was entered into. Now we are concerned about the impact of breaking the deal and the impact of additional delays. 
   As I mentioned just a few minutes ago, I myself was caught in delays that were exacerbated by the fact that we had some planes waiting to take off ``right now.'' That is without any additional flight authorization during the time periods that are going to be sought. 
   Second, certainly the Senator from Illinois talked about the fact that the mayor of Chicago came here for a specific reception that was in his honor to benefit Chicago and was inconvenienced to the point that he didn't arrive until after the reception was over and he turned right around. I almost did that yesterday on another flight. 
   But the point is, more flights mean more delays and mean breaking the deal that the Congress, the executive  branch, and the local governments made with the people. 
   Will the distinguished Senator from Arizona address those two elements of my concern at this point? I agree certainly on the stage 3 engines and the continued noise reduction. 
   Mr. President, before he answers the question, let me thank him for his accommodation in many areas. I am not in any way diminishing the number of changes the Senator from Arizona has made to try to address legitimate concerns that he recognized could be addressed. And this is a less bad bill than we had earlier with respect to this particular component of it. But we are still not where the deal said we ought to be. We are still not where we can represent to the people that we are not going to be creating additional delays in an obviously constricted area.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank my senior colleague. He and I were away from the Senate floor for the signing of the defense authorization bill, which was the work of my colleague from Virginia and the committee he chairs. I thank him for his kind comments. 
   Very simply, this amendment is about a 1986 agreement, on which the senior Senator from Virginia and I both worked, as well as many others. It was an agreement between the Federal Government and the local governments and the State governments involved to make sure that we addressed the serious concerns that were then holding up any progress on improvements on National Airport. 
   At that time, we recognized that the two airports, Dulles Airport and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, work in tandem; they should be viewed as a single airport. Together, they serve consumers and the Washington region well. It was agreed that a local authority would best manage the airports, just as all other airports across the nation. 
   In this particular case, if we were to approve an increase in flights at National Airport, we would be breaking that deal. 
   We would also increase the delay and increase the disruption to local communities. Most importantly, we would be going back on a deal--we would be reneging on a deal that was made so the Federal Government would stay out of the business of trying to micromanage the only two airports in the area. 
   I hope the Members will respect the agreement that this body, the Federal Government, and the State governments and the local governments entered into in 1986, and move to strike the additional slots that are in an otherwise meritorious bill. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. I thank the Chair. 
   Madam President, first, I join my distinguished colleague from Connecticut in his eloquent address and the passion he brings to that subject. I share that passion. 
   I certainly join many of our colleagues who have spoken about the need to adequately fund our public education system, but I want to respond to an argument the distinguished majority leader made on Friday regarding the condition of our Nation's schools. 
   The Senator from Mississippi indicated it is not the Federal Government's job to fix leaky roofs. He indicated it is not the responsibility of the Federal Government to build local schools. He indicated that every State has a budget surplus so the Federal Government should not get involved. 
   As a former Governor who was able to pump over $1 billion of additional money into public education without a tax increase, I might ordinarily agree with that premise, but there are times which call for extraordinary partnerships among localities, States, and the Federal Government. I believe we are experiencing one of those times. 
   We have three phenomena that are colliding to put the greatest level of stress on our educational infrastructure that we have seen since the 1950s. Our school facilities across the Nation are over 40 years old on average, our school-age population is skyrocketing, and our States and localities simply do not have the resources to do what needs to be done despite their surpluses. 
   To say that providing school construction funding is not a Federal responsibility is easy. It is an easy way to sit on our hands and do nothing to help children who wade through puddles to get to class, to do nothing to help children who suffer in up to 100-degree temperatures in buildings with no air conditioning, to do nothing to help the countless mayors across this country who stated they desperately need our help. 
   In Virginia alone, despite our Commonwealth surplus and plans to invest more money in school infrastructure, we still face a $4 billion shortfall in school construction and repair needs. I have heard from superintendents, local officials, State legislators, parents, and, most important, students who have all asked for Federal help in this area. 
   For those colleagues who fear Federal intrusion in the area of education, I simply say, if Federal officials want to help local officials pay for school buildings and repairs, things we all acknowledge we need urgently, how do we encroach on local school control of education? Localities have asked for our help, and it is help we can provide  without telling them how to run their schools. I believe this is actually one of the least intrusive things that we can do to help from the Federal level. 
   Providing school infrastructure assistance is not intended to be a panacea for all the challenges we face with respect to increasing academic achievement, but it is certainly a critical need. 
   Under the leadership of a Republican President, Dwight Eisenhower, our predecessors in Congress summoned the political will to fund a massive national infrastructure initiative. 
   We did help build roads. We did help build schools. We did it because our States and localities needed our help. We did it because our population was booming. And we did it to try to ensure that the United States would have the infrastructure it needed to be economically sound and competitive. It is my hope that we can summon that will once again. 
   With that, Madam President, in full support of the statement made by our distinguished Democratic leader and my colleagues on this side of the aisle, and in opposition to the proposal from the other side of the aisle upon which we will vote momentarily, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, thank you. I thank my distinguished senior colleague from Virginia. 
   Mr. President, I wanted to take a minute or two to discuss the item that my senior Senator has just alluded to, which, in my judgment, is critical. 
   I begin by saying that it is an area of research and development that is of enormous importance to every American who lives by an airport, every American who is concerned with our Nation's defense, and every American who flies on a regular basis, as all of our colleagues do. That issue is aeronautics research and development. 
   Since the time of the Wright Brothers, American's commitment to aeronautics research and development has brought extraordinary returns on our Nation's military superiority and the rise in affordable passenger air travel. Both can be attributed directly to our investments in aeronautical research. 
   In addition, aerospace products are America's top manufactured export commodity and are the top contributors to the positive side of the U.S. balance of trade. 
   Air traffic is predicted to triple over the next 20 years. As our skies become more crowded and our airports noisier, aeronautics research continues to grow in importance. If we are to improve the safety, efficiency, and performance of our air travel system, we are going to need to develop new aeronautics, new aeronautics concepts, and new aeronautics designs and technologies that can better respond to the growing demands of our aeronautics infrastructure. 
   In addition, America's aerospace industry is facing a fierce challenge from the European consortium, Airbus 
   which has now captured over 50 percent of the world market that American airplane products and producers once dominated. 
   At a time when there is a clear need for new investments in this field and near unanimous support in our country for new investments in basic research, it is troubling that our commitment to aeronautics research has been waning. Funding for aeronautics research was cut by $151 million from 1998 to 1999, and this year the President proposed to cut it by an additional $150 million. That is a 30-percent reduction in just 2 years. 
   Even more worrisome is the fact that the House cut an additional $1 billion out of NASA's budget, placing the future of NASA aeronautics research and critical facilities such as NASA's Langley Research Center in great danger. For more than 80 years, the Langley Research Center in Hampton, VA, has been at the forefront of aeronautics research and pioneered innovations that are present in every plane in the air today, innovations that have affected and are important to every plane that flies today. Its facilities are one of a kind. If this center were closed, the United States would lose its most valuable resource for improving aircraft safety and performance. 
   Senator WARNER and I have worked closely with Senators BOND and MIKULSKI over the past few months to strengthen our commitment to aeronautics research. I am grateful to both of them that they have restored many of the severe cuts that were proposed by the House. I am still disappointed, however, that more money has not been set aside for aeronautics research. We have reached an understanding with the chairman and ranking member that further increases will be considered in conference. 
   With that, I am very pleased to join the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia in offering this amendment. It is my understanding it has been agreed to on both sides. I note that the distinguished chairman of the committee,  the senior Senator from Alaska, probably spends more time in the air than any other Senator in this body. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'd like to take just a few moments to express my concern about the funding of the Round II Empowerment Zones. I recognize how difficult your job is to balance all the priorities within the VA-HUD appropriations bill, but I want to make the managers of this legislation aware of how important Empowerment Zones are to communities nationwide. While I will continue to seek a bill that will enact full funding of the Round II Empowerment Zones, we need to make sure there are adequate funds to continue the economic revitalization efforts this year. 
   Quite simply, the Round II Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities represent a commitment made by the Congress in the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act which approved a second round of competition for 20 new empowerment zone designations. Congress did not follow through with the grant money that complement the tax incentives that have already been approved. Without this funding, they will fall short of their goals, particularly in their ability to leverage funds. 
   The Empowerment Zone program is of special importance to me because of my support of the efforts of Virginia's Norfolk-Portsmouth Empowerment Zone. Norfolk-Portsmouth took the first step to reclaim their community when they won an Enterprise Community designation during Round I competition. When Congress approved the Round II competition two years ago, Norfolk-Portsmouth won an ``upgrade'' to full Empowerment Zone status. This means that Norfolk-Portsmouth has more resources to leverage millions in public and private sector investments. Continued funding means a more well-prepared workforce to complement the tax credits already approved to attract employers. And that's just scratching the surface of Norfolk-Portsmouth's potential. From May 1995 to June 1999, 60 percent of those completing training are employed, with another 16 percent involved in additional training. Other cities have shown results just as impressive within its first year: for example, in the Columbus Empowerment Zone in Ohio, they have so far created or retained 700 jobs in a zone that had a poverty rate of about 46 percent. Working with over 15 businesses in Columbus, they have already secured about $700 million in private sector commitments. 
   This type of investment in Norfolk-Portsmouth and other cities is an example of public-private partnerships at their very finest. Empowerment Zones work because people in the community--local government, the private sector and civic organizations work together to create a vision for their community and a strategic plan to achieve it. This kind of collaboration, designed and created for the people of the community by the people of the community, use public, private and non-profit funds to create economic and community revitalization. 
   Without question, our nation is experiencing good economic times. But if we are to include those who are striving mightily to also participate in our economic prosperity, the time to do so is now. One way we can do this is by supporting the work of the Round II designees.  
   With some additional appropriation in the VA-HUD bill, the Round II designees will have just enough to continue the work they're doing. The Administration is fully behind this effort and I understand they will be working on this issue with the Chair and Ranking Member. 
   I hope the money allotted to Round II Empowerment Zones in the Housing and Urban Development budget and approved by the President will be restored.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, the Conference Report on the National Defense Authorization Act before us today makes a healthy increase of over 8 billion dollars to the President's request. This reflects concerns by the Congress that readiness has eroded to a point where our military is having to take significant risks in its day-to-day operations. 
   Many of our colleagues are aware that we have sized our armed forces to engage not only in two major theater wars that break out nearly simultaneously, but also to handle the Bosnias, Kosovos and other smaller-scale contingencies that challenge our interests overseas. For the first time since we adopted our 2-war strategy not long after the end of the Cold War, the commanders in charge of our warfighting forces are warning the Congress--again for the first time in the post Cold War era--that the risks in our ability to fight in that second theater have gone from moderate to high. 
   This risk is not merely some esoteric metric that only some military strategist can comprehend. Rather, the dangers are that we will lose an unacceptable number of men and women in battle, that we will lose excessive territory in the initial phases of battle, and that battles will last much longer than they would with a more capable force. 
   This is a serious warning--not one we should take lightly. The military challenges to the U.S. in the decades ahead are ill-defined and very difficult to predict. While the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs has signaled a significant drawdown in Bosnia in the near future, while our commitment of troops to Kosovo is relatively small compared to those of our European allies, and while signs of progress on the Korean peninsula are making news this week, we also see the tragedy in East Timor, renewed Chinese threats against Taiwan, and rebel action in Russia, all of which  remind us of the extraordinary instabilities that we will face in the next century. 
   Whether we will see more or less conflict is unclear, but the growing competition for fixed resources in impoverished regions where populations grow unabated suggests that civil and interstate strife will only worsen. These strains will also spawn terrorists--including those embittered by their harsh circumstances and in particular those who feel they have nothing to lose. 
   Decisive action, as we saw by the U.S. and others in Bosnia and Kosovo, will, we hope, deter future conflicts and gross human rights violations. But the speed with which the tragedy in East Timor developed on the heels of NATO's victory in Kosovo tempers such optimism. Ultimately, a combination of resolute determination to defeat aggression, strong support for democracies, and effective means for improving the quality of life for all is the best path to ensure we don't have to send our young men and women into harm's way repeatedly in the twenty first century. 
   This conference report goes a long way toward ensuring we will be ready in the years to come. It invests in new weapons to the tune of three billion dollars over the FY 2000 Administration's request, and looks to the distant future with an increase for research and development of almost two billion dollars over the request. Readiness is increased by about 1.5 billion dollars. More importantly, this bill focusses on our greatest asset--our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines--that ultimately make the defining difference between victory and defeat. With a significant pay raise and retirement reforms, the bill meets head on a continuing crisis in recruiting and retention. I was particularly pleased that the Senate and conferees agreed to provisions I had included in an earlier bill, S. 4, to focus pay increases on specialties--such as aviators--where retention and recruiting problems are particularly severe. 
   At a time when we are watching every defense dollar so closely, I am disappointed that we did not do much more in this bill to rid the Department of Defense of so many wasteful expenditures. Across the nation, we are now obligating in excess of 3 billion dollars a year to pay for utilities, to maintain buildings and roadways, and to operate equipment on bases that are unneeded by our military. We are likewise spending billions on weapons and research programs that the Department of Defense did not request but was forced to pursue by the Congress. We watch the Department waste hundreds of millions of dollars due to misguided acquisition policies, poor oversight of inventories, and service duplication of effort. These are difficult problems to fix--due either to political inertia or sheer organizational complexity, but nonetheless we should and can do much more. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I want to comment briefly on this bill's attempt to reorganize the entire Department of Energy. While PRC espionage has severely damaging consequences for long-term U.S. security, rushing to restructure a department with such vital responsibilities is not, in my view, prudent oversight on our part. In short, had the changes included here been instituted two decades ago, it is unclear that these changes would have had any impact on the PRC's ability to garner intelligence on our nuclear weapons. Indeed, one might even make the case that the bill will worsen this situation. I intend to track this matter closely in the years ahead and to support necessary modications of this language as the reorganization proceeds. 
   Mr. President, on balance, this is a very good bill that does much to fix military readiness and other problems. I support its passage and urge my colleagues to support it as well.

    Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor an outstanding public servant. Recently, Vola Lawson, the city manager of the City of Alexandria, announced her retirement. During her fourteen years as city manager, Ms. Lawson provided the City with solid leadership and opened the doors of City Hall to all Alexandrians. I'm proud to add my name to the long list of those who are praising Vola Lawson. Her distinguished career offers the ideal model for public officials, and inspires confidence in our public institutions. I ask that yesterday's article from The Washington Post on Vola Lawson's retirement be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, this amendment would strike section 329, the legislative rider which attempts to bypass the administrative and legislative process. Section 329 would overturn recent Federal court decisions which merely required the Forest Service to collect the data the law requires for making forest management decisions like cutting timber. It would apply to all activities that are affecting wildlife on all 450 million acres of public lands in the United States. The Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior said:  
   It is unnecessary, confusing, difficult to interpret, and wasteful. If enacted, it will likely result in additional and costly delays, conflicts, and lawsuits, with no clear benefit to the public or the health of public lands.  
   It is opposed by the Forest Service. It is opposed by BLM. The Forest Service can comply and is complying with the court rulings. They are gathering the information now. 
   Last night, my colleagues complained that the New York Times and the Washington Post did not understand the Northwest. Here is what the Seattle Times has to say about the decisions, in an editorial opposing section 329 with the headline, ``No More Outlaw Logging.''  
   It falls to the Forest Service to balance scientific and commercial interests ..... keeping the Forest Service honest and forcing it to commit resources to make the plan work.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I did not ask that the reading of the amendment be dispensed with because it was so short and to the point. 
   The amendment simply strikes section 329 from the Interior appropriations bill we are now considering. Section 329 is a rider that is intended to overturn recent decisions handed down by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals and the Federal District Court in Washington State dealing with national forests. 
   These courts were asked to examine the activities of the Forest Service and BLM to determine whether, in allowing certain timber sales from public lands, they complied with their own regulations and resource management plans that were developed under the National Forest Management Act. The courts found that they did not comply and disallowed the sales until they did. 
   The forest plans guide the Federal decision-making, so that one activity in the national forests such as logging does not occur in detriment to other uses. These plans apply only to national forest land--Federal land--not private land. This is land held in trust for all people and all uses, and the Forest Service and BLM are charged with ensuring that decisions involving these public treasures are made wisely. 
   We in Congress continually insist that Federal regulators operate using good science. But there is no good science without good data. 
   Section 329, which my amendment would strike, would relieve the Forest Service from the obligation to develop any new data. And we cannot have good decisions without good science and good data. 
   After decades of managing our forests primarily for the production of logs, we are now managing forests for a variety of uses. But we cannot do that without baseline data on threatened and endangered species. 
   We are changing the way we manage forests and the way we look at forest uses. 
   Preserving habitat and providing recreation also have become increasingly important. 
   These changes are not easy. Proponents of this section, that my amendment would strike, fear that the requirements that we make sound decisions based on sound science and good data will lead to less logging. This is simply not true. Managing forests for their various uses, which include harvesting timber, requires an understanding of the entire system, including the plants, animals, even the pests that sometimes inhibit or damage growth. 
   To improve forest management, in December of 1997 the Chief of the Forest Service appointed an independent committee of scientists to advise him on ways to bring better science into forest planning. The panel's findings strongly recommended the use of scientific evidence in managing forests. The panel repeatedly advised that monitoring is critical to sustaining forest health. 
   In the cases that section 329 seeks to overturn, the courts simply require the Federal Government to undertake the monitoring that their own forest plans and rules require. Supporters of section 329 argue that the courts in these two cases have deviated from rulings by other courts where challenged timber sales were allowed to proceed. In other cases--and here is the important difference--the courts had enough data to rule in favor of the Forest Service. There was evidence to show that while the data gathered may not have been exhaustive, at least it was adequate. 
   In the most recent cases that section 329 seeks to overturn, the courts, after noting deference to the Forest Service, recognized the job simply had not been done adequately or at all. The courts didn't rule that each and every species had to be monitored. They simply said to the Federal Government: You have to follow your own rules. You have to gather the data in which a sound decision can be based. 
   For example, the Eleventh Circuit decision delayed seven timber sales in the southern Appalachian forest in Georgia until the Forest Service completed an evaluation of the impact the sales would have on the forest environment. 
   The purpose of the information gathering is to ensure that the Forest Service makes an informed decision before it allows the removal of expanses of  timber that could be crucial to survival of endangered or threatened species or that could affect overall forest health. 
   In a similar action, a Federal judge in Washington State has delayed over 25 timber sales until the Forest Service completes the survey work required by the Northwest Forest Plan. 
   In the case involving the southern Appalachian forest, the Forest Service failed to develop the required baseline data on a number of species in both the endangered and the threatened category and in a category known as ``indicator'' species. For example, the Forest Service had no population inventory information at all for 32 of 37 species in one category. The court of appeals ruled that in proffering the tracts of timber for sale, the Forest Service failed to comply with its own regulations. The court didn't just determine that the data was inadequate; the court determined that the data was nonexistent. 
   Under most forest plans, the Forest Service develops lists of indicator species to provide a basis for monitoring. These lists have species such as deer, bear, bass, and trout. These species are representative of all the other species in the forest. The list is short and it is designed to be easy to monitor. 
   In the Eleventh Circuit case, the Forest Service developed such a list but then failed to gather any information on most of the species on the list. In the Northwest, the court found that the Forest Service sidestepped similar requirements of the forest plan. 
   The Northwest Forest Plan is the legal and scientific framework that allows timber sales to go forward in the old growth forests of the Northwest. As our colleagues will recall, lawsuits 
   in the early 1990s brought logging in that region to a complete halt. The Northwest Forest Plan, which was the result of lengthy and often painful negotiations, allowed timber sales to go forward, provided that there was an adequate basis to make an informed decision. The agreement provides the best hope of sustained yield and multiple use. This latest ruling by the Western District Court of Washington is a reminder that the agreement is the operating plan for the forests, and that guidance memorandum cannot exempt the Forest Service from its duty. This ruling will delay timber sales but only until the Forest Service completes the work laid out in the plan. 
   Of the 80 surveys in question, all but 13 have protocols developed that will allow survey work to move forward. These decisions are not a result of overstepping by the courts. They are a result of the courts examining the rules the Forest Service laid out for itself and merely requiring the Forest Service to operate by the rules it adopted. 
   Let me quote from the Eleventh Circuit decision:  
   While the Forest Service's interpretation of its Forest Plan should receive great deference from reviewing courts, courts must overturn agency actions which do not scrupulously follow the regulations and procedures promulgated by the agency itself.  
   I suggest to our colleagues who support section 329 that we should not as a result of one court decision turn our backs on the necessity of developing good information on plant and animal populations in our national forests. This data is the basis of the good science we keep talking about. It will add to our knowledge. In fact, most forest districts already have a substantial amount of data and continue to develop more. The majority of sales are moving forward under the existing rules and plans. It would be a mistake to let delays in a few timber sales negate all of the important work that is now being done. Section 329 effectively stops data gathering for the coming fiscal year. 
   In addition, section 329 establishes a new standard to be applied by the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management for determining when to approve timber sales. However, according to the agencies that are required to implement the change, rather than speed timber sales up, it would slow them down. To understand the effect of this change, we ought to hear from those who will be responsible for implementing the change. 
   In a statement issued jointly by the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior they say:  
   [I]f this rider were adopted, tens of thousands of individual management activities and planning efforts would be subject to a new legal standard. 
   This would have the unintended effect of increasing project costs and increasing delays in order to conduct time-consuming reviews of administrative records to document compliance with the new standard. 
   Increased litigation and delay could also be expected as plaintiffs seek to define the new standard in court. 
   In an effort to free up a limited number of timber sales in Georgia and the Pacific Northwest, the Senate would unnecessarily override the Federal Court ruling, agency regulations, and resource management plans requiring the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to obtain and use current and appropriate information for wildlife and other resources before conducting planning and management activities. 
   Moreover, the bill language applies not just to timber sales decisions and required surveys in the forests of the Southeast and Pacific Northwest, but to all activities for which authorization is required on all lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management and the Forest Service. 
   As such, it could result in far-reaching, unintended negative consequences.  
   In short, the Secretaries who would be required to implement the new standard write that:  
   Section 329 is unnecessary, confusing, difficult to interpret, and wasteful. 
   If enacted, it will likely result in costly delays, conflicts, and lawsuits with no clear benefit to the public or the health of public lands.  
   The Forest Service, which is charged with implementing the court's ruling, is acting. In the southern Appalachian forests, they are modifying the forest plan and have developed guidance to help meet the court's directives. In the Northwest, they are completing a supplemental environmental impact statement that will respond to the court's concerns. 
   Incidentally, the SEIS was in process before the court ruled because the Forest Service had already recognized that the plan needed adjusting, and the plan has mechanisms in it to accommodate change. 
   The Forest Service does not believe this rider is necessary in order to approve timber sales. In fact, they believe it will interfere with timber sales. 
   I want to emphasize an additional problem with section 329. It does not just apply to timber sales. Again, according to the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior:  
   The provision which applies for one year would apply to all of the nearly 450 million acres of land managed by the two agencies and would apply to all management activities undertaken by the bureaus, not just timber sales.  
   We should not be putting a rider on an appropriations bill to lower the standard for government agencies in the hope that it might pass unnoticed. One of the reasons people get cynical about their government is that it does not always do what it says it will do. In this case, we would lower the bar for agencies that do not want the bar lowered. The Forest Service believes that it can do the job right. We would do a disservice to this body and to the people who expect us to protect our national treasure by not demanding that Federal agencies make informed decisions with adequate data. 
   What section 329 proposes to do is lower the standard the first time that agency fails to meet it. I believe this is the wrong approach. I believe we should strike section 329 from this appropriations bill and that the Federal Government should comply with the laws we have passed and the rules it has established and the plans it has adopted. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, first let me address my colleague and friend from Idaho, who is one of the four Senators who have spoken against this amendment on the floor and tell him first of all I appreciate the sincerity of his remarks and the concern he shows, and his colleagues have shown, for those who face economic hardship because of any decision that might be impacted by the Federal Government. I would have to say in particular, with respect to the distinguished Senator from Oregon talking about some of the people in communities which he has visited, the same phenomena has occurred to all of us at one time or another. All of us truly feel the intense pain that those families suffer. In many cases that suffering comes to them because of activities that have been taken in terms of Federal trade policy, sometimes because of innovation in various manufacturing techniques, modernization of equipment--lots of reasons that long and established communities are adversely affected. Any of us who do not relate to that and have a sense of compassion--we may disagree on a particular item at a particular time, about what is the best way to approach a particular challenge that we face, but I don't think any of us lack compassion for those families or want to be in a position where we are doing anything that hurts more than helps. In this particular instance, I would have to say one of the comments made by my friend from Oregon was ``let science decide.'' That is really what is at issue here. 
   We see the issue differently. But in this particular case, science has determined at this point, and the board of scientists the distinguished Senator referred to has suggested, that there are means of establishing the health of the forest that will require indicator species measurement. None of the decisions require counting all species, every single species. In fact, the only species I am aware of that is measured in terms of every single member of the species is the Condor count. That is a truly endangered species. I know of no other. There may be. 
   In any event, we are talking about doing something. The reason these cases were decided the way they were and other cases were decided differently is because the rules that had been established, the plan that had been established by the Forest Service, and that they had agreed to follow, wasn't followed. 
   The Northwest forest plan came about in very large part because of the timber wars, the very difficult situation that every Member of the Northwest delegation of this body remembers. 
   As a result of the compromise that was entered into, opened up some logging--I recognize the 80-percent factor the Senator from Idaho and others have used--at least some logging was conducted and the gridlock that had existed prior to that time did not continue. They have been operating under this provision, the Northwest Forest Plan since that time. 
   I have heard repeated references to costs that are clearly beyond anything anyone associated with the Forest Service, BLM, the Interior Department, or the Agriculture Department would consider possible, or can even understand frankly, because we have claims of $5 billion to $9 billion, and no one in the administration is talking about anything that would cost anything in that range. 
   The essence of the court decisions were on a very limited scope. The court said, if you tell us that this is the plan you want to put into effect, that you agree to put into effect, then the least you ought to do is try to follow that plan. 
   The problem in the Eleventh Circuit, if my memory serves me correctly, was with 32 of the 37 species, absolutely nothing was done. The court is in the position of saying, we will give great deference to the Forest Service, to other administrative agencies, to regulators, to anyone else who is involved, but you cannot simply do nothing and expect us to simply say it is OK not to pay attention to your own rules and regulations. 
   That is what both of the cases are about, and that is what distinguishes the cases which trouble the Senators from the Northwest from the other cases. 
   In the other cases, the judge was able to rule in such a way that the logging could continue, whatever land disturbing operations could continue. We are not talking about a situation where every single species, some of which none of us could identify if we were given a chart of all the species involved because they are so rare, had to be counted. That is what indicator species are for, to simply be able to track in some limited way some species as an indication of how all the species are faring under various changes that might affect those particular forests or those particular areas. That is really all we are saying. 
   In this particular case, the Forest Service, BLM, the Interior Department, the Department of Agriculture, and the heads of those agencies have said that section 329 is likely to cost a great deal more money, is not likely to do exactly what they purport to address but have exactly the opposite effect. 
   In this particular case, the Agriculture Department, the Interior Department, the BLM, and the Forest Service make it very clear that what is proposed is more likely to be counterproductive, but that is beside the point. They are acknowledging that a standard has been recognized by the Eleventh Circuit case and that they did not meet that standard. They believe they should be held to the standard, and that is what they are prepared to do. That is what adaptive management practice is all about. This is not the kind of absolute foreclosure that my friends on the other side have represented it as. 
   Plans are underway right now to address the challenges that were put to the management agencies by both decisions. I submit the concern for the Ninth Circuit case is considerably greater on the part of my friends from the northwestern part of the United States than the Eleventh Circuit.  
   Nonetheless, the decisions simply said to the Federal agency involved: If you say these are the rules that you are going to follow and you agree these are the rules that should be followed, and the scientific community has said this is the way we can make the rational assessments and achieve the kind of balance that we are looking for, then you ought to do that. 
   I share the frustration. There is always an enormous frustration factor when you are dealing with a situation that seems to be beyond the control of those who are most affected by it. I am particularly sensitive to the State of Idaho where so much of 
   the land is owned by the Federal Government, owned by the people of the United States, and that makes this forum for decisionmaking so much more important, in many cases, than it is for other States where the percentage of our total land, the percentage of our total economic activity is less affected by decisions that are made right in this particular Chamber. 
   The bottom line again is simply if the agency agrees to a particular course of action, if the action is rational, and reflects the fact we are not using the forest just as a place where logging can be carried out, but where recreational and other environmental elements are valued, then that one activity must be balanced against the others. 
   In this particular case, a rational approach has been devised. It is flexible. It is being addressed at this particular moment. An additional environmental impact statement is in the process of preparation. 
   The only real change that will come about from where the law is now, the only real change is whether or not the public ought to have an opportunity to participate and comment on the process. That is the only real change that would be brought about by this particular rider, other than attempting to legislate on an appropriations bill, thus bypassing the administration, regardless of what party is in power, and bypassing the legislative process, bypassing the authorizing committee to which these arguments could be addressed. 
   I am not at all insensitive to the concerns that have been raised by my colleagues who represent this particular area. Indeed, I want to work with them and the Forest Service, the BLM, the Interior Department, and the Agriculture Department to see if we cannot find ways to address the specific problems that those communities, particularly those that have no other opportunity for economic activity, are faced with at this particular time. 
   The way to do it is not to put an environmental rider on an Interior appropriations bill which bypasses the Federal administrative process, bypasses the legislative process, and simply attempts to write into law something that has not been approved by either section and which is, indeed, actively opposed by representatives for both. 
   Mr. President, I see no one else who I believe wishes to address this particular matter. We will have an opportunity to provide closing arguments tomorrow before this is taken up. 
   I do not believe we have asked for the yeas and nays. I request the yeas and nays.

   Mr. ROBB. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished ranking member of the Finance Committee, the Senator from New York, and mentor to us all. His presence, at the end of this Congress, will be missed in ways I do not think any of us fully appreciate. 
   First of all, I want to fully agree with the comments made by the Senator from Montana and the Senator from Massachusetts. I will try not to repeat those comments. My particular frustration in dealing with the bill before us today is that we are considering this huge tax cut, one which would normally be designed to stimulate the economy, and yet no economist I am aware of has suggested that such a stimulus is needed at this particular moment. 
   In fact, what is truly needed is not being done. This bill does nothing to address the two most pressing structural systemic problems, Social Security and Medicare. Instead of trying to bring about some responsible changes to the Social Security system and the Medicare system, we are taking a projected surplus we hope will occur, but may or may not occur, and spend it in a way that provides a stimulus to those who least need a stimulus at this particular time. Indeed, it is very hard to find someone who represents the group who will be most benefited by this bill who is actually asking at this time that we provide them with a huge tax cut or an economic stimulus. We just do not need it. 
   If we are going to enact a tax cut, it is my view that it should be in some targeted areas we know we are going to have to take care of anyhow. For example, we should have a permanent extension of the R&D tax credit, not cutting it back. Instead, we go through the same charade we go through each year, which makes it difficult for those who must make decisions about investing in research and development to make the kinds of decisions they need to make. The bill also fails to target tax credits for investment in information technology training, which is so clearly the cutting edge of our economy today. We are not making those investments in this bill. 
   What we are doing is making a huge tax cut available to those who are disproportionately in the middle- and upper-income brackets in this country, and not providing the basic investment in infrastructure. 
   My personal preference is to not have a tax bill at this point. If we cannot do better than the one we have, I would rather have nothing, notwithstanding some of the good things upon which both sides agree, and simply begin to pay down the debt. We are in such a hurry, however, to deliver the good news that we are going to give money back to you that ought to be yours in the first place, even if we are only going to give you $4 billion of it back in the year 2000. Even though it is only $4 billion, those who support this bill are attempting to take credit for full $792 billion, the lion's share of which will not be until the end of the next decade. This bill is going to lock in statutorily those changes which will make it very difficult for those who serve in succeeding Congresses and succeeding administrations to make the corrections they may well be called upon to make. 
   I am certain we will hear a scream from those on the other side of the aisle if we even think about what could be scored in any way, shape, or form as a tax increase, even though it would only be correcting a tax cut that most people who have common sense and have some sense of fiscal responsibility view as a mistake today. 
   I will not extend the debate. I will only observe that even though I disagreed with the original proposal, there were a small number from this side of the aisle who were willing to go along in the hope that some sort of compromise could be reached. And we took a bad bill and made it worse, and drove off the Democrats who were prepared to participate in a bipartisan solution. 
   So it does go to what the Senator from Massachusetts just suggested. It is a political bill. It is regrettable because we have an opportunity, for the first time in a long time, to do something really fiscally responsible in terms of the kinds of obligations that we have in this body and the other body, in concert with the White House at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue. 
   I regret we are in a situation that we cannot act in a fiscally responsible manner and address the true pressing needs, such as Social Security and Medicare, instead of what we are doing. 
   I know the time has expired. 
   With that, I urge my colleagues to oppose this particular measure, and to work eventually with those on the other side of the aisle to come up with a constructive, fiscally responsible measure to meet our legitimate needs. 
   With that, I thank the distinguished Senator from New York, as well as praise, although I am not in agreement with, the distinguished chairman of the committee, the Senator from Delaware. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, in discussions with the manager of the bill, the majority leader, and the Democratic leader, and understanding that the matter that I was going to raise would require fairly extensive debate and then a vote, thus delaying the departure of Members for the August recess--and remembering how fond Members have been of not bothering Members of this body when they were the last obstacle between leaving on the August recess and making one last vote--I have agreed with the distinguished manager of the bill, the Senator from Washington, not to offer the amendment. He has agreed to recognize me first when the bill is next before the Senate. 
   With that in mind, and knowing that many of our colleagues are, as I speak, heading for the airports, I will not offer the amendment I had planned to offer this evening. I will offer it when we next take up the Interior appropriations bill.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I like to take a few moments to express my concern about funding for the Maggie Walker National Historic Site in Richmond. While construction funding was included in the budget submitted by the National Park Service, funding was not included in the Interior appropriations bill before us today. I want to make sure that the managers of this legislation are aware of just how important the Maggie Walker project is to both the Richmond community and to our nation. I would also like to urge them to provide this funding. 
   Maggie Walker, who lived in Richmond from her birth in 1867 until her death in 1934, epitomized triumph in the face of adversity. In an era that glorified male achievement, and in a part of the nation that did not encourage African American leadership, she stood out as a very successful member of society despite the fact that she was both female and African American. 
   Ms. Walker both succeeded within the system and pushed for change. She established a newspaper. She organized a student strike to protest unequal graduation ceremonies. She founded a bank and was the first woman in the nation to serve as president of a bank. She was also actively involved in founding the Richmond chapter of the NAACP, and throughout her life, Maggie Walker championed humanitarian causes. 
   The Maggie Walker National Historic Site in Richmond is comprised of the Walker home, and several adjacent support buildings. The Walker residence itself was built in 1883 and purchased by the Walker family in 1904. The residence served as Ms. Walker's home untile the year of her death. The Walker family sold the home to the National Park Service in 1979. Furnishings throughout the home are original family pieces. 
   The National Park Service budget request is necessary to literally protect the site from destruction, as well as for safety and historic preservation. Funding will support a fire suppression system for the main Walker home, and will restore the exteriors of the adjacent support buildings. These structures will be used for interpretive and education facilities, and for museum storage.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, the senior Senator from Virginia, Senator WARNER, and I would like to bring to the Managers' attention a serious concern involving the City of Virginia Beach and the Minerals Management Service of the Department of Interior. In my view, the city has been unfairly treated, and I hope we can rectify this matter during conference negotiations on the Interior Appropriations Bill.

   Mr. ROBB. That's right. More important, we believe that not charging the city would have been the best policy decision. First, the sand paid for by the city protected federal land. MMS guidelines state that ``when OCS sand is used for protection of Federally-owned land (e.g. for military bases, national parks, and refuges), a fee would not be assessed.'' That is the case in this instance. 
   Sandbridge beach is crucial to protecting the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge, which is federally owned. The fragile beach acts as a barrier island as the fresh water/brackish environment is three feet lower than the ocean adjacent to Sandbridge. If this beach is not maintained, an inlet could form, changing the ecology to a salt water estuary causing great harm to the Refuge and also disrupting one of the potable water sources for the City of Chesapeake. Additionally, the project is directly adjacent to the Dam Neck Fleet Combat Training Center. The beach at this Center was recently renourished with an 850,000 cubic year nourishment project. Sandbridge acts as a feeder beach for the Dam Neck area and also provides protection to the flank of the training Center. In short, the City of Virginia Beach used its own funds to protect federal property. Compensation is only fair. 
   I'd like to add that fair compensation is something the City of Virginia Beach had assumed in good faith would be forthcoming. The City acted in an emergency to protect the beach. This beach is a Congressionally-authorized project and is being constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers led the city to believe that it would be compensated. In fact, the Corps has already used approximately 2 million of its federal dollars to design the project, is acting as construction manager, and considered this renourishment to be the first phase of this project authorized by Congress in the 1992 Water Resources Development Act. 
   In addition, the City of Virginia Beach was assessed a free by the MMS for mining the sand used to construct the federal project at Sandbridge solely because the City, not the federal government, fronted the cost of the construction.

   Mr. ROBB. My colleague is correct. But I wish to stress that this case was not a profit-seeking endeavor, but an emergency situation to replace sand on a federally-authorized beach that was washed away during a severe storm.

   Mr. ROBB. The City of Virginia Beach was assessed a fee of $0.18 per cubic yard, and they were forced to enter into a lease agreement with MMS before being allowed to obtain critical sand for the emergency beach erosion project. The money paid in MMS fees, which totaled $198,000, would have allowed the City to place an additional 40,000 cubic yards of sand on this badly eroded beach. 
   In conclusion, we hope our colleagues agree that the MMS should have utilized their option to waive the fee for sand replenishment in this emergency situation, and as a result, the City should be reimbursed for protection Sandbridge Beach. Not only did the MMS assess a fee on a federally-authorized project which protects federal land, but they took advantage of the City during an emergency situation. Under the time constraints the City had no other alternative to find sand elsewhere, and was forced to pay the fee. It is for these reasons that my colleague and I believe that the MMS has an obligation to reimburse the City of Virginia Beach for this incorrectly assessed fee.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator ROCKEFELLER, in introducing the New Markets Tax Credit Act, innovative legislation that will benefit both rural and urban America. 
   As its name suggests, the New Markets bill is designed to create new markets within our nation for investment, for job growth, and for renewal. While most of the nation experiences record economic growth, there are some places that have been left behind. Too many communities in both rural and urban America haven't been able to share the wealth, and without willing investors, that wealth may never come. Capitalism cannot flourish where there is no capital. This legislation we're introducing today addresses the need for investment in all our communities, and I believe the tax credits contained in this bill provide a way for America to lift as it climbs. 
   Under this bill, tax credits would be allocated to Community Development Entities located within the neighborhoods and rural areas where help is needed. Those who invest in these Community Development organizations would receive tax benefits, and the funds they invested would be used by the organizations to invest in local businesses, provide start-up capital, or make low interest loans. The investment decisions would be made at the local level by those who best know the community, would attract private enterprise to create economic growth, and would use federal tax credits to achieve these objectives. This local, federal, and private sector partnership holds the key to improving communities across this nation. 
   The New Markets Initiative can use both the business incubator and community action models that have proven so successful in many communities. An example of such success can be found at People, Incorporated in Southwest Virginia, a community action agency that promotes economic growth by leveraging funds and lending expertise to new or expanding businesses. 
   This legislation, along with the Enterprise Zone bill I recently introduced, gives lcoal communities the tools they need to spur economic growth where they live. Attracting investments to the neediest communities will pay dividends, not just in economic terms, but in quality of life terms as well. Prospering communities can provide quality education, improved transportation and better police protection. And improving communities can provide a draw for those who would otherwise be tempted to move out to the suburbs, thereby reducing the pressures that have created suburban sprawl and increasing commutes and diminishing open spaces. 
   Mr. President, I hope we can move this legislation quickly.

    Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, today I rise to honor Mr. William M. Dempsey who will retire from the U.S. Marshals Service on August 28, 1999. He has served as a Public Affairs Specialist with the Marshals Service for 23 years. 
   Mr. Dempsey has more than four and a half decades of experience in public affairs positions with various civilian, government and military organizations. For twenty years, from 1955-1975, he served with the U.S. Air Force in several positions. During the period 1959-1961 he served as a Public Information Officer with the U.S. Taiwan Defense Command. He later served a tour of duty in South Vietnam as Director of Information for all U.S. rescue and recovery activities. From 1968-1972 he served on the staff of the Secretary of the Air Force. 
   In late 1976, Mr. Dempsey joined the U.S. Marshals Service as a Public Affairs Specialist. In that capacity, he implemented a public affairs strategy for the agency, advised senior officials on public information aspects of major operational matters, and was frequently the agency's spokesman to the media. His extensive experience with national, regional, and local media organizations has benefitted the Marshals Service and the American public for more than two decades. 
   Mr. Dempsey graduated from St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1954 with a bachelor's degree in Political Science. He also has completed graduate level study in Public Relations/Communications at Boston University. He resides in Fairfax, Virginia, near the Arlington headquarters of the U.S. Marshals Service. 
   I am honoring Mr. Dempsey on the Senate floor today as a way of thanking him for his service to the law enforcement community, the public affairs community, and our nation.

    Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Robert Tobias, a man who has shown untiring commitment to the concerns of Federal employees. Recently I had the opportunity to attend one of the receptions in his honor hosted by the many Federal employees he has represented and led so effectively. 
   Mr. Tobias, who is retiring after four terms as president of the National Treasury Employees Union, NTEU, has proven his dedication to the fair treatment, professional development and quality of life for Federal workers time and time again. During his 31 years of service, the organization has grown to the point that it now represents over 155,000 men and women who serve our Federal Government. For the past 16 years, Mr. Tobias led the NTEU, spearheading initiatives to ensure fair workplace policies for Federal workers and pursuing effective labor-management policies for more efficient service from Federal agencies. But perhaps most importantly, he's championed family friendly policies to help our outstanding Federal workers continue to meet demands and increase productivity. These innovations include implementing alternative work schedules and negotiating child care facilities for busy Federal families. 
   Because of his outstanding reputation, he's won many awards and appointments, most notably his appointment to the National Partnership Council and the Commission to Restructure the IRS among them. Under his leadership, he's ensured that Federal employees are included in the many decisions to help Federal agencies run more efficiently and that they are publicly recognized for all the hard work they perform. 
   Robert Tobias leaves an indelible mark on the Federal workplace by the hard work he has done on behalf of NTEU--indeed, the nation--and we are indebted to him for his service. I wish him continued success as he moves on to teaching and writing, knowing we can still rely on his voice and experience when it comes to the critical needs of Federal employees.

    Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today important legislation that will help low-income rural and urban areas nationwide reinvigorate their communities. 
   The Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities Act will fully fund the Round II Enterprise Zones authorized by Congress in 1997. The Enterprise Zones/Enterprise Community (EZ/ECs) concept combines tax credits and social service grants to promote long-term economic revitalization. The most important aspect of Enterprise Zones are their inclusive approach--by design--so local government, the private sector and non-profit and civic groups together create a vision and a plan to implement that vision, with the federal government playing a supportive role rather than the lead role. 
   I'm sure many Senators can point with pride to the successes within their own states, but I'd like to take a moment to talk about the Norfolk-Portsmouth Enterprise Zone (EZ) in my state of Virginia. The Norfolk-Portsmouth EZ won its new designation in 1997. One of the many services Norfolk-Portsmouth provides through Norfolk Works, Inc. the entity implementing the many activities of the EZ, are GED classes and job training and apprenticeship programs. There's even a Multi-media Training Course, which includes an 15-week internship at a media company. Norfolk Works also recruits and screen applicants for jobs. And they don't do this alone: Norfolk Works coordinates with many agencies, organizations and businesses to help the residents within the Norfolk-Portsmouth Zone. Already, the Norfolk Works has produced impressive results--from May 1995 to June 1999, 60 percent of those completing training are employed with another 16% involved in additional training. 
   The success of the Norfolk-Portsmouth Enterprise Zone is just one example of the promise and results of Enterprise Zones. But unlike Round I EZ/ECs, Round II EZ/ECs did not receive the Social Service Block Grant (SSBG) that provides resources for social services such as job training and child care which complements the tax incentives and bonding authority already approved. 
   Communities competed for these designations with the understanding that Congress would give them the full funding to implement their vision. We have a responsibility to fulfill our obligations to these communities, that worked very hard to win the resources to make their vision a reality. 
   I look forward to working with our colleagues to fulfill this promise.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, despite the opportunities we have had in this bill and in the Finance Committee to address the $112 billion school repair needs in this country, this tax bill is simply inadequate in terms of infrastructure assistance for our Nation's schools. 
   We know 14 million children attend schools in need of extensive repair or complete replacement. We know we need to build 2,400 new schools by 2003 to accommodate record school enrollments. We know we need to equip our schools with modern technology and the infrastructure necessary to support that technology. We know all these things. Yet we have reported a tax bill that only helps build and renovate 200 schools. We cannot starve our schools of resources and then criticize them when they are overcrowded or dilapidated. 
   On behalf of Senators LAUTENBERG, CONRAD, HARKIN, and WELLSTONE, I move to recommit the bill to the Committee on Finance, with instructions to report back to the Senate within 3 days with an amendment reducing or deferring by $5.7 billion over the next 10 years certain new tax rates in the bill that benefit those who least need relief.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, this amendment simply delays the effective date of the tax cut that is proposed. There are many who believe that a tax cut of this magnitude at this time would be ludicrous. But that is not the issue. The issue is whether or not we ought to go ahead with a tax cut notwithstanding the fact that we have not protected Social Security and Medicare. 
   Most of the people who have spoken so far have talked about their concern for doing just that. The lockbox provisions were proposing to do just that. 
   If you want to save Social Security and Medicare, this is an incentive. It will delay the implementation of the act, but it will not negate the effectiveness of the act. 
   I ask that our colleagues vote to support this particular amendment, save the one-half of 1 percent of the total which would be expended this year, and not lock in cuts that would cost $792 billion, which would be almost impossible to reverse should that prove to be the case.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, first of all let me thank my distinguished colleague from New Mexico for his continued leadership on virtually every aspect of education and our public responsibility in that particular area. I am pleased to join him on this amendment, and would say that I agree completely with my colleague from New Mexico about the need to make critical investments in our future. Not only does this tax bill fail to ensure the solvency of Social Security and Medicare, it provides an inadequate level of investment in education. 
   My own State of Virginia has long been proud of its history and support of education. You may recall it was a Virginian who is widely acknowledged as ``the father of free public schools in America.'' Thomas Jefferson's vision to provide a free public education to all citizens was designed to preserve a fledgling democracy. But at the dawn of a new millennium, a strong and vibrant system of public education has many other benefits as well. 
   Education breeds opportunity. And it is opportunity that knows no class, no gender, no race, no income level, no street address. Because when we invest in education, we invest in our people, we invest in the economic strength of our communities, and we invest in the international competitiveness of our Nation. 
   That is why I have always believed that all three levels of Government--local, state, and federal--should work together in the area of education. That is why I believe that the Federal Government can be a constructive partner in education. And that's why I believe this tax bill falls short of our responsibility to our nation's children and to our nation's future competitiveness. The stakes for our country, and all who live here, couldn't be greater. 
   Despite these stakes, the tax bill we debate today still falls short in its investment in education. In addition to the concerns expressed by my friend from New Mexico, I am particularly concerned about the inadequate level of school construction assistance provided in this bill. 
   Mr. President, we know that 14 million children attend schools in need of extensive repair or, in some cases, complete replacement. We know that 7 million attend schools with safety code violations. And we know there are thousands and thousands of trailers in use because of school overcrowding--over 3,000 in Virginia alone. Loudon County, Virginia, Mr. President will need to build 22 new schools to accommodate its enormous growth in student population. My home county of Fairfax, VA has capital needs of $1.2 billion over the next ten years. 
   But it isn't just a Virginia phenomenon; it's a national crisis. 
   And we have known about this crisis since 1995, when the GAO informed us that our national school repair needs total some $112 billion. We have known that we need to build and repair over 6,000 schools across the Nation. And yet we are considering a bill today which builds and renovates only 200 schools. 
   Mr. President, later in our debate, I will offer a motion to recommit the tax bill to the Finance Committee to force us to take another look at our priorities. I have recently introduced legislation which combines various bipartisan school construction proposals, and which I hope brings us one step closer to the compromise I know we can reach on this issue. I look forward to that debate, but for now I will simply say that Senator BINGAMAN is right: we need to pay more than lip service to our most critical societal investment--education. I thank the chair and I yield back any time remaining to the Senator from New Mexico.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this particular amendment with my long-time friend and colleague from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, and others who join us. Both Senator GRAHAM and I served as Governors before coming to this body, and our views on fiscal matters are frequently very much in sync as they are on the amendment we offer this evening. Having served as executive officers of our States, we share a somewhat unique perspective, and it is from that particular unique perspective that we offer this amendment. 
   The amendment simply states that if it is the will of a majority of the Members of this body to enact the tax cut before us, let's at least accept responsibility for strengthening Social Security and Medicare first. In short, let's get our priorities straight. 
   We all understand the allure of tax cuts. I do not know many Americans who would not like to have a few extra dollars to spend on something, and I do not know many Americans who truly enjoy writing a check to the IRS. Most of us work hard to minimize legally what we have to pay to Uncle Sam to run our Government, and most of us can find areas where we would like to see Government spending cut or eliminated altogether. Sure, we like and, indeed, expect many of the services and protections Government offers, but we do not like to have to pay for them. 
   To enact a tax cut of this magnitude at this time when the economy is not in need of an economic stimulus, when  we have not fixed Social Security, when we have not fixed Medicare, when we backload all of the tough decisions future Congresses will have to make to pay for the cuts, when we frontload only the politically popular promise of more than we are actually delivering, when we know that discretionary spending assumptions are unrealistic and unattainable, when we are already breaking the spending caps we have pledged to adhere to in the Balanced Budget Act we passed just 2 years ago, when we know defense spending is going to have to increase well beyond the current baseline, when we know that correcting a course of action will be far more difficult than anything we are bent on doing with this bill, Mr. President, I submit that to pass this bill at this time without this amendment would be ludicrous. It would be fiscally irresponsible in the extreme. It would be as fiscally irresponsible as anything Congress has contemplated during the 11 years I have served in this body, and we are doing it all in the face of a certain Presidential veto. Is it any wonder people lose faith in their Government? 
   Enacting massive tax cuts today before addressing the obligations we know we have tomorrow is reckless. Those who propose this approach are, in effect, buying political benefits by using our children's credit cards. We curry favor today and leave the bill for others to pay. A surplus is what is left over after we have met our obligations, and we will not know what our obligations are until we reform Social Security and Medicare. 
   I am pleased to offer this amendment with my distinguished colleague from Florida and many others who are acting as cosponsors. I say in the spirit of the amendment that we all have enormous respect for the chairman of the committee and the bipartisan effort that has preceded this particular point in the debate. But we are simply--I am simply unwilling--we are simply unwilling to accept the fact that we should move forward with the tax cuts before the surplus upon which those tax cuts are premised has actually materialized. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague from Florida. 
   Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank you, and I thank the distinguished Senator from Tennessee for his comments. I think he is absolutely correct in that there is much that we agree upon. I would like to commend him for his effort to reach the bipartisan consensus that is going to be required if we are going to solve either challenge that we are discussing this evening. 
   Social Security will not be saved without a bipartisan effort, and it is going to require the hard, politically risky work that the Senator from Tennessee just alluded to. The same thing is true with saving Medicare. Those are not easy decisions. That is one of the principal reasons that we are suggesting we ought to address those tough questions first. 
   Let me suggest I understand in terms of the remarks made by the distinguished Senator from Tennessee that taking on something that is not on the table is effective. But we are not really defending all of the President's plan in this particular instance. We are using a couple of numbers that happen to coincide with the President's. But ours is much simpler and much more specific. We are talking about simply postponing this tax cut. 
   The Senator from Tennessee made the point that it might be difficult to actually achieve whatever is necessary for some actuary to come to the conclusion that we had in effect saved Social Security or that we had saved Medicare. I would not contest that assertion by the Senator from Tennessee. 
   But we are not saying you can never have a tax cut. We are saying only that we will not have this tax cut, this tax cut that we believe at this time is excessive. It may be that a time will come when tax cuts, particularly targeted tax cuts, are appropriate. I suggest to my friend from Tennessee that while the time may be difficult to envision in terms of major tax cuts, it seems to me a time that does not cry out for tax cuts is a time when the economy is not in need of the economic stimulus that would come with a tax cut. 
   The one thing that the Fed seems to suggest to us is that a tax cut could overheat the economy and would have consequences that we are trying to avoid at this particular time. But the bottom line is this: We are not suggesting anything but, hold up. We are saying in effect, What is the hurry? There is no compelling urgency to cut taxes, particularly when we are talking about a tax cut of this magnitude that can be addressed next year, or the year after, or whenever we find that we can afford to make that kind of a tax cut after meeting our obligations, such as protecting Social Security and Medicare. 
   That is all we are saying. We are only suggesting that, because of the magnitude of this particular bill, we ought to suspend this particular tax cut until we have achieved those objectives. I suggest that is a relatively modest restraint on our activities, but it is a fiscally responsible approach to take. 
   I have to tell the distinguished Senator from Tennessee that there are many on this side of the aisle at least who are not all that enamored with some of the suggestions that our brethren have made with respect to tax cuts at this time, and indeed we voted for the Democratic alternative only because it would substitute for the bill that is on the floor today. 
   But we are not against tax cuts altogether for all time. Indeed, there are some areas where we should provide cuts--the extending, for instance, of the R&D tax credits and others that we know we are going to do anyhow--it is something that would provide a sense of realism and would allow some certainty in terms of planning for those companies that are doing the cutting edge work, that make our economy strong, and that make us a leader in the global economy. 
   But we are just saying this tax cut is so big and so difficult to justify that we ought to at least hold up until we have, again to quote the distinguished Senator, ``done the hard, politically risky work'' to protect Social Security and Medicare. 
   Again, I commend the Senator because he is willing to engage. 
   He is willing to roll up his sleeves and engage on a bipartisan basis in trying to make those tough decisions. I wish we could find more on both sides of the aisle who were willing to roll up their sleeves and work on these decisions. 
   The distinguished Senator from Florida and I are saying, let's simply not make this tax cut effective until we have solved those problems facing both Medicare and Social Security. I agree with the Senator from Tennessee, we are not solving these problems just by saving some of the surplus generated by Social Security. That does not bring about the systematic change we are going to need to have if we are going to  solve the long-term solvency question with respect to Social Security. We are not doing that at this point with respect to Medicare. To that extent, I agree with the Senator. 
   We have the tougher decisions to make. We are saying let's not take advantage of a projected future surplus since that would, indeed, make all of the other decisions more difficult. 
   Another point where I differ with the Senator from Tennessee, he says it is always easy to come back and, in effect, reverse the decisions; if we cut taxes too deeply, we can turn around and raise taxes. With all due deference and respect, raising taxes is not easy to do. There are very few in this body on either side of the aisle who like to be tagged with either authoring or voting for a tax increase. That is the problem with tax cuts of this magnitude, particularly when they would be so difficult to reverse, and we splurge without making the tough decisions first. In the meantime the current surplus can be used for constructive, long-term debt reduction. 
   Lastly, I have been concerned about the focus on publicly held debt as opposed to the total debt. We used to be very much concerned about the total debt. I have told my friends from the White House and others who have focused on this, I think what we are doing to reduce the public debt is a good thing. However, the plan promises too much. We are really not reducing the total obligation we have simply by making the IOU a statutory obligation instead of having it part of the publicly held dealt. Reducing the publicly held debt does good things. It makes our financial future better. It means we don't have to go out and borrow on the markets. However, the same obligations we have with respect to Social Security now, with respect to Medicare now, are still there. We are simply transferring them to a different form so our financial picture looks a little better. 
   I suggest again this is a limited amendment. It is simply saying, what is the hurry with respect to huge tax cuts that may or may not materialize? Let's do the responsible thing. Let's do that hard, politically risky work of extending Social Security and Medicare solvency first. Then we can address the question of whether or not we provide additional tax cuts and what form and what magnitude they might take. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I want to respond briefly, if I can, to our distinguished chairman and friend from Delaware with respect to the question of timing. 
   The distinguished Senator from Delaware mentioned the fact that the tax cut this year is only $4 billion out of some $792 billion that is proposed in the bill. 
   That is about one-half of 1 percent of the total promise that would be incorporated in statutory law if, for any reason, we are wrong. That is what we would have to find a way to change, against all of the forces that are normally arrayed against any tax increase. 
   Why squander the opportunity to pay down or to begin to pay down the national debt--not just the publicly held debt, the national debt, the national unified debt? This is the first time in well over a generation there has been any opportunity to pay down the debt. 
   We are not proposing additional spending. I have not checked with my distinguished colleague from Florida for certain, but if the distinguished chairman of the committee were willing to accept an amendment that would suggest some similar restraint on spending which would correspond to the restraint we are attempting to place on cutting taxes, I will suggest to the chairman of the committee, I think we could find a place to make a deal. 
   We are not suggesting profligate spending. We are suggesting that we put that money in the bank, that we pay down the national debt. 
   Again, in terms of urgency, one-half of 1 percent is what we would do right now. But the other 99.5 percent would be locked into the law that we would be obligated, by law, to change at the appropriate time. That is the reason we are suggesting that we do not want to rush to judgment with respect to what many of us believe would simply not be a responsible tax cut of this magnitude at this time. 
   With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
   Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.

   Mr. ROBB. I will just respond to one point made by my distinguished friend from Tennessee. He was suggesting, correctly, that if we were to reserve, save, all of the surplus, we would not save Social Security and we would not save Medicare. We do not disagree. We concede. 
   Indeed, I suggest that that makes the case for why we believe we ought to save this surplus and, at the very least, not squander it, because it might increase the incentive to make those tough political choices we have not made to protect these two programs. 
   So saving all of the surplus is not going to save Social Security. It is not going to make Social Security solvent in the context that the Senator from Florida and I are discussing, nor is it going to do that for Medicare. We understand that. But it might focus the mind a little bit. As Samuel Johnson said: when a man knows he is to be hanged it concentrates his mind wonderfully. That is not an exact quote, but that is fairly close to it. Delaying the effective date of the tax cuts might give us some incentive, some focus, to conduct that hard, politically risky work that the Senator from Tennessee so accurately described it is going to take if we are to solve the problem with either Social Security or Medicare. 
   All we are saying is, let's not squander this money. It isn't just a matter of correcting it next year, it exacerbates the problem, because it is going to increase the amount of money we are going to have to carry in terms of the debt. So we are saying: Hang on; $4 billion, one-half of 1 percent; it is not worth locking in the kind of a tax cut some are suggesting until we've done first things first. 
   It has been a good debate. I am particularly grateful, first of all, to my friend and colleague from Florida for his leadership and cosponsorship, and to the distinguished chairman, who is also good natured--notwithstanding differences we may have which may be fairly significant, but I have never heard a cross word uttered by him--and to the distinguished Senator from Tennessee for engaging in this dialogue which I think does at least illustrate the choice we are going to have to make and the choice that, in fact, we are asking our colleagues to make. 
   We are simply saying do not squander the surplus by making this kind of humongous tax cut this year when we can wait until next year or the year after and find out exactly where we are going and, hopefully, increase the pressure to actually save Social Security and Medicare. 
   With that, I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleagues. 
   The Senator from Florida and I happily yield back the remaining time on our side.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I have come before this chamber on numerous occasions to urge our colleagues to find a way to give states and localities the additional resources they so urgently need to build and renovate our nation's schools. In January, Senator LAUTENBERG and I, with several other colleagues, introduced the Public School Modernization Act of 1999. In March, Senators LAUTENBERG, HARKIN, and I were successful in offering an amendment to this year's budget resolution which called for $24.8 billion in zero-interest bonds as well as direct grants for school construction and repair. That amendment passed the Senate unanimously. Regrettably the Senate Finance Committee tax bill includes only minimal school infrastructure assistance, despite the opportunity we had in Committee to include much more substantial infrastructure relief. 
   Proposals regarding school construction have been offered from both sides of the aisle. Unfortunately, however, the debate about education infrastructure needs and the federal role to address those needs has too often been partisan and has been characterized by an inability or an unwillingness to recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all solution to the school construction dilemma facing many of our nation's school districts. 
   So today, I am pleased to be joined by Senators LAUTENBERG, CONRAD, HARKIN, KENNEDY, DASCHLE, REID, MURRAY, LEVIN, CLELAND, DODD, TORRICELLI, SCHUMER, LINCOLN, JOHNSON, WELLSTONE, KERRY, KERREY, and AKAKA in introducing legislation designed to combine various bipartisan school construction proposals to create a menu of school construction financing options. The Public School Modernization and Overcrowding Relief Act of 1999 will help school districts build new schools to accommodate the record enrollments of elementary and secondary students we know are coming. It will also help modernize schools to ensure that our children have the benefit of modern technology. And it will help repair old schools which have become outdated and unsafe. 
   Mr. President, 14 million children attend schools in need of extensive repair or replacement. Twelve million attend schools with leaky roofs, and 7 million attend schools with safety code violations. The President of the Maine Education Association testified before the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee recently and stated that there are schools in Maine that actually turn the lights out when it rains because the electrical wiring is exposed under their leaky roofs. 
   Compounding the safety problem is the significant overcrowding in the nation's schools. Across the country, there are thousands and thousands of trailers used for instruction--over 3,000 are in use in Virginia alone. So instead of attending science class equipped with the latest technology to conduct biology experiments, our children are going to class in poorly-ventilated portable trailers that can actually be harmful to their health. 
   Mr. President, Loudon County, Virginia will need to build 22 new schools over the next six years to accommodate its enormous population growth. Despite the help that our own Virginia General Assembly has approved, the state will only provide two to three percent of Virginia's total school infrastructure needs. This isn't just a Virginia phenomenon; it's a national crisis. The National Center for Education Statistics estimates that by 2003, the nation will need to build 2,400 new schools to accommodate record enrollments in our elementary and secondary schools. 
   In short, school boards should not be forced to choose between hiring an additional teacher or fixing a leaky roof. School superintendents should be installing computer labs, not basic air conditioning. And students should attend schools of the future, not relics of the past. 
   The legislation we offer today will allow school districts to issue tax-exempt bonds for school construction. Localities will be able to save significant amounts of money on capital improvement projects, as the federal government would give bondholders a tax credit in the amount of the interest that the locality would otherwise be required to pay. The legislation also knocks down a statutory hurdle which currently hinders more private sector involvement in public education by allowing private entities to pool resources with states and localities to build and renovate school buildings. Furthermore, if a state or locality has previously issued bonds at a time when interest rates were high, this legislation would allow them to essentially refinance that debt to take advantage of today's lower interest rates. The legislation will also make it easier for small communities to issue a greater number of bonds without being subject to onerous arbitrage requirements. All of these provisions provide states and localities with choices. Under this legislation, our states and localities will be able to avail themselves of those provisions that best suit their financial needs. The bill creates a menu of options through which states and localities can assemble their own financing packages. 
   Mr. President, as a former governor, I acknowledge that education is primarily a state and local responsibility. The federal government, however, can be a helpful partner in education by helping to defray the cost of capital improvements without interfering with the substantive decisions that states and localities are struggling to make regarding their academic reform efforts. Providing a variety of financing options to fund capital improvements, therefore, is an imminently constructive role for the federal government to play. For our public education system to be the best in the world, all three levels of government--local, state, and federal--will have to work together. 
   I thank my colleagues who have co-sponsored this legislation, and I look forward to working with them to pass it. It's flexible. It's sensible. And it provides the most financing options of any school construction proposal to date. I hope this legislation brings us one step closer to the compromise I know we can reach. 
   Mr. President, in the 1930's and again in the 1950's, our grandparents and parents summoned the political will to build the vast majority of our nation's existing school buildings. It is my hope that we can summon that will again. Our nation's students and families deserve no less.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, first let me thank my friend and colleague from Delaware, as well as my friend and colleague from New York, for their support. 
   As a cosponsor of the Biden amendment, I would like to express my strong support for the effort to preserve and restore funding for the COPS Program. 
   I believe many of our colleagues share my view that protecting our Nation's citizens from all enemies, foreign and domestic, is a critical obligation of the Federal Government. We are committed to try to make all of our communities safer from the threat of crime. Today, by supporting this amendment and the COPS Program, all of us can make good on this commitment. 
   The Biden amendment will prevent the COPS Program from expiring as the underlying bill provides. Over the next year, the $495 million in funding provided by the amendment will put 1,500 new officers on the beat, hire 2,400 school resource officers to reduce violence in schools, keep hundreds more officers out in their communities rather than behind their desks, purchase bulletproof vests, and provide better communications equipment and technology. In short, this amendment will make a difference to the safety of our communities. 
   I am particularly gratified to see the resources devoted to school safety. Even before the tragic killings in schools across the Nation, I worked to amend the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill in 1997 to permit the use of COPS funding for school safety grants. The following year, with the help of Senators GREGG and HOLLINGS, we expanded that program. As a result, this year more than $167 million in school safety grants, including funding to hire school resource officers, is going to communities across the Nation. 
   More generally, the Community-Oriented Policing Services program, or COPS, is one of our best strategies for fighting the war on crime. The rationale is straightforward, and the results are impressive. In the simplest terms, COPS funding means more police on the beat, which means less crime. 
   The dynamics of COPS in community policing are, of course, more complex. The goal is not simply more bodies but better neighborhoods. By giving law enforcement the resources to actively engage their communities, we develop trust and better communications; we allow officers to be proactive and prevent crime before it occurs. 
   The bottom line is that the COPS program works. This Nation has the  lowest crime rate in 25 years. The murder rate is at the lowest point in 30 years. 
   In my home State of Virginia, we provided funding to put nearly 2,000 additional officers on the streets. As we have added those officers, we have seen a drop in crime. Between 1992 and 1997, murders declined by 17 percent in Virginia Beach, by 30 percent in Norfolk, and by 48 percent in Newport News. 
   With these statistics, it is not surprising how many are urging the Senate to step up to the plate again. My colleagues have already mentioned the many organizations asking us to continue COPS funding, including the Fraternal Order of Police and the United Conference of Mayors. 
   In a letter to Majority Leader LOTT, Sheriff Dan Smith, president of the National Sheriffs Association, stated:  
   It is imperative to effective crime control that the COPS program survive. It is a program that is vital to effective law enforcement, and to sheriffs in both rural and urban jurisdictions.  
   I urge my colleagues to support the Biden amendment. We should not be satisfied with the lowest crime rate in 25 years. We should work for the lowest crime rate ever. This important amendment will help us to achieve that goal. 
   I again thank my distinguished colleague from Delaware for his continued leadership in this important area. I am delighted to work with him and with others, and I look forward to the continuation of this vital program. 
   I yield any time I may have remaining to the principal sponsor of the amendment, the Senator from Delaware.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'm pleased to introduce legislation today to provide additional federal funding for the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. The legislation, the Woodrow Wilson Bridge Funding Act, has been cosponsored by the other three Senators from this region, Senators WARNER, SARBANES and MIKULSKI. We have worked well as a team. And I thank Senator WARNER, who will introduce corresponding legislation that authorizes the funding to go to the bridge project, which I am also pleased to cosponsor. 
   These two bills complete the job that was started in the TEA-21 legislation we passed last year. In that bill, the Administration agreed to support $900 million for the bridge. I commend my senior colleague for his tireless efforts to secure those funds. But even with the funding provided by TEA-21, the amount of funding available for the bridge fell $1 billion short of what is needed to build it. 
   Since the passage of the highway bill, I have been pressing the Administration to recognize the federal obligation which is owed to this federally-owned bridge. During the past few months of fits and starts on this project, I have focused on funding as the most serious long-term threat to rebuilding the bridge. I've spoken to Secretary Slater, written letters to the Secretary and OMB Director Jack Lew, and my office has been in constant contact with the Department of Transportation urging a solution to our funding shortfall. 
   So I was gratified when the Administration proposed a solution reflected in the bills we are introducing today. After receiving the Administration's proposed legislation and consulting with the entire regional delegation, from both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Potomac River, we decided to divide the legislation into two bills, which will be referred separately to the two committees with primary interest in the legislation. The bill I'm introducing allows direct payments from the Highway Trust Fund to be used to finish this project. It will be referred to the Finance Committee, on which I sit, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on that committee to move this legislation forward. Senator WARNER's bill will be referred to the Environment and Public Works Committee, on which he sits. 
   Together, these two bills will solve the remaining financing problem facing the Woodrow Wilson bridge. By securing Administration support in advance, we have already travelled a significant distance toward getting a bill that can be signed into law. And it is my hope we can move quickly in the Congress to fill this fiscal pothole.  
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the two bills be printed consectutively in the RECORD.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues on the floor today to introduce the Bipartisan Social Security Reform Act of 1999. As one who has been involved in various reform efforts over the past three Congresses, I can honestly say that the legislation we are introducing today is, in my view, the best product we have submitted to date. 
   I would like to take a moment to talk about the dedication of the members who are here on the floor today. They have all demonstrated a tireless commitment to get this body to take seriously solving the tough issue of financing this program through the Baby Boom generation and beyond. This is not an easy task. Under current law, the program faces a shortfall that would require either an 18 percent payroll tax rate or a 30 percent cut in benefits. Either option would be devastating to the future workers financing the program or the future Social Security beneficiary. 
   This group has united around a common purpose. Instead of trying to dress up so-called lock-boxes as Social Security reform, and instead of undertaking massive Federal borrowing to finance individual accounts on top of the current system, and instead of committing future taxpayers to fix the problem, we have actually sought to solve the long-term financing dilemma in this important program. And I'm proud to say that we have done this without adopting any payroll tax increase. 
   By allowing all workers to take 2 percentage points of their payroll tax into individual retirement savings accounts that workers own, we ensure that not only is today's Social Security surplus being set aside for today's workers who will become tomorrow's retirees, but we also advance fund some of our future liabilities. In addition, we also use some of the surplus to boost contributions for lower income workers, ensuring that these individuals have a comparable opportunity to build wealth in their personal savings accounts. The accumulation in these accounts will supplement future Social Security benefits under the traditional program. 
   While we make some revisions to future benefits to bring down the financing cost of the program, we do so in a way that doesn't affect anyone currently over the age of 62, that increases the traditional Social Security benefit for low income earners, that protects women who have taken time out to raise children, and that increases the benefit for widows and widowers. 
   Mr. President, this is a credible plan that solves the financing challenge presented by Social Security in a truly progressive manner. I hope other colleagues who are serious about tackling the issue will not only take a close look at this proposal, but will also help us make real reform a top priority.

   Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I commend my colleagues from Rhode Island and Florida for their efforts to try to craft a bipartisan compromise. 
   We succeeded in putting together legislation that I believe would have led us to a bill that could become a law. 
   As Senator CHAFEE indicated, we are in a situation where a bill that is supported by an overwhelming majority of all of the health-related organizations--doctors, nurses, patients, and providers--is not going to enjoy enough votes on this floor to pass. 
   The bill that will pass is going to be vetoed by the President. 
   I hope we can find a way to crawl out of our fox holes and find the common ground that is necessary if we are going to address in a responsible way the issues and the concerns we have been talking about for this entire week. I commend the leadership for sticking to their agreement and giving everyone an opportunity to be heard. I regret there was no sense of compromise on the floor. It is important we do that. I hope we continue with that mission. I appreciate those who have worked hard to achieve that compromise. 
   I yield the floor.

   Yesterday, when we were debating the amendment I had the privilege of offering on behalf of myself and Senators MURRAY, MIKULSKI, BOXER, and others, we had no one from the other side of the aisle here to debate or discuss that during the entire period we were discussing that particular amendment. In a few minutes I am going to address the merits of what was said, but nothing was said, no engagement on the merits of the amendment that we offered was offered by anyone from the other side of the aisle. Was there a decision not to engage this side? Does the Senator know how to respond to that?

   Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts. 
   I am pleased that the Senator from Tennessee is on the floor. 
   First, let me observe that I see a disturbing trend as we consider the basic proposal to grant patients' rights, however defined. Every time we have a Democratic amendment, we find some small objection to it, technical or otherwise, causing everyone on the other side to have to vote against it with the promise that tomorrow we will resubmit it with a word or two changed so it will be acceptable to our side. 
   If my observation is incorrect, I look forward to being corrected. 
   Yesterday the Senator from Tennessee, Senator FRIST, took the floor to say that he supported 98 percent of the amendment I offered on behalf of myself and Senators MURRAY, MIKULSKI, BOXER, and others, but he had just a couple of objections to it. He stated that the problems with our amendment were such that he had to urge all Members to vote against it and it could only be fixed with the alternative that Senator SNOWE and Senator ABRAHAM would cover today. 
   At the time my friend from Tennessee was speaking, I asked if he would yield for a question. He declined to do so. That is, of course, his right. But since my friend from Tennessee would not yield during yesterday's debate for a question on his claims, I want to take just a minute to correct the RECORD. 
   First of all, Senator FRIST said he had spoken with the chairman of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Primary Care Committee, Dr. Robert Yelverton. My colleague said Dr. Yelverton told him that OB/GYNs would not qualify as primary care physicians. A number of OB/GYNs took exception to the claim of the Senator from Tennessee that Dr. Yelverton told him OB/GYNs are unqualified, including Dr. Yelverton. 
   I received a fax this morning from Dr. Yelverton which clarified these comments for me and for our colleagues. Let me read part of what he said. 
   He said:  
   I have never spoken directly to Senator Bill Frist (R-TN) or any member of his staff on the subject of OB/GYNs as primary care physicians or on any other subject. The quote that Senator Frist attributed to me on the floor of the Senate today came from an article in the June 13, 1999, edition of the New York Times.)  
   He goes on to say:  
   Senator Frist's misuse of my statement in support of his position that OB/GYNs could not act as primary care physicians because of the ``high standards'' that managed care organizations set for primary care physicians, is regrettably misleading to say the least, and does an injustice to the true intent of my statements.  
   Again, I am quoting Dr. Yelverton. He went on to say:  
   I personally supported then and I support now the amendment sponsored by ACOG to allow OB/GYNs to act as primary care physicians and to allow direct access for women's healthcare and did, in fact, spend a portion of this very afternoon e-mailing my senators and encouraging them to vote in support of the amendment.

   Mr. ROBB. I ask my Republican friends: What are their objections to the proposal to allow women access to care that they want and need? How do those who voted against our amendment yesterday, which is so important to American women, justify doing so? 
   I want to clarify something my colleague from Tennessee said about our proposal to guarantee that doctors and patients--not insurance companies--decide how long a woman stays in a hospital after a mastectomy. Senator FRIST criticized a provision in our amendment that said physicians shall make decisions about the length of stay in a hospital in accordance with ``generally accepted medical standards,'' arguing this standard would be used in determining whether a woman has a mastectomy, a lumpectomy, or a lymph node dissection. 
   I want the record to reflect that our amendment said nothing of the sort. The Robb-Murray amendment simply said that after a woman has had one of these procedures, a doctor and patient can then decide how long a woman stays in the hospital. That is what the amendment actually said. Our Republican colleagues are simply wrong when they say that the amendment would somehow apply to the decision of the kind of surgical procedure a woman undergoes. 
   Mr. President, I know there is a broader issue being debated over the definition of ``medical necessity'' and whether or not this definition is problematic. But that debate has nothing to do with the amendment we offered yesterday. Our amendment specifically said that physicians would be empowered to overrule insurance companies only when deciding how long a woman stays in the hospital after a woman has had a mastectomy, a lumpectomy, or lymph node dissection. Their argument that our amendment had a broader application is simply without merit. 
   The Republican arguments in this case against the mastectomy portion of our amendment were off base. Their argument against guaranteeing better care by an OB/GYN has been discredited by the doctor whom they quoted yesterday. 
   I hope we can come to some truly bipartisan resolution of these issues. They are important. They are important to women. They are important to all of the people in this country who are not currently covered. To restrict the scope of this amendment in such a way that specifically excludes women from having direct access to the type of health professionals with whom they are most comfortable is unconscionable. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank my colleague from Massachusetts. 
   Mr. President, while I would concede that most Members of this body are very concerned about issues that have special relevance to women, we all too often leave much of the advocacy on those issues to women who are colleagues in the Senate. In a legislative body with only 9 women and 91 men, the amount of time focused on issues of special concern to women is often skewed. As someone who has always  prided himself on standing up for equality of opportunity, that seems profoundly unfair. 
   Women's health--and, specifically, the choices women have in our health care system--ought to be a special concern to everyone. 
   As a father of three daughters, I have come to better understand that the types of health care women need and the way they access it are often very different from the health care needs of men. 
   Unfortunately, our health care system has long ignored some important facts about women's health. During this important debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights, I have offered an amendment that would do something to correct that. I rise to explain the amendment which was just sent to the desk which will help women get the medical care they need. 
   The amendment has been crafted with Senators MURRAY, BOXER, and MIKULSKI and will remove two of the greatest obstacles to quality care that women face in our current system today: No. 1, inadequate access to obstetricians and gynecologists; and, No. 2, inadequate hospital care after a mastectomy. 
   We know today that for many women, their OB/GYN is the only physician they regularly see. While they have a special focus 
   on women's reproductive health, obstetricians and gynecologists provide a full range of preventive health services to women, and many women consider their OB/GYN to be their primary care physician. 
   Unfortunately, some insurers have failed to recognize the ways in which women access health care services. Some managed care companies require a woman to first visit a primary care doctor before she is granted permission to see an obstetrician or gynecologist. Others will allow a woman to obtain some primary care services from her OB/GYN but then prohibit her from visiting any specialists to whom her OB/GYN refers her without first visiting a standard primary care physician. This isn't just cumbersome to women; it is bad for their health. 
   According to a survey by the Commonwealth Fund, women who regularly see an OB/GYN are more likely to have had a complete physical exam and other preventative services--like mammograms, cholesterol tests, and Pap smears. 
   At a time when we need to focus our health care dollars more toward prevention, allowing insurers to restrict access to health professionals most likely to offer women preventative care only increases the possibility that greater complications and greater expenditures arise down the road. 
   We ought to grant women the right to access medical care from obstetricians and gynecologists without any interference from remote insurance company representatives. This amendment is designed to do just that. 
   I offer this amendment on behalf of my colleagues because the Republican bill, which has been offered for the purposes of debate by Senator DASCHLE, will not grant women direct access to care. 
   First of all, their bill only covers a limited percentage of the women who have health care insurance in our country, leaving more than 113 million Americans without any basic floor for patient protections. Then, for the minority of patients that they do cover, the Republicans offer only a hollow set of protections but leave many women without direct access to the care they need. 
   While their bill would allow a woman to obtain routine care from an OB/GYN, such as an annual checkup, the bill would not ensure that a woman can directly access important followup obstetrical or gynecological care after her initial visit. For example, if a woman were to have a Pap smear during a routine checkup at her gynecologist, and that Pap smear came back abnormal, the Republican bill would not guarantee that she could access important followup care from the same doctor. 
   Instead, their bill would allow insurers to force her to go back to a primary care gatekeeper physician to get permission for a followup visit to her gynecologist. This may sound unbelievable, but a recent survey showed that women face this obstacle 75 percent of the time. In addition, the Republican bill will now allow a woman to designate her OB/GYN as her primary care provider. 
   Their provision ignores one of the basic facts about the ways women receive health care in America today. While OB/GYNs have a special expertise on women's reproductive systems, they are also trained at primary care. For women, their OB/GYN is the only doctor that they see on a regular basis. 
   Because many of these women consider their OB/GYN to be their primary care physician, they depend on him or her for the full range of diagnostic and preventative services that are offered by other general practitioners. Statistics show that women are more likely to have had a physical from an OB/GYN in the past year than from any other doctor. One survey from the University of Maryland showed that OB/GYNs provide 57 percent of the general physical exams given to women. In another survey, when asked who they go to for primary care, 54 percent of the women said it is to their OB/GYN. 
   We know how women access primary care and we know that by allowing them to get this care, their health care will improve. Yet insurers often ignore the fact that many women rely on their OB/GYN for primary care, making it more difficult for them to access preventative care and other services. 
   Our amendment will grant women more direct access to health care professionals that they have come to depend upon. 
   The second piece of this amendment will address the inhumane treatment that some women have received after they have experienced the trauma of a mastectomy. Each year, millions of women are screened for cancer by mammogram and, sadly, nearly 200,000 of them are diagnosed with breast cancer. 
   The options women face in such circumstances are difficult, and in a time of great uncertainty, women ought not be forced to face unnecessary additional burdens. Unfortunately, some women have been told by their health insurer that a mastectomy will only be covered on an outpatient basis. Given the trauma that a woman faces with such major surgery, both physical and emotional, it is unconscionable that some insurers refuse to cover proper hospital care after a mastectomy. Much like the restrictions on access to obstetricians and gynecologists, these restrictions on hospital care after such traumatic surgery are simply bad for women's health. After a mastectomy, doctors tell us that hospitalization is often critical to foster proper healing, as well as to provide support to women who have just experienced the emotional trauma of such major surgery. 
   Our amendment will return control over this important medical decision to the medical professionals and ensure that doctors who actually know and examine their patients, not some distant, impersonal insurance company representative, make 
   decisions about the length of stay in the hospital following a mastectomy. It would put into law the recommendations of the American Association of Health Plans, who said in 1996, that:  
   The decision about whether outpatient or inpatient care best meets the needs of a woman undergoing removal of a breast should be made by the woman's physician after consultation with the patient ..... as a matter of practice, physicians should make all medical treatment decisions based on the best available scientific information and the unique characteristics of each patient.  
   Although this commonsense, important provision was included in legislation offered by the other side of the aisle last year, it has inexplicably been dropped from their bill this year. We cannot, however, retreat from our commitment to the health and well-being of the women of America. 
   Finally, this amendment would help self-employed women and, indeed, all self-employed Americans better access affordable health insurance by making the cost of their insurance fully tax deductible.

   Mr. ROBB. Finally, this amendment would help self-employed women and, indeed, all self-employed Americans better access affordable health care by making the cost of their insurance fully tax deductible. The current tax  system penalizes self-employed individuals, and this amendment will ensure they are treated equally. 
   I am concerned that the bill offered by the other side doesn't even cover 70 percent of Americans with health insurance. I am even more concerned, however, that the protections they offered to this limited number of Americans doesn't reflect the health needs of half of our population, the women in our population. 
   I know we can do better. We should do better. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment which recognizes the critical needs facing the women in this country today. 
   With that, I yield the floor, and I reserve any time remaining on my side.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank you. And I thank our distinguished colleague from Massachusetts for his leadership on this whole bill. 
   I use this moment to simply commend our colleagues, who happen to be women, who have made the most passionate, persuasive case for this particular amendment that could be made. 
   Frankly, in listening to my colleague from Maryland about the agony women go through before they have to make a decision about a mastectomy, talking about the difficult choices that women have to make, and adding to it the bureaucracy, where we bounce them back and forth, and talking about money--for this particular amendment, I have heard one estimate that it will be 12 cents a year for the increased cost--we will probably, I suggest, save more money in the lack of administration and bureaucracy than it would cost if we allow women to have as their designated primary care provider their obstetrician or gynecologist. This is the person they go to right now to receive their health care, as pointed out so eloquently by the Senator from California. 
   As the Senator from Arkansas has noted, this is a very real problem. Her husband happens to practice this particular form of medicine. She gave us a compelling reason as to why we should not subject the women of America to this kind of burden. 
   I am very grateful to my colleague from Washington, who has long led the fight on this particular issue, and my colleague from Minnesota, and others who have spoken out. 
   I, frankly, do not understand the argument against this particular proposal. There is no one here to make that argument. I am, frankly, surprised. This makes sense for the women of America.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'm pleased to join Senators JEFFORDS and LANDRIEU as a cosponsor of this amendment that helps address an issue affecting many lower pay-grade federal employees with young children: affordable child care. Often there are facilities available to fill this need, but the costs puts this option beyond the reach of these families. This amendment addresses this concern by allowing the use of appropriated funds to help these families. Though I am concerned that the House may be uncomfortable with the overall scope of this amendment, I look forward to working with Senators JEFFORDS and LANDRIEU to make sure this measure or a reasonable compromise is acceptable to both the House and the Senate.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I have not been present for all of the debate this time, but this issue has been before us many times in the past. I stand to oppose the amendment and to speak on behalf of the 1.2 million Federal employees who would be directly affected by the amendment. If this amendment were to pass, it would take away their health benefit rights which have been negotiated. The bottom line is, and I say this as one who represents a disproportionate number of Federal employees, this would make Federal employees, women who are eligible for this health benefit, second-class citizens. It would deny to them a benefit that is available to every other woman under every other private health plan that chooses to offer such coverage. I think it would be wrong. 
   I reserve the remainder of the time, and I thank the Senator from California and the Senator from Washington for their extraordinary leadership, again, on this very important issue.

    Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to submit a resolution honoring our veterans that have earned the oldest military decoration in the world, the Purple Heart. This resolution expresses the Sense of the Congress that the U.S. Postal Service should issue a postage stamp honoring Purple Heart recipients. 
   The Purple Heart was established by General George Washington in 1782 as a badge of distinction for ``meritorious action.'' After the Revolutionary War, however, the Purple Heart was not awarded again until it was revived in 1932, the year marking the 200th anniversary of Washington's birth. 
   Today, the Purple Heart is awarded to members of the U.S. armed forces who are wounded by an instrument of war in the hands of the enemy. Additionally, it is awarded posthumously to next of kin in the name of those who are killed in action or die of wounds received in combat. This year, the 200th anniversary of George Washington's death, is a fitting time for the Postal Service to honor our Purple Heart recipients with a commemorative postage stamp. They deserve no less.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, while most people think of divisions in this body as divisions of party, there are other divisions as well. Increasingly, I'm becoming concerned about the division between those who want to create political issues and those who want to solve problems. 
   From the start of this debate, I realized that the crushing wave of litigation which could accompany the new year threatens to hinder our efforts to achieve Y2K readiness and exacerbate the damage done by the Y2K bug. The prospect of litigation enormously complicates an already complex problem. I have worked with others to try to move all interested parties toward enough of a consensus that we could get a bill that would be signed into law. 
   This effort to develop a consensus bill led to the development of the alternative offered by Senator KERRY. That substitute had the benefit of both addressing the legitimate needs of the high tech community and satisfying the concerns expressed by the Administration. Instead we have voted out legislation which, if unchanged in conference, is heading toward a veto. 
   I have said from the outset that I believe we ought to pass a bill to address this real--and unique--problem. So today I voted for S. 96, to move it to the next stage in the legislative process. But I caution my colleagues that if this bill is not modified--if the conferees are not willing to address the remaining concerns in the upcoming conference--then we're still faced with a veto, we'll end up where we began, and we'll have wasted valuable time in reaching our goal. 
   With regard to the conference, I have heard that the House may simply adopt the Senate language, sending this bill directly to the White House knowing it would be vetoed. That's pure politics and it's counter-productive. From my negotiations with the White House, I know that they too want to find consensus, but at this point, the only way to find this consensus is to sit down with them in a conference setting. 
   If a conference does not take place, if this bill is sent to the President with the explicit knowledge that it will draw a veto, then the reports on Capitol Hill that some would rather have a Y2K issue than a Y2K solution will be obvious for one and all to see, because there is consensus to be found on this issue, if all parties are willing to negotiate in good faith.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, as a Senator from Virginia, with one of the most vibrant high-tech communities anywhere in the country, I am acutely aware of the problems the Y2K bug presents. And I want a bill. I have worked with the high-tech community in Virginia, particularly Northern Virginia, but throughout the State since my days as Lieutenant Governor and as Governor. 
   During the time I was Governor, I created a task force on high technology and they came up with 44 recommendations, the most prominent of which was to create a Center for Innovative Technology, which, for the benefit of our colleagues, is housed in that funny-shaped building very close to Dulles International Airport. Colocated with it was the Software Productivity Consortium, because we wanted to be able to provide a central point for consideration of all the issues and concerns of the technology industry and a way to broker the release of the scientific work on technology-related projects. 
   So, I come with a lengthy background of working with the high-technology community and a specific interest in getting legislation that will address the Y2K problem. 
   The potential wave of litigation which could accompany the turn of the century could, in fact, be crushing, and many businesses have indicated that the threat of litigation could keep them from devoting the necessary resources to addressing their own Y2K problems. A reasonable bill, which would weed out frivolous lawsuits and encourage parties to remediate their Y2K disputes outside the courtroom, would be to everyone's benefit. But while there is general agreement that some sort of bill should pass, regrettably, we do not yet have consensus on exactly what language should be in this bill. 
   Passage of almost any legislation requires some elements of compromise. We have seen that process ongoing. Indeed, I entered this debate several weeks ago--actually, now months ago--to help find the necessary consensus on this issue. Given the rapidly approaching new year, as well as the dwindling number of legislative days left in the Senate, it is important for us to act on this legislation now. Further delay will only make it more difficult to reach the consensus most of us are looking for. 
   With the tight timeline we are facing, I am concerned with the direction the debate still seems to be taking. Notwithstanding my own misgivings about certain provisions in S. 96, the administration strongly objects to the bill in its current form, and the President has promised that if Congress sends S. 96 to the White House without significant modifications, he will veto it. Thus, we are presented with a dilemma. If we want a bill that will solve a legitimate problem, we need a bill that the President will sign or at the very least will not veto, or we need 67 hard votes in order to override a veto. Otherwise, we are just playing with politics. I regret to say I am afraid that is where we are now. We do not at this point, on this language, have the necessary 67 hard votes. 
   The President has promised to veto this bill if it comes to him in its current form. So we are going through an exercise to polarize and politicize an issue instead of providing a solution to an issue. 
   I appreciate the very hard work that my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts has put in trying to find the necessary language that would provide the relief that is legitimate and on which virtually everyone in the Chamber can agree and still get the President to sign. 
   If we continue to approach this legislation with a vehicle we know the President has already promised to veto, we are not giving the industry the relief they so critically need. All we are doing is scoring political and debating points, but we are not coming up with a solution. We have that dilemma. 
   I am, therefore, a cosponsor of the legislation offered by my distinguished friend, the Senator from Massachusetts, because the White House has indicated they will sign that particular legislation if these changes are made. It has line-by-line changes to certain provisions, and they are relatively limited at this point. 
   I applaud the good will that has prevailed on both sides to this point in reaching this particular position, but we are still not there. For this reason, I hope that our colleagues will support the amendment that has been drafted and negotiated by my distinguished partner from Massachusetts because, at that point, we will have a bill. It will not be a perfect bill, but it also will not be a vetoed bill. 
   It is inconceivable to me, given the many demands that have come to this Chamber from all of the interests that are involved, that we could ever come up with a perfect bill, but at least we will have protection from the kinds of lawsuits that the industry is most concerned about, and we will have it in time to make decisions to remediate some of the problems they could otherwise deal with if they were free from the threat of litigation in this particular area. 
   I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for his patience in working out the amendment which is now before us, and I urge my colleagues to pass this particular amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered today is about accepting responsibility. On February 3, 1998, a United States Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler severed a ski gondola cable near Cavalese, Italy, plummeting twenty people nearly 400 feet to their deaths. We later learned, to our great disappointment, that the pilot and the navigator conspired to destroy evidence of the circumstances leading to the accident. 
   This amendment, cosponsored by Senators SNOWE, BINGAMAN, LEAHY and KERREY, upholds the honor of the United States Marine Corps and our military both here and abroad, permits the United States to accept responsibility for this tragic accident, and sends an unambiguous message that we will not tolerate efforts to cover-up our mistakes. 
   The Congress has already authorized payment to rebuild the gondola we destroyed. We have not yet authorized payment to help rebuild the lives of the families we destroyed. This amendment allows the Secretary of Defense to compensate the victims' families both for the accident and the effort to hide evidence of the accident. 
   A similar amendment was passed by the Senate during consideration of the Emergency Supplemental. The amendment passed unanimously, but was dropped during Conference consideration. I urge the Senate to adopt the amendment and allow the families of the victims to begin healing.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, today I'm introducing legislation to assist federal workers seeking affordable care for their young children. 
   Many federal facilities provide child care centers for their employees' use. But for many lower and middle income employees, these services are simply unaffordable--their costs put them beyond the reach of these families. The bill I am introducing today, along with Senators WARNER and SARBANES, will make this option affordable for these employees. 
   This legislation authorizes federal agencies to use appropriated funds to help lower and middle income federal workers better afford the child care services they need. Let me emphasize that these funds have already been appropriated, meaning no new government spending is involved. This is a modest, cost-effective solution that will certainly ease the minds of parents who are understandably concerned about their child care needs. 
   Our federal employees should not have to choose between their desire for public service and their need for child care services.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend and colleague from Michigan for his leadership on this issue, as well as my colleague and friend from Arizona for his leadership on this issue. It is a difficult issue. 
   This year, we have added billions of dollars to improve the readiness of our Armed Forces. It does not take a budget expert to realize how much more we could accomplish for our men and women in uniform if we had the billions in savings that would accrue from just one additional round of base closures in the year 2001. 
   Last year and the year before that, I argued that not giving the Department of Defense the authority it has asked for to close unneeded bases makes the Congress look shortsighted and indecisive. I argued then that every dollar used to maintain excess infrastructure is a dollar diverted from resources we so badly need to modernize our equipment and to improve the quality of life of our hard-working military personnel and their families. 
   Sadly, those BRAC efforts failed for nearly the same reasons the emergency supplemental succeeded last year, reasons that have more to do with politics than with making the right choices when it comes to protecting this Nation's interests, both now and into the next century. 
   Admittedly, the emergency supplemental had plenty of legitimate emergency spending, emergency spending for our troops, for our farmers, and for hurricane and tornado victims. But it threw fiscal discipline out the window by also spending billions in nonemergency spending. In my view, we have acted 
   just as irresponsibly over the past 3 years by refusing to close bases we no longer need. If we fail to pass this latest BRAC proposal once again, we will have failed not only the taxpayer but also the men and women who comprise the finest fighting force the world has ever known. 
   I come back to this point, one I have made time and time again, to ask, who really suffers if we force the Department of Defense to keep open bases it does not need? In the end, we only punish those who most need the benefits of infrastructure savings. First, we punish the Nation's taxpayers when we fail to make the best use of the resources with which we are entrusted. Second, we punish today's soldiers, sailors, and marines, because current readiness requires having sufficient reliable resources for equipment, training, and operations. Finally, we punish tomorrow's force, our future readiness, as we continue to mortgage the research, development, and modernization of the platforms and equipment that will be necessary to keep America strong into the 21st century. 
   As the Joint Chiefs of Staff have testified, there is no shortage of legitimate programs to apply BRAC savings towards including Navy shipbuilding. Years of relatively low procurement rates have created a shortfall so significant that the fleet size will shrink to substantially less than the 300 ships of the Navy's stated goal in the 2020s, if procurement rates of 8 to 10 ships do not start materializing now. The Navy is stretched thin enough right now, with 324 ships. Do we really want to risk not having enough ships to meet our commitments in the next century? 
   It does not have to be this way. The 300-ship Navy, the Army after next, and the Air Force and Marine Corps of tomorrow can be funded, at least in part, from BRAC savings. The savings from the first four rounds of base closures alone are estimated to be on the order of $25 billion over the next 4 years. It should come as no surprise that scores of studies and organizations such as the Quadrennial Defense Review, the Defense Restructure Initiative, the National Defense Panel, and Business Executives for National Security have all concluded that more base closures are crucial to the future of our Armed Forces. 
   It is time to put politics behind us. We have an obligation to change the way we do business and to do what is right for our Armed Forces and what is right for the taxpayer. I urge my colleagues to support this critically important amendment.  
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. I thank my distinguished senior colleague. One minute will be sufficient because I know the chairman of the committee is about to make a unanimous consent request. 
   I state to my good friend from Pennsylvania, I am very much opposed to this amendment. I cannot imagine a modification of this amendment that would cause me to be supportive. We have already debated this essential question twice. 
   Congress has the power to declare war. If we are concerned about consultation with the executive branch, as we speak consultation is taking place up in S-407 in a classified briefing where the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of State, the National Security Adviser and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have been briefing all Senators on what is taking place, what has taken place, what will take place and have again reaffirmed the intention of the President to consult with the Congress before any change, particularly with respect to the implementation of any particular plan that might involve the commitment of ground troops, takes place. 
   With that, Mr. President, I ask our colleagues to look very seriously at the long-term implications. Think of the kind of message this sends to Milosevic. Think of the kind of message this sends to our 18 alliance partners, if we were to continue to try to take this type of action on the floor of the Senate. 
   Mr. President, I urge a rejection of this particular 
   amendment and I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia and the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee. Like our other colleagues, I commend him and the distinguished Senator from Alaska for their hard work on this particular proposal we will be voting on today. 
   I regret that I am not able to support this particular bill because there is so much in it that I do support. I clearly recognize the critical need for additional spending for our military. Indeed, we are not spending enough on our military today, even with the emergency spending that is legitimately included in this bill for the crisis in Kosovo. We are going to have to spend even more if we are going to meet our commitments around the world and provide the national security that we're expected to provide--and indeed that we profess to be able to provide. We are not spending enough money on ships, or planes, or ammunition, or on quality of life improvements for members of our Armed Services. We are going to have to address those needs, even beyond what is provided in this bill. 
   I am embarrassed by the fact that we're just now getting around to funding the emergencies that occurred as a result of Hurricane Mitch, and the needs of our farmers are acute and critical. There is simply no excuse for the delay in providing the emergency funding in these areas. The concern I have is with the process. We cannot continue to do business this way. If we determine that this is an emergency spending measure, we ought to make sure that what we are funding are true emergencies and take care of our other priorities through the normal authorization and appropriations process. 
   We have the promise of a surplus. We ought not to abandon the fiscal responsibility that brought us that promise and has given us the chance to make real progress on debt reduction. We should not use the fact that we have our men and women in harm's way overseas as an excuse to go on a spending binge here at home. Many of the projects in this bill have merit. If it is an emergency, it ought to be in this bill. And we ought to take out the nonemergency spending, pass a clean bill, and get the emergency spending where it is needed, especially to our military. 
   In short, Mr. President, providing substantial emergency funding for our troops in Kosovo is the right thing to do. Providing long-overdue emergency funding for the victims of Hurricane Mitch is the right thing to do. And providing desperately needed emergency funding for our nation's farmers is the right thing to do. But combining these legitimate emergency requests with billions of dollars of nonemergency spending--no matter how meritorious the individual project--is the wrong way to do it. 
   With that, I yield back any time I may have. With great regret, I announce that I am unable to support the bill, although I fully support many of the priorities the bill includes.

   Lyt Yates--of the Sergeant at Arms, Printing Graphics and Direct Mail Branch--will retire on July 25, 1999 after twenty-seven years of loyal service to the United States Senate. He started his career on May l5, 1972 as a Computer Operator with the Sergeant at Arms Computer Center, and has worked his way up the ladder to his current position as Supervisor. As a valuable member of the Computer Center team, he was instrumental in assisting with the creation of payroll forms, letterhead and other Senate forms still in use today. 
   Over the years, Lyt has enjoyed working with Senate staff--assisting with countless individual requests, solving problems, and seeing the job through to completion. 
   He is looking forward to retirement with his wife, Joanna, in Midland, Virginia. His future plans include, traveling, wood carving and spending time with his eight grandchildren. 
   On behalf of his Senate family, I thank Lyt Yates for nearly three decades of outstanding and dedicated service to the United States Senate--and I wish him well in the years ahead.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I had appeared on two previous occasions today believing that would be the time at which amendments would be accepted only to find that that had changed. Because I, like the Chair, have responsibilities with the defense authorization committee and subcommittee markups, I may be absent when that time eventually arises. 
   I rise now to discuss, rather than offer, an amendment, which I will offer as soon as we are permitted to do so, that I hope will add an essential component to the larger debate we have begun about school violence and juvenile justice. 
   Given the last year of school tragedies in Arkansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Oregon, and now Colorado, discussions about seemingly random acts of school violence have moved from the school board meeting rooms to the kitchen tables of America. Our dialog has encompassed everything from Internet use and video games to gun control. If anything positive has resulted from these tragedies, it is that we, as a nation, have finally started to focus on school violence by acknowledging that this is a multifaceted problem demanding multifaceted solutions. 
   Unfortunately, the issue of violence in our schools is not new. Six years ago, I stood in this Chamber to talk about school violence and offered an amendment to create a 2-year 
   commission to study school violence. I acted in response to shootings that involved students and took place in the Norfolk area of Virginia. 
   When I spoke in 1993 about school violence, I mentioned that we had experienced a cultural change. In fact, I brought this very chart to the floor to illustrate that point. 
   In 1940, public schoolteachers were asked to cite the top disciplinary problems they dealt with on a routine basis. The list included: Talking out of turn, chewing gum, students making noise, running in the halls, cutting in line, dress code violations, and littering. The same list of routine disciplinary problems in 1990 looked like this: Drug abuse, alcohol abuse, pregnancy, suicide, rape, robbery, and assault. 
   That was 1990. If the same survey were done today, I suspect assault would rank even higher on the list. In the 1996-1997 school year, 43 percent of our Nation's schools had no incidents of crime at all. For those that did, the vast majority of crime involved theft and vandalism. But despite these facts, in the last year alone, 40 people have died as a direct result of school shootings. The most serious of them, of course, occurred 3 weeks ago today at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. 
   The most common questions asked following incidents of school violence are: Why? and, What could have been done to spot the warning signs and intervene before it was tragically too late? 
   In an effort to better educate school districts across the country about how to develop violence prevention and intervention strategies, the Secretary of Education and the Attorney General last August issued a comprehensive guide entitled ``Early Warning, Timely Response.'' The guide was developed with the help of experts from law enforcement, education, juvenile justice, mental health, and other social services and was based upon extensive research about violence prevention plans. The emphasis of this guide is communitywide involvement. 
   Our children come into contact every day not only with us as parents, but also with teachers, administrators, pastors, bus drivers, coaches, counselors, and so many others. We all have a responsibility to help parent and guide our Nation's children.  
   Furthermore, we all know that recognizing the warning signs of stress, depression, substance abuse, and violent behavior starts at home and extends well into our communities. We, as public officials, have a responsibility to work with States and communities to ensure that we are doing all we can to keep our schools safe. 
   That is the thrust of the amendment I plan to offer. It is about the Federal Government becoming a better, more responsible partner with States and localities to combat school violence in America. I use the word ``partner'' because there is not a single requirement that States or localities participate at all. 
   Instead, this proposal is about providing the sources and expert advice to States and communities and schools who worry today about school violence and want to renew their efforts to fight it. For those of us on both sides of the aisle who care deeply about education, this amendment is a recognition that good schools are safe schools. 
   In this spirit, the amendment I will offer, hopefully later today, establishes a national resource center for school safety and youth violence prevention and authorizes additional funding 
   to communities to develop violence prevention and intervention plans and to expand mental health services and treatment programs. 
   First, the national center that we envision will serve as an ``education FEMA,'' if you will. In the event of an incident of school violence, the center's experts would be dispatched directly to the school involved to provide emergency response services. The center's team of experts would provide crisis counseling, additional school security personnel, and long-term counseling for students and families who chose to take advantage of these services. 
   Second, the center will establish a toll-free, anonymous student hotline so that students may report, without fear of retaliation, criminal activity or threats of criminal activity and other high-risk student behavior they witness or of which they become aware. For example, a student could call such a hotline to report another student's substance abuse or gang affiliation. The center would work with the Attorney General to develop guidelines about how to coordinate with law enforcement agencies to both relay the information and protect student privacy. 
   The importance of this hotline became apparent to me during my own research on this bill, as well as during the visit I made with President Clinton to T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria, VA, just 2 days after the shooting in Littleton. It is clear to me that there has been a void in our legislative approach to promoting school safety. 
   While we have substantially increased the funding of school safety plans under the COPS program over the last 2 years, we need to do a better job of encouraging and teaching our children that students themselves also have a responsibility to report high-risk or threatening behavior of which they are aware in themselves or other students. But to effectively encourage this, we have to provide students with safe channels through which to report this information. A student who is aware of a plan to build bombs or knows that another student is suicidal should have a confidential way to report that knowledge. 
   In the long run, an investment in prevention is an investment not just in the child who may be on the brink of pulling the trigger or throwing the bomb, but an investment in the safety of all our children who can all too quickly become tragic victims. 
   Third, the center will provide training and technical assistance to teachers, administrators, parents, law enforcement personnel, and others in communities about ways to develop effective school safety strategies. Components include helping schools effectively utilize tip hotlines, assisting with threat assessment, helping create partnerships among police, schools, parents, and social service agencies, developing media and police protocols to handle emergencies and, very important, working with the Departments of Justice, Education, and HHS to help train teachers to learn to identify students at risk of bringing violent behavior into their schools. 
   Fourth, the center will serve as a clearinghouse of information about model school safety plans across the country, with the center's staff available to offer a wide array of plans to a community seeking assistance, from increased use of surveillance equipment to a community case management process to deal with troubled youths. This includes the operation of a nonemergency, toll-free number for the public to obtain information about school safety. 
   Finally, the center would conduct research about school violence prevention and the extent to which smaller learning communities help reduce incidents of violence in our schools. We can do all this for less than $100 million. That is the center's authorization in the legislation that we plan to offer. 
   From emergency response teams, to the student hotline, to the teacher training to identify violent behavior in school, this small investment in an education FEMA is well worth the expense. 
   In truth, however, nothing can ever compensate a family for the loss of a child. But we ought to be able to say to all communities throughout this country that we are doing everything we can to prevent these tragedies from happening in the first place. 
   The second part of this amendment provides direct support to communities as they look for resources to develop or enhance their own school safety and youth violence prevention services. I believe communities will benefit tremendously from this amendment, because it authorizes more funding for comprehensive community-wide school safety plans under the Safe Schools/Healthy Students Program, an existing program that was enacted in response to the tragic incident in Jonesboro, AR. 
   I will not go into detail about this part of the amendment because I know Senator KENNEDY has been working on these issues for some time now and has particular expertise about the combined work that the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services have done with communities that have come together to improve or establish mental health services for violence-related stress and other types of community efforts. I certainly applaud the Senator for all he has done in this regard. He has been an outstanding advocate for children and families over the years. 
   Let me conclude by saying as a public official and as a former marine, I have long believed that the first responsibility of the Federal Government is to keep our citizenry safe--safe from enemies both foreign and domestic. Americans have a right to be safe in their homes, on their streets, and in their workplaces. And our children have a right to be safe in their schools. 
   Fear of violence should not threaten our children's learning environment. The bottom line is this: We cannot have good schools unless we have safe schools. As I said at the outset, there are many components of this debate about school violence and juvenile justice. We need to talk about parenting and values and teaching our children about respecting their lives and the lives of those around them. 
   We need to talk about how we hold accountable those who endanger or harm our children. We need to talk about guns and the extent to which there are loopholes in existing laws that can be changed to better protect our children. But there is absolutely no question that we need to talk about prevention, and this amendment builds upon the work Congress has already done in the area of prevention. 
   This amendment will be just one component of a debate that I hope we will all support to help our kids and their families, America's teachers and counselors, our law enforcement officials, and entire communities across our Nation who have one goal in common--to stop school violence before it starts. 
   Here in Washington we can do our constructive share. We can provide expertise. We can provide resources directly to communities. We can empower communities to better protect America's children. We can, and we should. 
   As I said on the floor last week, simply going to school should not in and of itself be an act of courage. 
   With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, this bill is designed to address problems that are not being met at this particular point. The distinguished Senator from Utah makes the point that there are duplicative programs. There are many programs in many areas of the country, some statewide, some local, some in jurisdictions that can afford to provide the kind of services that this Senator would provide, but what this bill attempts to do and would do, if approved, is provide a national center which will provide the hotline services that many school districts simply cannot afford. 
   Many States are indeed putting hotlines together. 
   In my State yesterday, the Governor announced the establishment of a hotline, but a number of States do not have them; many local jurisdictions do not have them. This will provide for the States that do not have the resources to meet these needs, not only with respect to the hotline, but with respect to providing technical assistance, providing any kind of help that the particular school or students who recognize a need for assistance might designate. 
   It will not require anything. It will not compel any jurisdiction to take on any new responsibilities, nor use any of the facilities that are available. But it will provide at one place the kind of technical response which can respond to these emergencies when they occur so that we have the expertise immediately available in terms of emergency response, we have the type of expertise that can assist school systems and other districts in putting together their own plans to deal with problems that fall into this particular area. 
   With respect to the other part of the bill, I yield now to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, who is the author of that particular provision.

   Mr. ROBB. The Senator from Minnesota would like to respond as well. 
   I will say, again, to address the specific concern raised by the Senator from Utah with respect to the duplication, this is an effort to provide one-shot, one-stop assistance to States, localities, individuals and others who need assistance who are currently uncovered by any of the programs that are in effect. 
   If this program is as effective as we believe it can and will be, it may be that some of the other programs will ultimately be folded into this protection. We do not need 100 or several hundred different hotlines. They are desirable if the local jurisdiction can afford them. In this case, we will have a national clearinghouse, a national hotline. We will have the coordination of the Department of Justice and the Department of Education. That is what we are trying to accomplish in a single bill.

   Mr. ROBB. I see the Senator from Delaware approaching. Does he desire to speak on this? 
   In that case, I think the differences have been explored. Once again, I suggest to you that this is an attempt to codify and collect in one place the wisdom of those professional agencies and institutions which we look to for guidance in this particular area to address the problem the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts has related to us and which all of us know in terms of our personal experience is a very serious problem that cannot be ignored and simply cannot be solved solely by locking people up, no matter how much we might think that actually addresses the problem. 
   So I would again observe that this is a desire to make a collective opportunity available for those institutions that may not have the resources to take advantage of the various provisions of this bill and to provide additional funding for a program that has been demonstrated to work. 
   With that, I yield back----

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to introduce legislation that I have been working on for several months and had not planned to introduce until later this year when the Senate considers the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. However, the tragic event in Littleton has moved everyone's timetable forward. 
   When I was Governor of Virginia, education was my top priority. I might note that I know it was a top priority for the Presiding Officer when he was Governor of Ohio. Since I have been in the Senate I have become increasingly concerned about school safety. We simply cannot have good schools unless we have safe schools. 
   In 1993 I was able to get legislation enacted to create a commission on school violence. Regrettably, that commission was never funded, but it should have been. Two years ago the Senate approved an amendment I offered to allow COPS funding to be used for school safety. Last year we significantly expanded on that program, and I am grateful for the Senate's and the President's commitment to that important effort. 
   Over the past year, a year in which we have had too many horrible tragedies in our schools, we have all noticed that the most common questions asked following an incident of school violence are: Why didn't we see it coming? What could we have done to spot the warning signs and intervene before it was too late? 
   The legislation I offer today is designed to address one essential component of the school violence crisis: Prevention and intervention. In the coming weeks the Senate will consider a variety of proposals to address the issues of preventing school violence, how to manage crises when they occur, and how to punish those who engage in violence in our schools. I look forward to working with our colleagues to develop a comprehensive approach to school violence which incorporates this legislation and acknowledges the need for prevention and intervention efforts. 
   Out of respect for the families in Littleton and deference to the majority leader's request that we not take up  legislation until next week at the earliest, I will not make extended remarks at this time and will defer to a later time. For now, I simply offer my continued prayers for those in Littleton who are still coping with a tremendous loss to their community. 
   Simply going to school should not be an act of courage.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to endorse emphatically granting to the Commander in Chief the authority he needs to achieve our military objectives and the objectives of our NATO alliance against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Rather than considering limitations to the President's powers, as they are interpreted through the War Powers Act, we ought to be singularly focused on aiding his ability to prosecute and end this war as quickly as possible. That is why I am an original cosponsor of this resolution permitting the use of all necessary force and other means to accomplish our goals in the Kosovo region of Yugoslavia. 
   We are now weeks into an air campaign that may last months. Americans need to prepare themselves now, psychologically at least, for war. War is not risk free. We have to accept the fact and the responsibility that goes with it that we may well lose significant numbers of American lives, and we can't wait to see how it turns out before we risk taking a stand for which we 
   will be and should be held accountable. 
   The longer we exhibit a lack of resolve to see this through to conclusion, the longer it is going to last, the more it is going to cost, and the greater the risk that the U.S. and alliances' casualties will mount. In effect, Mr. President, we are exacerbating everything we purport to worry about--time, money, and, most importantly, lives--and we protract the suffering of those we are trying to save. 
   We cannot and should not tolerate defeat or compromise simply because we lack the will and conviction to win. Doing so would injure the credibility we fought so hard to rebuild in Operation Desert Storm. It is simply inconceivable to me that we would allow the confidence restored in American military power in Iraq to be frittered away in the Balkans. Given the importance of this military campaign, I was stunned by last week's House vote on support for current operations, and remain deeply concerned that individual feelings about our Commander in Chief seem to be influencing votes that have consequences that are so much more important than any Commander in Chief. 
   At the same time, I am deeply concerned about our unwillingness to accept responsibility for our position of world leadership. I regret that fewer and fewer of our citizens are willing to take necessary risks. There are beliefs and principles that our founders were willing to die for, and we cannot shrink from the challenge that we face today. 
   This resolution simply gives the Commander in Chief the options necessary to implement our military objectives, and it is consistent with my belief that winning the conflict is of paramount importance. 
   I commend Senators MCCAIN and BIDEN for their efforts today and urge support for the resolution and opposition to the tabling motion. 
   With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, when future generations search for ``lessons learned'' from America's 18th, 19th and 20th century military experiences, they no doubt will be accessible through dusty texts, dated documentary videos, or long-forgotten Congressional transcripts. 
   I am concerned, however, that these lessons will not carry forward into the next century as an enduring reminder of the true costs, and the true benefits, of waging wars, on behalf of freedom and democracy. 
   Increasingly, we have seen the gap between the military, and the rest of society, widen. 
   Early in the next century, for example, we expect that less than four percent of the population will be veterans, down from over 11 percent in 1980. 
   This means that fewer and fewer civilians will have a personal understanding of the military, making it more and more difficult to pass on to successive generations, one of our most powerful military assets--our experience. 
   How then do we ensure that we don't ``repeat'' our past mistakes--and that we build on our past successes? 
   Mr. President, I am joined by Senators HUTCHISON, of Texas, KERREY of Nebraska, HAGEL, REED of Rhode Island, SMITH of New Hampshire, CLELAND, ABRAHAM, and HUTCHINSON of Arkansas in introducing the National Military Museum Act. 
   It will teach visitors about each of the major wars in which America has fought. 
   Finally, it will help build pride, in our military, and the nation. 
   The United States, through the fine stewardship of the Smithsonian Institution, operates over a score of excellent national museums--from the National Portrait Gallery, to the National Postal Museum, yet none of these are dedicated to the armed forces. 
   In fact, the individual military services have many museums--the Army alone, has over 60. 
   We also have military artifacts and battles represented in sections of some of the Smithsonian museums. 
   Yet we do not have a single, prestigious, integrated national museum to tell America's military story and to honor our armed forces. 
   This is an extraordinary shortcoming in the telling of our national heritage. 
   By contrast, many of our key allies have national military museums. 
   The British Imperial War Museum, and the Australian War Memorial, are two fine examples. 
   The United States is a nation that has influenced world events decisively over the last century and will continue to do so for centuries to come. 
   And it is a military power that has sought not to conquer other lands, but to bring freedom, and democracy to the entire world. 
   History shows few if any nations, with such disproportionate means, employing force for such consistently altruistic ends. 
   Yet we have no national place to tell, this extraordinary story. 
   Mr. President, where, would a teenager interested in World War I, World War II, Korea, or Vietnam, go, to learn more about these wars? There really is no museum displaying artifacts from these wars, in a comprehensive fashion. 
   We do in fact have several fine Civil War museums, but the lack of representations of so many other wars is remarkable. 
   The idea of a National Military Museum goes back to the late 1800s. 
   Several attempts to build this museum, (including a concerted effort by President Truman) failed, for various reasons: inadequate funding, post-war disillusionment, or blueprints that were too ambitious.  
   Now, as we enter the 21st century, the time is right to display the enormous inventories of artifacts, that have been accumulated from this century--especially from conflicts since World War II. 
   As now envisioned, the National Military Museum would include display sections for each of the military services as well as separate sections for each of the country's major wars. 
   A spectacular atrium would house large items, from: missiles to ship sections to aircraft. 
   Based on a review of numerous potential sites, this legislation authorizes that the new museum be located on the Navy Annex property just west of the Pentagon. 
   Bounded symbolically, by Arlington National Cemetery, to the north, and offering a commanding view of the capital area, this location is ideal, and one of the last available parcels, in the area, suitable for a museum of this scope and importance. 
   The museum would share a large 55-acre tract of land with an expansion of Arlington National Cemetery and possibly other veterans' memorials. 
   The buildings currently on this land, are slated for demolition around 2015. 
   The National Military Museum Act establishes a National Military Museum Foundation, which will be responsible for the design construction, and operation, of the museum. 
   The Foundation's Board, will consist of 10 members, and their first action will be to conduct a study on the siting, design, environmental impact, and governing of the museum. 
   The Foundation may recommend that the museum, become part, of the Smithsonian Institution. 
   Assuming no Congressional action, upon receipt of both this study, and a General Accounting Office evaluation, the Foundation will proceed with final design preparations, and pursue fundraising. 
   Construction would begin after demolition of the existing Navy Annex buildings. 
   Mr. President, I am very pleased to introduce this legislative cornerstone, for building, one of the most important, and--I would anticipate--most visited museums, in the world. 
   Let us honor our nation's military with this long overdue museum. 
   Let us safeguard our past, so that future generations will know what has been done before--and what may have to be done again, in the future--to push back the forces of tyranny, and to preserve the freedoms, we are so fortunate to enjoy.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to announce my position on the cloture petition on the so-called Social Security lockbox legislation before the Senate. 
   First, let me say that I am disappointed with our Republican colleagues for making this a political issue. The fact of the matter is that both Democrats and Republicans in this body believe that Social Security surpluses should be protected and, absent extraordinary circumstances, should be used to reduce the public debt. Budget resolutions sponsored by both Democrats and Republicans abided by that rule. In essence, then, the legislation presented to us today is designed as little more than a political show vote that will give a basis for claiming that Republicans alone are committed to protecting Social Security while Democrats are not. Nothing could be more disingenuous. 
   Let me also say that we could use some truth-in-advertising around here. This is not even a true lockbox. There are significant exceptions included in this legislation. No. 1, the so-called lockbox allows for adjustment of its scriptures for emergency spending, with the likelihood that significant defense-related emergency spending will be enacted. As one individual commented, ``if we don't have an on-budget surplus to fund emergencies, then we adjust the debt limits to borrow from the Trust Fund.'' No. 2, it should also be pointed out that the debt limits can also be adjusted for whatever is deemed Social Security reform. That is so open-ended in my view it gives Congress a loophole through which it could easily evade the so-called lockbox altogether. 
   What concerns me most in this proposal, however, is that it gives the American people the false impression that this is the answer to our fiscal problems. Instead of just resisting the temptation to go on a tax-cutting or spending spree, dealing honestly with solving the long-term funding challenges in Social Security and Medicare, and paying down our enormous debt with the entire surplus, we claim that the lockbox, an artificial mechanism which only commits part of the total surplus to reduce the debt, is the most fiscally responsible thing we can do. What makes this proposal all the more disingenuous from our Republican colleagues is that the large tax cut that they hope to enact threatens most our ability to meet the scriptures of the so-called lockbox. 
   In the final analysis, this political stunt isn't worth risking the credit worthiness of the United States. 
   Mr. President, I agree wholeheartedly with the thrust of this legislation that the Social Security surplus  should be used to pay down the publicly held debt, although I would commit the entire surplus to that purpose. My concern is that the proposal before us is nothing more than an attempt to politicize an issue on which we all agree, and that it has the potential to do more harm than good by risking the credit worthiness of the United States.

   Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I thank my colleague from Minnesota for his courtesy. 
   Mr. President, I want to, first of all, say that I support the Ed-Flex bill, so I particularly appreciate my friend and colleague from Minnesota yielding just a couple minutes to me. 
   But like so many of our other colleagues today, I want to express my condolences to all of those in Littleton who have suffered such a tragic loss in such a traumatic event to the community. I think it was obvious last night when the President was asked after his statement if there was anything we could do to prevent tragic incidents like this from happening, he acknowledged that there aren't any easy answers. But we all know that recognizing the warning signs of stress and depression and substance abuse and violent behavior starts at home and extends well into our communities. Littleton, as other communities, is suffering in ways we can only imagine. My three daughters are now grown, but I cannot imagine the agony of waiting to find out what fate might have befallen them under similar circumstances. 
   I grieve with the families, as all others do. I note to my colleagues that I had introduced legislation in 1993 which I believed would make a contribution to the effort to reduce and prevent school violence. I plan to reintroduce similar legislation sometime in the next week or two. I welcome the work of any colleagues who desire to help. 
   I appreciate the fact that in 1997 we were able to divert money from the Community Oriented Policing Services funds to fund school safety initiatives, and we were able to increase those funds by tenfold in 1998. We can do more, and I hope the legislation I plan to offer will advance that cause. 
   But for right now, I simply join with all of our colleagues here in the Senate in expressing to those families grieving in Littleton, CO, and all over the country, that we understand the agony through which they are hopefully passing at this moment, and we will do our best to work with them. 
   With that, I thank the Chair and particularly thank my colleague from Minnesota for yielding to me. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Madam President, last week I offered a few comments on two great civil rights leaders, Ms. Rosa Parks and Mr. Oliver W. Hill. 
   Today, as we are on the verge of passing S. 531, legislation to award a Congressional Gold Medal to Ms. Rosa Parks, I want to speak again just briefly. 
   As I noted last week, our Nation owes Ms. Parks an immense debt of gratitude. It is gratifying to me that we have been able to move this legislation so quickly, and I think the great speed with which the Senate is acting is testimony in itself to our admiration of Ms. Parks. 
   No matter how eloquent our words or how eloquent we believe them to be, words can never match the simple act of this courageous woman. Ms. Parks herself has become a symbol for the courage and righteousness of the civil rights movement. When we think of her action, we cannot help but think of  the consequences --an historic bus boycott by 40,000 people, a decade of principled protests, and legal and legislative victories that helped make America more free. 
   Ms. Parks, an unassuming seamstress who stood up to segregation by sitting down in the front seat of a city bus in Montgomery, AL, now stands like a giant in the history of the 20th century. 
   I thank our colleagues and the leadership for their support for passing S. 531 today. While we still face too long a journey to end discrimination, Rosa Parks and thousands of individual acts of courage have made us more free and have inspired the rest of us to carry on in our own efforts. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

    Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'd like to use this occasion to honor a long-time friend, Mr. Gerald T. Halpin, who has shown that economic prosperity can go hand-in-hand with public service. Jerry Halpin is the Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer of  WEST*GROUP, a commercial real estate company based in McLean, Virginia, and he was recently honored as the 1998 Fairfax County Citizen of the Year by the Fairfax County Federation of Citizens Associations and ``The Washington Post.'' Jerry Halpin deserves this recognition, not just because he changed the face of Fairfax County as a visionary businessman, but also because of his vast record of quiet and selfless community leadership. 
   Anyone who is familiar with Northern Virginia is also familiar with Jerry Halpin's business accomplishments, although not everyone knows the full range of this self-effacing, public-spirited citizen's contributions to our community. In 1962, Jerry and three partners purchased a 125-acre farm on the crest of a hill in western Fairfax. On that crest he built Tysons Corner, which remains to this day one of the primary commercial centers in the entire region. His WEST*GROUP properties dot the area, and he has been responsible for the development, redevelopment or construction of office, retail, residential, resort, and industrial space for WEST*GROUP affiliates aggregating more than 12 million square feet. 
   In the midst of this time-consuming and successful business career, however, Jerry Halpin made the time to reinvest in his community. His specific contributions to this region are far too numerous to mention, although I would like to highlight a few. Thirty-five years ago, when the Fairfax County Park Authority was unable to secure sufficient funds to purchase land for a park site, he refinanced his home to cover the purchase price and then turned the land over to the Park Authority. Today, that land constitutes Burke Lake Park, one of Fairfax County's finest public recreation areas. As he was developing the WEST*GATE and WEST*PARK Office Parks in Tysons Corner, Jerry ensured that a net gain of trees existed after construction and donated land for a school, a ball park and transit stations. He played a major role in the purchase of various structures for Wolf Trap Farm Park, one of the finest facilities in the area, and dedicated substantial time to the Park as an early Trustee, Executive Committee Co-Chairman and Finance Committee Chairman of the Wolf Trap Foundation. On a more personal scale, Jerry was also involved in the landscaping of Trinity United Methodist Church and the Churchill Road Elementary School playground, both in McLean. A common thread runs through these disparate projects. Knowing him as I do, I am convinced that Jerry undertook each, not to advance his personal ambitions, but to promote the public interest. That's why many who live in the region are familiar with Jerry's commercial work but are less familiar with his public works. That is because Jerry is not a self-promoter, and I know he did not seek the honor that was bestowed upon him by the Federation of Citizens Associations. I am glad, however, that his selflessness has been recognized, not so much because Jerry needs awards, but because he provides the community with such a positive role model. 
   Despite his many years of work and service, Jerry Halpin is still going strong. He currently serves as Chairman of the Grand Teton National Park Foundation, as a Director of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, and as a Director and Chairman of the Finance Committee for the National Capital Bicentennial Celebration. These current activities build on many in the past, such as his service with the American Horticultural Society, the American Museum of Immigration, the National Parks and Recreation Association, the Virginia Museum of Science, the Boarder Baby Project Gala, and the Medical Care for Children Partnership Awards Dinner. Jerry has also volunteered his time and leadership skills to many charitable organizations including the McLean Project for the Arts, United Community Ministries, the Claude Moore Colonial Farm, Hospice of Northern Virginia, Fairfax Hospital and Northern Virginia Community College. 
   Jerry's civic participation has extended to various public boards and commissions. During my term as Governor of Virginia, I appointed him to the Governor's Task Force on Science and Technology and to the Governor's Joint Study Committee to inquire into the practicality of creating a Coal Slurry Pipeline in Virginia. Jerry served as a member of the Governor's Advisory Board on Industrial Development under Governors Holton, Godwin and Dalton. He was also a member of the Fairfax County Economic Development Authority and its predecessor organizations for over eight years. 
   Jerry Halpin has been a personal friend of mine for many years now. For over forty years, he has provided community leadership not only for Fairfax County, but to all of Northern Virginia and the Washington D.C. metropolitan area. The Fairfax County Federation of Citizens Associations and ``The Washington Post'' could not have selected anyone more deserving than Jerry Halpin to be the 1998 Fairfax County Citizen of the Year. George Hartzog, the former Director of the National Park Service, has called Jerry a ``treasure to mankind''--I couldn't have said it better.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to support this motion to instruct the conferees to set aside some of the on-budget surplus for Medicare. 
   The Budget Resolution approved by this body in March made the correct decision with regard to Social Security by devoting the off-budget, or Social Security, surplus to paying down the publicly held debt. That was the right thing to do, especially if we are not going to come to closure on a true Social Security reform plan that brings down future liabilities. 
   While the direction on Social security was the correct course, failure to hold some of the on-budget surplus to deal with Medicare takes us down the wrong fiscal path. Medicare's financial problems are not only more acute than Social Security's but also much more difficult to solve. The fact of the matter is that even under the reform plan considered in the Medicare Commission, solvency would not be significantly extended. 
   Given these facts, it seems to me that the smarter fiscal policy over the long-term would be to leave some of the on-budget surplus to address Medicare. Using it all for a tax cut significantly reduces our flexibility to prepare for the retirement of the Baby Boom generation and the demands on Social Security, Medicare, and our overall budget that will result from the doubling of beneficiaries eligible for these programs. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this motion to instruct if they are serious about acting in a fiscally responsible way to shore up Social Security and Medicare.

   Mr. ROBB. 
   Mr. President, late last summer, a Virginian contacted my office to request my intervention in a matter which had brought considerable anguish and frustration to her family. 
   She informed me that her father, a decorated veteran of World War II and a career civil servant, had recently passed away. Before his death, however, he made two simple requests: one, that his body be donated to science, and two, that his ashes be placed in the Arlington National Cemetery. His widow, now 72, honored the first of those wishes. But in honoring the first request, she found out that the second was precluded. 
   The family learned that, due to various legal concerns, ashes of organ donors who donate their bodies to science are not returned to the families of the donors. Unfortunately, due to the regulations governing Arlington National Cemetery, veterans cannot be memorialized in the Columbarium unless their remains are actually inurned there. Oddly, it so happens that if his spouse had predeceased him, her remains would already have been inurned in a niche at Arlington, awaiting his remains. 
   While I can appreciate that limited space at Arlington has necessitated adherence to strict guidelines for burial and memorialization, I cannot see the virtue in denying appropriate recognition for an entitled veteran simply because he has donated his remains to science. In fact, I would like to encourage more veterans to do just that. 
   All of us recognize the great need for viable remains for both transplantation and for medical study. Veterans who make this courageous commitment should be suitably recognized and their loved ones should know that a grateful nation has made a place for them at one of our country's most sacred memorials. 
   With that said, I submit this bill which seeks to modify current regulations to allow otherwise qualified veterans, who have donated their remains to science, to be memorialized at the Columbarium in Arlington National Cemetery, notwithstanding the absence of their cremated remains.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that will correct current calculations of federal retirement annuities that unfairly penalizes federal civil servants who switch to part-time service at the end of their careers. 
   The Congress included provisions in the 1986 Civil Service amendments contained in the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act that reformed the part-time service calculations for retirement, so that part-time workers would not receive the same annuities as full-time workers. I believe that was a fair and equitable reform. However, after receiving a letter from one of my fellow Virginians, L. David Jones, it is clear that there have been errors in the interpretation of the provision. 
   Mr. Jones worked for the Naval Research Lab until his retirement in February, 1995. He worked there full-time for 30 years and part-time for five years after his 30 years of full-time service. He elected part-time service at the end of his career to not only to ease into retirement, but to help his colleagues better manage an increased workload. But because of the misinterpretation of the provision, he would have been better off retiring at the end of his 30 years. Instead of being praised for his additional service, his situation now serves as a cautionary tale for others who wish to transition into retirement and help their colleagues: if you switch to part-time service after a long career as a full-time worker, your annuities will be reduced. Clearly, that is not the intent of the provision. 
   Mr. Jones and his wife sought judicial remedies to no avail. He and his family simply want his annuity calculated accurately. That is why I am introducing this legislation today. 
   Mr. President, by passing this legislation we will ensure that federal retirees like Mr. Jones and others are not unjustly penalized for working part-time at the end of their careers. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Government Affairs Committee to ensure its consideration and favorable recommendation as quickly as possible.

    Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I wanted to say a few words today about two civil rights leaders to whom this nation owes an immense debt of gratitude. Ms. Rosa Parks and Mr. Oliver W. Hill, both, in very distinct ways, took action that has helped make our children more free, our society more enlightened, our culture more enriched. 
   I was pleased to add my name to the list of cosponsors of S. 531, legislation to award a Congressional Gold Medal to Ms. Rosa Parks, who as everyone knows stood up to segregation by sitting down in the front seats of a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. It is difficult to adequately put in words the courage it took on the part of Ms. Parks to oppose decades of institutionalized racism. It is also hard to describe the pride we feel today in Ms. Parks' action, and in how our nation's conscience grew, although too slowly, in response to the bus boycott that followed. 
   Ms. Parks' action set off a 382-day bus boycott by 40,000 people, which in turn led to a federal court challenge and the end of Montgomery's segregated buses. The decade of peaceful protests that followed brought us a string of liberating Supreme Court decisions and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Today, Ms. Parks, an unassuming seamstress, stands like a giant in the history of the 20th century. 
   Mr. Oliver W. Hill, an aggressive attorney for the Civil Rights movement, is less well known. But Mr. Hill is no less courageous, and the contributions he made to this country deserve much greater recognition. For that reason, I've asked the President to award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom. 
   I describe Mr. Hill as ``aggressive'' because he trained as a warrior in the cause of justice: he went to law school specifically to overturn Plessy v. Ferguson. His training paid off. He prevailed in Alston v. School Board of City of Norfolk to grant equal pay for African American teachers. And he defended the rights of African American students in Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County, which was one of the five cases decided as part of Brown v. The Board of Education. Sadly, all this success was not without cost. Mr. Hill remembers the terrible telephone calls to his home, and the cross that was burned on his yard in Richmond. 
   The courage and accomplishments of this man and this woman are truly historic and important to our nation. I hope we can pass S. 531 quickly to recognize Ms. Parks, and I hope the President will decide very soon to reward Mr. Hill with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, through his work on the Medicare Commission, Senator BREAUX has offered some very strong recommendations to deal with our long-term problems in Medicare, and I hope that the Finance Committee will act expeditiously in considering these and other reform elements. While I share many of the sentiments expressed in this amendment, I don't believe it will bring us closer toward finding common ground on the Medicare question. Realization of comprehensive Medicare reform will require a genuine bipartisan effort from all parties involved, and we ought to be working to keep the political tension surrounding this debate to a minimum. I'm concerned that the wording of the amendment offered by Senator ROTH will further divide us rather than bring us together on this important issue. For this reason, I will oppose it.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to strike section 204 of the budget resolution, as well as the reconciliation instructions to cut taxes by $778 billion over the next 10 years without offsetting their costs. 
   I move to eliminate these provisions because they strike at the very heart of the fiscal discipline that has brought about the first unified balanced budget in 30 years. 
   In 1993, in President Clinton's first budget, we introduced a new pay-as-you-go rule in the Senate. This rule provided for a 60-vote point of order in the Senate against legislation that would increase the deficit over 10 years. That has served to keep the Senate and the Congress on a course of fiscal responsibility by requiring Congress to pay for any changes in revenues or direct spending. 
   The budget resolution before us, however, abandons the pay-go rule and allows Congress to spend the projected onbudget surpluses without offsetting their costs. 
   While supporters of this language promote this as a simple clarification of existing principles, arguing the pay-go rules were not to apply in times of onbudget surpluses, the Congressional Budget Office disagrees. 
   In my judgment, it would be irresponsible to abandon the very pay-go rules that brought us to this point when we still face a $3.7 trillion debt held by the public, and a total debt of over $5.5 trillion. 
   But, Mr. President, regardless of one's views on whether these rules were meant to apply in our current fiscal circumstances, I believe it is in our interest not to abandon the pay-go rules at this time. They have been instrumental in imposing fiscal discipline on this body, something that has been sorely lacking in previous years. 
   Paying for new spending or new tax cuts forces legislators to make tough choices. If we abandon this rule, we are saying, in effect, we don't have to make tough choices anymore. And that is particularly troubling when we make long-term decisions based only on projections, as we do today. 
   Mr. President, those who support this change are using it to pass a tax cut that would otherwise be subject to a point of order under the current pay-go rules. But I want to ask our colleagues, which is the more fiscally conservative position? Supporters of this new language may think of themselves as fiscal conservatives. In my view, the fiscally conservative position demands paying for other priorities and using the total surplus, not just the off-budget surplus, to pay down the publicly held debt. 
   By ridding ourselves of this debt, we dramatically increase our flexibility to solve some of our long-term funding challenges in Social Security and Medicare. 
   The budget resolution before us is short shrift to Social Security and Medicare by abandoning the pay-go rules and using the onbudget surplus for tax cuts. Once again, it puts short-term political interests ahead of long-term planning. As long as the only window we are looking through faces the next election rather than our economic strength in the next century, we will continue to put our focus on feel-good tax cuts at the expense of preparing for the future of Social Security and Medicare. 
   Bottom line, Mr. President, the responsible position is to maintain the  current budget rules and pay down the debt, and that is the proposition that Americans support. 
   We have a responsibility to the next generation to reduce the debt that clouds our Nation's future prosperity, and the way to remove that debt is to stick to the pay-go rules that have served us so well. 
   With this amendment, cosponsored by Senator GRAHAM of Florida, we will keep the pay-go rules, we will pay off the debt, and we will ensure that any tax cut doesn't threaten to plunge us back into the large deficits from which we have so recently been delivered. 
   With that, Mr. President, I yield back any time remaining. I thank the Senator from New Jersey.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, this is the third time this year that I've come to the floor to express my strong support to help states and localities build and repair our children's schools. I am concerned that this budget resolution, which often serves as our roadmap throughout the appropriations process, does not adequately take into account the urgent need that school districts are facing throughout the country. Not only do we have old schools in desperate need of repair, we also have a growing student population. States and localities simply cannot keep up with  their school construction and repair needs. They cannot pay for major infrastructure projects without our help. 
   Mr. President, this is what we know. We know that the average school building in the country is 50 years old. We know that GAO estimates that we need $112 billion just to repair old buildings to make them safe. And Mr. President, we know that over the last ten years, public school enrollment has increased 16.4% and that GAO estimates that it will cost an additional $73 billion to build the new schools we need to accommodate this surge in enrollment. 
   Mr. President, in Virginia, there are over 3,000 trailers in use. These trailers are not wired to the Internet; they're not even wired to their own schools network. Over the last two years, 38% of our school districts have been forced to close at least one building in each district due to facility-related problems. The most commonly reported problem was the insufficiency of air-conditioning and ventilation. In fact, our students have lost 38 days of instructional time--that's seven weeks--because of problems with the air conditioning. 
   But these problems are not unique to Virginia. School infrastructure problems exist everywhere. In Alabama, it is reported that the roof of an elementary school collapsed just after the children had left for the day. In Chicago, teachers place cheesecloth over air vents to filter out lead-based paint flecks from getting into their classrooms. In Ohio, there are even some children who use outhouses instead of modern-day restrooms. Roughly forty percent of New Mexico schools have inadequate electrical wiring, and fifty percent of Delaware schools report inadequate plumbing systems. 
   The list goes on and on. 
   Developing a budget is about setting priorities. I have long believed that we have three basic priorities which should come before all others: we should provide for our citizens a strong national defense, we should provide quality education for our children, and we should not pass on debt to the next generation. 
   When we consider the federal role in education, we should focus on helping states and localities to meet their pressing needs. And Mr. President we have pressing needs when it comes to the condition of our schools. It is a pressing need when we see children fainting in school because the building has no air conditioning. It is a pressing need when we see a child attending class in a trailer. It is a pressing need when we see leaky, unsafe roofs. I don't believe that any parent would deny that their children's needs come first. 
   We should not procrastinate in finding a solution to this problem. This amendment is broadly worded. It doesn't target the money to any particular population. It doesn't impede stats' efforts to begin their construction projects. Where there are disagreements on how to allocate federal funds to the states, or whether or not to target a certain portion of those funds, or whether to have more private sector involvement, or what amount of federal dollars we can afford, let's talk about those issues. But let's at least agree that we in Congress do have an important role to play. This amendment is merely an attempt to determine whether this Congress is going to recognize our national school construction crisis. Our states and localities have recognized the crisis and are reaching out for our help. 
   Mr. President, last session Congress recognized another infrastructure need--our national transportation need--and appropriated $216 billion for roads and transit projects. If we can recognize this national need, come together on a bipartisan basis, and pass legislation to build roads, surely we can come together to build schools. Schools are more than just classrooms, they're community centers. Schools provide more than just classroom instruction, they provide the keys to the future. 
   Mr. President, this amendment is a starting point. Let's at least send the right message to this Nation: that we see the leaking roofs, that we see the cracked walls, that we see all the trailers--and that we are willing to help. 
   I thank my friends, Senator LAUTENBERG and Senator HARKIN, and all those who have co-sponsored this amendment and I urge its adoption. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for Senate Resolution 53, which declares March 24, 1999 as ``National School Violence Victims' Memorial Day.'' 
   As a number of my colleagues noted, the past year has been a grim one for educators, parents, and students. The tragic events in schools in Arkansas, Kentucky, and Oregon shocked the conscience. I'm thankful that in my home state of Virginia, no one was killed at school in 1998. But this past summer in Richmond, a volunteer and teacher were wounded by gun fire from a fourteen-year-old student. All of these events were terrible blows to families and friends in each community. I hope today's resolution will give some solace to those communities, who will know that the Congress has not forgotten them. 
   For the nation as a whole, these events were a terrible blow as well, and I believe Congress has an obligation to follow up with a commitment to preventing future school violence because while schools are a relatively safe place for our children, the events of the past year have shaken our confidence. School children have written to me expressing the fear that they will be attacked, and I know their parents have similar fears. We cannot expect our children to achieve their best in such an environment. 
   We've already taken a number of steps that I hope will help allay these fears. Later this year, more than $165 million in school safety grants will be awarded by the Department of Justice's Community Oriented Policing Services program. I want to thank my colleagues, particularly Senators GREGG and HOLLINGS, for supporting efforts last year to increase funding for this program, which I initiated in 1997. I ask my colleagues to support funding for this important program again this year. 
   Later this year, as we consider juvenile justice reform legislation and the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Schools Act, I will be looking at other ways to help make our schools safer, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on that effort as well. Students should worry about their next test, not about their safety. Fear should not be a part of any school's curriculum.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today not only in my capacity as a U.S. Senator but also as a former U.S. Marine and as a father. 
   Along with Senators SNOWE, LEAHY, FEINSTEIN, KERREY, BINGAMAN, and others, I am offering an amendment that will permit the United States to shoulder unambiguously its responsibility, uphold the honor of the U.S. military, both at home and abroad, and begin to ease the grieving of 20 families who lost their loved ones in a tragic accident near Cavalese, Italy, last year. 
   On February 3, 1998, a U.S. Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler was flying low and fast through the Italian Alps on a training mission. Just minutes from its scheduled return to base, the pilot suddenly caught a glimpse of a yellow gondola off to his right at eye level. 
   A split second later, he spotted the two cables that carried the gondola, and, fearing for his life, he put the plane into a dive. His action probably saved the lives of the four-member crew, but it was not enough to prevent the wingtip from clipping the cables. 
   Unaware of the devastation left in his wake, he completed his mission and returned the damaged plane to Aviano Air Base. 
   The plane's wing had stretched and then snapped the cables supporting the gondola, which was then 307 feet above the valley floor. Inside were 20 people; among them, a Polish mother and her 14-year-old boy, seven German friends, and five Belgian friends, including an engaged couple. 
   I am told that those 20 people had just 8 seconds to live from the time the cable was struck. Eight seconds doesn't seem like a long time, unless you know you are going to die. 
   [Pause.] 
   That was eight seconds. The next day in Cavalese, Italy, a lone bell tolled. Shops ``closed for mourning,'' a memorial mass was planned and skiing was halted out of respect for the dead. And the families of those dead spent their first day of grief. 
   One year later, Cavalese is once again teeming with tourists. The cable car has been rebuilt, and a memorial stone erected. 
   One year later, however, the United States has not yet acted to accept full responsibility for those twenty deaths. Following a lengthy court martial, the pilot of the jet was acquitted of any criminal wrongdoing. President Clinton reacted by stating that the United States would ``unambiguously shoulder the responsibility for what happened.'' We need to follow those words with deeds. We need to accept our responsibility by compensating the families of the victims, quickly and fairly. While many factors contributed to this accident, and we may never know exactly which one was the proximate cause, we do know that it was our fault. They were our air crew. It was our plane. 
   Because there is no question whether the United States is responsible for the accident, the only question is whether we have the will to act honorably and settle the issue of compensating the families quickly--doing everything we can to not prolong their agony--for they have already suffered unspeakable grief. 
   Since last summer, I have repeatedly urged the Department of Defense to develop a mechanism that acknowledges our responsibility and allows the families to begin putting their lives back together. And I believe every official in the Department associated with this matter shares this desire to put the tragedy behind us. Unfortunately, the Department of Defense does not believe it has the authority to resolve these claims on its own. 
   This belief stems from the Department's conclusion that this case is governed solely by the Status of Forces Agreement, or SOFA, which regulates the relationship among the military forces of NATO allies. Following an accident in a host country involving a NATO ally, the SOFA requires injured third parties to file claims in the host country and pursue them as if the host country itself had caused the injury. Then, the claims are litigated or settled as the host country determines. Once a level of compensation is decided, the host country pays the claim and seeks reimbursement of 75% of that claim from the country at fault. 
   The Department of Defense has informed me of its belief that the SOFA provides the sole remedy in this case and that therefore the DoD does not have the authority to settle the claims of the families arising from this accident. 
   While I disagree with that conclusion, this amendment resolves the question. My amendment specifically grants the Department the authority they believe they presently lack, rather than forcing the families to wait to resolve this question in a judicial process that could take many years. The amendment allows the Secretary to settle the claims and sets aside $40 million for that sole purpose. 
   It leaves to the Secretary the discretion to determine an amount of compensation, but limits the Secretary to offering no more than $2 million for any single claim. Further, it requires the Secretary to move quickly and resolve the claims within 90 days after enactment of this legislation. Finally, my amendment explicitly avoids interfering with the ongoing SOFA process. 
   This is an important point. The SOFA allows civil claims to be decided in the host country but criminal allegations to be decided in the country at fault. This structure protects local citizens in the host country from having civil claims decided on the ``home turf'' of the wrong-doer, while also protecting our troops from criminal prosecutions in another nation. Some have suggested that if we adopt this amendment, we put at risk this entire structure of the SOFA. I fail to see the logic of this assertion. I doubt any country would move to scrap the SOFA and begin trying members of our military in their courts simply because we offered a supplemental payment to own up to our responsibility for a tragic accident. In fact, I believe such an act of acknowledgment would have just the opposite effect, and reduce the tensions that the acquittal in this case have created. My belief is based in part on the fact that three of our NATO allies who lost citizens in this accident support this amendment. In fact, the ambassador from Belgium wrote to me that his country ``would welcome each initiative that might contribute to a quick settlement of the claims of the victims' families. In that spirit, we fully support your proposed amendment to S. 544, the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, and hope that your proposal will gain the necessary support in the U.S. Senate.'' He goes on to state his belief that this  ``legislative initiative is not incompatible with the SOFA-procedure.'' The German and Polish governments share this view. 
   I've been sensitive to the concerns of the Department of Defense regarding the importance of the SOFA, which is why the amendment speaks in terms of supplementing the SOFA, not displacing it. The SOFA has worked well for over forty years and I have no intention of disrupting that process with this amendment. 
   But we also need to consider the purpose of that process. In 1953, when the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations was considering the SOFA, they wrote that the structure of the claims process was ``calculated to reduce to a minimum the friction that almost inevitably arises from [injuries caused by members of a foreign military] against members of the local population.'' In this case, however, I believe blind adherence to the perceived requirements of the SOFA is causing friction with our NATO allies, not reducing it. 
   The procedures established in the SOFA are designed to do justice. In this case, under these circumstances, justice is best served by having the United States take responsibility for the harm we've caused. 
   Last July, the Senate adopted unanimously a Sense of the Senate I offered stating that ``the United States, in order to maintain its credibility and honor amongst its allies and all nations of the world, should make prompt reparations for an accident clearly caused by United States military aircraft'' and that ``without our prompt action, these families will continue to suffer financial agonies, our credibility in the European community continues to suffer, and our own citizens remain puzzled and angered by our lack of accountability.'' 
   Since last July, each of our predictions have sadly been realized. Our allies, especially Italy where we have strategically important basing agreements, are outraged by our lack of accountability. They feel angry and betrayed. Americans everywhere cannot understand why we don't act to accept responsibility for the deaths of these 20 people. Editorial writers from the New York Times to the San Francisco Chronicle, the Cleveland Plain Dealer to the Atlanta Constitution have called for prompt and adequate compensation to the families of those who were killed. 
   Finally, I have met with many of the family members. Some have been pushed nearly into poverty, having lost their primary means of financial support. Last September, I met with three of the Belgian families, as well as the Polish doctor who would have been in the gondola with his wife and son if he had not strained a leg muscle and decided not to take the final run of the day. Last Thursday, I met with families of the German victims. 
   Having met personally with the families, I can tell you they are not angry with the United States, but they don't understand. They are grieving, but they are not greedy. They want accountability, but they are not vindictive. They simply want someone to be held responsible for the deaths of their children, their husbands, their wives. 
   That is what my amendment is about--responsibility. It is not about money. Compensation is no substitute for the companionship of a lost loved one. By resolving these cases now, however, the United States can clearly and unambiguously acknowledge its undeniable culpability in the deaths of these twenty people, something the families have so far sought without success. 
   In speaking with the families following the first court-martial, I have been struck by a single seemingly incomprehensible fact regarding its outcome. They were not so much determined that the pilot spend his life in jail. They simply sought closure on the question of who was responsible for the deaths of their loved ones so they could begin to cope with the loss. They also wanted the chance, at sentencing if it had come to that, to talk about those who had died. I invited them to do that when I met with them. As they described their children, I thought of my own. Last week, I asked the mother of one of the victims if she had a picture. She removed the locket from around her neck, with the photos of her dead son and his wife she keeps near her heart. 
   The Belgian families also shared pictures with me last September. I wanted to show those to you. Stefan, aged 28, shown here with his mother; and Hadewich, aged 24; and Rose-Marie, also aged 24. In an interview late last year, Rose-Marie's father said he drove by the graveyard every day, and said hello to his daughter. He explained why he did this: ``It's easy. We have lost our daughter, but she is still a little bit alive there. To say hello to her is a way for me to ease the stress a little bit. And it is also a tribute to her. I say: Rose-Marie, you gave us so much love and joy, I am trying to give it back to you as much as possible.'' 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and set aside $40 million for these families. To put that into some perspective, the plane involved in this accident cost some $60 million, and fortunately for us neither the plane nor the crew were lost. 
   In the Defense Appropriations bill last year, the Congress set aside $20 million to enable the town to rebuild its gondola, a project which has cost nearly $18 million to date. In fact, my amendment is modeled after Section 8114 of the bill we adopted last year, which set aside the $20 million from the Department of the Navy's Operation and Maintenance account to pay for ``property damages resulting from the accident.'' The President has acknowledged that our willingness to set aside these funds has helped ``speed the economic recovery process'' of the town. 
   Here is a picture of that new gondola. Last year, the Congress passed an amendment to help rebuild the gondola our aircraft destroyed. This year, the Congress should pass an amendment to help rebuild the lives of the loved ones our aircraft destroyed. Let us show the world we care as much about loss of life as we do about loss of property. 
   I urge adoption of my amendment. The honor of the United States is at stake. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, whatever frustrations many of us may have right now regarding our bilateral relations with China, including allegations of Chinese espionage against our national labs, the deteriorating human rights situation in that country, the ballooning trade deficit, and more, we need to be careful about micro-managing the Executive as it conducts comprehensive negotiations over the terms of China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). 
   Congress' voice ought to be heard on this subject, and it will be. The Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 precludes granting unconditional MFN (permanent normal trade relations status) without a Congressional vote. By law, we will have the opportunity to carefully review and pass judgment on whatever agreement the Administration reaches with China, whenever that may occur: during Premier Zhu Rongji's visit next month, later this year, or perhaps years from now. 
   Ambassador Barshefsky and the other USTR officials negotiating directly with the Chinese deserve credit for appropriately consulting with Congress. Just yesterday lead negotiator Bob Cassidy reviewed in great detail with our staffs all aspects of the negotiations. Active consultations at this stage make sense, but the Senate directly intervening in the process by requiring a congressional vote on a WTO agreement with China--on the front and back ends of the protocol negotiations--is redundant, unnecessary, and tramples on Executive branch prerogatives. On those grounds, I support the tabling motion.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I support a national missile defense. I have voted--repeatedly--to fund research and development that would make such a defense not just a theoretical hope but a reality. In the past, however, I have also opposed legislation identical to S. 257, the National Missile Defense Act of 1999 as it was introduced. I voted against it when it was reported from the Armed Services Committee. I did so, even though I unequivocally support providing our nation a real defense against missile attack, because I believed that as introduced the bill would not advance that objective and could possibly move us in the opposite direction. While it is imperative for the United States to deploy a defense against missile attacks by North Korea and other rogue nations, it is equally imperative that we consider affordability, operational effectiveness, and treaty implications when determining how best to proceed on such a major acquisition program. 
   Mr. President, the Department of Defense, in testimony before the Armed Services Committee, has made it very clear that we can't accelerate the national missile defense program beyond what we're doing right now even if we spend significantly more money on it. Yet the original legislation implied that money is no object, that we should forgo our basic responsibility of getting the best defense possible for the taxpayer's dollar. I am concerned--as are many of our colleagues--about numerous, severe problems our military faces today, that can be resolved with proven technologies. Our forces are operating at OPTEMPOS unheard of even during the Cold War. Their equipment is often older than the operators, and spare parts are regularly in short supply. It is no wonder that we are facing one of the most pressing recruiting and retention challenges since the hollow force of the seventies. Passing blank check legislation is not, in my view, responsible, and not in the best interest of our military. 
   Fortunately, changes were made to the original legislation that addressed some of my concerns. The Cochran amendment subjects national missile defense deployment to the normal authorizing and appropriating process, allowing us to retain fiscal control over the program. This reinforces the need to ensure that any system we approve be affordable and operationally effective before deployment. 
   Mr. President, the bill in its original form was silent on arms controls. It is clear from hearing the comments of several Senators in support of this bill that they believe the ABM Treaty is of marginal consequence when compared to deploying a missile defense capability. The virtual certainty that the Russians will retain thousands of nuclear warheads if we undermine the ABM Treaty has been brushed aside as a minor annoyance. No matter that the existence of these thousands of additional weapons greatly increases the likelihood of the kind of accidental launch that a national missile defense would defend against. No matter that, by undermining the strategic arms control process, we prompt China and other nations--including so-called rogue regimes--to develop or expand their nuclear arsenals and create the very kind of threat that our limited missile defense is supposed to protect against. 
   The Landrieu amendment, by reinforcing the need for continued arms reduction efforts 
   with the Russians, addressed this short-coming in the original legislation. 
   As a result of these modifications, I am now willing to support this bill. I caution, however, that this legislation really accomplishes nothing that will have a meaningful, positive impact on the pace and quality of our missile defense development efforts. While it is appealing to declare a policy, such a declaration doesn't move us closer to the goal, and may in fact cause the American people to gain a false sense of security. We should acknowledge the risk that we could be giving the American people the false impression that by passing this legislation we are somehow approving deployment of a protective shield to safeguard them from nuclear missile attack. At best we'll get a very limited defensive capability. At worst, we will have spent tens of billions on top of the $40 to $80 billion already spent on missile defense since 1983, our troops will continue to struggle with a high OPTEMPO and inadequate equipment due to inadequate funding, the Russians will not honor START II limits--even after ratification of the treaty, and we will have a system that is not operationally effective. 
   Regardless of the outcome of the vote on this legislation, we will continue to develop a missile defense to protect our nation. The issue surrounding missile defense is not that we don't want such a system--the problem is we don't yet know how to build one we can afford. I remind my colleagues of the Pentagon's dramatic claims of success by our Patriot missile batteries during the Gulf War. It was only after the war that we learned that there were very few if any effective intercepts of the Iraqi Scuds. The technology wasn't here then and it has a long way to go today--especially when it comes to ICBMs. 
   And we should not let our focus on providing such a defense divert our attention away from the other crucial element in protecting America from missile attack: reducing the number of missiles aimed at our nation. A number of colleagues shared my concern about the effect of this legislation on our efforts to reduce the Russian arsenal through the START II process. 
   Mr. President, I will support this legislation because we have addressed the largest potential down-sides and because I support the objective of providing our nation with an effective missile defense, but we still have a long way to go before we actually solve the challenges we face and we ought to be up front with the American people in describing where we are in this process.

   Mr. ROBB. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Arizona. And he is, indeed, my friend. On most issues we are as one, particularly as it relates to our Nation's defense, and many other areas, sometimes taking on some tough issues. 
   This is one of those areas where we disagree. We have a fundamental disagreement with respect to the scope of the legislation that we passed some 13 years ago, and whether or not Congress should still have its hands in and control of the local regional airport authority. But I thank my friend from Arizona for not offering an amendment that I was told about an hour ago he was going to offer which would in effect have told the local airport authority not only that they could not have their nominees approved, that they had to have additional slots and change the perimeter, but tell them exactly how  to spend the money that they were going to get. 
   I thank my friend from Arizona for not doing that because that, frankly, would be an additional insult to the authority that Congress granted to the local authority some 13 years ago. We are going to have a significant discussion about the wisdom of Congress meddling in the local airport authority's jurisdiction to determine its own fate and make its own decisions with respect to the number of flights, the impact that the number of flights has on noise pollution, on safety, on the convenience of customers, and a number of other factors that are involved, and whether or not we ought to allow the two airports, working together, to work out a plan that helps both of them grow and both of them to serve the greater Metropolitan Washington area. 
   But for now, recognizing that there is a longstanding, legitimate need to release some of the airport improvement funds, I thank my friend from Arizona for at least allowing us to get what I understand--and I haven't still read the entire amendment--is about $30 million, which is $10 million more than we had a little while ago and with less strings attached. For increasing the number--it is not the $200 million that the airports are owed, but it is $30 million that will allow them to get started on much delayed, very important projects, particularly out at Dulles International--I thank my friend from Arizona for this modified amendment. 
   I join not only my friend from Arizona, but the distinguished senior Senator from Virginia and urge its passage as soon as it is the will of the Senate to do so. With that, Mr. President, I thank the Chair and, again, I thank my friend from Arizona. We will have more opportunity to discuss the full merits of this legislation at a later time.

But it is a merit-based discussion, and I do look forward to having that with Senator MCCAIN at the appropriate time. But for right now it is important to have the $30 million available to us.

   Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President. And I thank my colleague from Massachusetts for his leadership on this bill as well. 
   Mr. President, I would like to congratulate our colleagues, Senators FRIST and WYDEN, for their efforts to provide States and localities with greater opportunities to be innovative in their use of Federal funds. 
   This bill provides States and localities with the flexibility and freedom from Federal regulations that is often necessary for States to best serve their children and parents in providing top-notch educational services. 
   As a former Governor, I am particularly sensitive to the argument that too many Federal strings and regulations make Federal assistance seem more like a Federal burden. This legislation, while not a panacea for all of our educational needs, returns flexibility to the States in a way that is effective and helpful, but that still requires States to be accountable for positive results as they provide public education to our Nation's children. 
   I thank the Senators for their insight and their sensitivity to the concerns of our Nation's Governors, legislatures, and school officials, and I urge my colleagues to 
   support this bill--on final passage--if and when we get there. And I hope we will get to that point as soon as possible if we can reach some agreement on relevant amendments. 
   Mr. President, I also thank Senators HARKIN, LAUTENBERG, KENNEDY, and many others for the opportunity to talk about an amendment that we still hope we will be able to offer in due course which recognizes a sad reality faced every schoolday by too many children and teachers across the country. 
   We all say--here in Washington, in every State capital, and in every county, city, and town--that education is important. Indeed, it is critically important. But those words must ring hollow to the millions of children who walk through the doors of their schools to find leaky roofs, crowded classrooms, and woefully inadequate heating and air-conditioning systems. The state of too many of our schools is deplorable. 
   Mr. President, in spite of the relatively good economic times, many States are experiencing, many local governments are experiencing just the opposite, and they have not been able to meet the school construction and renovation challenges that are facing our Nation. 
   This is an area where the Federal Government can and we believe should play a pivotal role without interfering with the longstanding preference for local control of education. The Federal Government can be a meaningful partner in contributing to the vital national interest that our students receive a good education in an environment that is conducive to learning. 
   Mr. President, the General Accounting Office estimates our national school infrastructure repair needs total some $112 billion. That same GAO study also estimates that we, as a Nation, need $73 billion to build the new schools that are required to accommodate the rapid growth in our public school enrollments. 
   In addition to all of the findings in the amendment that we still hope to have an opportunity to be able to vote on, I have similar data from my own State of Virginia which indicates not only tremendous infrastructure needs exist, but our State and local governments simply cannot afford to foot the bill by themselves.  
   A 1998 report on school infrastructure, requested by the general assembly, found that while localities estimate that school construction investments of $4.1 billion will be made in the next 5 years, school construction needs in Virginia could exceed $8.2 billion. Virginia Governor Gilmore and the members of the general assembly approved a school construction repair plan this year which I applaud, but which only meets 3 percent of that unmet burden. 
   While there is no question that every dollar counts, and helps, I have heard from students, parents, teachers, administrators, school board officials and legislators about the need to complement Virginia school modernization construction efforts. 
   Earlier this year, the Thomas Jefferson Center for Educational Design at the University of Virginia issued a report which not only echoed the need for more school construction funds, but also detailed the alarmingly unsafe or inadequate condition of many schools in our Commonwealth. 
   Classes are being held in over 3,000 trailers; 2 out of 3 school districts have held class in auditoriums, cafeterias, storage areas, and book closets; and 3 percent of Virginia school districts had to increase the size of their classes in order to accommodate their growing student population. 
   While I don't let public opinion polls determine how I vote on issues I believe it is appropriate to note that there is overwhelming public support for Federal help in the area of school construction funding. 
   In a recent poll conducted by Republican pollster Frank Luntz, 83 percent of Americans surveyed supported significant Federal school construction spending and indicated that it should be a top priority of Congress. 
   Still, some believe that our nation's infrastructure needs in other areas are just as compelling as our school construction and repair needs. 
   In a statement made to the Finance Committee last week a Public Finance Specialist with the Congressional Research Service concluded that the ``condition of America's school facilities may or may not be worse than the condition of other capital facilities of other State and local public services.'' This statement would seem to imply, Mr. President, that the Federal Government should not attempt to prioritize infrastructure needs. 
   Last year, however, Congress approved $216 billion in road and transit funds. 
   We were obviously willing to concentrate on transportation needs during our last session. 
   Why shouldn't we concentrate on school infrastructure needs this session, particularly in light of the 1998 Report Card for America's Infrastructure issued by the American Society of Civil Engineers, which rates our public schools as being in the worst condition among all public infrastructure. 
   The simple fact Mr. President, is that prioritization is our responsibility. 
   Many years ago, when faced with enormous transportation needs as well as a large growth in our nation's student population, President Eisenhower proposed a massive national infrastructure project in his 1955 State of the Union Address. 
   This project resulted in the building of many of the nation's schools in existence today. 
   Mr. President, Loudoun County in Northern Virginia has determined that, because of the enormous growth of their student population, they need to build 22 new schools. 
   That figure doesn't even address their repair needs. 
   And just down the road, at Chantilly High School, which I visited last spring with Education Secretary, Dick Riley, students are sharing lockers, attending classes in over a dozen trailers that have poor ventilation, and are so crammed in the hallways when they change classes that school officials were actually considering banning bookbags and backpacks. 
   Mr. President, I received a compelling letter from the Superintendent of Schools in Caroll County, VA, about that county's school construction needs. 
   Superintendent Oliver McBride outlined that the average age of the school buildings in Carroll County is 45 years. Carroll County school officials estimate that their school construction needs total $61 million. 
   Mr. McBride wrote,  
   We have been particularly pleased with the interest and response of the members of the Virginia General Assembly and Governor Gilmore who have and are seeking to make additional funds for school construction available to localities in the State. We certainly would encourage the U.S. Congress to become a participant in this effort as well ..... Simply stated, we need your help.  
   Mr. President, our efforts to help States and localities build and renovate schools in no way jeopardizes their autonomy with respect to education. It merely acknowledges the need for the Federal Government to complement the efforts of many States and localities that are now wrestling with the question of how to repair and equip old schools, and how to build new schools. 
   Mr. President, it is our children who pay the price if we fail to acknowledge that Federal school construction funding is both imminently appropriate and critically important. 
   And if my colleagues want to debate how we allocate school construction money, whether we target any funds to specific districts, how we avoid creating too many Federal strings, or how we can make it easy for States to take advantage of this type of funding mechanism, I am more than willing to do that. 
   But the point is we need to engage in that discussion. And we need to begin now. 
   Our children, their parents, and our States need our help. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this sense-of-the-Senate amendment if we are permitted to offer it. 
   Let's at least send the right message to this Nation: that we see the leaking roofs, that we see the cracked walls, that we see all the trailers--and that we are willing to help. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank again my colleague from Massachusetts.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today, as I have done on two previous occasions, to introduce legislation to stem the flow--actually flood--of trash into Virginia and other States that have been affected. I am pleased to be joined, in doing so, by my senior colleague from Virginia, who will be joining us very shortly, Senator WARNER. 
   We have witnessed a virtual explosion in legislation in Congress focussed on rights. In recent months, Congress focused on the Patients' Bill of Rights, the Soldiers' Bill of Rights and the Taxpayer Bill of Rights. These are just a few recent examples. 
   The bill I am introducing today, along with my colleague, Senator WARNER, could be called a Bill of Responsibilities. It recognizes the responsibilities of the various levels of government to manage the huge volumes of trash we are generating. 
   The primary responsibility for taking care of trash lies with local governments. They are responsible for picking up the trash and they are responsible for finding a place to put it down. Local governments are also charged with the responsibility of making local land-use decisions and should be allowed to decide for themselves whether a community should be subjected to a large landfill that takes garbage from out of State. Recognizing the responsibilities vested in local governments, the legislation we are introducing today allows localities to ban unwanted out-of-State trash. 
   States have a responsibility for ensuring that the State's environment is protected and that its highways and waterways are safe. This legislation recognizes that responsibility, allowing States to override local government approval of out-of-State imports if local decisions on trash affect the State as a whole. To help States fund this responsibility, the bill allows States to assess up to a $3 per ton fee on out-of-State trash. This fee is similar to the out-of-State tuition that States charge students to come to their States to take advantage of host State's colleges and universities. 
   In addition, the legislation allows States to cap the amount of trash that can accumulate in landfills that have local approval. By allowing States to impose such a cap, this legislation strikes what we believe is the right balance between localities' desires to generate revenues by accepting waste and States's responsibilities to protect State resources, to provide a safe network of highways, and to ensure that State regulatory agencies are not overwhelmed by the influx of new waste. 
   This legislation also addresses the responsibilities of States that have refused to face the obligations of siting their own refuse. States that export huge amounts of waste are imposing a burden on those States that have created new capacity. The bill we are introducing sends a very strong message to States that ship more than 6 million tons a year to other States, although no State yet meets that threshold. The bill allows importing States to ban the garbage coming from such superexporting States. If the importing State chooses not to exercise this prohibition, the bill allows the State to impose large and escalating fees on those superexporting States that have not had the political will to site their own excess capacity. 
   While large regional landfills are becoming more common because of the expense of building modern and environmentally sound facilities, those landfills should accept waste on the basis of a region's cooperation rather than on the basis of a single State's abdication of its responsibilities. 
   Finally, this legislation recognizes the responsibility of the Congress to regulate interstate commerce. Because the Supreme Court has determined the garbage is commerce, like any other commodity, States and localities have been powerless to halt the disposal of out-of-State waste within their borders. While some States have attempted to limit out-of-State trash on their own, unless Congress acts to grant States and localities the ability to ban or limit out-of-State trash, those State laws are likely to be struck down as unconstitutional. 
   This legislation overcomes that constitutional hurdle by granting States and localities the right to restrict interstate trash disposal. If we again fail to pass legislation that protects localities from being buried under out-of-State garbage, we are abdicating our own responsibility to protect the quality of life of communities in each of our States. 
   The bills I have introduced in past Congresses focused on protecting localities from unwanted garbage. The bill Senator WARNER and I introduce today builds on that foundation. It reflects Virginia's most recent experience with importing garbage and addresses both the problems we have seen and the lessons we have learned. We now have enough history to examine the benefits and the possible burdens of host community agreements, and how they can best be used to develop state-of-the-art landfills. We also understand better the hardships that trash traffic can impose on communities that do not benefit from another community's decision to host a large landfill. Finally, it addresses a problem that has festered for too long, the inability of States to summon the political will to site their own capacity. I encourage the Senate to move quickly to consider this particular legislation.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my senior colleague, Senator WARNER, in introducing legislation to put an end to the strangulation of the Capital region's airports. As Senator WARNER just indicated, more than $200 million in airport improvements are on hold, and have been on hold since October 1, 1997, as part of an effort to strong-arm the region into accepting more flights at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. 
   I believe this tactic is outrageous. It is bad enough that the Congress is trying to micromanage local airports. As Governor of Virginia, I worked with my now colleague and senior partner, Senator WARNER, and then-Secretary of Transportation Dole to pass this legislation in 1986 designed to get the Federal Government out of the airport management business altogether. 
   The legislation that was enacted shifted control of the Washington airports away from the Federal Government and to a regional authority so they could effectively and efficiently manage their own airports, just like they do in every other State in the Union. 
   Even at that time, though, I was not particularly sanguine about the prospect that the Federal Government would not be able to resist the temptation to meddle with our local airports for its own ends. So I was not surprised at the efforts to add flights to National, and it is no secret that, notwithstanding a strong personal friendship that I and my senior colleague have with the distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee, we sharply disagree on this particular issue. But to block airport improvements and hurt this region's consumers in an attempt to force a policy change is simply wrong. 
   The Senate has the power to delay airport improvements at National and Dulles, because it must approve nominees to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority that manage both--both--Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport and Dulles International Airport. 
   Without the nominees, the airports cannot obtain grants under the Airport Improvement Program or use the passenger facility charges to fund projects. 
   These two programs are the lifeblood of airport funding. So Senate inaction on the nominees keeps Dulles and National from making improvements that can truly make a difference to consumers. 
   Proponents of more flights at National argue they are helping consumers. But blocking the nominees blocks major improvements that would also help consumers. 
   These improvements include easier passenger access between the terminals and parking, better access among terminals, improved baggage handling, and the renovation of aging facilities. 
   We should resolve the issue of the number of flights and the distance of flights at National with open debate and not through coercion. 
   The legislation Senator WARNER and I are proposing today severs the link between action on the nominees and action on airport improvements, and we urge our colleagues to support this effort. 
   Our proposal retains the Senate's role in approving the nominees. So if Members have concerns about airport management, those concerns can be addressed. But it is simply wrong to hold airport improvements hostage. It is time to rescue Dulles and National. We shouldn't allow the critical improvements at both airports to remain captive any longer. 
   I am very pleased to join my senior colleague. I yield the floor.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to offer the special incentive pay amendment to S. 4. 
   I am pleased to be joined in offering this legislation by our colleague from  Massachusetts, Senator KENNEDY, Senator CLELAND from Georgia, Senator KERREY from Nebraska, and Senator BINGAMAN from New Mexico. 
   Yesterday, Mr. President, a number of our colleagues, among them Senator ALLARD, described the acute challenges that are faced by the Navy as it struggles to retain sufficient numbers of critical personnel like Navy SEALS, surface warfare officers, nuclear-qualified officers, and career enlisted fliers. 
   While S. 4, with its significant pay raises, improved retirement and enhanced GI bill benefits is an important step in the right direction, we still have big problems in these smaller categories of military service where we have been only marginally successful in our retention efforts. 
   This amendment begins to address the downward retention trends the Navy is experiencing in these areas by aligning pay increases with problem specialties.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, this amendment is the aviation career officer special pay amendment to S. 4. I am very pleased to be joined in offering  this amendment by the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Senator MCCAIN. He has been a major force in taking care of our military aviators for many years, and I am very pleased to have Senator MCCAIN as a cosponsor as well as the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, Mr. BINGAMAN. 
   Mr. President, my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee are all very much aware of the serious retention problems now faced by DOD, and especially those pertaining to pilots. The Air Force, for example, is losing three pilots for every two pilots it trains. You don't need to have a math degree to understand the implications of that statistic. To quote Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Mike Ryan, this is ``one of the most serious pilot force challenges in Air Force history.'' And the Navy's situation is no less daunting. 
   Current law allows aviation officers from O-1s to O-5s with 6 to 13 years of service to receive a bonus of up to $25,000 a year if the officer agrees to complete 14 years; or up to $12,000 per year if the officer agrees to complete 1, 2, or 3 additional years. 
   While existing law was intended to fix retention problems in specific aviation communities such as the F/A-18 community, retention problems are now showing up across the board. This amendment is straightforward. Its intent is to give DOD maximum flexibility to stop the widespread hemorrhaging of pilots. The provision broadens eligibility from anywhere from 1 to 25 years of service and allows for up to $25,000 for each year of extended duty. 
   DOD's retention and recruiting problems can grow rapidly. Indeed, many problems that DOD did not even report just a year ago were reported with alarm just 6 months ago. We need to give the Department the flexibility and the headroom to manage a serious and unpredictable problem that cannot be adjusted only once a year by the Congress. 
   To address concerns that we are ceding too much authority to DOD, this authority must be renewed after 5 years, and the Secretary of Defense will be required to report annually to the defense committees on the impact of this increased authority on the retention of aviators. 
   This provision is supported by the Department of Defense and is included in the budget request. The flexibility afforded by this provision reflects a consensus of service views developed and will allow each service the ability to tailor compensation programs to meet their specific retention challenges and to accommodate their unique career path requirements. 
   During a period of excessive and costly resignations, we simply cannot afford not to give DOD the tools it needs to fix the retention problem. I urge my colleagues to support this provision and help us to address one of our most serious readiness dilemmas. 
   I yield the floor. I ask for whatever action the managers may wish to take on this amendment.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. Chief Justice, colleagues, sitting in judgment of the President of the United States is not easy for any of us. It is particularly difficult for me because of the personal and political relationship I have had with this President over the last 20 years. We served together as Governors in the early eighties, as several of you did. We traveled together on foreign trade missions. We shared similar priorities for our States. At my urging, he joined the fledgling Democratic Leadership Council, which would later become an intellectual and organizational resource for his Presidential campaign. 
   From our earliest meetings, I recognized in him, as many of you have recognized, gifts of head and heart and a truly extraordinary range of political and communication skills that marked  him with a potential for greatness. It was not as a friend, however, but as a U.S. Senator that I took an oath to render impartial justice under the Constitution in this impeachment trial. I was fully prepared to convict and remove the President from office if I concluded that the articles charged met the test of high crimes and misdemeanors as envisioned by the framers of our Constitution, and if the evidence convinced me of his guilt beyond any reasonable doubt. That is the standard I would require to remove this President or any President from office. 
   As we wrestle with the decisions before us today, I believe that it is incumbent upon us to reflect on the consequence of these decisions tomorrow; for while this trial is about this President, it is also about the future of this Republic. We simply cannot escape the fact that what we do today will affect the strength and stability of our Nation because the actions we take, the precedent we set, directly affects the separation of powers and the independence of the Presidency as an institution. 
   The writings of the framers and the overwhelming consensus of the scholarship that has followed demonstrate that the mechanism for removing a President was central to maintaining the delicate balance of power among the three branches of Government. The Founding Fathers struggled to resolve the tension between making it too difficult to remove a President, thereby creating a king, and making it too easy, thereby creating a weak Chief Executive who would serve at the pleasure of the legislature. As more than 400 scholars concluded last November, the lower the threshold for impeachment, the weaker the President. 
   The resolution of this dilemma--where to set the standard for removal--occupied the brilliant minds of several Virginians who took part in our constitutional debates two centuries ago. When George Mason offered specific language to define an impeachment standard, James Madison worried about making the standard too low. In worrying, he replied that so vague a term would be equivalent to a tenure at the pleasure of the Senate. After much deliberation, our founders finally agreed that the President should be removed only for committing treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors against the United States. Thereafter, as we all know, a Committee on Style, which had no authority to make substantive changes, dropped the last four words, considering them redundant. 
   Alexander Hamilton defined impeachable activities as those that relate chiefly to the injuries done immediately to society itself. During the debate, Edmund Randolph, a Virginia Governor, reflected concerns. He stated that the Executive will have great opportunities of abusing his power, particularly in time of war when the military force and, in some respects, the public's money will be in his hands. Clearly, our founders created impeachment not to punish the President, but to protect the Republic. They had lived under a king and they didn't want another. 
   History and common sense tell us, therefore, that the threshold for impeachment should be high--very high. It should be difficult, not easy, to impeach a President of the United States because impeachment is the ultimate sanction for protecting the Republic. It is a weapon to be respected and feared, but wielded only under the most compelling circumstances. Similarly, history and common sense tell us that removing a President is not the same as removing a Federal judge. In James Madison's records of the debate at the Federal Constitution, he wrote, ``The judiciary hold their places not for a limited time, but during good behavior.'' The Executive was to hold his place for a limited term, like the members of the legislature. 
   Like them--particularly the Senate, whose Members would continue in appointment in the same term of 6 years--he would periodically be tried for his behavior by his electors, who would continue or discontinue him in trust, according to the manner in which he had discharged it. Likewise, removing a President is not the same as removing a member of the Armed Forces for violating the military code of conduct. The Uniform Code of Military Justice is required to maintain the good order and discipline for waging war and securing peace. And all of us who have served in the Armed Forces understood that we swore an oath to obey a code not required of any civilian, even those with the power to send us into harm's way--a civilian Commander in Chief, our Secretary of Defense, and Members of Congress. 
   Finally, removing a President is not the same as punishing a citizen in a court of law. Like any citizen, a President can be fully punished in court after he leaves office, and the failure to convict him in an impeachment trial in no way precludes a subsequent criminal prosecution. 
   If a President is subject to the law, then he is clearly not above it, as some have claimed. 
   Some also argued that since the President's oath requires him to faithfully execute the laws, any violation of those laws should thereby warrant his removal from office. While that argument may be appealing, it simply was not the standard adopted by the framers. Their standard was narrowly confined to treason, bribery, or other high crimes or misdemeanors. And it is against this standard that we are called upon to judge the conduct of this President. 
   I believe the President lied. When he came before the television cameras and addressed the American people, wagging his finger and denying that he had sexual relations with a subordinate employee, he lied. This offensive public conduct, which has caused me the greatest personal anguish, is an act that will be forever seared into our Nation's memory. His deception was calculated, politically motivated, and directed at each and every one of us. 
   Though clearly reprehensible, this lie did not violate any law and was not the subject of any article of impeachment. So, while I am convinced that the President lied to us, I am not convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he lied to the grand jury, which is the sole basis for the first of the two impeachment articles. 
   Despite the apparent strength of the evidence, the House of Representatives defeated an article alleging perjury in the President's civil deposition. They voted to impeach the President for perjury based solely on his testimony before the grand jury. Article I alleges that the President willfully provided perjurious, false, and misleading testimony to the grand jury. 
   I listened intently to the arguments presented by both sides, and I have read the President's grand jury testimony carefully. In my judgment, the President's grand jury testimony ultimately boiled down to a few irreconcilable discrepancies, and while often slippery, hair-splitting, legalistic, and, in the words of the President's counsel, ``maddening,'' was not perjurious beyond a reasonable doubt. 
   On article I, therefore, I will vote not guilty. 
   Article II alleges obstruction of justice, a crime difficult to prove because it requires a determination beyond a reasonable doubt about what a person intended by his words or deeds. 
   In this case, it is extremely difficult to determine whether the President's intentions were to obstruct justice in a civil or a criminal proceeding, or whether his intention was to mislead his 
   family and the Nation about an embarrassing personal relationship. While his intent is difficult to prove, the unconstitutional bundling of charges contained in article II is clear to me. 
   Article I, section 3, of the Constitution clearly requires that in an impeachment trial no person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of the Members present. The rule of law requires concurrence by two-thirds. 
   While article I, in my judgment, violates this constitutional requirement, at least it focuses on a single event. Article II is flagrantly worse. Drafted in the disjunctive and containing 7 subparts each alleging a separate act of obstruction of justice, the bundling of these allegations would allow removal of the President if only 10 Senators agreed on each of the 7 separate subparts. If, for example, 10 Senators voted to convict based solely on subpart 1 and a different group of 10 Senators voted to convict based on subpart 2, and so on, it would be possible to reach a total of 70 votes for conviction. But that total would not have been reached with a two-thirds concurrence on any individual subpart.  
   Such a pleading is not allowed under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and would be thrown out by every Federal court in the land. Surely the founders did not envision removing a President from office if no more than 10 Senators could agree on a given allegation. 
   Trying to justify this unconstitutional bundling by citing a similar approach in the Richard Nixon case is weak because the Nixon charges were not presented to the Senate. Trying to justify this unconstitutional bundling by citing the Senate impeachment rules is no more compelling since our rules cannot conflict with the Constitution. We simply cannot remove a President from office with an article of impeachment that so clearly violates constitutional standards that we are required by law to follow. 
   On article II, therefore, I will vote not guilty. 
   Thus, I will vote not to convict on both articles because the factual, legal, and constitutional standard for removal was not met. 
   I am not prepared to say, however, that perjury and obstruction of justice are not impeachable offenses, because I believe it would be a mistake to attempt to do that which the founders chose not to do--to define what is impeachable with specificity. 
   For impeachment to remain what our forefathers intended it to be--a deterrent to misconduct and a means to protect the Republic--future generations should be free in each case to examine the facts, apply the law, and follow the Constitution and to render impartial justice. That is the impeachment process we have inherited from those who came before us, and that is the precedent we bequeath to the ongoing chronicles of American history. 
   The legacy of this trial, I believe, is not what becomes of one man. This trial is larger than one man. The legacy of this trial is that the Senate, sitting as a Court of Impeachment, proved worthy of the faith of our founders to render justice. 
   No matter what judgment is rendered, however, this trial cannot exonerate the President. A vote against conviction is not a vote to condone his lying to the American people, nor does it suggest that any Member of the U.S. Senate believes that perjury or obstruction of justice charges are anything but serious. They are very serious charges. 
   Sadly, the vote we are poised to take on these charges has divided our Nation. In the eyes of too many of our citizens, this vote will represent either a nonmilitary coup attempt against a duly elected President or a victory for those bent on accelerating the moral decline of the Nation. In truth, this vote represents neither. A vote for acquittal indicates nothing more and nothing less than what it says. The case to remove the President from office was not proven. 
   We sit in judgment today not because we are free from human failings--I certainly have my share--but because our forefathers bestowed upon the Senate the responsibility of protecting the Republic by judging the President when articles of impeachment are exhibited by the House of Representatives. In doing so, they carefully and deliberately limited the scope of our judgment. 
   We are judging the President in his capacity as President, and we are called upon to decide only one issue--whether he should be removed from office. The Senate does not have the duty nor the capacity to rule on the broader character of the President. In our limited role, we are not called upon to judge him as husband and father, for that is the province of his family. We are not called upon to judge him as accused citizen, for that is the province of the courts. We are not called upon to judge him as sinner, for that is the province of God. And we are not called upon to judge his legacy, for that is the province of history.

    Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I'm pleased to be joined today by several colleagues in introducing legislation that will help with one of the nation's most pressing challenges for the twenty first century--recruiting teachers for our public schools. 
   The deterioration of our schools is evident. The Third International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) ranked U.S. high school seniors last among 16 countries in physics and next to last in math. We are failing to provide the quality of education that will not only ensure each individual student the skills needed for personal success and fulfillment, but also that the nation can maintain its economic--and intellectual--leadership into the next century. 
   Clearly there are many measures that must be taken to address this national dilemma. Our school infrastructure is literally crumbling. I was joined recently by Senator LAUTENBERG in introducing the Public School Modernization Act of 1999, which will support building new schools and repair and modernization of old schools to accommodate a growing school population and reduce class size. 
   Many schools have been left out of the information revolution. I have worked hard to help Virginia schools get ``wired'' to the Internet--indeed I've helped physically wire several schools across the Commonwealth. 
   But ultimately, nothing matters more for the education of our youth than quality teachers. The Department of Education estimates that the nation's local school districts must hire more than two million teachers over the next decade to meet growing enrollment demands. 
   This legislation builds on an existing program--the Troops-to-Teachers program established originally in 1993--to help bring experienced, well-disciplined role models with proven leadership skills into the public school system. Since its authorization, the Troops-to-Teachers program has assisted thousands of military personnel who leave the military to become public school teachers. Troops-to-Teachers offers counseling and assistance to help participants identify employment opportunities and receive teacher certification. It has been a great success, filling school vacancies in 48 states. 
   These professionals are providing what educators say they need the most: mature role models, most of them male and many minorities, often trained in math and science, highly motivated, and comfortable in tough working environments. In fact, over three quarters are men, compared with about 25 percent in the overall public school system. About half elect to teach in inner city or rural schools. A disproportionate share have science, engineering or technical backgrounds. Retention is much higher than the national average. 
   The authority for Troops-to-Teachers expires at the end of this fiscal year. The legislation we are introducing here today reauthorizes the program and makes many refinements to encourage even more of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines to enter the noble profession of teaching America's youth. The legislation focuses more resources toward direct financial assistance to cover teacher certification costs for applicants, and creates a bonus for those opting to teach in certain high need schools. Fewer resources are made available for administrative and other overhead costs. The bonus, I believe, will be particularly effective in attracting larger numbers of applicants. A recent offering of a sign-up bonus of $20,000 in Massachusetts public schools led to an explosion in applications from around the country. 
   Mr. President, I urge other Senators to support this important legislation and I look forward to it being brought forward for final passage this year.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Combat Veterans Medical Equity Act of 1999, legislation which will serve to codify America's obligation to provide for the medical needs of our combat-wounded veterans. 
   Although we have long recognized the combat-wounded vet to be among our most deserving veterans, and although we have long distinguished the sacrifices of these veterans by awarding the Purple Heart medal, remarkably, there is nothing in current law that stipulates an entitlement to health care based upon this physical sacrifice. In fact, I believe most Americans would be surprised to learn that a combat-wounded Purple Heart recipient could be denied services for which a non-combat veteran, with a non-service-connected disability, would be eligible. This legislation would seek to remedy that situation. 
   Specifically, this bill establishes for VA hospital care and medical services based upon the award of the Purple Heart Medal. It also gives Purple Heart recipients an enrollment priority on par with former Prisoners of War and veterans with service-connected disabilities rated between 10 and 20%. 
   Mr. President, as a Vietnam Veteran who has been privileged to lead marines in combat, and as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have a keen appreciation for the sacrifices made by all of our men and women in uniform. At the same time, in the face of tighter budgets and greater competition for services, I believe strongly that Congress should ensure equity in disbursing of medical services for our most deserving veterans--the combat wounded. These veterans, who have shed their blood to keep our country safe and free, deserve no less.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, last year I joined Senators MCCAIN and LEVIN in introducing legislation authorizing another base closure round. I argued then, as I do today, that failing to enact another BRAC round only makes the Congress look short-sighted and indecisive. I argued then that if we don't bite the bullet quickly, the cost of excess infrastructure will continue to drag down the readiness of our forces today and rob us of the resources so badly needed to modernize our forces for tomorrow. 
   For the first time since the late 1970's, military readiness is suffering significantly. Ships are undermanned, pilots are flying too many missions, reservists are being asked to leave family and job over and over. It doesn't take a budget expert to realize what we could do for the troops with billions in savings from cutting excess infrastructure. 
   This year we in the Congress will almost certainly add billions of dollars to the defense budget. This is a mixed blessing. While these adds will help resolve problems across the board, from recruiting to modernization to preparing for the future, they will also undermine any incentives to better manage the Department of Defense and to eliminate the wasteful assets and administrative inefficiencies that we the Congress are so determined to preserve. 
   BRAC failed in the past for reasons that have much to do with politics, but little to do with ensuring our every defense dollar is spent for maintaining and equipping our armed forces for the battlefields of the next century. Those politics are behind us now. We must move forward and authorize more BRAC rounds. 
   Keeping excess military posts open won't bring more firepower to bear in the next war. Keeping an unneeded R&D lab open won't recruit more talented young men and women to serve as the foundation for the world's finest fighting force. Keeping an underutilized training range open won't buy modern equipment so badly needed to replace systems now often older than the men and women using them. 
   Mr. President, I reemphasize a point I've made time and time again in the past--who suffers from Congressional inaction? In the end, we only punish those who most need the benefits of infrastructure savings. First, we punish the Nation's taxpayers when we fail to make the best use of the resources with which they entrust us. Second, we punish today's soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines whose readiness depends on sufficient, reliable resources for equipment, training and operations through the year. Finally, we punish tomorrow's force as we continue to mortgage research, development, and modernization of equipment necessary to keep America strong into the 21st century. 
   The bill we're introducing calls for a base closure round in 2001 and another in 2003. Like the provision we offered last year and the year before that, the bill should answer concerns over the politicization of future BRAC rounds. Language is included to allow privatization-in-place at a facility only if the BRAC Commission explicitly recommends privatization-in-place. 
   The long-term savings from the first four base closure rounds already are generating substantial savings--about three billion dollars a year. Each new round will save another 1.5 billion dollars per year. It is no surprise that scores of studies and organizations such as the Quadrennial Defense Review, Defense Restructure Initiative, National Defense Panel, and Business Executives for National Security have all concluded that more base closures are crucial to the future of our Armed Forces. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to do what is right for our armed forces, what is right for the taxpayer, and support this legislation.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Separate Enrollment and Line Item Veto Act of 1999. I'm pleased to be joined by my long-time colleague and tireless fighter for budget sanity, Senator HOLLINGS of South Carolina. 
   As former governors, we both understand the importance of line-item veto authority in prioritizing spending. The legislation we introduce today is similar to that passed by the Senate in 1995, which is patterned on the separate enrollment process that we both supported with former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey. 
   I have been a long-time supporter of various line-item veto measures because I believe that only the President has the singular ability to reconcile spending priorities in the best interest of the nation. Recognizing that Congress has been unable or unwilling to seriously address our problems with special interest tax provisions and spending for members' pet projects, as last year's appropriations process attests, some form of additional veto authority should be given to the President. Otherwise, the President continues to have to approve items in bills which he doesn't support to approve those that he does. 
   As my colleagues know, the Separate Enrollment Line Item Veto legislation we passed in 1995 in the Senate was ultimately changed in conference negotiations with the House of Representatives. The end product of those negotiations was an enhanced rescission line item veto process, giving the President the ability to strike items from bills after signing them into law. Because that approach was struck down by the Supreme Court, I believe the line item veto is an important enough fiscal tool that we ought to put forward other alternatives. 
   The separate enrollment process contained in this bill presents few constitutional concerns. This process doesn't give the President the ability to strike items from bills he otherwise approves. This approach breaks down bills into their individual parts that are then passed again as separate bills, making sure each provision can then stand on its own merits. 
   In closing, let me acknowledge that this line item veto legislation, like the previous experiment, won't solve all  the nation's fiscal problems, but that it is a needed step if we are interested in pursuing good public and budget policy.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to lend my support to the Military Recruiting and Retention Improvement Act of 1999. For the first time since the late 1970's, military readiness is suffering significantly. We are now paying the price for asking our people to do much more with less and less. As the Service Chiefs have testified, the feedback from our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines is clear and unambiguous. Low pay, the 40 percent retirement system, military health and education benefits that could stand a shot in the arm--we now have plenty of evidence these things are keeping us from retaining our best and brightest. Equally troubling, our recruiting picture across the services is dismal. These downward trends cannot continue. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff warns that ``there is no more shock absorbency left in the system,'' and further that if the trends continue, we will ``find ourselves in a nosedive that might cause irreparable damage to this great force.'' The Army and Air Force Chiefs of Staff, the Chief of Naval Operations, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps all agree that we are only five years away from a hollow force. Put simply, we are placing at risk the future readiness of the finest fighting force in the world. 
   Mr. President, this bill provides the resources to begin to reverse the steady downward spirals we've seen in military recruiting and retention. It is also a strong signal to our most important asset--our men and women in uniform and their families--that we are serious about taking care of them. In my view, it is nothing more than adequately compensating our people for the job they are already performing. And it is exactly the kind of ``fix'' we in the Congress can, and should, support. 
   I would like to make one additional point. While we have many pressing longer-term concerns, such as modernizing and recapitalizing our forces for the next century and doing something about the billions of dollars of excess infrastructure the services continue to carry, we simply can't afford to take a ``wait and see'' approach when it comes to taking care of our people. To do otherwise places at risk our future readiness and everything we've worked for, like the ability to mount an operation like ``Desert Fox'' and execute it brilliantly. We can't let that happen.

   Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to join with Senator LAUTENBERG to introduce the Public School Modernization Act of 1999. 
   I was gratified that so many Members of this body recognized last year that the need for school construction and modernization is vital. The legislation that Senator LAUTENBERG and I are introducing is designed to help States build new schools and repair and modernize outdated ones, so that our children will have a better, more modern and safe environment in which to learn. 
   A few weeks ago, the Thomas Jefferson Center for Educational Design at the University of Virginia issued a devastating report detailing the alarming condition of many of Virginia's schools. Over 3,000 trailers are being used to hold classes. Two out of 3 school districts have held classes in auditoriums, cafeterias, storage areas, and book closets, and 53 percent of Virginia school districts had to increase the size of their classes in order to accommodate their divisions' growing student populations. 
   We know that smaller class sizes do, in fact, have a dramatic impact on student learning, especially in the first 3 years. So in order to give our children the learning environment they deserve, we have to fix the leaky roofs, build the additional classrooms, and build more schools to accommodate our growing student population, and to reduce class size. 
   This is a constructive role for the Federal Government to play. In fact, it was a Republican President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, who proposed a massive $1.1 billion school construction initiative in 1955. 
   Our States need our help, Mr. President. This legislation does not usurp local control of education or hinder States and localities from developing their own solutions to the problem of improving the academic performance of our children. Rather, this bill is intended to complement the efforts of the many State legislatures that are now wrestling with the questions of how to repair and equip old schools and how to build new schools. 
   Mr. President, no child should be forced to go to a school without heat, or have to wade regularly through standing water to get to class, or be expected to learn in a trailer with poor ventilation. Our children and their parents need our help. 
   I thank my colleague, Senator LAUTENBERG, for his work on this issue, and I look forward to working with him on this effort to bring it to a successful conclusion. I also thank Senators DASCHLE, KENNEDY, KERRY, TORRICELLI, EDWARDS, and BINGAMAN for joining us today. 
   I urge all of our colleagues in the State to recognize the urgent school construction needs of all of our States and to work with us in passing this particular legislation.
