Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate passed H.R. 4110, the Veterans Programs Enhancement Act of 1998. This measure strives to improve the services and benefits provided to our nation's veterans by amending several health, education, housing, and other benefits programs within the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
I am especially pleased that the measure contains two provisions which I have been working on. Section 603 of the bill will extend the eligibility of members of the National Guard and Reserve for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Home Loan Guaranty Program. The provision will ensure that the men and women in the Selected Reserve will continue to be eligible for this program through September 30, 2003. Under current law, authorization for the program is scheduled to expire in October 1999. 
As the author of legislation in 1992 which extended eligibility for VA-guaranteed home loans to National Guard and Reserve members who complete six years of service, I am pleased with the participation in the program by members of the Selected Reserve. The VA Home Loan Guaranty Program for Guard and Reserve members has provided many individuals and families with a needed opportunity to obtain a mortgage in order to purchase a home, many for the first time. The VA Home Loan Guaranty Program is not only beneficial for members of the Selected Reserve, it also contributes to the financial viability of the VA Home Loan Guaranty Program since the origination fees paid by Reservists more than offset the cost of additional loan guarantees. I am gratified that the home loan program will continue to be made available to members of the National Guard and Reserves who have served our country. 
I am also pleased with the inclusion of Section 706 in H.R. 4110. This provision would prohibit the Secretary of Veterans Affairs from establishing or collecting parking fees at the Spark M. Matsunaga Department of Veterans Affairs Medical and Regional Office Center in Honolulu, Hawaii. Under current law, the VA is required to charge its users and employees to park at facilities built with special revolving funds. In Hawaii, the VA parking structure is located on the grounds of the Tripler Army Medical Hospital and will be shared by VA and the Department of Defense. The joint VA/DOD parking facility would result in an administrative nightmare if parking fees were required to be assessed for VA medical employees and visitors but not DOD personnel and visitors. Furthermore, the costs of administering the parking fees far outweigh the revenues that would be generated from the assessment of nominal parking charges. The waiver of parking fees for the VA parking structure at Tripler Army Medical Center will ensure that all visitors and employees enjoy free and equal access to the facilities.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, for the last year or so, both the House and Senate have been working on legislation that would reauthorize the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee has reported legislation offered by my colleague from Idaho, Senator Kempthorne, that would modify the Act in significant ways. Although it is unlikely that we will take up this bill in the short time remaining to us, I would like to make a few observations about the Endangered Species Act and what it has meant to Hawaii, home to more endangered species than any other state or territory within the United States. 
Mr. President, as legislators, we are guardians of our Nation's rich natural inheritance; in this capacity, we cannot afford to squander the ecological legacy we leave to our children. Surely, part of our concern for rare species and ecosystems is the simple realization that once they are gone, we would have failed in our stewardship responsibility. Hawaii is poised on the brink of irreversible ecological change, and it is important that wise stewardship decisions be rendered to preserve our unique, tropical ecosystem. 
The term `ecosystem' has become a political buzzword and does not adequately described the delicate checks and balances that make up the natural world. The basis of Hawaii's natural system begins not with a list of threatened plants and animals, but with the unique origin of the islands. For millions of years, lava welling out from the earth's mantle cooled upon the ocean floor, gradually forming the Hawaiian islands, one by one, a process that is ongoing even today. As one island moves away from the influence of a `hot spot' in the middle of the Pacific, another island is born. Each island is the peak of a volcanic mountain, with its base hidden far below the surface of the ocean. Only a few types of birds, insects, and plants were able to colonize the remote islands, and these few evolved into scores or even hundreds of unique species. The islands sheltered no large land mammals or reptiles, only creatures that have gradually lost their natural defenses against such predators. 
The Endangered Species Act is critical to this unique, insular ecosystem. There are, 1,126 total U.S. species listed by Fish and Wildlife Service under protection of the ESA, and although its islands represent just two-tenths of one percent of the total U.S. land area, Hawaii is home to more rare and endangered species than any other state or territory. In addition, three-fourths of the nation's now extinct plants and birds once existed only in Hawaii. Hawaii has an astounding 363 listed endangered species. Only California, with 223 listed species, rivals Hawaii in the number of listed endangered species. The Pacific islands, not including Hawaii, have a total of 16 listed endangered species. 
The causes of Hawaiian species decline are numerous and complicated, but the most significant threats come from non-native animals that uproot and devour fragile native plants. Feral pigs, rats, and mongooses not only physicially destroy plants, but spread the seeds of aggressive alien plants such as the South American banana poke vine, and small invasive trees like the Brazilian strawberry guava. These alien plants form thick, impenetrable monocultures that choke out native plants. When native plants disappear, the birds and insects that rely on native plants for food are also threatened. Diseases that kill native flora and fauna are also spread by alien species: birds in particular are ravaged by diseases transmitted through mosquitoes. 
Hawaiian plants and animals co-evolved over millions of years and continue to depend on each other for survival. The interdependency of Hawaiian insects, birds, and plants makes this ecosystem susceptible to rapid, irreversible change due to loss of species richness. Endangered species in Hawaii range from mammals such as the charismatic monk seal and the Hawaiian goose (also the state bird), or nene [nay-nay], to sea creatures like the hawksbill sea turtle and invertebrates such as the Oahu tree snail. There are endangered plants from 279 taxa, including plants with great cultural significance such as the mahoe and uhiuhi. Hawaii harbors at least 5,000 species as yet unknown to science as well as many rare species, including the wekiu bug, which has `antifreeze' in its blood, and the Wood's tree hibiscus, a small tree previously unknown to science, found in Kauai, with only four individuals known worldwide. 
I cannot stress enough that the loss of even one species may contribute to the decline of entire ecosystems, and barring unprecedented action, many species may vanish undiscovered. Along with the species, lost also is genetic information that could lead to new foods and medicines. 
Mr. President, the survival of hundreds of endangered species now depends on human intervention. Though gravely threatened, Hawaii's remaining natural treasures can be saved. Conservation of habitat, control and eradication of noxious introduced plants and predators, and enlightened resource management are the answer. Conservationists within Hawaii kill feral animals, erect fences to keep ungulates away from fragile plants, breed animals in captivity, pollinate flowers by hand, and destroy alien plants. We are hoping to restore and maintain healthy ecosystems so that Hawaii's native species have the respite and protection they need to survive. Thus, Hawaii is not a lost cause: more than a quarter of the state's land remains unspoiled. But we must continue in our struggle to protect rare and endangered species before the battle is over and our legacy to our children is robbed of species richness. 
Since the enactment of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, we have garnered important knowledge and won substantial victories across the country in our efforts to protect imperiled species. Eight U.S. species have removed from the list due to recovery and another 18 species have been upgraded from endangered to threatened. More importantly, at least half of all species listed for a decade or more are not either stable or improving in status. 
For example, the first group of captive-bred Mexican wolves was released back 
into the American southwest this year; California condors, southeastern fish, and dear to me, the Hawaiian silversword plant and `alala have also been re-introduced to the wild. Bird conservation groups in my own state have hatched eggs from 12 different endemic species--species that have never before been reared in captivity like the `akohekohe, palila, Maui parrotbill, puaiohi, `elepaio, and `amakihi. All of this has been accomplished in 25 years since the Act's passage--remarkable when considered on nature's time scale rather than our fast paced Congressional calendar. 
But these successful conservation efforts are not merely a result of Federal law. In Hawaii at least, the State legislature has enacted an endangered species law that is comparable, and, in some instances, stronger than Federal law. Last year, the State amended this law to allow `take' of endangered or threatened species when such authorization is issued in conjunction with a safe harbor agreement or habitat conservation plan. Although modelled after Federal law, the State amendments are more strict. For example, under the ESA, in order to allow for a `take,' the population must not decrease; however, under the Hawaiian statute, the likelihood of population increase must be proven before taking is allowed. 
Despite success on the Federal and State levels to protect and preserve biological diversity, Congress may next year consider legislation similar to the Kempthorne bill, that in its current form could weaken the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the Nation's most important law protecting endangered wildlife and wildlife habitat. 
There are many provisions of the Kempthorne bill, S. 1180, the Endangered Species Recovery Act of 1997, that I applaud and support. The bill emphasizes recovery efforts, and codifies many of the administration's efforts to provide incentives to landowners that are affected by the Endangered Species Act. The Kempthorne bill also expands the role of States in implementing the act, which has the potential to tailor species recovery efforts on a case-by-case basis, rather than applying a Federal cookie-cutter approach to species protection. 
However, there are key elements of S. 1180 that are fundamentally unsound. For example, the legislation would lock in Habitat Conservation Plans without allowing for review and adjustment. Mr. President, our knowledge of rare species is slow in coming; but as our information base grows, Habitat Conservation Plans need to change and grow, too, reflecting new and more complete information about the needs of endangered species. Imagine if our knowledge or medical science were similarly locked in--we would still be using leeches to bleed patients of `humors.' 
In addition, the Kempthorne measure does not fully cover water rights, nor does it provide just compensation to property owners. It would also establish significant bureaucratic obstacles to listing, management, and recovery plans. And it offers less conservation per dollar appropriated. 
Our House colleague, Congressman George Miller, has put forward a bill that I find more consistent with the original intent of the Endangered Species Act. The Miller 
bill emphasizes recovery of species; steps up protection of candidate species; creates a new and important category of `survival habitat' which is designated at time of listing, yet also has a version of `no surprises' permits; and creates a habitat conservation fund based on performance bonds paid by recipients of incidental take permits. It contains extensive tax benefits for landowners affected by the Endangered Species Act. Most importantly, under the Miller legislation, the public is allowed to sue to enforce the terms of Habitat Conservation Plans. 
I applaud Senator Kempthorne for attempting in his legislation to balance the needs of private landowners against the protections we accord endangered species; unfortunately, I believe his bill tilts too far in favor of the former. However well-meaning, key provisions of the bill represent a backtracking on endangered species and endangered species habitat protection. Until these shortcomings are addressed, Congress should not consider altering the most important and effective law we have on the books for protecting our rarest forms of life. 
Mr. President, let me conclude by noting that more than any other state, Hawaii is teetering on the edge of no return. The Endangered Species Act is our ultimate safety net when the more than 150 other U.S. laws and international treaties fail to prevent a species from declining toward extinction. When measured in terms of preventing threatened species from going extinct, the Act has been an overwhelming success. I would be reluctant to support legislation, however well-intentioned, that would reduce the effectiveness of this landmark law. 
I therefore look forward to debating reauthorization of the Endangered Species Act when the 106th Congress convenes. Senator Kempthorne and Congressman Miller have both made good starts in heightening concern about endangered species and in bringing to light the complexities of species protection and recovery. Let us build on their efforts next year and debate more thoroughly the requirements that are necessary to crafting a stronger, more effective endangered species law. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, yesterday I stood with the President and several of my Democratic colleagues to call on the Republican leadership to focus their attention on the children of America. Millions of American children in schools across the United States are being denied the basic education foundation they need to succeed. 
In Hawaii, thousands of children waited with anticipation for the new school year. Parents took their children to buy school supplies, new clothes, and other back-to-school preparations. However, many of these students entered or returned to schools that are so inadequate that they cannot receive a quality education. Our children are being asked to learn in environments that are not conducive to learning, and may even be dangerous. But still, these young, bright-eyed, captivated children go day-after-day to schools seeking to learn the wonders of the world. 
Mr. President, Congress has the moral responsibility to ensure that we provide our children access to quality education. President Clinton recently called on Congress to enact several education initiatives that will improve education facilities, ensure that the education curriculum challenges and engages our students, and provide teachers and administrators the resources they need to teach and support our children. 
These proposals work together to strengthen our nation's schools. First, we need to build and modernize our nation's schools. We continue to demand that our workforce compete in the demanding high technology marketplace, yet we educate children in schools that do not have access to the information superhighway, let alone the physical capabilities to support the demand for access. Many of Hawaii's schools were built over 50 years ago, before schools required a computer in every classroom. For example, I recently received a e-mail from a concerned parent whose child attends Hickam Elementary School. The parents had decided to hold a teachers' breakfast for the faculty at the school. They turned on the air conditioning in the office and the library and blew the fuses--the electrical wiring was unable to handle the demand for the increased energy required by the air conditioners. If the wiring cannot support air conditioners, how can it support the computers and the air conditioners needed to cool the rooms which house the computers? Although Hawaii is facing economic problems, we are not facing these problems alone. Every day 14 million students attend schools that need extensive repair and replacement, like Hickam Elementary School. Almost 60 percent of America's schools reported at least one major building feature in disrepair. 
As we continue to rely on technological advances to improve education for our children, schools need to be capable of supporting these increasing demands. Hickam is not the only school in Hawaii experiencing this hardship; many schools in Hawaii face this problem. Administrators must choose whether to cool the library so that children can read and learn, or turn on the computers in their labs. This should not be. We need to assist schools in making the investments to improve existing facilities or allow them to build new facilities to meet the growing technological demands. We must commit ourselves to ensuring that our children are able to learn in a comfortable and safe environment. That is why I support efforts to rebuild, modernize, and reduce overcrowding in more than 5,000 public schools through Federal support that would pay the interest on nearly $22 billion in bonds to help improve the schools across the country, including Hawaii. 
But a new school loaded with technology gizmos is not enough. Ensuring access to such advancements does not guarantee success. We must also invest in our teachers. We chide teachers for being unqualified, but we fail to provide them the support needed to succeed. We lament the teacher shortage, but fail to provide the resources to recruit quality individuals. And, we have a growing problem with teacher retention, yet we fail to give teachers the respect they deserve and acknowledge that teaching is a very complex and difficult profession. 
As my colleagues know, before I came to Congress, I was a teacher. I taught elementary, intermediate, and high school students in Hawaii. I know, firsthand, the difficulties teachers face each day in their classroom. Fortunately, I taught during a time when teachers were respected and appreciated. Today, however, we take teachers for granted. We expect them to be teachers, counselors, and sometimes, even part-time parents. We fail to recognize the importance these individuals have in shaping the nature of our nation's future leaders. I am not sure when this terrible decline began, but I know that it must stop. We must raise our respect for teachers and realize that they are not the source of our education problems, nor are they the only ones that can improve our current situation. 
We have a responsibility to provide the resources needed to allow our nation's teachers to succeed. We need to increase funding for teacher development programs such as technology teacher training, which helps teachers learn to use technology effectively to improve classroom instruction and enhance student learning. We need to help communities hire 100,000 new qualified teachers to allow schools to reduce there class sizes. We need to reduce the number of out-of-field teachers, particularly for new teachers who are more often assigned to teach subjects outside of their field of training and often do not have the support and mentoring to assist in their development. The First Lady said, `it takes a village to raise a child.' I believe that, but I also believe that it takes a village to teach a child. Teachers, parents, administrators, and communities as a whole must be committed to ensuring that our children are provided the assistance they need to obtain a quality education. 
Children are wonderful, forthright, and open individuals, particularly when they are young. It is always a treat for me to meet with young students, they often have a very truthful and direct way of putting things into perspective. Just three weeks ago, I participated in a satellite conference with third grade students from Queen Liliuokalani Elementary School and high 
school students from Radford and Kaimuki High Schools. The high school students are participants in E-school, a virtual school which provides on-line and satellite distance learning opportunities to students and teachers. Hawaii's Department of Education is a national leader in the virtual school concept. Leveraging federal funding through the Technology Literacy Fund and the Technology Challenge Grants, Hawaii students are able to learn and receive over 21 high school credit courses for on-line classes. Yet, even with these wonderful achievements in Hawaii, more needs to be done. The students who participated shared with me their concerns over the lack of more capable computers, the need for greater security for the system, and the desire for more teachers who are able to use the system. Students want to learn, it is our responsibility to ensure that they have the resources available to help them achieve their goals. 
We know that children learn better in small classes, particularly in the early childhood years, study after study has proven that class size makes a difference in the achievements of our children. President Clinton has requested $12 billion over 7 years to reduce the class size in grades 1 to 3. As a former teacher, I strongly believe that the proposal would significantly advance the educational achievements of our students. The average class size in the United States for grades 1 to 3 is 23. In Hawaii, the average class size for kindergarten through third grade is 21.9. How can we expect our children to be able to learn when one teacher is required to teach 21 five- to eight-year-olds. I challenge my colleagues to spend a day, just one day, at a elementary school in their State to experience firsthand the challenges in getting 21 five through eight-year-olds to pay attention to you. 
Our responsibility should not stop with the school bell. As many as 5 million children are home alone after school each week. Hawaii was fortunate to have the first state-wide after-school care program. This innovative program began in 1990 under the leadership of Governor Benjamin Cayetano while he was the Lieutenant Governor. Hawaii's A-Plus program provides after-school activities to eligible students in grades K through 6. The program provides supervised enrichment and physical development activities at 171 public schools. It is available to eligible children and fees are based on a sliding scale from $6 to $55 per month. 
However, many of our children in other states are not as fortunate. Only one-third of the schools in low-income neighborhood and half the schools in affluent areas offer after-school programs. Full funding for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program would provide 400,000 children in the United States access to safe learning centers, similar to those provided in Hawaii. 
First-rate facilities, quality teachers, students ready and willing to learn are important ingredients needed to ensure success for our children, but that success also needs to be based on high academic standards. We must set significant academic standards for our students to ensure that they will be able to compete in the growing global economy. We should increase funding for Goals 2000 to assist states in raising and setting academic standards that challenge and motivate students. We need to expand funding for Title I to provide the means for disadvantaged communities to develop and maintain high academic standards. 
Mr. President, our schools are in disrepair, our classrooms are overcrowded, our teachers are overburdened, our children need our help now. We have a responsibility and a moral obligation to provide modern, safe facilities, reduce class sizes, provide the support for children outside of the classrooms, and support and help recruit and retain well-qualified teachers. I urge my Senate colleagues to make a concerted effort to address this vital national problem. The implications of ignoring or delaying our obligation may have ramifications that may not be so easily corrected. 
Our nation's children are depending upon us to make the sacrifice and do what needs to be done. We must stand up and meet this challenge, if we do not, we will have failed our nation's children--our nation's future.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the remarks delivered earlier this afternoon by my friend, the senior Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Nickles) regarding the International Religious Freedom Act. I commend him and Senator Lieberman for their leadership in advancing this legislation. I congratulate their willingness to work with the Administration and all interested parties to craft legislation that is inclusive, that preserves many options for the President, yet is strong and effective in addressing religious persecution around the world. The revisions suggested and accepted in the spirit of compromise have not weakened the core purpose or value of this legislation. 
This is one of the most important pieces of foreign relations legislation this Congress will consider during this session. It proposes action against religious persecution worldwide, and establishes a structure by which the United States can more effectively investigate, monitor, and address serious violations of religious freedom, an internationally recognized human right, as well as an issue of concern to all people of faith. 
The International Religious Freedom Act is a necessary step to ensure that religious persecution will not be tolerated in our conduct of foreign policy. S. 1868 seeks to promote religious freedom by establishing an Ambassador-at-Large for Religious Liberty, a Special Advisor within the White House on Religious Persecution, and a bipartisan Commission on International Religious Liberty. It also provides the President with an array of options, including economic sanctions, which he can use to respond to countries that engage in or condone religious persecution. The measure in no way constricts or mandates the conduct of American foreign policy. 
This is not a Republican bill or a Democratic bill, a conservative or liberal proposal, or an effort to protect or promote any one faith. It is supported by the Episcopal Church, the Christian Coalition, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Catholic organizations, and other religious and human rights associations across the country. Indeed, it is an ecumenical effort supported by a bipartisan group in Congress, and it enjoys wide support among all people of faith and supporters of human rights. This is why I was honored to join Senator Nickles, Lieberman, Specter, and Coats, Congressmen Wolf and Clement, and a diverse coalition of religious leaders this morning to urge Congressional action on the International Religious Freedom Act before adjournment. 
As a longtime supporter of human rights, the defense of the right to religious freedom is as significant as IMF funding and our ongoing efforts to deal with the international financial crisis. Sadly, many of the conflicts we are witnessing today have religious intolerance at their core. It is my strong belief that if we in the United States, our allies in other nations and people of faith around the world speak out about religious liberty and call attention to religious persecution, and bring positive forces to bear in defense of religious freedom, we can advance understanding and respect for this basic human right and prevent religious intolerance from festering and exploding into conflict and violence. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report to H.R. 6, the Higher Education Reauthorization Act. Passage of this important measure will ensure that access to higher education remains attainable for all Americans. 
The increase in the Pell Grant eligibility included in the bill will help families and students offset the growing cost of higher education. This successful program has helped ensure that low-income and disadvantaged students have the opportunity to pursue a post-secondary education. 
The bill also includes the continuation of the concept of the State Student Incentive Grants (SSIGs). The new modified program, Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership Program, will continue the worthwhile effort of encouraging additional financial opportunities for students seeking a higher education. 
The decrease in the student loan interest rate is another effort to ensure that students and their families are able to obtain a quality higher education. The decrease in the student loan interest rate helps students reduce the financial burden of higher education. Too often students are forced to chose between their education and the enormous financial hardship they must overcome to obtain the education they need to improve their lives. The agreement included in the bill helps to reduce the financial burden for students and their families. 
Mr. President, the provisions in the bill relating to teacher development and preparation are important to ensure that we have the quantity and quality of teachers needed for the next generation of students. Across the country the shortage of teachers, particularly in critical subjects such as special education, math and science where there is serious demand, is having an adverse impact on our students. However, the problem is not just recruiting students to become teachers, the problem is making sure that students have the support and encouragement once they have chosen this honorable profession. Teacher development and preparation programs are essential if we are to stem the tide of teachers leaving the profession before retirement. Too many teachers are leaving to seek employment opportunities outside of the teaching profession because administrators and communities are failing to provide the support they need. The teacher development and preparation programs included in the bill will help to address this important issue. 
Ensuring that our teachers obtain the educational background needed to achieve academic success must start at higher education institutions. Colleges and universities should not complain about the caliber of students pursuing higher education, while denying their educational degree programs the resources and the support that they need. The caliber of teachers leaving these institutions has a direct impact on the quality of students coming through the front door. The provisions in this bill help to address these concerns. 
Mr. President, I would like to thank the Chairman, Senator Jeffords, and Senator Kennedy, the Ranking Member, for their support on resolving the eligibility concerns surrounding the students from the Federated Associated States (FAS). The House, unfortunately, attempted to terminate the eligibility of college students from FAS for Pell Grants, Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants, and College Work Study. The House provision would have upset the unique relationship the United States has with the FAS and violated the legal and moral obligation we have with the countries under the U.S. Compact of Free Association with the Republic of Palau and the U.S. Compact of Free Association with the Federated States of Micronesia and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. It would have been an embarrassment if the U.S. failed to live up to its moral obligations in ensuring that FAS citizens were given the educational assistance necessary to become self-governing. The agreement worked out in conference ensures continued federal financial aid eligibility for FAS students and does not preclude the inclusion of such eligibility in the renegotiation of the Compact with the FAS. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to express my support for this important measure and look forward to its passage. Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. AKAKA. 
Mr. President, I support S. 2279, the Wendell H. Ford National Air Transportation System Improvement Act of 1998. This measure will enhance the safety and efficiency of our air transportation system, upon which the island state of Hawaii is uniquely dependent. I am pleased that this weighty legislation is named for the departing senior senator from Kentucky, whose contributions to aviation are legion. I am especially supportive of Title VII of the bill which addresses the issue of air tour operations at national parks. 
Mr. President, Title VII of S. 2279 establishes a comprehensive regulatory framework for controlling air tour traffic in and near units of the National Park System. The legislation requires the Federal Aviation Administration, in cooperation with the National Park Service and with public input from stakeholders, to develop an air tour management plan (ATMP) for parks currently or potentially affected by air tour flights. 
Under the ATMP process, routes, altitudes, time restrictions, limitations on the number of flights, and other operating parameters could be prescribed in order to protect sensitive park resources as well as to enhance the safety of air tour operations. An ATMP could prohibit air tours at a park entirely, regulate air tours within half a mile outside the boundaries of a park, regulate air tour operations that impact tribal lands, and offer incentives for the adoption of quieter air technology. An ATMP would include an environmental determination.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the world record breaking achievements of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) program conducted at the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) on Kauai. This exemplary program is part of NASA's Environmental Research Aircraft and Sensor Technology (ERAST) program, which first gained national recognition for record breaking Pathfinder flights last year. 
Mr. President, on December 10, 1997, I was proud to participate in a ceremony dedicating the previous record breaking flight that reached an altitude of 71,500 feet in memory of Hawaii's beloved hero, Colonel Ellison Onizuka. This was a most fitting tribute to honor Colonel Onizuka and inspire our youth to excellence. 
Since that time, the Pathfinder solar electric powered remotely piloted aircraft has undergone design upgrades which have allowed the ERAST Team to once again set a new world altitude record for unmanned solar-powered aircraft. This landmark was accomplished when the solarplane climbed to 80,200 feet above PMRF on August 6, 1998. I am particularly proud of the students and faculty of Kauai Community College and the talented personnel at PMRF who assisted NASA's ERAST Team in attaining this monumental achievement. 
The success of Pathfinder and Pathfinder Plus has opened new doors to possible educational, scientific, and technological applications that were not imaginable a few years ago. There are countless implications for advances in the fields of aviation, satellite deployment, solar energy technology, oceanic and atmospheric research and monitoring, and environmental protection. 
Mr. President, I commend NASA's ERAST Team, the students and faculty of Kauai Community College and the personnel at PMRF for demonstrating that through our imagination, we can reach unimagined realms in space and near space.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today Capitol Police Officer Jacob J. Chestnut was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery, concluding a week that has saddened and shocked every American and touched the hearts of millions of people around the world. I rise to express my profound sorrow over the death of Officer Chestnut and Detective John Gibson, and to extend my sympathy to the families, friends, and fellow officers of these two brave men. The tremendous outpouring of grief and respect we have experienced and witnessed during the Congressional ceremony and honors on Tuesday, and in the requiem services for Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut over the past two days are fitting tribute to the courage and selfless sacrifice of these fallen heroes. 
The deaths of Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson, killed in the line of duty as they defended all of us who are privileged to work and visit the Capitol, is a testament to the fidelity and valor of these men, as well as a reminder of the exceptional bravery and courage of the men and women of the Capitol Police who protect the Capitol complex and grounds. We are fortunate to have these officers on the job, protecting all of us, willing to confront the dangers and violence that too often afflict our world today, so that our Capitol can remain open and accessible to the public. The professionalism, pride, and good-natured courtesy which these officers bring to their duties, day in and day out, serves our democracy by keeping the Capitol open to the people and safeguarding, with their lives if necessary, the freedom and liberty we cherish. 
On the Capitol dome, looking across the Capital City, stands the Statue of Freedom Triumphant in War and Peace, an emblem of democracy and hope, a symbol of America's promise that every citizen has the freedom and opportunity to realize their God given potential. In her right hand Freedom holds an olive branch, in her left, a sword, a reminder that the preservation of freedom and democracy often requires sacrifice. 
Over the course of our history, the Capitol has witnessed stirring oratory and the passage of landmark legislation which have inspired us, strengthened our nation, restored hope, preserved our Republic, and maintained our resolve. The heroic actions of Officer Chestnut and Officer Gibson, who acted to preserve and protect life without regard to their own safety, bonds deeds to the ideals and values we celebrate and honor here at the heart of our democracy. The President said it best when he stated that the actions of these brave men sanctified the Capitol. May God bring comfort and peace to the families, friends, and colleagues of Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut.

 Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, a we continue to celebrate the International Year of the Ocean, I would like to inform members of the status and efforts to save the endangered Hawaiian monk seal, the only seal endemic to the Hawaiian islands. 
As you may know, the Hawaiian monk seal is one of three species of monk seal known in the world. The other two are the Caribbean and Mediterranean monk seal. The last Caribbean monk seal was sighted in 1952 and is thought to be extinct; the Mediterranean monk seal still survives, but barely, with a population of only 500-1,000 individuals. The rarity of the monk seal makes efforts to save the Hawaiian variety all the more urgent. 
Monk seals belong to an order known as pinnipedia, which in Latin means feather or flipper footed. This order includes seals, sea lions, and walruses. Walruses are not found in Hawaii because the weather is not cold enough for them to survive; sea lions are also not natural to the area. The only pinniped found in Hawaiian waters is a seal--the Hawaiian monk seal. Although, Hawaiian monk seals predominately inhabit the Northwestern Hawaiian islands, including Kure Atoll, French Frigate Shoals, Laysan Island, Lisianski Island, Pearl and Hermes Reef, they are occasionally found in the main Hawaiian islands. In fact, the Hawaiian monk seal is one of only two mammals that are endemic to the Hawaiian islands, the other being the Hoary bat. 
The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) estimates that there is a population of approximately 1,200-1,400 Hawaiian monk seals. This is half of what the population was in the 1950s. Factors threatening this species include entanglement and consumption of marine debris, disturbance by humans and animals on pupping and haul out beaches, mobbing of females by males, and shark predation. 
The NMFS is leading the effort to save the Hawaiian monk seal from further endangerment and ultimate extinction. Under federal law, the agency protects Hawaiian monk seals through education, research, and recovery programs. For example, NMFS has appointed a Hawaiian Monk Seal Recovery team to help with research programs, data analysis, population assessment, and addressing specific problems such as mobbing, human disturbance, and fishing line/net entanglement. The recovery team's mission is to eliminate the causes leading to the declining monk seal population and recommend how further efforts should be managed to stabilize and impede endangerment of this species. 
Throughout the years, NMFS has monitored activity on primary breeding locations and taken appropriate actions to aid young monk seal pups and their mothers to a full and healthy life. In order to do this, NMFS has initiated recovery plans to protect females and their offspring from vicious male mobbing which occurs when adult male monk seals attack pups, juveniles, and sub-adult females, probably mistaking them for breeding females. Some of the efforts that NMFS has launched include removing weaned pups from the beach and placing them in enclosed pens until they are strong enough to be released on their own, relocating monk seal males from areas where they greatly outnumber females, and rehabilitating small abandoned pups until they can be released back into the wild. 
NMFS also strives to decrease indirect and direct human activities that result in harmful occurrences, like a seal swallowing marine debris or entangling itself in fishing lines or nets. In order to accomplish the task of cleaning up beaches and ridding the oceans of debris, NMFS offers information to schools, marine parks, organizations, and individuals who want to learn what they can do to help the recovery of this species. NMFS also sets up signs on beaches where monk seals are most likely to breed or visit informing visitors how to avoid disturbing the sea animals. 
Fortunately, the agency is supported by other organizations that have fostered efforts for the recovery of this unique and beautiful species. These include: the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, which assists and supports NMFS's recovery efforts; Earthtrust and the Hawaii Wildlife Fund, which promote awareness of and education about the Hawaiian monk seal; Sea Life Park Hawaii, which has in the past offered rehabilitation for monk seal pups; and Dolphin Quest, which financially supports monk seal recovery efforts. 
In addition to these organized efforts to save the monk seal, I should recognize the conservation conscious beachgoers, fishermen, and other individuals, who go out of their way to ensure that their activities do not disturb or harm Hawaiian monk seals or other marine life. By simply picking up trash before they leave the beach, beachgoers can do much to promote the survival of the Hawaiian monk seal. Fishermen can also help by being aware of where they fish and making sure that they do not cast their lines in an area where Hawaiian monk seals may inhabit and accidentally bite onto a baited hook. It is also important to make sure that fishing lines and nets are not left in the ocean for a monk seal to swallow or become entangled in. Thus, conscientious citizens can do much to perpetuate the existence of this special creature. 
Mr. President, the Hawaiian monk seal is one of Hawaii's biological treasures. Through the combined efforts of government agencies, community organizations, and ordinary citizens, we may one day witness the full recovery of the Hawaiian monk seal. It is my hope that through the education and preservation of this rare species, more people will learn to respect and value all marine life and, by extension, understand our own relationship to our living environment.

Mr. AKAKA. I have offered an amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill to provide $12 million for electric and hybrid-electric vehicle development. The funds will be administered by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, known as DARPA. Senators Inouye, Jeffords, Leahy, Coats, and Boxer have joined me as cosponsors of the amendment. 
This is not a new program. Congress provided $115 million to the Department of Defense for the electric vehicle program over the past five fiscal years. Industry has contributed more than $115 million in matching funds. In fiscal year 1998, the appropriation was $15 million, so my amendment represents a budget reduction of 20 percent compared to the current fiscal year. 
Seven regional consortia, comprised of more than 200 member companies, participate in the program. Individual consortia, which were selected competitively, include Hawaii, Sacramento, the Mid Atlantic Consortium in Johnstown, PA, the Northeast Consortium in Boston, the Southern Consortium in Atlanta, the Mid America Consortium in Indianapolis, and CALSTART in Burbank, CA. 
The President's fiscal year 1999 budget proposed that the DARPA program be transferred to the Department of Energy and the Department of Transportation. The object of the fiscal year 1999 change was to transfer DoD-developed technology to commercial service vehicles such as buses, delivery vans, and service trucks. I support this transfer. 
Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of all three federal agencies and the consortia that participate in the electric vehicle program, another year of funding through the Department of Defense is needed before the transition can proceed. 
The Department of Defense has long been interested in hybrid electric combat vehicles because they can reduce fuel consumption by 50 percent, leading to a reduced fuel logistics burden, increased endurance, and reduced emissions. In addition, hybrid electric combat vehicles use electric power for mobility, weapons, countermeasures and sensors, and have reduced thermal and acoustic signatures. 
The five-year DARPA program has resulted in the development of a number of combat vehicles with hybrid electric propulsion. These include an Army M-113 Armored Personnel Carrier, a Bradley Fighting Vehicle, two High Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled 
 Vehicles, commonly known as Humvees, and a prototype composite armored vehicle. 
Other DoD projects are in the planning stages. DARPA and the Marine Corps are jointly developing a hybrid-electric reconnaissance, surveillance and targeting vehicle, designed as a stealthy, fuel efficient vehicle that can be transported by the V-22 Osprey in support of the Marine Corps Sea Dragon operation. DARPA and the Army are jointly developing a combat hybrid power system for a 15-ton future combat vehicle. The system will provide pulse power for electric guns, directed energy weapons, and electromagnetic armor, as well as other components and systems. 
The funds provided by my amendment should be used in the same manner, and for the same program objectives, as in fiscal year 1998 funding. As the author of the amendment, it is my intention that DARPA administer the program as it did in fiscal year 1998, and that funds can be used for the development of defense and non-defense electric and hybrid-electric vehicles. 
I thank the Chairman, and my colleague from Hawaii, the ranking Democrat on the subcommittee for their consideration of my amendment. I yield the floor.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduce the Investment in Women's Health Act of 1998, a bill to increase Medicare reimbursement for Pap smear laboratory tests. This is the Senate companion measure to the bill introduced in the House by my colleague and friend, Representative Neil Abercrombie. 
Last year, I was contacted by pathologists who alerted me to the cost-payment differential for Pap smear testing in Hawaii. According to the American Pathology Foundation, Hawaii is one of 23 states where the cost of performing the test significantly exceeds the Medicare payment. In Hawaii, the cost of performing the test ranges between $13.04 and $15.80. The Medicare reimbursement rate is only $7.15. 
This large disparity between the reimbursement rate and the actual cost may force labs in Hawaii and other states to discontinue Pap smear testing. Additionally, the below-cost-reimbursement may compel some labs to process tests faster and in higher volume to improve cost efficiency. This situation increases the risk of inaccurate results and can severely handicap patient outcomes. 
If the Pap smear is to continues an effective cancer screening tool, it must remain widely available and reasonably priced for all women. Adequate payment is a necessary component of ensuring women's continued access to quality Pap smears. 
My bill will increase the Medicare reimbursement rate for Pap smear lab work from its current $7.15 to $14.60--the national average cost of the test. This rate is important because it establishes a benchmark for many private insurers. 
No other cancer screening procedure is as effective for early detection of cancer as the Pap smear. Over the last 50 years, the incidence of cervical cancer deaths has declined by 70 percent due in large part to the use of this cancer detection measure. Experts agree that the detection and treatment of precancerous lesions can actually prevent cervical cancer. Evidence also shows that the likelihood of survival when cervical cancer is detected in its earliest stage is almost 100 percent with timely and appropriate treatment and follow-up. 
Mr. President, an estimated 13,700 new cases of invasive cervical cancer will be diagnosed in 1998 and 4,900 women will die of the disease. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

 Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President. I am pleased to introduce legislation today that would enable the Senate Employees Child Care Center (SECCC) to receive the proceeds from Senate recycling or other waste prevention programs. Specifically, my bill would authorize the Architect of the Capitol to receive funds from Senate recycling programs and make those funds available for the activities and expenses of the SECCC, subject to the regular appropriations process. The effect of this measure will be to provide the SECCC with a potentially steady, if relatively small, source of income as well as create an additional incentive for the Senate to support recycling efforts. 
 Mr. President, the SECCC was established as a non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation in 1984 by parents who work for the Senate. Today, the center provides full and part-time care for about 50 children between the ages of 18 months and 5 years. The SECCC is open to the entire community, with priority enrollment reserved for children of Senate employees. The SECCC is accredited by the National Academy of Early Childhood Programs, a division of the National Association of Young Children. It first received such recognition in 1989, the first day care center in Washington, D.C., to be so distinguished. 
The SECCC is governed by an independent board composed of the parents of children enrolled at the center. A cooperative relationship exists between the SECCC and the Senate. The parents, through the board, are responsible for oversight of SECCC operations; the Senate provides critical support, such as providing for the facility itself and utilities. The Senate is providing the funds for the construction of a new center, near the Daniel Webster Senate Page Residence, which is expected to be ready for occupancy within a few months. 
The Senate currently does not appropriate annual funds for the operation of the SECCC. The SECCC's annual operating budget of approximately $535,000 is funded entirely through tuition payments and the center's fundraising efforts. These funds are used to defray costs associated with tuition assistance (scholarships), teacher salaries, curriculum materials, meals, general office expenses, advertising and marketing, accounting and audit fees, professional development, and unemployment and liability insurance. 
The recycling program for House and Senate buildings is operated by the Office Waste Recycling Program (OWRP), under the Architect of the Capitol. Through OWRP, the Architect is responsible for collecting and bundling recycled materials; a private contractor, under contract to the General Services Administration, serves as the recycling facility. However, the Architect does not have the authority to receive funds from recycling or other so-called `enterprise' activities; thus, all recycling funds from both the Senate and House are deposited in 
the General Fund of the U.S. Treasury. 
The OWRP started as pilot project in 1990-91 and was expanded on a voluntary participation basis to all offices in the House and Senate office buildings in 1992. The program is based on the concept of source separation, an approach that includes the separation, collection, and removal of high and mixed grade paper as well as aluminum cans, glass, and certain types of plastic materials. The effectiveness of the program depends on the active participation of Congressional staff, who are needed to separate recyclables into designated receptacles, and the custodial and labor forces, who must ensure that materials remain segregated during the collection process. 
The program has been a success in certain respects. For example, it has allowed Congress to avoid paying costs associated with hauling away and landfilling recycled materials, since these costs are borne by the recycling contractor. According to the OWRP, in FY97, the House Office Buildings recycled 2,247 tons of paper, cans, glass, and plastic, avoiding landfill/haulaway costs of $173,000. For the same year, the Senate Office Buildings collected 898 tons, for a savings of $69,146. 
However, actual revenues generated by the program have been nominal. The Senate recycling program, for example, brought in a relatively paltry $2,694 in FY96 and $2,364 in FY97, the last full year for which we have data, while collecting an estimated 1,021 tons and 886 tons of paper waste. The reason for this seemingly low return is that the contractor is not required to pay for materials that are contaminated by a certain percentage. With respect to paper, which constitutes the bulk of Senate recyclables, contamination refers to mixing with other recyclable (e.g., newspapers with high grade paper) or with foreign matter such as food. Apparently, Senate and House recycled materials have relatively high contamination levels, a fact which may be attributed in part to an absence of incentives on the part of Congressional offices to recycle. 
This is in sharp contrast to the situation with federal agencies, which beginning in 1991 have had the authority to retain recycling proceeds, either to defray the cost of maintaining recycling programs and/or direct them to programs that directly benefit employees, including day care activities. In my opinion, it is no accident that while the level of participation in recycling programs varies from agency to agency, overall the Executive Branch agencies' recycling programs are much more robust than Congress'. 
Mr. President, my bill would authorize the Architect of the Capitol to receive Senate recycling funds and make them available for the payment of SECCC activities and expenses, through the annual appropriations process. This would achieve two mutually beneficial goals: first, to provide a small but important supplement to the day care center's operating budget; second, to improve the efficiency of the Senate recycling program by establishing an internal incentive to recycle.

 Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize a very special Hawaii business person. Charles Wesley Fortner is the recipient of the 1998 U.S. Small Business Administration's Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award. Mr. Fortner, 28 years of age, is a resident of Mililani, Hawaii, and the founder and president of the Honolulu-based telecommunications firm, Island Page, Inc. 
In 1994, Mr. Fortner had the courage to move to Hawaii to open the business by himself. With two partners who gave him the paging rights to the Hawaiian Islands, Mr. Fortner established the business location and field tested the equipment that carries the paging signals by driving and walking all over the island. 
In less than four years, Island Page has grown from a one-man operation to a company with a trained staff of 18 employees. Mr. Fortner's motivational ability and management style encourage his employees to operate the business with a strong customer service attitude. Those who know Mr. Fortner consider him the model of the new business mentor for the next century. 
Island Page sales totaled $280,000 in 1995 and increased 370 percent in 1996 to pass the $1 million mark. Sales for 1997 were expected to increase another 50 percent. The company achieved a profit of 12 percent in 1996 and anticipated a 25 percent return in 1997. 
Mr. Fortner is the man behind Island Page's popular `Captain Beep Beep' radio campaign. His creative abilities have also played a major role in establishing the technical requirements of the company. He brought with him to Hawaii a new line of equipment that allowed him to operate the business at a lower cost than his competitors. The company started in one location on Oahu, moved into the Dillingham community in the second year and opened a third location in Hawaii Kai in 1997. Mainland travelers can use the Island Page network and local subscribers can travel anywhere in the country and receive a page from Hawaii. 
I am pleased that Charles Wesley Fortner has been named SBA's 1998 Young Entrepreneur of the Year. I believe that he embodies the best Hawaii has to offer.

 Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Sherrie M. Suzuki of Hawaii Baptist Academy in Hawaii for winning first place in the 11th Annual National Peace Essay state-level competition. More than 5,000 participants from various countries around the world, including the United States and U.S. territories entered this contest. Each student wrote on issues concerning war crimes and human rights violations in various international conflicts. 
Miss Suzuki's essay entitled, `Cleansing the Wounds of War', sheds light on an ongoing issue concerning how war criminals should be brought to justice. Her solution examines the United Nations' tribunal expected to be permanently implemented in 1998. She writes `an international tribunal is one logical solution' to the problem of making war criminals pay for their atrocities. Her essay discusses the positive outcomes of the Nuremberg trials and the negative effects of Rwanda's mistakes. 
Mr. President, it is inspiring to witness the active role that young people play in enhancing their understanding about peace relations. Ms. Suzuki is proof that young students today are getting more involved in activities that address peacemaking issues. I am proud that Ms. Suzuki has received such a prestigious award. Her determination to expand her knowledge of peace and conflicts that arise in a changing global environment is admirable. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring a young woman of outstanding potential and achievement.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as the Senate considers funding for the International Space Station, I want to remind my colleagues about the achievements of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). 
Since 1915, American aviators, astronauts, and spacecrafts have expanded human knowledge. The advancements made by NASA are found in virtually every aircraft in use today. One example, used by Continental Airlines, is a NASA-developed device that warns of dangerous wind-shear conditions. In addition, NASA made valuable contributions to medicine by allowing scientists to utilize microgravity conditions in space to grow larger breast cancer cells, allowing different growth stages of these cells to be studied. 
NASA technology has produced a pacemaker that can be programmed from outside the body and developed instruments to measure bone loss and bone density without penetrating the skin. NASA research led to the development of a three-inch implant for diabetes that provides more precise control of blood sugar levels, thereby freeing diabetics from the burden of daily insulin injections. These are just a few of the scientific and medical advances developed from NASA technology. 
A panel of experts headed by aerospace consultant Jay Chabrow recently concluded that the space station's cost through the assembly stage could be $24.7 billion, which is $3 billion more than NASA now projects. While the overrun projected in the Chabrow report is a concern, the estimate in the report is modest in historic terms. For example, the initial contract for the lunar excursion module was $350 million. By the end of the contract, the cost had escalated to $2.3 billion, seven times the original cost. For the entire Apollo, Mercury, and Gemini programs, NASA spent approximately $100 billion to reach the moon. These programs, much like the International Space Station, ventured into unknown territory and were considered inherently risky. 
It is also important to note that while the panel indicated that there may be cost overruns and schedule delays, the panel also recognized that NASA's management of the Space Station has been `resourceful and effective' in addressing the many challenges that have resulted from this project. With over 400,000 pounds of flight hardware completed, NASA and its international partners believe that by the end of this year, over half a million pounds will be completed and the first two elements of the station will be in orbit. Although Russia has only been able to complete 95 percent of the module, the Russian government has reiterated its commitment to the station. However, NASA continues to evaluate other contingency plans to address possible delays by Russia. 
Once completed, the International Space Station will be the most complex structure ever sent into orbit, encompassing a laboratory and living quarters the size of two football fields. As demonstrated by several experiments conducted on the Russian Mir space station, Skylab, and space shuttle flights, advancements in science will be enhanced by the International Space Station. These experiments have been used to determine or refine existing protein structure models, create new drugs to battle viruses, such as AIDS, and develop inhibitors, such as those used to alleviate the complication of inflammation associated with heart surgery. 
Mr. President, as I have mentioned, the importance of the International Space Station is evident. The technological advancements that may be achieved by this project are monumental. I urge my colleagues to continue funding the International Space Station and maintain American's leadership in space research and exploration.

 Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution to commemorate the centennial anniversary of U.S. relations with the territory of Guam, which was acquired by the United States as a result of the Spanish-American War in 1898. The Philippines and Puerto Rico were acquired at the same time under the terms of the Treaty of Paris, but the Philippines has since become an independent nation and Puerto Rico is a U.S. Commonwealth. The island of Guam remains an unincorporated U.S. territory and is geographically located in the western Pacific. 
As we commemorate this historic moment in U.S.-Guam relations, I think it is fitting that we recognize the contributions and sacrifices that the people of Guam have made to our country, and the strategically significant role that Guam continues to play in the western Pacific. Guam is the only remaining U.S. territory that was occupied by Japan during World War II from 1941 to 1944, and served as a significant staging area for our military conflicts in World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Persian Gulf War. The people of Guam also served our nation well in assisting our efforts to resettle thousands of refugees affected by these conflicts. The island continues to be used by the U.S. military as a strategic post in the Pacific. We need to commend the people of Guam for their loyalty and their sacrifice to our country. 
Because of Guam's great distance from the continental United States and close proximity to Asia, it is often difficult for Americans to remember that Guam is even a part of the United States and her people are U.S. citizens. Moreover, given Guam's history, isolation and small size, it is not easy for Americans and Congressional policymakers to understand the aspirations of the people of Guam and the issues confronting her political leaders. 
That is why I am pleased that President Clinton recently acknowledged that the federal government has a duty to fully consider the unique situation Guam faces on political status and land issues. I wholeheartedly agree with the President and urge that we engage the Government of Guam in a constructive discussion on Guam's quest for commonwealth status and the return of federal excess lands. One point I would like to make clear, however, is that I believe that federal excess land issues can be addressed separately from commonwealth negotiations. The resolution of Guam's political status should not hinder the federal government's efforts to redress longstanding land issues. In fact, last year the Senate passed S. 210, an omnibus territories bill, which includes a provision which provides for the transfer of certain federal excess lands in Guam. With one third of the land in Guam controlled by the Defense Department, I think that the people of Guam have more than shouldered their burden as part of U.S. national security in the Asia-Pacific region. The federal impact on land use planning is more evident if you consider that Guam is just 30 miles long and nine miles wide. Let's recognize this year's centennial by enacting S. 210 and show that we do care about Guam's needs. 
Mr. President, for the past 100 years, the people of Guam have served as loyal citizens to our country. They have worked hard to develop a private sector to supplement the jobs created by the presence of our U.S. military bases. They have done their best to promote economic self-sufficiency. They have been there for us all these years and I think it is time that we recognize this and show our appreciation. I believe that the United States should take this opportunity to give back to the people of Guam by seriously engaging them in political status and land issues. It is the last we can do for all that Guam has done for our country.

 Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Pet Protection and Safety Act of 1998, a bill to close a serious loophole in the Animal Welfare Act. 
Congress passed the Animal Welfare Act over 30 years ago to stop the mistreatment of animals and to prevent the sale of family pets for laboratory experiments. Despite the Animal Welfare Act's well-meaning intentions and the enforcement efforts of the Department of Agriculture, the Act routinely fails to provide pets and pet owners with reliable protection against the actions of USDA-licensed Class B animal dealers, also known as `random source' dealers. 
Medical research is an invaluable weapon in the battle against disease. New drugs and surgical techniques offer promise in the fight against AIDS, cancer, and a host of life-threatening diseases. Animal research has been, and continues to be, fundamental to advancements in medicine. I am not here to argue whether animals should or should not be used in research; rather, I am addressing the unethical practice of selling stolen pets and stray animals to research facilities. 
There are less than 40 `random source' animal dealers operating throughout the country who acquire tens of thousands of dogs and cats. Many of these animals are family pets, acquired by so-called `bunchers' who resort to theft and deception as they collect animals and sell them to Class B dealers. `Bunchers' often respond to `free pet to a good home' advertisements, tricking animal owners into giving away their pets by posing as someone interested in adopting the dog or cat. Random source dealers are known to keep hundreds of animals at a time in squalid conditions, providing them with little food or water. The mistreated animals often pass through several hands and across state lines before they are eventually sold by a random source dealer to a research laboratory for $200 to $500 each. 
Mr. President, the use of animals in research is subject to legitimate criticism because of the fraud, theft, and abuse that I have just described. Dr. Robert Whitney, former director of the Office of Animal Care and Use at the National Institutes of Health echoed this sentiment when he stated, `The continued existence of these virtually unregulatable Class B dealers erodes the public confidence in our commitment to appropriate procurement, care, and use of animals in the important research to better the health of both humans and animals.' While I doubt that laboratories intentionally seek out stolen or fraudulently obtained dogs and cats as research subjects, the fact remains that these animals end up in research laboratories--and little is being done to stop it. Mr. President, it is clear to most observers, including animal welfare organizations around the country, that this problem persists because of random source animal dealers. 
The Pet Protection and Safety Act strengthens the Animal Welfare Act by prohibiting the use of random source animal dealers as suppliers of dogs and cats to research laboratories. At the same time, The Pet Protection and Safety Act preserves the integrity of animal research by encouraging research laboratories to obtain animals from legitimate sources that comply with the Animal Welfare Act. Legitimate sources are USDA-licensed Class A dealers or breeders; municipal pounds that choose to release dogs and cats for research purposes; legitimate pet owners who want to donate their animals to research; and private and federal facilities that breed their own animals. These four sources are capable of supplying millions of animals for research, far more cats and dogs than are required by current laboratory demand. Furthermore, at least in the case of using municipal pounds, research laboratories could save money since pound animals cost only a few dollars compared to $200 and $500 per animal charged by random animal dealers. The National Institutes of Health, in an effort to curb abuse and deception, has already adopted policies against the acquisition of dogs and cats from random source dealers. 
The Pet Protection and Safety Act also reduces the Department of Agriculture's regulatory burden by allowing the Department to use its resources more efficiently and effectively. Each year, hundreds of thousands of dollars are spent on regulating 40 random source dealers. To combat any future violations of the Animal Welfare Act, the Pet Protection and Safety Act increases the penalties under the Act to a minimum of $1,000 per violation.

Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, it is with great pleasure that I take the floor today to speak on behalf of Ms. Susan Oki Mollway, the President's nominee to the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaii. 
I wholeheartedly support Ms. Mollway, who, if confirmed, will fill the fourth seat on the Hawaii court. I also want to join with the remarks of my senior Senator, who eloquently and passionately spoke about Susan Oki Mollway and her family. He also spoke about our interviewing her for this position and how impressed we were with her caliber, the kind of person that she is. I also want to thank chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah for his support and for reporting this out of committee, and also Senator Pat Leahy, the ranking member from Vermont on the committee, and members of the committee for reporting this nominee out to the floor. I also want to thank our majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, for permitting it to be on the floor today. 
This has been a long journey for us. This position has been vacant since the untimely passing of Judge Harold Fong in April of 1995. As the senior Senator from Hawaii noted, the caseload in the District of Hawaii continues to increase. This has been very, very 
difficult for Hawaii. The recently adjusted 1997 Federal Court Management Statistics Report found that the U.S. District Court, District of Hawaii, is the eighth busiest court out of 91 in the country, and the third busiest in the ninth circuit. 
Therefore, it is critical that the vacancy on the Hawaii court is filled. Senator Inouye and I believe that Susan Oki Mollway is the most qualified candidate for this position. 
Ms. Mollway enjoys the highest rating of `well qualified' from the majority of the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary. To quote some of her colleagues in Hawaii, `We have come to know her as a highly ethical, careful, dedicated, intelligent, articulate, caring, and energetic lawyer.' Ms. Mollway is known for her professional skills, her sense of ethics, and a moral compassion--qualities needed for service on the Federal bench. 
Senator Inouye has already recounted Ms. Mollway's education, professional, and family background. However, I do wish to point out that, as a Harvard Law School graduate, she could have stayed on the mainland like so many of Hawaii's young people. Instead, she returned to Hawaii, the home of her parents, where she joined one of Honolulu's best-known law firms --Cades Schutte Fleming & Wright. 
As a specialist in civil litigation, Ms. Mollway handles a wide range of cases and has appeared before every level of the State and Federal courts, including a successful appearance before the U.S. Supreme Court in 1994. 
Ms. Mollway has responded fully to those who have questioned her on her former position on the board of directors of the Hawaii chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. Senator Inouye has mentioned this about her. Prior to her board membership, the ACLU-Hawaii filed a friend of the court brief in support of plaintiffs in the Hawaii same-sex marriage case. Although she was aware of ACLU-Hawaii's position and activities in the same-sex marriage case, as a board member Susan Mollway was never called on to play an active role. 
Furthermore, Ms. Mollway understands that her personal opinions are not relevant to the decisions she would make as a Federal judge. She has stated that she recognizes the authority of the Constitution, Federal statutes as passed by the Congress, and case precedent from higher courts as the judicial guidelines to follow in court deliberation. 
I believe my colleagues will agree with me that Susan Mollway's credentials are impressive. She is an individual of the highest integrity, whose dedication to her profession is admired by all. I am pleased to lend my support to Ms. Mollway and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this nominee whose confirmation will bring the U.S. District Court in Hawaii to its full complement.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be joining Senator Kempthorne and Senator Cleland, chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Personnel, in offering an amendment to the 1999 Defense Authorization Act that would waive current statutory time limitations for award of the Distinguished Service Cross, Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Distinguished Service Medal to certain deserving veterans. 
Mr. President, I am especially pleased that this amendment will enable the Department of the Army to award the Distinguished Service Medal (DSM), our third-highest award after the Medal of Honor and Distinguished Service Cross, to the late Lt. Colonel Richard Motoso Sakakida of Fremont, California. The award would honor Colonel Sakakida's meritorious service as an Army intelligence officer and undercover agent in the Philippines during World War II. 
Colonel Sakakida, a second-generation Japanese American and former Hawaii native, was recruited by Army military intelligence well before the attack on Pearl Harbor to conduct undercover activities in the Philippines. Then-Sergeant Sakakida served in the Philippines from 1941 to 1945, first as a covert operative spying on the Japanese community, subsequently as a military intelligence staffer for General MacArthur, and still later, after giving up a seat on an escape aircraft to a fellow nisei, as the only Japanese American prisoner of war captured by the Japanese during that conflict. 
While a POW, Sakakida was subjected to severe torture--beatings, dislocation of his shoulders, and cigarette burns--by the feared Japanese secret police, the kempeitai, without revealing his covert status. After gaining the trust of his captors and assigned menial tasks in the Judge Advocate's office of the Japanese 14th Army, he was able to purloin vital military intelligence, including information on troop movements. He reported this information to General MacArthur's headquarters in Australia via a secret courier service that he helped establish comprising Filipino guerrillas. Some of the information he conveyed to the Allies in this way may have contributed to the destruction of a Japanese naval task force. 
He also took advantage of his position to aid secretly a number of Allied prisoners of war who were being held there for trial for attempting to escape; Sakakida smuggled food to them and imaginatively interpreted for them during their trials. One of these men, a naval officer who would later become an Oklahoma supreme court justice, asserted that he escaped execution only through Sakakida's intervention and assistance during his trial. 
During this period, Sakakida engaged in perhaps his most daring exploit, the jailbreak of hundreds of Filipino guerrillas from a Japanese prison. Disguised in a stolen Japanese officer's uniform, he managed to free the guerrilla leader Ernest Tupas and hundreds of other imprisoned fighters, who later augmented his intelligence pipeline to MacArthur. Yet, despite the opportunity for escape that was offered on this and other occasions, Sakakida chose to remain a prisoner of war in order to continue his undercover work. 
After American forces invaded the Philippines, Sakakida escaped from the retreating Japanese forces at Baguio. During a firefight between American and Japanese troops, he suffered shrapnel wounds in the stomach. For the next several months Sakakida wandered alone in the jungle, living off the land, debilitated by his injuries. He finally happened upon American troops, whom he eventually convinced of his identity. At that point, he was informed that the war was over. 
After the war, Sakakida served with the War Crimes Tribunal, obtaining information on war crimes committed by the Japanese in the Philippines. He later transferred to the Air Force, where he led a long and distinguished career with the Office of Special Investigations. 
Mr. President, aside from a Purple Heart Award and Prisoner of War Medal, Colonel Sakakida has yet to be honored with an official U.S. military decoration for his amazing service in the Philippines. There are a number of reasons for this oversight, but most are attributable to the official secrecy surrounding his work, which prevented his story from being recognized for what it was until it was too late to consider him for an appropriate decoration. When his accomplishments at last came to light at a veterans convention in 1991, some of Sakakida's supporters, including myself, sought to have him considered for a high award for valor; however, the Army refused to consider any award applications in Sakakida's behalf on the basis that the statutory application deadlines for these awards had expired. 
After numerous failed attempts to waive these rules, an opportunity recently presented itself to seek equity for Sakakida under a new provision of law (section 526 of Public Law 104-106) that requires the military services to review the merits of an application for an award, regardless of any statutory time restrictions, if a member of Congress submits such an application. Under the measure, if the military determines that such an award is merited, it may request a waiver from Congress to make the award. 
Last March, pursuant to section 526, I asked the Army to review Sakakida's record to determine if he deserved the DSM. In May, the Army responded positively to the request and officially recommended that Congress grant the late veteran a waiver from all time limits pertaining to the award. The amendment that Senator Kempthorne, Senator Cleland, and I are offering would effectively grant this waiver, clearing the way for the Army to confer the DSM on this amazing individual. 
Mr. President, for the late Colonel Sakakida and his wife Cherry, this day has been long in the making. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to ensure that a true American hero can receive his due, albeit posthumously. This award means a great deal not only to his widow, but to the entire Japanese American community and all those who honor military service to their country. 
Should this amendment become law, I would like to recognize the many nisei veterans, including members of the all-nisei Military Intelligence Service, and other supporters whose enthusiasm sustained Sakakida's case. I would also like to single out the efforts of three individuals without whose hard work the Army would never have considered Sakakida's case: Wayne Kiyosaki, who wrote the definitive biography of Colonel Sakakida; Ted Tsukiyama, who served as a key historical resource; and, most importantly, Colonel Harry Fukuhara, whose tireless advocacy in behalf of the late hero reflects his own dedicated service to his nation. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the assistance of Senator Kempthorne, Senator Cleland, and Charlie Abell of the Personnel Subcommittee staff for their support and guidance on this matter. I eagerly await the day when Colonel Sakakida's accomplishments are officially recognized by the U.S. Army.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, the Senate is engaged in an historic debate over tobacco control legislation. This bill is the most important public health issue of the decade. Yet, it appears that we are losing sight of the foremost purpose of the bill. If this bill was a Christmas tree, its branches would be drooping to the floor because of the weight of the unrelated amendments. These extraneous amendments were added at the insistence of the majority to broaden the appeal of the legislation. Yet, critics of the bill cite these amendments as reasons to topple the tree. 
First, a majority of Senators voted to strip the liability provisions from the tobacco bill. With this vote, we lost a powerful incentive for the tobacco companies to accept provisions of the bill that require their consent. Industry cooperation is critically important to a comprehensive national tobacco policy, and to obtain voluntary acceptance of the sweeping advertising restrictions. 
As my colleagues know, advertising is one of the most important factors in attracting young people to tobacco products, and restrictions on advertising must be a central component of the efforts to reduce youth tobacco consumption. Industry acceptance will also be essential to the lock-back provisions that will penalize companies that fail to meet youth tobacco reduction targets. 
The majority then passed an amendment to divert $2 billion from public health initiatives into programs having nothing to do with tobacco. This amendment takes money allocated to public health and puts it into drug interdiction, the Coast Guard, education vouchers, and a multitude of other items. We have abandoned the fundamental objective of this public health legislation. 
The Senate then approved an amendment providing a massive tax cut to reduce the marriage penalty and increase the deductibility of health insurance for the self-employed. These provisions not only strip huge sums from the bill, but also take funds from the general treasury in future years. As a result, the majority of my colleagues voted to weaken the Social Security system for future generations. Money that would have been used to reduce the incidence of youth smoking will instead be used to finance a tax cut. Make no mistake about it, this action severely hampers the effectiveness of the programs designed to reduce tobacco use. The money stripped from the bill would have paid for core public health initiatives such as health research, counter advertising, and smoking cessation and education programs. 
We are losing sight of the grim statistics on youth tobacco consumption that have been repeated here on a daily basis. Every day, 3,000 kids become smokers. One third will die to tobacco related diseases. We have an obligation to act. 
Despite my strong objections to these changes, we must pass a measure out of the Senate and allow the process to continue. The bill retains provisions that address the problems of youth tobacco consumption. For example, the tobacco price increase in the bill should dramatically reduce the number of kids who begin smoking and who may ultimately die from smoking related diseases. Statistics show that for every ten cents added to the price of cigarettes, approximately 700,000 fewer teens will being smoking and more than 200,000 premature deaths will be avoided. The bill also provides for a national counter-advertising campaign aimed at discouraging young people from using tobacco products. It also funds health research at the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and state and local tobacco education and prevention programs. 
Two other components of the bill that will have a large impact on our efforts were added during floor consideration. The first is the increased investment of funds into early childhood development and after-school activities. The second is the strengthening of the look-back provisions which hold individual tobacco companies responsible for their portion of the youth market. 
Mr. President, the Senate still has a landmark opportunity to save the lives of future generations. If this effort is defeated it will show that the majority bowed to the tobacco industry and sold out the youth of America.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would permanently authorize the Department of Veterans Affairs Home Loan Guaranty Program for members of the Selected Reserve. 
The eligibility of National Guard and Reserve members for VA-guaranteed home loans will expire in October 1999. I believe that Section 3702 of Title 38, which allows Guard and Reserve members who complete 6 years of service to participate in the loan program, should be made permanent. 
The law extending eligibility for the VA Home Loan Guaranty Program to these service members was enacted in 1992 with bipartisan support in the Senate and in the House. As the sponsor of the original bill, I am pleased with the participation of Guard and Reserve members in the program, and am committed to ensuring that their eligibility for this program continues beyond the sunset date. 
With the downsizing of our active duty military forces, Guard and Reserve units are becoming an increasingly vital element of the total force. However, there are very few incentives to get qualified individuals to serve our country in the Selected Reserve. The VA Home Loan Guaranty Program for National Guard and Reserve members is an excellent incentive to join and remain in the Selected Reserve. 
Since the VA Home Loan Guaranty Program for Guard and Reserve members began in October 1992, the VA has guaranteed more than 33,000 loans through fiscal year 1996. In 1996 alone, approximately 11,000 loans totalling over $1 billion were made. According to the VA, only 93 out of all loans made to Reservists have been foreclosed upon, for a minimal default rate of about 0.4 percent. By comparison, the foreclosure rate for loans made to other veterans was two and one-half times higher than the rate for Reservists. Furthermore, 67 percent of loans to Reservists guaranteed by the VA in fiscal year 1996 were to first time home buyers, compared to 56 percent of loans to other veterans. 
As the statistics on VA-guaranteed home loans indicate, the inclusion of Guard and Reserve members actually stabilizes the financial viability of he program since this group is likely to have a lower default rate than other veterans. Reservists are generally an older, more mature, and stable group with established civilian jobs and ties to local communities. 
Mr. President, it is clear that the VA Home Loan Guaranty Program is not only good for members of the Selected Reserve, it is also beneficial for the VA Home Guaranty Program. Furthermore, the local economies where the homes are purchased also benefit from this program. So, therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. Passage of this measure will ensure that the program continues to be made available to National Guard and Reserve members who have served our country.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today marks the centennial of the Philippines' independence from Spain and also the 100th anniversary of Philippine-American relations. I urge my colleagues to reflect upon our friendly relationship with the Filipino people and their Republic. 
The Sun and Stars, the flag of the Republic of the Philippines, has once again been unfurled on the same balcony where General Emilio Aguinaldo declared the country's independence, overthrowing 300 years of Spanish colonization on June 12, 1898. 
With that act by General Aguinaldo, Filipinos earned the distinct honor of being the first indigenous people in Asia to wrest their freedom and independence by force of arms from their European colonial masters. 
The Philippine Centennial is a toast to the Filipino spirit, to the rebirth of a courageous nation, to Asia's first republic and constitutional democracy, and to a glorious and progressive future for the Filipino Nation. 
There is no better time than now to recognize the enduring friendship between our two countries. 
It is a friendship which flourished despite tragic beginnings in a conflict first with the Spanish in 1898, and subsequently with Filipino independence fighters. But we moved beyond that struggle and worked diligently to grant full Philippine independence in 1946. 
During World War II, Filipino troops fought bravely side-by-side with American forces and Filipino guerrilla fighters were indispensable in the liberation of the Philippines from Japanese occupation. 
The Philippines continued, even after independence, to be America's most important ally in Asia, again contributing troops to the Korean conflict and to the Vietnam war. 
We owe a debt of gratitude, if not more, to our Filipino friends. We rejoiced when the peaceful `people power' revolution restored democracy to the Philippines twelve years ago. Presidents Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos established a democratic government and instituted market-based reforms which placed the Philippines--politically and economically--on a strong foundation for the 21st century. 
I am confidant that newly elected President, Joseph Estrada, will continue to nurture these reforms. The Multilateral Aid Initiative for the Philippines that Congress launched following the `people power' revolution was an effort not only to demonstrate support for Filipino democracy but also to show our lasting commitment to an enduring relationship with the Philippines. This continues to be the basis for our policy, and it is instructive that during the current Asian financial crisis the Philippines has escaped the worst effects of the crisis. 
The United States continues to be the largest trading partner and foreign investor in the Philippines. One-third of Philippines' exports come to America. Two-way trade between our two countries exceeds $12 billion. 
Today, all Americans should honor our good friendship with the Philippines on this important commemoration of their independence, support their continued political and economic progress, and work to maintain the special and close relationship between our sister democracies. The Philippines has clearly become a positive role model for its Asian neighbors. 
Mr. President, because of the deep and enduring ties that have tradionally bound the people of the Philippines and the United States together, I strongly urge our colleagues to adopt S. Res. 235, a resolution commemorating 100 years of friendly relations between the people of the United States and the Philippines. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and the preamble be agreed to, en bloc, and that the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.

 Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the students from Lahainaluna High School from Lahaina, Maui, who recently came to Washington, D.C., to participate in the national competition of We the People . . . The Citizens and the Constitution. 
As you may know, We the People . . . The Citizen and the Constitution is a civic education program which seeks to develop young students into enlightened and capable citizens who understand and promote responsible participation in our democratic process. Students learn the history and principles behind our constitutional democracy through the use of the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution, and the Bill of Rights. 
These young students competed against 49 other classes from across the Nation, demonstrating a youthful and enthusiastic interest in the fundamental ideas that are imperative for gaining a better understanding of our government. We the People is not only a competitive event, but it is also the most extensive civics program to reach more than 26 million students from elementary, middle, and high schools across the country. 
I would like to recognize these fine students for their accomplishments: Iao Eisenberg, Tiffany Fujiwara, Jasmine Hentz, Erin Lockhard, William Myers, Leah Nakamura, Ryan Ott, Michael Prieto, Julie Reed, Sal Saribay, Justin Serrano, Jeffrey Shelton, Yee Ning Tay, and Kerri Tsubaki. I would also like to acknowledge the contributions of their teacher, Mrs. Ruth E. Hill, and the District and State Coordinators, Ms. Jane Kinoshita and Ms. Sharon Kaohi, respectively. Without their dedication and leadership, our students would be unable to participate in this important program. 
Mr. President, I commend all the students and teachers who participated in this program, and particularly the students of Lahainaluna High School who represented Hawaii in the national competition. It is always heartwarming to see students actively engaged in the learning process. I wish the students and teacher of Lahainaluna High School the best as they continue to pursue their future endeavors.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the 27th Infantry Regiment `Wolfhounds' for their 50 year relationship with the children of Holy Family Home of Osaka, Japan. This relationship is a symbol of the friendship and cooperation we have with the Japanese people. It has played an integral part in our lasting relationship with Japan and is a story that deserves to be told. 
Fifty years ago, Catholic nuns from the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul stood hopeless in the streets of a battered, war-torn Osaka, Japan, selling buttons and trinkets to the incoming occupation force soldiers in exchange for food. They were trying to keep orphaned children, who were living in abandoned, shabby, cold barracks, alive during most difficult conditions. Several Wolfhound regiment soldiers, including my friend Sergeant Hugh O'Reilly, saw the sisters' dedication and dilemma and took the news back to their headquarters. The men quickly organized to provide relief for the children. 
Over the next few months, the soldiers used materials from the occupation forces to build facilities, collected money to feed the children, and began to cement this lasting relationship. Interested in doing more for the orphanage, Sgt. O'Reilly coordinated support from his unit for the Christmas holiday of 1949. This marked the beginning of the current relationship. Later, Sgt. O'Reilly began collecting money on a regular basis to improve living conditions for the children. Every week the collection grew, eventually averaging $3,000 a month. When the 27th Infantry deployed to Korea in 1950 the collections continued, to the surprise of the Sisters of Charity. The funds received during the years of occupation duty and the Korean conflict helped build the orphanage complex that greatly improved the lives of the children. 
The 27th Infantry's generosity to the orphanage brought much public attention to the unique relationship the regiment had with the orphanage. In 1955, Hollywood produced the film `Three Stripes in the Sun,' which detailed Sgt. O'Reilly's efforts to assist the orphanage. In 1957, the Wolfhounds invited two children from the orphanage to come to Schofield Barracks in Hawaii, thus beginning the tradition that continues to this day. This month, on June 8, two more orphans will be making their first trip to Hawaii. 
Another tradition began the following year, when the Wolfhounds sent two `Soldiers of the Year' to the orphanage during Christmas to act as `Father Christmas.' They visited the orphanage in Osaka, bringing gifts and companionship during the holidays. 
These visits have been made possible largely by the generosity of a special individual, Mr. Akio Aoyama, an industrial leader in Japan. He recognized the benefits of improved United States-Japan relations that the orphans' relationship with the American regiment would foster. He has donated $10,000 each year to help offset the costs of travel, lodging, and other functions during the orphans' annual pilgrimage to the Wolfhounds in Hawaii. 
Sgt. O'Reilly is the Wolfhounds honorary sergeant major and lives in Hawaii with his wife, whom he met at the orphanage. I would like to thank and commend him and the Wolfhounds for their untiring dedication and love for the children of Holy Family Home. Whether it be defending our country during times of war or promoting goodwill in peace, I know the soldiers of the 27th Infantry Regiment will endure. We all say thank you for a job well done and wish you continued success in the future.

 Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, in behalf of myself and Senator Dan Inouye, I am introducing legislation today that would enable the National Park Service to acquire a valuable parcel of land at the southern tip of the Island of Hawaii for inclusion in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park (HVNP). 
My bill, which is supported by the Administration, would revise HVNP's enabling act to allow the Secretary of the Interior to use appropriated funds to acquire a certain 1,951-acre tract of privately held land on the southern boundaries of the park. HVNP's existing statutory authority precludes the acquisition of additional contiguous properties except by donation. 
Mr. President, the small parcel of land that the Park Service wishes to acquire is clearly defined by the `Great Crack,' a landform which extends to the summit of the Kilauea Caldera and is characterized by extensive pili grasslands. The area contains historic and prehistoric lava flows with related geological features, major lava tube systems of significant biological and cultural value, and over two miles of coastal environment with associated cultural sites and marine resources. 
Located adjacent to HVNP's designated Wilderness Area, one of the most remote areas of the wilderness in Hawaii, the proposed acquisition would be managed as undeveloped land sharing the same wilderness qualities of natural quiet, grand vistas, and solitude. 
Mr. President, the acquisition of this parcel will significantly enhance the environmental and cultural values of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. I hope that my colleagues will support this measure.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, before we break for the Memorial Day recess, I would like to remark on the celebration of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month and to honor the contributions Asian Pacific Americans have made to our country. 
Mr. President, the scope of the celebration has expanded every year since 1992, when President Bush signed Public Law 102-450 designating May of every year as `Asian Pacific American Heritage Month.' In Washington, D.C., and in cities all around the nation, schools, community organizations, cultural groups, and government agencies are commemorating the occasion with film festivals, conferences, cultural shows, museum exhibits, political forums, and a multitude of other activities. 
Americans of Asian and Pacific Islander descent number 10 million and that figure continues to rise. Asian Pacific Americans represent a broad range of ethnic groups. Their histories are as diverse as the lands of their origin. The earliest immigrants--Chinese, Japanese, Asian Indians, Koreans, and Filipinos--and the most recent refugees--Vietnamese, Laotians, and Cambodians--all experienced similar, yet unique journeys as they crossed the Pacific to venture to a new land of opportunity. Opportunities, however, were not as plentiful as they would have hoped. From the Chinese Exclusion Laws, which restricted immigration on a racial basis, to Executive Order 9066, which resulted in the internment of more than 110,000 Japanese Americans and their immigrant relatives, life in America, at times, proved to be a nightmare rather than the promised American Dream. But despite seemingly insurmountable obstacles, these early intrepid immigrants toiled and sacrificed in order to make this country their own and to preserve the American dream for their American children. They helped build our railroads, labored on our farms, worked endless factory hours, and formed the backbone of many small businesses. 
Today, even more so than in the past, Asian Pacific Americans contribute to every sector of our society. They are in corporate board rooms, scientific laboratories, universities, Congress, statehouses, the judiciary, government agencies, the performing arts, and sports. They are architects like I.M. Pei, scientists like AIDS researcher David Ho, statesmen like Senator Dan Inouye, writers like journalist Iris Chang, musicians like conductor Zubin Mehta, filmmakers like Chris Tashima, sports heroes like Tiger Woods, and warriors like General Eric Shinseki. Unfortunately, the scope and ubiquity of Asian Pacific accomplishments are often overshadowed by insensitive acts directed against members of the community. 
For example, during last year's investigation of campaign finance abuses, the distinction between foreign donors and Asian American donors was frequently blurred by members of both political parties and the media. While investigations focused on contributions made to the Democratic National Committee by foreign donors, legitimate American donors were unduly interrogated and harassed simply because their surnames happened to sound `foreign.' 
For their part, the media, including major newspapers, networks, and magazines, often confused `Asian' with `Asian American' in their stories and headlines on the donor controversy, though they never seemed to confuse `European' with Americans of European extraction. The media's inability to distinguish between foreigners and citizens contributed to the stereotypical impression that there is a nefarious `connection' between all Asians and Asian Americans. 
This bias was in more recent evidence just after Michelle Kwan and Tara Lipinski honored America by winning the silver and gold Olympic figure skating medals, respectively. Immediately after the event, the internet website of NBC's cable affiliate, MSNBC, contained the headline, `American Beats Out Kwan for Women's Figure Skating Title.' As we all know, both Lipinski and Kwan are Americans. But the difference between the two champions, in the eyes of MSNBC's editors, was their skin color, making one `more' American than the other. 
Mr. President, instances like these remind us that Asian Pacific Americans, whatever their achievements, whatever their contributions to the nation, are still perceived as foreigners, whether fifth or first generation. These unfortunate incidents are reminders that as a nation we still have a long journey ahead of us on the road to tolerance and mutual understanding. 
But I would be remiss if I did not also point out that there have also been a number of developments that have helped advance the Asian Pacific community's quest to become fully accepted members of American society. I would like to take this 
opportunity to highlight two notable events which occurred during this month's celebration of Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, events that I hope reflect a growing understanding of, and appreciation for, Asian Pacific Americans by fellow Americans. 
First, last Saturday, a ceremony celebrating the designation of Angel Island as a National Historic Landmark was held in San Francisco. Located in San Francisco Bay, Angel Island Immigration Station served as an immigration processing station for many West Coast immigrants between 1910 and 1940. Most of the immigrants entering through Angel Island were Chinese, but a sizable portion of the immigrants came from Japan, the Philippines, and Europe as well. However, the Chinese experience was vastly different from that of other immigrants, regardless of which port of entry they entered through. Subject to a series of Chinese exclusion laws beginning in 1882, Chinese immigrants could only enter the United States under the `exempt class.' Instead of a welcoming atmosphere, these Chinese were subjected to days, weeks, months, and even years of hostile interrogation before being admitted to the U.S. or being deported back to China. They languished in prison-like conditions at Angel Island until decisions were handed down. In contrast, processing at Ellis Island took an immigrant, on average, three to five hours. Angel Island Immigration Station closed in 1940 after processing over 175,000 Chinese immigrants. 
In 1970, a state park ranger discovered scores of poems beautifully carved into the wooden walls of the detention barracks, evidently composed by its onetime Chinese and Japanese resident. In one poem, a prospective Chinese immigrant wrote:  
Every one says traveling to North America is a pleasure. 
I suffered misery on the ship and sadness in the wooden building. 
After several interrogations, still I am not done. 
I sigh because my compatriots are being forcibly detained. 
Another wrote 
Originally, I had intended to come to America last year. 
Lack of money delayed me until early autumn. 
It was on the day that the Weaver Maiden met the Cowherd. 
That I took passage on the President Lincoln. 
I ate wind and tasted waves for more than twenty days. 
Fortunately, I arrived safety on the American continent. 
I thought I could land in a few days. 
How was I to know I would become a prisoner suffering in the wooden building? 
The barbarians abuse is really difficult to take. 
When my family's circumstances stir my emotions, a double stream of tears flow. 
I only wish I can land in San Francisco soon, 
Thus sparing me this additional sorrow here. 
These poignant works reveal the hardships these immigrants endured; but, more importantly, they also revealed hopes and desires that are universal to the American story. This story is work preserving, whether it is the experience of the Irish of Boston, the Italians of New York City, the African Americans of Savannah, the Mexicans of El Paso, or the Cambodians of Long Beach. 
I would like to congratulate the Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation, the Chinese Historical Society of America, the California Department of Parks and Recreation, and the many other community organizations and individuals who worked tirelessly to procure National Historic Landmark status for Angel Island. It is my hope the new designation will help preserve a significant experience in the lives of Asian Pacific immigrants, on that will also resonate with the universal immigration experience of all Americans. 
The second promising development that occurred this month was the announcement by Hasbro Toys, the company, which manufactures `G.I. Joe,' that it will be creating a Japanese American G.I. Joe, as part of its G.I. Joe Classics Collection. The action figure will honor the Japanese Americans who fought valiantly for our country during World War II. 
My colleagues will recall that as members of the famed 100th Infantry Battalion/442nd Regimental Combat Team, Japanese American soldiers suffered unparalleled casualties in the French and Italian campaigns. Many veterans today still recall the heroism of this fighting unit, which during one famous engagement sustained 800 casualties to save the lives of some 200 members of a Texas battalion who were facing certain annihilation by German troops. The 442nd emerged as one of the most decorated units in our nation's military history, among its more famous members is Senator Daniel Inouye, whose heroism earned him the Distinguished Service Cross. 
Aside from their military prowess, what was even more remarkable about these brave men was the fact that they were fighting for a country which was, in essence, holding their families hostage in internment camps. One of the darkest chapters of our nation's history was the forced evacuation of over 110,000 Japanese Americans into internment camps. 
And so I am very pleased that a toy company, which markets to our most important community, our children, has dispensed with typical marketing values to honor America's home-grown Asian Pacific American heroes. For ultimately, only change in our cultural values will have transformational effect on race and ethnic relations as we approach the next millennium. 
Mr. President, I am Native Hawaiian and I am Chinese, but above all I am American. I have embraced all of my identities and hope that others can learn to embrace and cherish our inherent diversity. It is my sincere hope that as we celebrate Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, each and every citizen will reflect on our nation's multiple heritages and appreciate the relationship between our racial and ethnic diversity and the unity that binds us together as Americans. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution to commemorate 100 years of relations between the people of the United States and the people of the Philippines. It is especially fitting for Congress to recognize our special relationship with the Philippines because this year is also the centennial of Philippine independence from Spain. Senators Helms, Biden, Thomas, Inouye, Roth, Lugar, Boxer, Cochran, Coverdale, and Murray have joined me in submitting the resolution. 
Our country's friendship with the Philippines began in 1898, a year which also marked a growing U.S. interest in the Pacific region. Over the years, the Philippines has modeled its governmental institutions after the United States and has demonstrated a growing commitment to democracy, human rights, and a free market economy. 
Until the end of the Cold War, the United States maintained major military facilities in the Philippines, which played a significant role in preserving regional peace and stability. The United States has important strategic, economic, and political interests in Southeast Asia and regional stability remains an overriding U.S. concern. To this end, Filipino soldiers have stood shoulder to shoulder with American troops on the battlefields of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam to protect and advance mutual interest. Today, the Philippines remains an important partner in guarding the peace and maintaining stability in Southeast Asia. 
In the twelve years since the peaceful `people power' revolution restored democracy to the Philippines, President Aquino and Ramos established a democratic government and instituted market-based reforms which placed the Philippines--politically and economically--on a strong foundation for the 21st century. Economic growth exceeded 6 percent last year and is forecast to grow at 3 percent in 1998. 
In many ways the Philippines has emerged as a model for her Asian neighbors. Political stability and democratic institutions were strengthened by free market and trade reforms. In turn, deregulation, lower tariffs and government debt, financial transparency, and respect for the rule of law provide a healthy economic foundation for the Philippine's future. 
It was not long ago that the Philippine economy was far behind the economic tigers of Asia. The Filipino people's love of democracy and political vitality were blamed in large part for this circumstance. Critics cited the absence of so-called `Asian values' in the Philippines, namely a willingness to make democracy secondary to prosperity and order. History has proven these commentators wrong, and today the Filipino model inspires advocates of democracy throughout Asia. Stability relies upon democracy and prudent economic policies. 
Last month when President Clinton and President Ramos met at the White House they reaffirmed the friendship between our nations. The leaders promised to continue close cooperation in responding to the Asian financial situation and conducted a frank discussion on bilateral issues, including remediation efforts at the former Subic and Clark bases and benefit parity for Filipino-American veterans. 
During this special year in which we observe the centennial of our relationship with the Philippines and the centennial of their independence, we have much to celebrate. First, we recognize the valuable contributions of Filipino-Americans to our nation. Filipino Americans helped to build and create the modern Hawaiian economy and have contributed greatly to the cultural diversity that is celebrated in my state. My good friend, Governor Ben Cayetano, is the first Filipino-American governor in the United States. In addition, we reflect on our close friendship and cooperation with the Philippines in times of war and peace. And finally, we look forward to continued close ties with a democratic and prosperous Republic of the Philippines, as we work together to champion democracy and economic growth in the dawning Pacific century.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 1385, the Workforce Investment Partnership Act. I really believe this bill would provide the infrastructure necessary to reform our Federal job training system. Currently, Federal job training programs are a hodgepodge of rules, regulations and requirements, which reflect duplicative agency responsibilities. This unfortunate situation deters employees with good intentions from seeking assistance for those in need. For the past 8 months, my colleagues in the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee have been working diligently to reform this ineffective system. 
H.R. 1385 is an ideal bill, a bipartisan bill that will consolidate dozens of programs within the Federal system of vocational and adult education, vocational rehabilitation, and job training programs. 
It will give states and local governments the flexibility to design training programs that best meet the needs of their communities. It encourages `One-Stop Customer Service' centers where applicants and employers may go to inquire about different training and employment opportunities that are available. 
In the State of Hawaii, efforts are already underway to streamline various workforce-related organizations and programs into a comprehensive system that encompasses economic development, workforce, and education priorities. The Hawaii State Legislature recently consolidated five Hawaii Department of Labor and Industrial Relations advisory policy bodies into a single agency, the Hawaii Workforce Development Council. 
This council is similar to entities in 30 other states. 
Many of our states have begun the process of consolidation, and it is time that the Federal government provide them with the direction and the resources necessary to complete this process. 
I thank my colleagues, Senator DeWine, Jeffords, Kennedy, and Wellstone for their efforts in bringing forward this bipartisan compromise for Senate consideration. H.R. 1385 will target Federal funds to those individuals who need it most and to those programs that are proven to be effective. I believe this bill will provide the infrastructure necessary to reform our Federal job training system. 
The time is now to reform this system, and I am pleased to express my support for this bill.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is finally taking action to restructure the IRS. As my colleagues know, the IRS supports operations of the Federal Government by collecting approximately $1.5 trillion in taxes each year. With roughly 102,000 employees and a budget of $7.8 billion, the IRS has a wide variety of programs designed to help taxpayers understand and meet their Federal tax obligations. 
Given the highly publicized criticism of the agency, let me begin by making a few comments relating to staff of the IRS. I am confident that the majority of the staff at the IRS, whose job it is to enforce federal tax laws, are diligent and competent in their responsibilities. Yet, we need to ensure that this professional staff lives up to a strict code of conduct, especially the supervisors and the regional directors. We must demand that taxpayer complaints about unfair treatment are promptly heard and that abusive IRS employees are dealt with appropriately. 
No one disagrees that serious reform is needed at the IRS. We in Congress also need to recognize that the complexity of the tax code and the constant changes by Congress add to the taxpayer burden and compound the difficulty of administering the laws we enact. 
The Senate Finance Committee hearings last week again highlighted serious allegations of abuse by the agency. I was pleased that IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti raised an important issue that deserves Congressional attention--that of tax evasion. Commissioner Rossotti disclosed that the tax gap, or the amount that taxpayers owe to the Federal Government but fail to pay, is $195 billion annually. Previous estimates indicated that the figure was between $70 billion to $140 billion. I agree with many of my colleagues that we must work together to conduct a review of `willful non-compliance.' We also need to maintain public confidence in the ability of the IRS to fight tax evasion. This is one example among a host of serious issues that should be a part of IRS reform. 
I am presently working with members of the Finance Committee to address an issue which involved IRS non-compliance with provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. 
Late last year, I was contacted by an IRS compliance officer who described his efforts to ensure proper enforcement by the IRS of the Foreign Investors Real Property Tax Act. After being assigned in 1990 to a special IRS project involving tax compliance of non-resident aliens, the compliance officer identified an internal IRS recordkeeping problem at the Philadelphia center, which hinders IRS collection and enforcement efforts. The compliance officer tried to resolve the matter using the processes available to him in the IRS, but was unsuccessful. This particular problem stems from the absence of an independent process for redress or complaint at the IRS. This recordkeeping failure prevents proper tax assessment and collection, and has resulted in a significant revenue loss. If these facts are correct, and the revenue loss is so great, then personnel actions should be considered for those who are responsible. 
I raise this issue to illustrate the point that we need greater oversight of the agency. As we work to improve service and responsiveness to taxpayers, we must also strive for an IRS that more effectively administers the tax laws. 
Mr. President, again, I am pleased that the Senate is moving forward on this critical issue. We must find a way to achieve an effective enforcement agency while ensuring that IRS powers are used responsibly. I believe that the legislation we are considering will move us in this direction. 
The bill incorporates many of the recommendations of the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service and is designed to enhance taxpayer rights and make the IRS more customer-friendly. I look forward to the debate in the coming days. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered by my colleague from Illinois, Senator Moseley-Braun. The Senator's amendment would authorize over $22 billion in essential bonding authority to the 50 States and territories to improve our Nation's public school system. 
The Moseley-Braun school construction amendment would provide direct assistance to states to improve and construct school facilities for our nation's children. The amendment before us will help thousands of schools across the country modernize their facilities to meet increasing technological demands. It will also provide assistance to local school districts to build additional facilities for the growing number of students. 
Hawaii's schools, particularly our rural schools on the neighbor islands, are in great need of improvement and modernization. The inclusion of modern technology in our education curriculum requires extensive renovations in older school buildings to ensure that all children have equal access to today's technological advancements. Hawaii's schools could receive an estimated $53 million for school construction under this amendment. This would greatly assist my state in meeting the increased educational demands of our children. 
Mr. President, as a former teacher, I have taught in both the private and public school systems, and I recognize the advantages and disadvantages of both systems. However, I believe that the Federal Government has a moral obligation to ensure that all our children are provided a quality education, and diverting potential resources away from our public schools is a disservice to the majority of American children who attend public schools. The underlying proposal does not focus on those who need the most help. The bill before us provides an average tax break for families with public school children of only $7 over five years, while families with children in private schools would receive a $37 benefit. This proposal provides a disproportionate share of benefits to wealthier families who do not need the additional Federal assistance. 
I urge my colleagues to support the Moseley-Braun school construction amendment and provide all our nation's children an equal opportunity to learn in safe, clean, modern school facilities. Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, today I am introducing legislation to establish voluntary standards for certifying tropical forest products grown in Hawaii. Senator Inouye has joined me in cosponsoring this measure. 
Agriculture has long been the backbone of the economy of rural Hawaii. Recently, however, the decline of sugarcane has caused an upheaval for many of our rural communities. In the past 10 years, 21 sugarcane plantations have gone out of business and the State has lost 115,000 acres of sugarcane production. 
For more than 160 years, sugar provided jobs and a special way of life for communities throughout the State. Cane is still king on Maui and parts of Kauai, but elsewhere it has disappeared from the agricultural map. Our great challenge is to develop new opportunities that keep Hawaii green and economically productive for at least as long--and hopefully longer--than our relationship with sugar. 
For many landowners, the future of rural Hawaii is in forestry. But what will forestry in Hawaii look like 10, 20, or 50 years from now? Many people have strong feelings about how to answer this question. 
Sustainability is the emerging idea in forest development. This means practicing stewardship that integrates the growth, nurturing, and harvesting of trees with the conservation of soil, air, water, and wildlife. Sustainable forests are managed to serve the needs of the present generation without compromising the needs of future generations. 
In Hawaii, the stewardship ethic is very strong, especially within the forestry community. Hawaii's tropical forests are home to some of the richest biological diversity on the planet, and our forest managers understand the importance of preserving our living heritage. But in many countries, stewardship and responsible forest development is weak or nonexistent. 
Around the globe, forests are disappearing at an unprecedented rate, and nowhere is this problem more severe than in the tropics. More than half of the world's tropical rain forests have been consumed, degraded, or destroyed in this century. 
Because of the attention being given to forest degradation, consumers are asking questions about the source of the wood 
demand, and foresters to supply, wood products from well-managed forests. 
As the demand for sustainable forest products has increased, criteria for sustainable forestry have been formalized. The result is a world-wide movement to verify that sustainable forestry claims are genuine. This process is known as certification. 
In recent years, the Hawaii forestry industry has closely monitored the certification movement. The bill I am introducing today will prompt an important dialogue on certification. I am inviting all stakeholders in this issue--Hawaii's forest industry, landowners, conservation experts, and affected communities--to engage in a free and open exchange about forest certification. 
What are the benefits of certification? For consumers, certification is a way of ensuring that forest products they purchase do not contribute to forest degradation. Independent verification of forestry practices is the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval telling them that sustainable standards are being met. 
To landowners, certification is a way of ensuring that their careful management is rewarded in the marketplace. A certification label may result in a premium for your products, better market access, and in some cases, more secure supply agreements. The best way for the Hawaii forest industry to increase the value of their resource may be to sell certified tropical wood products into a world market that recognizes the abuse that tropical forests have suffered--and is willing to pay more for a tropical product that has received proper certification. 
Just how widespread is certification today? Forest certification is big business. Certification is practiced in 25 countries. European and North American buyers groups are committed to wood products certification. Eleven nations, including Germany and France, are represented in the European buyers group. 
Certification is voluntary, not mandatory, and my bill reflects this fact. Over time, however, landowners who do not employ sustainable practices and do not seek certification may find it more difficult to market their timber. 
My bill will establish standards certifying that Hawaii forest products are cultivated, harvested, and processed in a sustainable manner. Although forestry certification standards are high, certification will not require perfection. Like agriculture, forestry is subject to the forces of nature, and nature is often unpredictable. 
For certification to become successful in Hawaii, I believe that a bottom up rather than top down approach to consensus-building makes the most sense. With this in mind, in January, 1998, I will convene a meeting in Hawaii to further the dialog about forest certification and the bill I introduced today. 
Certification can take root in Hawaii without action by Congress. However, my bill can jump start the dialog and provide a format for discussion. I will be the first one to cheer if certification becomes a reality with, or without, legislation by Congress.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators Craig and Landrieu, I am introducing the Methane Hydrate Research and Development Act of 1997. 
Methane hydrate is a methane-bearing, ice-like substance that occurs in abundance in marine sediments. It is a crystalline solid of methane molecules surrounded by a structure of water molecules. 
Methane hydrates are stable at moderately high pressures and low temperatures and contain large quantities of methane. One unit volume of methane hydrate contains more than 160 volumes of methane at standard temperature and pressure. 
Methane hydrates are found in deep ocean sediments. Significant quantities are also found in the permafrost of Alaska, Canada, and Siberia. 
Despite their potential as an energy resource, methane hydrates have not received the attention they deserve. We are only beginning to understand the magnitude of this potential resource. The amount of methane sequestered in gas hydrates is enormous. Worldwide estimates range from 100,000 trillion cubic feet to 270 million trillion cubic feet. Locations of known methane hydrate deposits within the Untied States include the Arctic, the seabed adjacent to northern California, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Eastern Seaboard. 
A conservative estimate of deposits under U.S. jurisdiction is 2,700 trillion cubic feet to seven million trillion cubic feet of gas. A recent U.S. Geological Survey analysis indicates the presence of over 500 trillion cubic feet of methane at the Black Ridge site off the coast of Carolinas alone. When you consider that current U.S. consumption is less than 25 trillion cubic feet of natural gas per year, you begin to appreciate the magnitude of this energy resource.

Mr. AKAKA. I am pleased to join Senator Murkowski and other colleagues in introducing legislation today that addresses certain aviation tax inequities that were enacted as part of Public Law 105-34, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. 
Among other aviation provisions, Public Law 105-34 lowered the passenger ticket tax from 10 percent to 9 percent, falling incrementally to 7.5 percent over 3 years. In addition, the law established a new domestic segment fee of $1, rising incrementally to $3 over 5 years, which will ultimately be indexed for inflation. However, flights from certain small, rural airports are taxed at a simple 7.5 percent rate and exempted from the segment fee. Finally, while the existing $6 international departure tax for flights between Hawaii and other states is maintained, the charge is indexed for inflation beginning in 1999. 
Mr. President, these taxes unfairly discriminate against Hawaii travellers. Residents of and visitors to Hawaii are entirely dependent on plane service for communication among the State's eight major islands as well as for travel to and from the distant U.S. mainland. The new aviation charges make personal, commercial, and Government travel within Hawaii more costly and hurts our tourism-based economy by inhibiting visitation from other States. I understand that many of these problems also apply to Alaska, which has similar transportation concerns. 
The bill we are introducing today addresses these shortcomings. Our legislation would reinstate the prior 10 percent ticket tax and eliminate the new segment fee on flights between our States and the mainland as well as on intrastate flights in Hawaii and Alaska. The measure would also eliminate the inflation adjustment for the $6 international departure tax to which flights to and from our States are subject. Finally, the bill would redefine the rural airport exemption in such a way that will qualify many passengers travelling within Hawaii and Alaska for the reduced 7.5 percent rate. 
Thank you, Mr. President. For the sake of Hawaii's and Alaska's unique air transportation needs, I urge my colleagues to support this initiative.

Mr. AKAKA. 
Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to adjust the Federal medical assistance percentage [FMAP] rate for Hawaii to reflect more fairly the State's ability to bear its share of Medicaid payments. I am pleased that my colleague, the senior Senator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, has joined me as a sponsor of this measure. 
The Federal share of Medicaid payments varies depending on each State's ability to pay--wealthier States bear a larger share of the cost of the program, and thus have lower FMAP rates. Per capita income is used as the measure of State wealth. Because per capita income in Hawaii is quite high, the State's FMAP rate is at the lowest level--50 percent. Hawaii is one of only a dozen States whose FMAP rate is at the 50 percent level. My bill would increase Hawaii's FMAP rate from 50 percent to 59.8 percent. 
Because of our geographic location and other factors, the cost of living in Hawaii greatly exceeds the cost of living in the mainland States. Per capita income is a poor measure of a State's relative ability to bear the cost of Medicaid services. An excellent analysis of this issue is included in the 21st edition of `The Federal Budget and the States', a joint study conducted by the Taubman Center for State and local Government at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government and the office of U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. According to the study, if per capita income is measured in real terms, Hawaii ranks 47th at $19,755 compared to the national average of $24,231. This sheds a totally different light on the State's financial status. 
The cost of living in Honolulu is 83 percent higher than the average of the metropolitan areas tracked by the U.S. Census Bureau, based on 1995 data. Recent studies have shown that for the State as a whole, the cost of living is more than one-third higher than the rest of the U.S. In fact, Hawaii's Cost of Living Index ranks it as the highest in the country. Some government programs take the high cost of living in Hawaii into account and funding is adjusted accordingly. These include Medicare prospective payment rates, food stamp allocations, school lunch programs, housing insurance limits, and military living expenses. 
These examples reflect the recognition that the higher cost of living in noncontiguous States should be taken into account in fashioning government program policies. It is time for similar recognition of this factor in gauging Hawaii's ability to support its health care programs. 
During consideration of the Balanced Budget Act this past summer, the Senate included a provision increasing Alaska's FMAP rate to 59.8 percent for the next 3 years. Setting a higher match rate as was done for Alaska would still leave Hawaii with a lower FMAP rate than a majority of the States, but would better recognize Hawaii's ability to pay its fair share of the costs of the Medicaid program. 
Despite the high cost of living, the Harvard-Moynihan study finds that Hawaii also has one of the highest poverty rates in the Nation. The State's 16.9 percent poverty rate is ranked eighth in the country, compared to the national average of 14.7 percent. These higher cost levels are reflected in State government expenditures and State taxation. Thus, on a per capita basis State revenue and expenditures are far higher in Hawaii, as well as Alaska, than in the 48 mainland States. The higher expenditure levels are necessary to assure an adequate level of public services which are more costly to provide in these States. 
Of the top 10 States with the highest poverty rates in the country, the Harvard-Moynihan study finds that only 3 others have an FMAP rate between 50-60 percent. The other six States have FMAP rates of 65 percent and higher. Even more astonishing is that of the top 10 States with the lowest real per capita income, only Hawaii has a 50-percent FMAP rate. 
To bring equity to this situation, Hawaii has sought an increase in its FMAP rate over the past several years. Just as we did for Alaska this past summer, Hawaii should be included in this long-warranted change, as the same factors justifying an increase for Alaska apply to Hawaii. Recognition of this point was made by House and Senate conferees to the Balanced Budget Act. The conferees, on page 879 of the conference report, note that poverty guidelines for Alaska and Hawaii are different than those for the rest of the Nation, yet there is no variation from the national calculation in the FMAP. The conferees correctly noted that comparable adjustments are generally made for Alaska and Hawaii. 
The case for an FMAP increase is especially compelling in Hawaii, which has a proud history of providing essential health services in an innovative and cost-effective manner. That commitment is not easy to fulfill. Unlike most States, for example, Hawaii's Aid to Families with Dependent Children/ Temporary Assistance for Needy Families [AFDC/TANF] caseloads have been increasing dramatically. 
In Hawaii, our caseload has risen by 21 percent since 1994 compared to a national decline of 23 percent during this same period. Since TANF block grants are based on historical spending levels, the increased demand has placed extreme pressure on State resources. 
Hawaii has sought to maintain a social safety net while striving for more efficient delivery of government services. The most striking example is the QUEST Medical Assistance Program, which operates under a Federal waiver. QUEST has brought managed care and broader coverage to the State's otherwise uninsured populations. At the same time, Hawaii is the only State whose employers guarantee health care coverage to every full-time employee, a further example of Hawaii's commitment to a strong social support system. 
There is a particularly strong need for a more suitable FMAP rate for Hawaii now. The State has not participated in the economic growth that has benefitted most of the rest of the Nation. Hawaii's unemployment rate is above the national average and State tax revenues have fallen short of projected estimates. The need to fund 50 percent of the cost of the Medicaid program puts an increasing strain on the State's resources. 
For all of these reasons, the FMAP rates for Hawaii should be adjusted to reflect more equitably the State's ability to support the Medicaid program. This will assure that the special problem of the noncontiguous States is dealt with in a principled manner. I believe it is also important to point out that based on Hawaii's current Medicaid spending level of approximately $700 million, each percentage point increase in our FMAP rate would provide approximately $7 million annually in additional Federal funds. Thus, the cost of enhancing the State's FMAP rate would be relatively modest. 
I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support an upward adjustment in Hawaii's Federal medical assistance percentage.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memory of the Reverend Dr. Abraham Akaka, my brother Abe, who passed away last month. Brother Abe, as our family knew him, was `kahu,' meaning shepherd in Hawaiian, to people of faith in Hawaii. For 28 years, he was pastor of Kawaiahao Church, the Westminster Abbey of the Pacific, Christianity's mother church in Hawaii. A true man of God, he dedicated his life to serving our church and its congregation, while attending to the spiritual needs of our people and communities across our State, and Nation. In a life marked by numerous achievements, honors, awards, and titles, the appellation `kahu' best describes Brother Abe. 
He was also a beloved husband and wonderful father to his five children, aided in his ministry by his wife Mary Lou Jeffrey Akaka. He was a source of comfort and inspiration, a bulwark of strength, and font of love for our family, and will be sorely missed.

Mr. Akaka. Mr. President, I thank the leader for his generous remarks, and I appreciate his remarks, because our relationship in our family is very close. 
It is indeed a signal honor and a privilege for me to be permitted by the U.S. Senate to convene this honorable body today as its Acting President pro tempore, and a genuine personal pleasure to introduce my brother, the Reverend Dr. Abraham Akaka, to give the opening prayer. 
Brother Abe, as our family knows him; or `kahu,' meaning `shepherd' in Hawaiian, as many in our community in Hawaii know him, was born in Honolulu 74 years ago. He began his service to the Lord and our people after graduating from the Chicago Theological Seminary of the University of Chicago, with a bachelor of divinity degree. 
He was the pastor of our Kawaiahao Church, the mother church of Hawaii, for 28 years. With brotherly love and family pride, I think I can fairly say that Brother Abe was Kawaiahao Church, and Kawaiahao Church was Brother Abe. He dedicated his life to serving our church and its parishioners and the greater Hawaii, and forgive me for my brotherly pride, but the church will not be the same again without him. In 1964, he lobbied here in Washington, DC, for the Civil Rights Act, was the first chairman of the civil rights commission for the State of Hawaii, and sent leis that were worn by Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King and his supporters in the Selma, AL, march. He began to organize the Congress of Hawaiian People, Friends of Kamehameha Schools, and Council of Hawaiian Organizations. He served as regent of the University of Hawaii. 
Among the honors bestowed on my brother are honorary doctoral degrees from the Chicago Theological Seminary of the University of Chicago, the University of Hawaii, Illinois Wesleyan University, the University of the Pacific in Stockton, CA, and Salem College in West Virginia. He served as the chaplain in our territorial senate, and subsequently, our State senate. He gave our statehood sermon on May 13, 1959, and inspired our Hawaii State Legislature to name our State, `the Aloha State.' Following Henry J. Kaiser, he received the Hawaii Salesman of the Year in 1952. 
Brother Abe has been most ably assisted in his calling by his bride of 47 years, Mary Louise Jeffrey Akaka. They share their love with five children and seven grandchildren. 
In retirement, Kahu continues to serve through the Akaka Foundation.   
Letter of Condolence From President and Mrs. Clinton to Mrs. Abraham Akaka 
Dear Mrs. Akaka: Hillary and I were saddened to learn of your husband's death, and we extend our deepest sympathy. We hope that the love and support of your family and friends will sustain and comfort you during this difficult time. You are in our thoughts and prayers. 
Sincerely, Bill Clinton. 
We weep with sorrow because he will no longer talk, walk, eat and play with us. We rejoice knowing that he is with God, with Ma, with Pa, and with members of our family in that Beautiful City of God in heaven--pearls, goldlined streets, river of life. He has left each of us a legacy of his life, his light and ministry to carry and bear here on earth. I can hear him speak in his velvety, soft voice. John 13:34, `A commandment I give to you, that you love one another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.'

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, last year marked the 150th anniversary of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment dedicated to the `increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.' Since its founding, the Smithsonian has promoted excellence in research and public education in all fields of human and scientific interest. To continue this great tradition of excellence, and to ensure its relevance to its patrons and beneficiaries, the American people, today I am introducing legislation, cosponsored by Senator Carol Moseley-Braun and Senator Patty Murray, to establish a new Smithsonian entity, the National Museum for the Peopling of America. 
The Peopling of America Museum would be dedicated to presenting one of the most significant experiences in American history, the complex movement of people, ideas, and cultures across boundaries--both internal or external--that resulted in the peopling of the Nation and the development of our unique, pluralist society. This movement transformed us from strangers from different shores into neighbors unified in our inimitable diversity--Americans all. 
Under our bill, the Museum would have a number of different functions. These include serving as: A location for exhibits and programs depicting the history of America's diverse peoples and their interactions with each other. The exhibits would collectively form a unified narrative of the historical processes by which the United States was developed; A center for research and scholarship to ensure that future generations of scholars will have access to resources necessary for telling the story of American pluralism; A repository for the collection of relevant artifacts, artworks, and documents to be preserved, studied, and interpreted; A venue for integrated public education programs, including lectures, films, and seminars, based on the Center's collections and research; and A location for a standardized index of resources within the Smithsonian dealing with the heritages of all Americans. The Smithsonian's holdings contain millions of artifacts which have not been identified or classified for this purpose. 
A clearinghouse for information on ethnic documents, artifacts, and artworks that may be available through non-Smithsonian sources, such as other federal agencies, museums, academic institutions, individuals, or foreign entities. 
A folklife center highlighting the cultural expressions of the peoples of the United States. The existing Smithsonian Center for Folklife Programs and Cultural Studies, which already performs this function, could be integrated with the museum. 
A center to promote mutual understanding and tolerance. The Museum would facilitate programs designed to encourage greater understanding of, and respect for, each of America's diverse ethnic and cultural heritages. The Museum would also disseminate techniques of conflict resolution currently being developed by social scientists. 
An oral history center developed through interviews with volunteers and visitors. The museum would also serve as an oral history repository and a clearinghouse for oral histories held by other institutions. 
A visitor center providing individually tailored orientation guides to Smithsonian visitors. Visitors could use the museum as an initial orientation phase for ethnically or culturally related artifacts, artworks, or information that can be found in each of the Smithsonian's many facilities. 
A location for training museum professionals in museum practices relating to the life, history, art, and culture of the peoples of the United States. The museum would sponsor training programs for professionals or students involved in teaching, researching, and interpreting the heritage of America's peoples. 
A location for testing and evaluating new museum-related technologies that could facilitate the operation of the museum. The facility could serve as a test bed for cutting-edge technologies that could later be used by other private or public museums. 
Our legislation also stipulates that the museum would be located in new or existing Smithsonian facilities on or near the National Mall. Additionally, the measure establishes an Advisory Committee on American Cultural Heritage to provide guidance on the operation and direction of the proposed museum. 
 Mr. President, aside from the first Americans, whose precedence must be acknowledged, we Americans were travelers from other lands. From the first Europeans who came as explorers and conquerors to the African slaves who endured the middle passage and labored in the fields of our early plantations, from the people of Nuevo Mexico to the French of the Louisiana Territory who became Americans through annexation, from the Irish who fled poverty and famine at home to the Chinese who came in search of Gold Mountain--all were once visitors to this great country. 
America is defined by the grand, entangled progress of its individual peoples to and across the American landscape--through exploration, the slave trade, immigration, or internal migration--that gave rise to the rich interactions that make the American experience unique. We embody the cultures and traditions that our forebears brought from other shores, as well as the new traditions and cultures that we adopted on arrival. 
Whether we settled in the agrarian West, the industrialized North, the small towns of the Midwest, or the genteel cities of the South, our forebears inevitably formed relationships with peoples of other backgrounds and cultures. Our rich heritage as Americans is comprehensible only through the histories of our various constituent cultures, carried with us from other lands and transformed by encounters with other cultures. As one eminent cultural scholar has noted: 
How can one learn about slavery, holocausts, immigration, ecological adaptation or ways of seeing the world without some type of comparative perspective, without some type of relationship between cultures and peoples. How can we understand the history of any one cultural group--for example, the Irish--without reference to other groups--for example, the British. How can we understand African American culture without placing it in some relationship to its diverse African cultural roots, the creolized cultures of the Caribbean, the Native American bases of Maroon and Black Seminole cultures, the religious, economic and linguistic cultures of the colonial Spanish in Columbia, the French in Haiti, the Dutch in Suriname, and the English in the United States? 
Unfortunately, Mr. President, the Smithsonian, perhaps our most prestigious educational institution, has never attempted to explore this comparative perspective of how our Nation came to be peopled. For whatever reason, the institution has failed to examine the college of relationships that shaped the values, attitudes, and behaviors of our various constituencies. Aside from occasional, temporary exhibits on a specific immigration or migration topic, such as the Museum of American History's recent exhibit on the northern migration of African-Americans, none of the Smithsonian's many museums and facilities has tasked itself to examine any aspect of this phenomenon, the peopling of America experience, much less offered a global review of the subject. 
This shortcoming derives, in part, from the fact that the Smithsonian, for all its reputation as a world-class research and educational organization, remains an institution rooted in 19th century intellectual taxonomy. For example, during the early years of the Smithsonian, the cultures of Northern and Western European Americans were originally represented at the Museum of Science and Industry, which eventually became the Museum of American History. However, African Americans, Asian Americans, Native Americans, and others were treated ethnographically as part of the Museum of Natural History. This artificial 
bifurcation of our cultural patrimonies is still in place today. Consequently, the collections of various ethnic and cultural groups have been fragmented among various Smithsonian entities, making it difficult to view these groups in relation to each other or as part of a larger whole. 
The establishment of the Peopling of America Museum would address this glaring deficiency. The museum would instantly create a national venue where all Americans, regardless of ethnic origin, could visit in order to discover and celebrate their diverse historical roots. More important, the museum would facilitate an exploration of our commonalities, the historical and cultural experiences that created the unique American identity and sensibility. 
Mr. President, in May 1995, the Commission on the Future of the Smithsonian Institution, a blue ribbon panel charged with pondering the future of the 150-year-old institution, issued its final report. In its preface, the Commission noted:  
The Smithsonian Institution is the principal repository of the nation's collective memory and the nation's largest public cultural space. It is dedicated to preserving, understanding, and displaying the land we inhabit and the diversity and depth of American civilization in all its timbres and color. It holds in common for all Americans that set of beliefs--in the form of artifacts--about our past that, taken together, comprise our collective history and symbolize the ideals to which we aspire as a polity. The Smithsonian--with its 140 million objects, 16 museums and galleries, the national Zoo, and 29 million annual visits--has been, for a century and a half, a place of wonder, a magical place where Americans are reminded of how much we have in common. 
The story of America is the story of a plural nation. As epitomized by our nation's motto, America is a composite of peoples. Our vast country was inhabited by various cultures long before the Pilgrims arrived. Slaves and immigrants built a new nation from `sea to shining sea,' across mountains, plains, deserts and great rivers, all rich in diverse climates, animals, and plants. One of the Smithsonian's essential tasks is to make the history of our country come alive for each new generation of American children. 
We cannot even imagine an `American' culture that is not multiple in its roots and in its branches. In a world fissured by differences of ethnicity and religion, we must all learn to live without the age-old dream of purity--whether of bloodlines or cultural inheritance--and learn to find comfort, solace, and even fulfillment in the rough magic of the cultural mix. And it is the challenge to preserve and embody that marvelous mix--the multi-various mosaic that is our history, culture, land, and the people who have made it--that the Smithsonian Institution, on the eve of the twenty-first century, must rededicate itself. 
Mr. President, what more compelling argument in favor of the Peopling of America Museum can be found than in these words? What initiative other than the Peopling of America Museum would more directly address the Smithsonian's role in presenting the diversity and depth of American civilization in all its timbres and color, or making the history of our country come alive for each new generation of American children, or preserving the multivarious mosaic that is our history, culture, land, and the people who have made it? 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe that this initiative will foster a much-needed understanding of our diversity, of the rich cultural and historical differences that constitute our uniqueness as individuals. Conversely, and more important, I believe that the Peopling of America Museum will promote an appreciation of the common values, relationships, and experiences that bind our citizens together. A museum dedicated to the celebration of our unity in diversity will sustain and invigorate our sense of national purpose; surely this is a mission worthy of the Smithsonian to undertake. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I hope that this legislation will initiate a national dialog about the central role that the Smithsonian should play in preserving, researching, and exhibiting America's cultural and historical patrimony. I look forward to beginning this conversation with my colleagues, the academic community, and the interested public.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today at noon, we have another opportunity to invoke cloture on S. 25, the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill, which I support. I am sorely disappointed that yesterday, the Republican majority once again successfully blocked going to the bill. 
After yesterday's two votes, the majority leader said that campaign reformers should just give up--that the bill's chances for enactment in this session of the 105th Congress were dead. 
I do not believe that the American people should be denied the benefit of campaign finance reform that would, in my opinion, level the playing field so that running for Federal office would not be so strongly influenced by money. 
It is amazing to me that after several months of public hearings by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that anyone doubts the critical need to rewrite our campaign funding laws. Throughout the course of the hearings we have witnessed example after example of the misuse of our campaign finance laws. 
And yet there remains a real crisis in the Senate over our inability to enact any campaign finance reform legislation. Moreover, this wholesale disdain for ending the money chase through substantive finance reform fuels the distrust held by the American public of Congress and their belief that Congress does not wish to clean up its own house. 
Our committee has examined allegations of foreign money influencing Federal campaigns, the use of Federal facilities to raise funds, contributors donating in another's name, and access to Congress and the White House linked to campaign donations. Like my colleagues, I support prosecution by the Department of Justice of these allegations if it is appropriate. We have also had an opportunity to hear from expert witnesses on how they would reform the funding of elections. 
Mr. President, we can no longer allow the mad hunt for money to drive our elections. Nor can we ignore the dramatic increases in soft money donations, the problems associated with unregulated independent expenditures and issue advocacy, and the improper use of tax-exempt organizations. 
And yet, despite the tremendous explosion in campaign expenditures and the dismay over the political system expressed by the voters, there remains steadfast opposition to reforming our Nation's campaign finance laws, as evidenced by yesterday's votes. 
I was hopeful, although perhaps too optimistic, to believe that S. 25, the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill would be embraced by most Members of the Senate. I was wrong. 
With less than 50 percent of voting age Americans going to the polls in the last election, so much is at stake. The public's deep distrust of this Nation's elected officials by the voters will continue if the only thing that comes from the Senate's investigation into campaign finance abuse allegations and the abbreviated debate on S. 25 is political rhetoric and finger-pointing. 
The Republican majority has seen fit to stifle the efforts of those Senators who support reforming the Nation's campaign finance laws. The only hope I see in passing such reform at a future date lies with the American voter. It will be up to the people of this great democracy to demand that their Senators support campaign finance reform. There will be no campaign finance reform until there is a nationwide movement to stop the campaign finance abuses uncovered by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I echo the sentiments of my colleague from Alaska. The aviation provisions in this tax bill are unfair to residents of and visitors to Hawaii and Alaska and will have a disproportionate impact on carriers that serve our States. 
The bill fails to recognize that the 49th and 50th States are fundamentally different from the rest of the Union in our heavy reliance on air transportation. As the only noncontiguous States, Hawaii and Alaska are, for all practicable purposes, accessible from the continental United States only by air. Furthermore, for different reasons, travel within Hawaii and Alaska is feasible only by commuter airline. In effect, Alaska's and Hawaii's air routes serve the same purpose as other States' highway systems. 
The pending measure would abrogate a long history of congressional support for our States' special aviation needs--needs which are embodied in current law--by imposing a per segment charge on flights to, from, and within Hawaii and Alaska. This new tax discriminates against the low-fare, short-haul carriers that serve the people of our States as well as the larger carriers that maintain our communications links with other States. 
Carriers that serve Hawaii can ill afford this additional tax burden; the impact is especially heavy on our local commuter airlines. The taxes of Hawaiian Airlines and Aloha Airlines alone will rise by as much as $7.5 million and $6 million, respectively, in the next year as a result of the new segment fee. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the conferees' desire to make excise taxes reflect usage of the air traffic system. But I do not believe that the conferees fully understood the implications of the segment tax with respect to states whose residents and visitors are wholly reliant on air service for intrastate and interstate travel. 
This is clearly an issue that deserves further study. Certainly this is an appropriate topic of review for the Mineta Airline Commission. Should the tax bill pass, I hope that Members of this body would agree to revisit this issue at the earliest opportunity. In any case, I will join Senator Murkowski and my other colleagues from Hawaii and Alaska in supporting legislation to restore the current tax treatment of our two States.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Reform Act, a bipartisan initiative to curb immigration, wage, and apparel labeling abuses in the CNMI. Senators Collins, Hutchinson of Arkansas, Landrieu, Bumpers, Ford, Bingaman, and Hollings are cosponsors of this legislation. 
The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands is located 3,900 miles west of Hawaii. Following World War II, the United States administered the islands under a U.N. Trusteeship. 
In 1975, the people of the CNMI voted for political union with the United States. Today the CNMI is a U.S. territory. 
A 1976 covenant enacted by Congress gave U.S. citizenship to residents of the CNMI. The covenant exempted the Commonwealth from U.S. immigration and minimum wage laws, however. This omission has led to a number of abuses in the CNMI that my bill would rectify.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the National Aquaculture Development, Research, and Promotion Act. Senators Craig, Leahy, and Daschle have joined me in introducing the bill. 
This legislation is not merely a reauthorization of an expiring law. It will help establish a coordinated national aquaculture policy. It will stimulate the fastest growing segment of U.S. agriculture. 
The ever-growing demand for fish and fish products is a driving force behind the decline of our fisheries. Aquaculture can help satisfy demand for fishery products and, at the same time, reduce pressure on wild stocks. The bill will also provide a framework for sustainable aquaculture development by encouraging best management practices for aquaculture at the State level. 
The National Aquaculture Development, Research, and Promotion Act addresses the most pressing needs of aquaculture farmers, such as research, aquacultural credit, and production and market data. 
For too long aquaculture farmers have suffered from the absence of a consistent and unified Federal policy to aid the development of aquaculture. My bill promotes policies to allow our country to become more competitive in the expanding global market for aquaculture products. 
The world market for aquaculture is vast, and the United States has the potential to lead future aquaculture production and technology. Efforts to expand the U.S. aquaculture industry will not go unrewarded. The United States imports 60 percent of its seafood, which results in a $3.5 billion annual trade deficit for fish products. Reducing our seafood trade deficit by one-third through expanded aquaculture production would create 25,000 new jobs. 
World production of aquaculture in 1995 was 21,300,000 metric tons. The U.S. contributed less than 3 percent to world output, however. 
With global seafood demand projected to increase 70 percent by 2025, and harvests from capture fisheries stable or declining, aquaculture production will have to increase by 700 percent, a total of 77 million metric tons annually, to meet future demand. The important question is whether U.S. aquaculture will share in this explosive growth. 
This bill is about creating jobs, expanding food production, and achieving sustainable aquaculture development. America has outstanding institutions for conducting aquaculture research. A coordinated effort, with appropriate Federal support, can advance aquaculture development and promote significant economic growth. Aquaculture has an important advantage because it can be conducted successfully on lands that are marginal for other forms of agriculture. 
Aquaculture is a diverse industry that affects all regions of the country. More than 30 States produce at least two dozen commercially important aquaculture species. Yet the United States ranks 9th among nations in the value of its production. China, Japan, India, Indonesia, Norway, Thailand, and Korea all enjoy a larger share of the global aquaculture market. In addressing the problem of our balance of trade, aquaculture can be part of the solution. 
Nowhere is the opportunity for aquaculture more promising than in Hawaii. We have a skilled labor force, access to Asian and North American markets, a climate that allows harvesting throughout the year, and a 1500-year tradition of aquaculture farming. 
Aquaculture supports more jobs per acre than other forms of agriculture, so it can strengthen our employment base at a time when other areas of Hawaiian agriculture are declining. Our tradition of aquaculture that operates in harmony with the environment will help assure that its growth and development is sustainable. 
However, the legislation I have introduced today was not designed merely to promote aquaculture in Hawaii. The bill was drafted with one basic principle in mind: to assist all segments of the aquaculture industry equally. It would be wrong to promote one segment of the industry, whether it is marine or freshwater aquaculture, or a particular species of fish or shellfish, over another. 
The United States can be a world leader in aquaculture in the same way that it leads in agriculture. This bill is an important step in achieving that goal.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am today introducing a bill which allows for the expansion of the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, commonly referred to as Punchbowl. I am pleased that my colleague, the senior Senator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye has joined me as a sponsor of this measure. 
This is a very simple bill. It authorizes $1.5 million for the construction of an additional columbarium at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. 
The cemetery is nearing its capacity and is only open to interment of cremains. It is estimated by the year 2002, Punchbowl will no longer be open for any burials. However, while the national cemetery will be closed to burials, Hawaii will begin to experience 5 years of the greatest expected burial needs for our World War II veterans. 
Currently, 26,000 World War II veterans reside in Hawaii. Based on present columbarium usage at Punchbowl, the Department of Veterans Affairs expects 20 percent of these veterans to chose cremation and inurnment at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. 
The number of Hawaii veterans wishing to be interred at Punchbowl does not include veterans who reside outside of Hawaii who would like to be buried at this facility. Every year, we have veterans who choose to return to Hawaii to be buried with their comrades. 
The bill I am introducing today will allow Punchbowl to accommodate 5,000 additional veterans and their spouses. This small expansion will allow our Nation's veterans, particularly those who served their country in World War II, to be buried in National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. 
I urge my colleagues to support this fair and reasonable request on behalf of our Nation's veterans.

Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by Senator Gorton. 
The `Mighty Mo' is a historical icon of World War II in the Pacific. It began its service in World War II by providing gunfire support during the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. The U.S.S. Missouri took its place in world history when it became the site for the formal signing of Japan's surrender. 
Continuing its auspicious beginnings, the Missouri participated in the Korean war, was decommissioned, then recommissioned, and saw its final battles during the Persian Gulf conflict. She was finally decommissioned on March 31, 1992. 
In January 1995, the Department of the Navy declared Iowa class battleships in excess to its requirements. The people of Hawaii have always believed that the Missouri's home is Hawaii. We supported having her homeported in Hawaii before she was decommissioned in 1992. Since then, our community has been diligently working to bring the Missouri to Hawaii to fulfill its final mission--as a memorial museum in the Pacific. It is a fitting tribute to those we honor at the Arizona Memorial to have the Missouri become a part of our memorial in the Pacific. 
The Senator from Washington believes that the Navy's evaluation process was unfair because the criteria were changed during the evaluation stage. However, the General Accounting Office found that the Navy provided all applicants the same information on the additional criteria at the same time. Although all interested parties were provided the same information, none of the applicants requested clarification of the additional requirement. 
The Navy conducted an impartial and fair review in determining the site location for the Missouri. There is no reason to reopen the selection process. I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment offered by the Senator from Washington, and let us move forward in establishing a memorial to those who so gallantly fought in the Pacific.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my friend, the senior Senator from Hawaii, in offering this amendment to restore funding for the East-West Center in fiscal years 1998 and 1999. 
Over the past 37 years, the East-West Center has established its reputation as one of the most respected and authoritative institutions dedicated to the advancement of international cooperation throughout Asia and the Pacific. The Center has played a key role in promoting constructive American involvement in the Asia-Pacific region through its education, dialogue, research, and outreach programs. The Center addresses critical issues of importance to the Asia-Pacific region and U.S. interests in the area, including international trade, economic cooperation and politics, security, energy and natural resources, population, the environment, technology, and culture. 
The achievements of the East-West Center bear repetition. Since its creation by Congress in 1960, the Center has welcomed more than 53,000 participants from over 60 nations and territories to research, education, and conference programs. Over 45,000 alumni have pursued degrees and participated in research, training, and dialogue under East-West Center grants. 
Scholars, statesmen, government officials, journalists, teachers, and business executives from the United States and the nations of Asia and the Pacific have benefited from studies at the Center. These government and private sector leaders comprise an influential network of East-West Center alumni throughout the Asia-Pacific region. The EWC alumni association has 35 chapters throughout Asia. I continually encounter proud Center alumni in meetings with Asian and Pacific island government officials and business leaders. 
The success of the Center as a forum for the promotion of international cooperation and the strength of the positive personal relationships developed at the Center are reflected in the prestige it enjoys in the region. Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Pakistan, and other American allies in the region--over 20 countries in all--support the Center's programs with contributions. The Center has also received endowments from benefactors in recognition of its contributions and value. 
Mr. President, the countries of Asia and the Pacific are critically important to the United States and our political and economic interests into the next century. By the year 2000, the Asia-Pacific region will be the world's largest producer and consumer of goods and services. Their markets for energy resources, telecommunications, and air travel are fast becoming the world's largest. 
Future economic growth and job creation in the United States is closely linked to our ability to identify and secure opportunities in the world's fastest growing economies. The East-West Center provides leadership and advice on economic issues, including APEC [Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation] and the U.S.-Pacific Island Joint Commercial Commission [JCC]. 
Mr. President, given the strategic and economic importance of the Asia-Pacific region to U.S. interests, and the credibility and trust enjoyed by the East-West Center in the region, I believe it is short-sighted to slash funding for the Center. While issues and developments in Asia are the focus of increased attention, and foreign affairs mandarins speak of the dawn of the Asian century, the United States has closed AID offices in the region and slashed funding for programs and organizations--like the East-West Center. These institutions are valuable to our Nation's understanding of Asia and the Pacific rim and our interaction with regional scholars, executives, and government leaders. Withdrawing our support sends signals to our friends and others in the region that our commitment and engagement are tenuous. 
For over three decades we have invested in the East-West Center, creating an important resource that promotes regional understanding and cooperation, provides expertise on complex regional issues, and informs our foreign policy decisionmaking. The amendment we offer seeks to ensure the continued existence of the East-West Center and the quality of its programs. If the Congress ends funding for the Center, its viability will be threatened and its future brought into doubt. This amendment authorizes a modest, but essential, level of support for the continued operation of the East-West Center. 
It communicates the importance our country places on exchange and cooperation with nations of the Asia-Pacific region and the lead role played by the East-West Center in promoting regional interaction and cooperation. 
Mr. President, I want to conclude by thanking my friend and colleague from Hawaii for his leadership in this effort to preserve the mission and good work of the East-West Center. I also want to express my appreciation to our colleagues who have cosponsored this amendment and expressed support for the East-West Center. 
I urge the adoption of the amendment.

 Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Downed Animal Protection Act, a bill to eliminate inhumane and improper treatment of downed animals at stockyards. Senators Smith, Reid, and Torricelli have joined me in sponsoring this bill. The legislation prohibits the sale or transfer of downed animals unless they have been humanely euthanized. 
Downed animals are severely distressed recumbent animals that are so sick they cannot rise or move on their own. Once an animal becomes immobile and cannot stand, it must lie where it falls, often without receiving basic assistance. Downed animals that survive the stockyard are slaughtered for human consumption. 
These animals are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to handle humanely. They have very demanding needs, and must be fed and watered individually. The suffering of downed animals is so severe that the only humane solution is immediate euthanasia. 
Mr. President, the bill I have introduced requires that these hopelessly sick and injured animals be euthanized by humane methods that rapidly and effectively render animals insensitive to pain. Humane euthanasia of downed animals will limit animal suffering and will encourage the livestock industry to concentrate on improved management and handling practices to avoid this problem in the first place. 
Downed animals comprise a tiny fraction, less than one-tenth of 1 percent, of animals at stockyards. Banning their sale or transfer would cause no economic hardship. The Downed Animal Protection Act will prompt stockyards to refuse crippled and distressed animals and will make the prevention of downed animals a priority for the livestock industry. The bill will reinforce the industry's commitment to humane handling of animals. 
The downed animal problem has been addressed by major livestock organizations such as the United Stockyards Corp., the Minnesota Livestock Marketing Association, the National Pork Producers Council, the Colorado Cattlemen's Association, and the Independent Cattlemen's Association of Texas. All these organizations have taken strong stands against improper treatment of animals by adopting `no-downer' policies. I want to commend these and other organizations, as well as responsible and conscientious livestock producers throughout the country, for their efforts to end an appalling problem that erodes consumer confidence. 
Despite a strong consensus within industry, the animal welfare movement, consumers, and Government that downed animals should not be sent to stockyards, this sad problem continues, causing animal suffering and an erosion of confidence in the industry. 
Mr. President, this legislation will complement industry efforts to address this problem by encouraging better care of animals at farms and ranches. Animals with impaired mobility will receive better treatment in order to prevent them from becoming incapacitated. The bill will remove the incentive for sending downed animals to stockyards in the hope of receiving some salvage value for the animals and would encourage greater care during loading and transport. The bill will also discourage improper breeding practices that account for most downed animals. 
My legislation would set a uniform national standard, thereby removing any unfair advantages that might result from differing standards throughout the industry. Furthermore, no additional bureaucracy will be needed as a consequence of my bill because inspectors of the Packers and Stockyards Administration regularly visit stockyards to enforce existing regulations. Thus, the additional regulatory burden on the agency and stockyard operators will be insignificant.

Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, the State of Hawaii, its delegation in Congress, and conservation organizations throughout the State are deeply concerned about Federal efforts to regulate hydroelectric projects on State waters. Across the United States, the question of who should have authority for hydropower regulation--the State or the Federal Government--is very contentious. But in the case of the fresh water streams of Hawaii, the answer is clear. The State of Hawaii, not the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, should have the authority for hydropower regulation in Hawaii, if the Commission finds it has no mandatory jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act. 
Those who care for Hawaii's rivers and streams recognize that unnecessary Federal intervention may have serious repercussions for our fresh water resources and the ecosystems that depend upon them. 
The State of Hawaii has demonstrated its commitment to protect stream resources by instituting a new water code, adopting instream flow standards, launching a comprehensive Hawaii stream assessment, and organizing a steam protection and management task force. 
The Federal interest in protecting the vast interconnected river system of North America is misplaced in our isolated mid-Pacific locale. The issues of interstate commerce, protecting military ports, or long interstate rivers are not applicable. 
Therefore, I am introducing legislation to terminate FERC's voluntary jurisdiction over hydropower projects on the fresh waters of the State of Hawaii. This legislation is nearly identical to one passed by the Senate during the 103d Congress. In 104th Congress, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee again approved the bill. I will continue to fight for the passage of this legislation in the 105th Congress.

 Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it is with great regret that I rise today to note the impending retirement of Edward P. Scott, Assistant Secretary for Congressional Affairs with the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA]. Ed has served in this position since his confirmation by the Senate in May 1993, after being nominated by President Clinton. 
As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I have greatly appreciated Ed's successful efforts to maintain close relations with legislators and keep Congress apprised of VA operations, programs, and policies. During his tenure, VA confronted the impact of judicial review on veterans' claims; addressed the health care, research, and compensation needs of Persian Gulf veterans suffering from undiagnosed illnesses; and, in the face of unprecedented fiscal pressures, began the most comprehensive restructuring of its health care and benefits administrations in history. Ed has played a critical role in developing and implementing VA's response to each of these challenges, while keeping Congress fully informed of, and involved in, major developments. 
Mr. President, prior to his administration appointment, Ed enjoyed a long and varied career in public service. After graduating cum laude from the University of Pennsylvania Law School in 1963, where he was Law Review editor, he clerked for New Jersey Supreme Court Associate Justice Nathan Jacobs. He then joined the Air Force for 3 years, working as an assistant staff judge advocate at Keesler Air Force Base before retiring in the rank of captain. Soon after, he joined the Peace Corps, serving as deputy director and, later, country director, in Korea. Returning to the United States, he signed on as a staff attorney to the Mental Health Law Project in Washington, DC. In 1977, he joined the staff of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, thus embarking on a long and distinguished career in the veterans arena. In the 16 years he was employed on the committee staff, he alternately served as majority and minority general counsel and, ultimately, staff director and chief counsel. 
As a committee staffer, Ed was instrumental in creating the Vet Center Program, enacting the Montgomery GI bill, elevating VA to cabinet rank, and establishing the U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals. During the 102d Congress, one of the most productive legislative periods in the committee's history, he helped revamp VA physician pay, improve homeless veterans programs, create a fairer system of compensation for survivors of disabled veterans, bring educational benefits in line with inflation, heighten concern for minority veterans, and establish a program to help treat women who were sexually abused in the military. In addition, under the leadership of my distinguished colleagues, Senator Daschle and Senator Rockefeller, respectively, he helped resolve controversial matters relating to agent orange exposure and VA drug pricing. 
Mr. President, I should also note that Ed played an important role in improving health care benefits and services for Hawaii's 120,000 veterans. Ed had an opportunity to visit Hawaii, gaining firsthand an appreciation of the unique needs of our multiethnic veterans population as well as of the special problems that confront the community as a consequence of Hawaii's insular geography and isolation from the mainland. He materially supported the Hawaii Delegation's efforts, initiated by my late predecessor, Senator Spark Matsunaga, to establish a VA medical center on Oahu; triple the size of the Honolulu VA outpatient clinic; and, establish vet centers, primary care clinics, and a residential post-traumatic stress disorder treatment center in the neighbor islands. 
Mr. President, however extensive Ed's achievements, what is most remarkable about this good man is the grace and sense of balance he has brought to public service. In dealing with many different organizations and personalities, each with a separate agenda, often on extremely contentious issues, he brought calm to rough waters and comfort to bruised egos. His willingness to consider every side to an issue, his ability to rise above partisan and personal concerns, truly elevated the level of debate on veterans issues. By his example, he constantly reminded us of our primary obligation, which is to promote the welfare of veterans. 
Thank you, Mr. President. Ed's departure from public service is a loss to all who care about good government. I offer him and his wife, Jane, my best wishes as they embark on a new, and I hope rewarding, phase of life.

 Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise to observe the untimely death late last month of my former Senate staff member, Jeffrey J. Dye, the young executive director of the Tennessee Democratic Party, and the only son of Dennis and Janell Dye. 
After serving less than 2 months in his new position, and reportedly meeting every challenge that this difficult job had to offer, Jeff was struck down in the very prime of life, at 27, by an epileptic seizure. 
It was a tragedy to his family, his friends, and the party he served with such fire and dedication. 
Jeff's passing has a very personal impact, Mr. President, because he worked for me for 2 1/2 years, first as a research assistant and later as a legislative correspondent, until he obtained a coveted position with the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee [DLCC] last July. 
As a Senate staffer, Jeff displayed the thirst for knowledge and eagerness to serve that characterizes many idealistic youth who come to Washington, He fulfilled his duties capably and supported me and my legislative staff in my Senate responsibilities. He gave much, Mr. President, and he learned much about the duties and responsibilities of public service. 
But it was clear from the start that Jeff chafed to do more. His endless interest in the political drama of our times, coupled with his youthful energy, finally turned him to the arena that he truly was born for: electoral politics, the art and science of political campaigning. 
Never was there an operative so constitutionally fitted for the rock and roll of modern, media-age politics as he. Jeff loved the ups and downs of elections, the eat-or-be eaten nature of the democratic process, whether in the form of a Presidential campaign or a race for the local school board. He had a Texas-size appetite where these things applied. 
But Jeff was not merely interested in the process. He was driven by a real concern for the people of our country. He had a passion to help ordinary Americans, and an abiding confidence in the ability, and indeed the obligation, of government to help the less fortunate. That is why he worked long hours, well into the evenings, to learn more about the political profession. 
Indeed, Jeff had a personal vision, one that he shared with some of my staff. He hoped to use the Internet as a communication tool for campaigns. His idea was to establish a multicandidate, multiparty bulletin board on the Internet for campaign literature and party platforms. Through this means, he hoped that everyone might have access to the information they needed to make better decisions about candidates and campaigns. Campaigns would thus be fairer and more informed. 
So when Jeff left my office last July to take up a position with the DLCC, the organization within the national Democratic Party that focuses on electing Democrats to State legislatures, I felt the loss of his departure but understood that he was going forward in the right direction. And when I heard that his success at the DLCC led to a position with the Tennessee Democratic Party, I knew he had found his dream. 
Jeff's unexpected death the third Monday in April was thus double tragic, for in addition to his youth, he seemingly had at last found a position that exactly meshed with his temperament, interests, and abilities. His opportunities appeared boundless. 
But if Jeff was taken from us just as he appeared to be fully engaged in life, we must remember that he died doing that which he truly loved. How many of us can say the same? 
Mr. President, Jeff's years among us were far too few, but let us take comfort in the knowledge that he lived them fully. May his parents and loved ones take solace in his bright memory.

 Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, for the last two weeks, I have had the great pleasure of sponsoring two Congressional fellows from the island of Kosrae. Mr. Lyndon Jackson and Mr. Charleton Timothy, legislative aides for the Government of Kosrae, have been working in my office since April 22 and will be leaving on May 9. They have been sent to Washington at the request of the speaker of the Kosrae State Legislature, the Honorable Hiteo S. Shrew, to learn more about our Nation's legislative and governmental processes. 
For their benefit, I thought I might take this opportunity to make some observations about Kosrae. As some of my colleagues know, Kosrae is one of the most beautiful islands in the Pacific, located just 5 degrees north of the equator, about 2,500 miles southwest of Hawaii. While only 42 square miles in size, it is well known throughout the region for its lush topography, beautiful beaches, clear blue waters, and rich coral reefs. 
I should tell my colleagues that the splendor of Kosrae is not exaggerated. My one and only visit to Kosrae took place fifty years ago this year, shortly after the end of World War II, when I had the good fortune to help crew the Morning Star, a schooner sent by the churches of Boston, MA, as part of a Christian mission to islands in Micronesia. The island was remarkably beautiful at that time, and I have been told that this continues to be the case. 
Although experiencing significant cultural changes over the past several decades, Kosrae's 8,000 inhabitants enjoy a casual, family oriented lifestyle. Fishing is a significant recreational and commercial activity. Kosrae is a major exporter of tuna to Guam and other Pacific islands. The island also has an abundance of citrus products and is particularly known for its sweet tangerines. And Kosrae handicrafts, such as their unique coconut baskets and trays, are renowned throughout the region. 
Kosrae is a single-island state that is part of the Federated States of Micronesia [FSM], formerly known as the United Nations Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. As trustee of the territory in the years following World War II, the United States was responsible for preparing the islands for eventual self-government, by helping develop their political, economic, and social institutions. 
In 1978, the four territorial districts of Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei, and Kosrae organized to form the Federated States of Micronesia, an action which became effective 1979 after the adoption of the Federation's draft constitution. The Federated States comprise 607 small islands, totaling only 270 square 
miles of land, spread across more than 1 million square miles of the Pacific. 
In 1986, after years of negotiations with our government, the FSM entered into the Compact of Free Association. The trusteeship was terminated at that time. The United States exercised no further administrative responsibility, and the island nation became fully self-governing. The terms of the compact generally provided for a framework of United States assistance, in return for which the FSM delegated security responsibility to the United States. This agreement has been in effect since November of 1986 with renegotiation of its financial provisions to start in November of 1999. 
Mr. President, in the period since the signing of the Compact, the close relationship between the United States and FSM has in some respects become stronger. The FSM has established constitutional governments at the national, state, and municipal levels that are patterned after our own. And in appreciation for our investment in Micronesia's quest for self-sufficiency, the FSM has reciprocated by maintaining strong political, economic, educational, and cultural ties. 
The FSM has also been a strong supporter in the United Nations on key issues of concern to the United States For instance, the FSM has consistently voted with the United States on such major issues as the situation in Bosnia, the Middle East peace process, and human rights in Iran and Iraq. 
Mr. President, I expect the strong relationship between the peoples of Micronesia and the United States to grow stronger and richer in the years ahead, as the FSM's experiment in American-style democracy continues. As the November 1999 date for renegotiating the compact of Free Association draws closer, I hope that my colleagues who have not yet had an opportunity to do so will take the opportunity to visit this unique and lovely place, and to acquaint themselves with the needs of Micronesia's people as well as the unique opportunities that the region offers our nation.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a measure which permanently authorizes the Native American Veteran Housing Loan Program. I am pleased that Senators Daschle, Inouye, Hollings, Wellstone, and Jeffords have joined me in cosponsoring this important measure. 
In 1992, I authored a bill that established a 5-year pilot program of direct home loans to assist native american veterans who reside on trust lands. This pilot program, administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA], provides direct loans to native American veterans to build or purchase homes on trust lands. Previously, native American veterans who reside on trust lands were unable to qualify for VA home loan benefits. This disgraceful treatment of native American veterans was finally corrected when Congress established the native American Direct Home Loan Program. 
Despite the complexities of creating a program that addresses the needs of hundreds of different tribal entities, VA has successfully entered into agreements to provide direct VA loans to members of 46 tribes and Pacific Island groups, and negotiations continue with other tribes. Since the program's inception, 127 native American veterans have been able to achieve home ownership, and none of the loans approved by the VA have been foreclosed. 
Unfortunately, the authority to issue new loans under this remarkably successful program will cease on September 30, 1997. This would be tragic and devastating to a number of native American veterans who want to participate in this program. Although VA has proposed a 2-year extension for the program, it fails to address the basic reason this program exists--equity. Native American veterans who reside on trust lands should be afforded the same benefits available to other veterans. Without this program, home loan benefits to native Americans living on trust lands will cease. This is the only program available for native American veterans who live on trust lands to finance a home for themselves and their families. There are no alternatives available. 
Permanent authorization of this program will ensure that native American veterans are provided equal access to services and benefits available to other veterans. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, 
today I am introducing the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Replenishment Act, a bill to purchase oil for the strategic petroleum reserve using revenue obtained from leasing SPR storage capacity. Senators Bingaman and Landrieu join me in sponsoring this measure. 
The strategic petroleum reserve is the cornerstone of U.S. energy security. During an oil emergency, the SPR is America's insurance policy against oil price shocks and economic disruption. 
However, our insurance policy is not providing the level of coverage we need. Because of declining U.S. oil production our dependence on imports is dangerously high, and the situation will grow worse in the coming decade. According to the Energy Information Administration, U.S. dependence on oil imports will rise from the current level of 50 percent to 60 percent in the year 2010. As oil imports increase, the strategic petroleum reserve will provide less and less energy security. 
The logical response should be to stockpile more oil. Yet, exactly the opposite is occurring. Some $315 million in revenue from the Operation Desert Storm drawdown was diverted to pay operating expenses rather than purchase replacement oil. Annual purchases of crude for the SPR have been halted, and we have begun to sell oil from the reserve as a deficit reduction measure. During fiscal 
years 1996 and 1997, the Department of Energy sold $450 million barrels of oil for this purpose. Congress and the administration share the blame for the sale of these strategic assets. 
The most alarming development of all, however, was last week's announcement by the Department of Energy that it is seeking public comment on the future of the strategic petroleum reserve. The first question on the DOE comment notice was `Should the United States continue to maintain the SPR?' That's like asking whether the Titanic should carry life boats. The strategic petroleum reserve provides an essential umbrella of energy security and the importance of this asset will increase as we become more dependent on oil imports. 
Like many Federal programs, the strategic petroleum reserve has become a victim of the balanced budget process. Congress and the administration are unable to muster the political will, or the scarce Federal dollars, to maintain or expand our emergency reserve. 
My colleagues and I on the Energy Committee have proposed a modest initiative to purchase new oil for the reserve. The bill we have introduced today would finance the purchase of oil for the SPR using revenue obtained from the lease of excess SPR storage capacity. 
With its current inventory, the SPR has more than 100 million barrels of available, but unused storage. A number of foreign governments have expressed interest in storing oil in the U.S. reserve to meet International Energy Agency responsibilities. Storing oil in our gulf coast facility would be far less expensive for these countries than constructing new storage capacity. The cost of constructing new capacity exceeds $15 per barrel, whereas the annual operating cost at SPR facilities is less than 50 cents per barrel. All of the revenue generated from such leases would be dedicated to the purchase of crude oil for the U.S. reserve. 
During consideration of last year's reconciliation bill, the Senate adopted a proposal I offered that was nearly identical to the legislation I have introduced today. The Clinton administration has a mixed response to this proposal. They support legislation giving DOE the authority to lease idle SPR capacity to foreign governments, but they have reservations about dedicating leasing revenue for the purchase of new oil. 
The legislation I am introducing today is an essential first step toward a more rational energy security policy. As the Senate Energy Committee considers the reauthorization of the strategic petroleum reserve, I will work with my colleagues on the committee to ensure that this measure is included as an amendment.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Inouye in encouraging the U.S. Trade Representative's continued pursuit of this case. The consequences of this interim WTO report are significant--not just for Hawaii, but for the U.S. agricultural community and for U.S. trading interests generally. Ambassador Barshefsky wisely recognized those implications when she joined with numerous other WTO members in calling for a WTO dispute settlement panel to condemn the EU banana import regime. 
The WTO panel acknowledged that in an increasingly interdependent global economy, governments will be held accountable for the adverse consequences their trade policies may have on foreign producing sectors, however large or small they might be. Hence, if the banana panel's interim report is adopted, as we expect it to be, small producing interests, such as the banana producers of Hawaii will be entitled under the long arm of the WTO to all rights and interests guaranteed by that treaty. Since the success of small producing interests is a critical aspect of Hawaii's agricultural future, this long arm protection is of great reassurance to us. 
Under the new WTO rules, if the banana report is adopted, the EU will face a stark choice: it will either have to dismantle this unlawful regime or face legal WTO trade retaliation. After decades of EU disregard of U.S. agricultural interests, a strict enforcement of that choice should establish an effective model for resolving future disputes with the EU and, equally important, should deter the EU from even engaging in unlawful agricultural policies in the first instance. Restored confidence in international dispute settlement should, in turn, help broaden the general view that trade agreements are a positive force in the promotion of U.S. agricultural trading interests. 
The banana report promises to be helpful to U.S. agriculture in still another way. By clarifying the conditions under which agricultural tariff rate quotas [TRQ's] can be administered, the report should prevent countries from using TRQ's to accomplish the sort of nontransparent, discriminatory and restrictive non-tariff barriers that the Uruguay Round sought to eliminate. 
In addition to the favorable precedent being set for American agriculture, the banana report also gives expansive life and coverage to the new WTO agreement governing services. The report found that U.S. service suppliers engaged in the wholesale distribution of fresh fruit have had their conditions of trade adversely affected by the EU regime in numerous ways, always to the direct benefit of EU corporate interests. The measure of U.S. harm as a result of these services violations may exceed $1 billion, a level well in excess of the harm normally implicated in international dispute settlement actions. By strictly upholding U.S. service supplier interests in this case, the panel has helped ensure meaningful, lasting protection of all U.S. sectors covered by the new international services accord. 
In short, if adopted, the WTO banana report will represent an unambiguous win for multiple trading interests throughout our country. We accordingly ask our Senate colleagues to lend all necessary support to Ambassador Barshefsky and her staff to secure adoption and full implementation of this important WTO report.

 Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to note the impending retirement of Mr. William E. Brew, who currently serves as the minority general counsel of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. As of April 4, his retirement date, Bill will have served 19 years and 1 day as a loyal and dedicated staff member of the U.S. Senate. 
A veteran of the Vietnam war, Bill has held increasingly important positions of responsibility on the staff of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. Since he was hired by Senator Alan Cranston in 1978, Bill has served as associate counsel, associate general counsel, minority counsel, deputy general counsel, general counsel, and most recently, minority general counsel to the committee. 
Through the many political changeovers in the administration and Congress in his nearly two decades on Capitol Hill, Bill provided institutional continuity, serving as a source of reliable information and wise advice on legislation, policy, and procedure for Members of both parties. 
Bill was closely involved in developing all of the major veterans initiatives that were enacted by Congress during this period. Among his major accomplishments are legislation relating to agent orange compensation, establishment of judicial review of veterans claims, establishment of the U.S. Court of Veterans Appeals, and creation of programs relating to the readjustment needs of Vietnam and post-Vietnam veterans. 
In addition to these special accomplishments, Bill worked hard to become the Senate's foremost authority on veterans health care matters. He served as an invaluable resource to members of the committee on the medical needs of the diverse, 27 million-strong veterans population as well as on the legal, administrative, and structural nuances of the hundreds of Department of Veterans Affairs' hospitals, outpatient clinics, nursing homes, and domiciliaries. 
Bill is well known for his logical, analytical, and deliberative mind. His patience and fairness are legendary, and few have been as adept at working in the heated, give-and-take atmosphere of the legislative process. His adherence to the very highest personal and professional standards has been a credit to the U.S. Senate. In short, Bill has been the veteran's veteran, that special individual whom Senators, professional staffers, administration officials, and veterans advocates have trusted to render an objective assessment on any particular veterans issue or to undertake any worthy cause in behalf of those who served. 
Mr. President, I believe that I have a special insight into the qualities of this outstanding individual. In the days and months immediately following my appointment to the U.S. Senate in 1990, Bill Brew was one of the experienced hands who helped indoctrinate me in the complexities of veterans policy and the doings of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Since then, I and my staff have relied on him for advice on issues major and minor. Whatever success I have had in the way of veterans legislation is in great measure due to his assistance. 
Indeed, no one worked longer or harder to improve the condition of Hawaii's 120,000 veterans than Bill Brew. It was his experience and energy that fueled a series of committee investigations revealing VA's historical neglect of the Aloha State's veterans. As a consequence of these inquiries, VA established four new primary care clinics and readjustment counseling centers in Hawaii; tripled the size of the Honolulu outpatient clinic; began preparations to construct a VA medical center on Oahu; and, established a unique residential treatment center for Pacific-area veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. 
So, Mr. President, it is with great reluctance that I extend Bill a fond farewell. I offer him my deep gratitude for the service he has rendered me and other members of this body over the last two decades. No one has worked harder to advance the public interest than this stellar public servant. I wish him well in all his future endeavors.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as we prepare for hearings on campaign fundraising irregularities, I would like to express concern about the negative impact that this issue is having on the image of the Asian-American community. 
Mr. President, Asian-Americans are an important part of our body politic. They have made significant contributions to politics, business, industry, science, sports, education, and the arts. Men and women like Senator Dan Inouye, Kristy Yamaguchi, Tommy Kono, I.M. Pei, David Henry Hwang, An Wang, and Ellison Onizuka have enhanced and invigorated the life of the Nation. 
Indeed, Asian-Americans have played a fundamental part in making this country what it is today. Asian immigrants helped build the great transcontinental railroads of the 19th century. They labored on the sugar plantations of Hawaii, on the vegetable and fruit farms of California, and in the gold mines of the West. They were at the forefront of the agricultural labor movement, especially in the sugarcane and grape fields, and were instrumental in developing the fishing and salmon canning industries of the Pacific Northwest. They were importers, merchants, grocers, clerks, tailors, and gardeners. They manned the assembly lines during America's Industrial Revolution. They operated laundries, restaurants, and vegetable markets. They also served our Nation in war: the famed all-nisei 100th/442d combat team of World War II remains the most decorated unit in U.S. military history. 
Despite their historical contributions, Asian immigrants and Asian-Americans have suffered social prejudice and economic, political, and institutional discrimination. They were excluded from churches, barber shops, and restaurants. They were forced to sit in the balconies of movie theaters and the back seats of buses. They were required to attend segregated schools. They were even denied burial in white cemeteries--in one instance, a decorated Asian-American soldier killed in action was refused burial in his hometown cemetery. Rather than receive equal treatment, Asians on the whole were paid lower wages than their white counterparts, relegated to menial jobs, or forced to turn to businesses and industries in which competition with whites was minimized. 
For more than 160 years, Asians were also refused citizenship by a law that denied their right to naturalize, a law that remained in effect until 1952. Without citizenship, Asians could not vote, and thus could not seek remedies through the Tammany Halls or other political organizations as did other immigrant groups. The legacy of this injustice is seen today in the relative lack of political influence and representation of Asian-Americans at every level and in every branch of government. 
Additionally, Asians were denied immigration rights. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 singled out Chinese on a racial basis, and the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1908 and the National Origins Act of 1924 prohibited Japanese immigration--while permitting the annual entry of thousands of immigrants from Ireland, Italy, and Poland. The 1924 law also allowed European immigrants to bring their wives from their homelands, but barred the entry of women from China, Japan, Korea, and India. Even Asians who were United States citizens were prohibited from bringing Asian wives into the country. Conversely, the 1922 Cable Act provided that any American woman who married an Asian would lose her citizenship. It was not until the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act eliminated immigration by national origins that the vestiges of these legal restrictions were lifted. 
Asians were also targeted by laws prohibiting them from owning property. The alien land laws passed by California and other Western and Southern States earlier this century, fostered by nativists and envious competitors, placed heavy obstacles in the path of struggling Asian immigrants and their children that were not faced by others. 
Perhaps most egregiously, Asians were denied civil rights guaranteed under the Constitution. The relocation of Asian-Americans from the west coast and Hawaii and their detention in internment camps between 1941 and 1946 is one of the worst civil rights violation in our history. One hundred twenty thousand men, women, and children of Japanese descent, two-thirds of them citizens, were incarcerated behind barbed wire fences, without due process or evidence of wrongdoing, under the grim view of machine gun towers. German-Americans or Italian-Americans did not suffer a similar fate. In the process, Americans of Asian ancestry were torn from their friends, their loved ones, their property, and their faith in the American dream. It was only in 1988, through legislation sponsored by Senator Inouye, Senator Stevens, and others who serve in this body today, that the U.S. Government officially apologized for this injustice. 
The reasons for historical prejudice and discrimination against Asians are complex, often involving economic or political motives. For example, at one time European immigrant labor groups felt threatened by cheap Asian labor and staged strikes and acts of violence against Asians. Employers cultivated such ethnic antagonism as a stratagem to depress wages for all workers, Asian and European. Nativists used Asians as a foil for their racist philosophies. Politicians cynically exploited anti-Asian sentiment to maintain power. And the press used the `Yellow Peril', the specter of unlimited `oriental' immigration, to sell papers. But at heart, the reasons for anti-Asian practices remain far simpler: Asians looked different, they had 
accents, they worshipped different gods. They came from cultures and spoke languages that were beyond the narrow experience of traditional, white America. 
Thus, Asians and Asian-Americans were targets. Unlike other contemporaneous immigrants--Irish, Italians, Poles, Jews--Asians stood out; they could not blend into the majority white population. Asians were naturally suspect for their skin color and appearance: they looked different so many Americans believed they must be different; that is to say, somehow less than true-blooded American. In many instances, the reaction of Asians was to turn inward, to establish their own communities or ghettoes, like Chinatown or Japantown, or turn to small businesses or farms where they did not have to compete for employment against Caucasians--further isolating and insulating their communities from the rest of American society. 
In time, however, Asians became more integrated in American life. The progeny of immigrants were born citizens, spoke only English, watched television and went to the movies, danced to the latest music, and felt they earned their place in society through workplace contributions and military service. As they assimilated, Asian-Americans enjoyed success in many areas of endeavor; in fact, they have been so successful that Asian-Americans have been cited as the `model minority.' Today, Asian-Americans tend to have high educational achievement, some are prominent in business and the professions, and they have been cited by social scientists for having community spirit, a sense of fiscal responsibility, and a strong work ethic. 
But the model minority image is mythical in many respects. On average, Asian-Americans earn less than Caucasians. There is a significant income disparity between Asians and whites with equal education. Asian-Americans also tend to be located in secondary labor markets, where wages are low and prospects minimal, and occupy lower or technical positions, where income potential is not as great as in the executive ranks. Proportionately fewer Asian-Americans are managers than is the case with other population groups; they constitute less than half of 1 percent of the officers and directors of the Nation's thousand largest companies. In corporate America, Asian-Americans have their own `glass ceiling.' 
In addition, many Americans mistakenly view the successful assimilation of more established, affluent groups such as Chinese-Americans and Japanese-Americans as the community norm. They do not realize that the community is extremely diverse in terms of ethnicity and recency of immigration. The more recent arrivals from Southeast Asia--for example, Vietnamese, Thais, Cambodians, Laotians--have significantly lower levels of income, education, 
and occupational advancement. 
Perhaps because of their success, perceived and otherwise, Asian-Americans continue to suffer for their minority status. They are periodically targets of hate crimes. The 1982 baseball bat killing of Vincent Chin in Detroit, a scapegoat for the Detroit auto industry's inability to compete with Japan, illustrated America's ignorance about Asian-Americans--Chin was of Chinese, not Japanese, heritage--and the inequality of justice for Asian-Americans--the killers paid a fine of $3,780 and never served jail time. In 1987, teenagers chanting, `Hindu, Hindu,' beat a young Indian-American to death. These are not isolated incidents. Last year, a report by the National Asian Pacific American Legal Consortium found that hate crimes against Asian Pacific-Americans grew from 335 incidents in 1993 to 458 incidents in 1995, a 37 percent increase in just two years. 
These violent incidents have been paralleled and surely fed by a growing national xenophobia. The fear of things foreign has manifested itself in cutbacks in international programs; the growth of the English only movement; and the passage of California's proposition 187 and Federal legislation to curtail social services to undocumented aliens and legal residents. Fear of Asians and other minorities is also seen in proposals to rollback minority language provisions of the Voting Rights Act and in broadbased attacks on affirmative action in education, employment, and contracting. 
I recall that only a few years ago, during the height of the debate over the budget deficit, much was made of the fact that a significant portion of our debt was held by Japan, but overlooked was the fact that both the British and Dutch had far greater investments in United States debt and property than the Japanese. Likewise, Japanese purchases of signature properties like Pebble Beach and Rockefeller Center received sensationalized coverage, but few stories traced the decline and eventual sale of these high-profile investments to other owners. 
Today, with the hype and hoopla surrounding Asians and Asian-Americans involved in the fundraising controversy, we see hints of the kinds of anti-Asian treatment that have been practiced in the past. 
The first and most obvious of these is the inappropriate and misguided attention paid by the media, commentators, and public figures to the ethnic heritage of those involved in the fundraising controversy. For example, an early Washington Post front page headline trumpeted an `Asian Funds Network.' However, upon a careful examination of the article, the reader found the article was principally concerned with Asian-Americans, not 
Asians. Clearly, in some quarters, `Asian' and `Asian-American' are synonymous, unlike the case with Europeans and European-Americans. In fact, the term `European' Americans is rarely heard in public discourse, because the ethnic origin of European Americans is not presumed to have a bearing on their patriotism. 
Despite the fact that Asian-Americans have paid taxes, lived and worked here for several generations, and died in military service, a different standard applies: Asian-Americans are still deemed to have an extraordinary, perhaps sinister, connection to their countries of origin. 
Mr. President, I think that I speak for the entire Asian-American community in expressing the hope that we can get to the bottom of this whole controversy, wherever the cards may fall. Those responsible for violations of laws or improper conduct should be identified and appropriately dealt with by the relevant authorities. However, I know that Asian-Americans also agree that the gratuitous attention to the heritage and citizenship of John Huang and other fundraisers is unjust and destructive. According to the press and others, John Huang isn't simply a DNC fundraiser or even an Asian-American fundraiser; rather, he is referred to as a `Taiwan-born naturalized citizen with ties to an Indonesian conglomerate' or, worse, `an ethnic Chinese with overseas connections.' 
Last fall, during an appearance at the University of Pennsylvania, Presidential candidate Ross Perot erroneously referred to John Huang as an `Indonesian businessman.' Later, alluding to the fundraising controversy, Mr. Perot rhetorically asked his audience, `Wouldn't you like to have someone out there named O'Reilly? Out there hard at work. You know, so far we haven't found an American name.' The implication of these and other characterizations is that being Asian and naturalized, rather than of European stock and native born, somehow renders one less American. 
Mr. President, this hyphenation or qualification of citizenship status is one of the subtle ways in which Asian-Americans are cast as different and therefore suspicious. To some, Asians and Asian-Americans are the Fu Manchus of Hollywood legend--evil, cunning, and inscrutable Easterners who march in lockstep to some hidden agenda. According to this view, being of Filipino or Thai or Pakistani heritage is all the same--if your skin is yellow or brown, you are alleged to share certain invidious characteristics of your race; your individualism fades into a kind of monolithic group identity. 
Thus, all Asians and Asian-Americans are, by extension, responsible for John Huang's or Charlie Trie's or Johnny Chung's 
alleged misdeeds. Furthermore, goes this circular reasoning, since it is accepted that Asians lack individualism, John Huang, Charlie Trie, and Johnny Chung must be part of an Asian conspiracy. 
A columnist for the New York Times played on this stereotype when, in a series of editorials last year, he wrote of the `penetration of the White House by Asian interests' and characterized John Huang as `the well-subsidized Lippo operative placed high inside Clinton Commerce.' The columnist also referred to an `Asian connection' which provided contributions through `front men with green cards.' Even the respected Wall Street Journal described some of John Huang's donations as coming from `people with tenuous connections to this country,' although it is unclear whether it was referring to Asian residents or Asian-Americans. 
A more recent manifestation of this stereotype can be found on this week's cover of the National Review, which depicts President Clinton and Mrs. Clinton with slanted eyes, buckteeth, and wearing a coolie hat and Mao cap, respectively, over the headline, `The Manchurian Candidates.' This is a true low for reporting standards, more reminiscent of William Randolph Hearst's Yellow Press than of modern journalism. Some irresponsible publications, in the interests of sensationalism, are obviously more than willing to conflate racist stereotypes with modern standards of objective journalism. The President, Mrs. Clinton, and the Asian-American community are owed an apology for this gross affront to decency and taste. 
Mr. President, a second major fallout of the fundraising affair is the impression fostered by the media and commentators that legal Asian-American participation in the political process is illegitimate. Charges of undue influence on the part of the Asian-American community have been raised with regard to immigration policy, specifically, the `fourth preference' category that allows siblings of citizens to immigrate. 
The press makes much of the fact that Asian-Americans who are concerned about this matter also contributed money to the campaign. Certainly Asian-Americans, the majority of whom are immigrants, wish to be reunited with their families. However, it is improper to imply that contributions to political campaigns by Asian-Americans should be held to a higher standard or any more suspect than contributions by other Americans. This is tantamount to suggesting that the practice of giving to political campaigns should be limited only to non-Asians. 
A third troublesome impact of the fundraising allegations is the overhasty and excessive reaction to the issue of legal 
contributions by permanent residents. In the wake of the `Asian donor' story, proposals have been made to eliminate their eligibility to make political contributions. Alarmed by the public fallout of the controversy, the Clinton administration and the Democratic National Committee have preemptively decided not to accept contributions from permanent residents or U.S. subsidiaries of foreign corporations. And a number of Members of Congress have returned contributions made by permanent residents who are Asian, not because the contributions were illegal but because they feared the public's reaction to their accepting `Asian' money. 
Mr. President, I acknowledge that there are legitimate concerns regarding the wisdom of allowing permanent residents to make contributions to political campaigns, apart from the possibility that proscribing such contributions may violate the free speech rights accorded all residents, citizens and aliens alike, by the Constitution. As my colleagues know, the Supreme Court has held that campaign contributions are an activity protected by the first amendment, and that the first amendment rights of legal residents are fully protected. 
In this instance, however, I am more concerned by the possibility that the only reason why campaign contributions by permanent residents has become an issue now is because, for the first time, Asians and Asian-Americans happen to be involved in a major way. Evidence of this perhaps can be seen in the DNC's private audit of supposedly suspect contributions. 
Reportedly, DNC auditors asked Asian-American donors whether they were citizens, how they earn their money, if they would provide their tax returns, and other intrusive questions, while threatening to tell the press if the donors did not cooperate. Some of the Asian-Americans contacted were longtime political contributors with impeccable reputations, who were naturally outraged. The DNC audit clearly smacked of selective harassment of those who happened to have Asian surnames; it underscores the Asian-American community's fear that they are being asked to pay for the alleged transgressions of a handful of individuals who happen to be of Asian heritage. 
Mr. President, a fourth major concern of the fundraising affair is that it has undermined Asian-American leadership opportunities in Government. According to some analyses, the fundraising affair impelled the Clinton administration to drop from consideration the names of University of California-Berkeley Chancellor Chang-Lin Tien and former U.S. Congressman Norm Mineta for the positions of Secretary of Energy and Secretary of Transportation, respectively. Thus far, no Asian-American has ever held Cabinet rank, and only a handful are represented in the 
senior ranks of Government. 
Furthermore, I would not be surprised to learn that every Asian-American candidate for political appointment is currently being scrutinized for contacts he or she may have had, no matter how innocent, with the Asian and Asian-American principals in the fundraising investigation. As a consequence, I greatly fear that promising Asian-American candidates for responsible Federal office will fall by the wayside, victims of guilt by association. 
A fifth and perhaps most serious impact of the fundraising story, however, is its long-term effect on Asian-American participation in the political process. Last year, a record 75,000 Asian-Americans registered to vote, a sign of the Asian-American community's newfound confidence and political maturity. I am deeply concerned that biased scrutiny of Asians and Asian-Americans by the press, politicians, and investigators will kill this initial flowering of a historically quiescent and apolitical community, a flowering that led to the historic election of an Asian-American to governorship of a mainland State. 
Will this scandal confirm Asian-Americans' fears that the system is rigged against them, discouraging them from participating in the development of public policy in a meaningful way? If so, this would be tragic for a community that is by far the fastest growing in the Nation, which is expected to comprise 7 percent of the population by 2020, and which has so many skills and experiences to offer our country. This tragedy would be compounded for those immigrants recently escaped from the yoke of authoritarianism, who might find the consequences of political activism reminiscent of the penalties experienced in their countries of origin. 
In conclusion, Mr. President, as we investigate the fundraising affair, let us remember the bigotry, prejudice, and discrimination faced by Asian immigrants and Asian-Americans as they struggled for acceptance in the New World. Let us recall how they overcame steep social, economic, and institutional barriers to become valuable, contributing members of society. 
With this in mind, Mr. President, let us keep our attention on matters of substance--the laws that were possibly broken, the processes and procedures that were bent, the individuals who circumvented or corrupted the system, and most of all what we can do to prevent abuses in the future. These are the real issues at hand. 
By the same token, Mr. President, let us avoid focusing on such irrelevancies as the ethnicity of the participants in this affair. Let us cease characterizing individuals by meretricious stereotypes; conversely, let us avoid judging an entire community by the actions of a few individuals. To do otherwise, Mr. President, would be a grave disservice to the seven million Americans of Asian ancestry who are valued and rightful participants in our great democratic experiment.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation that I have sponsored in the past two Congresses to provide a measure of tax relief to working families throughout America. My bill would restore value to the child and dependent care credit by allowing an annual adjustment of the credit for inflation. 
Mr. President, as the Federal Government and the states work to move people from welfare to work, the problems faced by working Americans seeking affordable, quality child-care services for their children will likely worsen. The availability and affordability of adequate child care are the principal concerns expressed by an increasing number of middle-class working parents. Many parents are forced to patch together a network of child care providers to secure care for their children. 
The evidence in support of improving the child and dependent care credit is clear. The number of single mothers working outside the home has dramatically increased in recent years. More than 56 percent of all mothers with children under 6 years work outside the home, and over 70 percent of women with children over age 6 are in the labor market. 
The percentage of Hawaii households in which both parents work outside the home is even higher than the national average. According to projections developed by the Bank of Hawaii based on the 1990 Census, 61.8 percent of all Hawaii families have both parents employed, and 71.3 percent of all households have at least two individuals in the workforce. 
The increased participation of single mothers in the labor market and the large number of two-parent families in which both parents work outside the home have made the dependent care credit one of the most popular and productive tax incentives ever enacted by Congress. Unfortunately, the value of the credit has declined significantly over the years as inflation has slowly eaten away at the value of this benefit. Measured in constant dollars, the maximum credit of $2,400 has decreased in value by more than 45 percent since 1982. 
In 1981, the flat credit for dependent care was replaced with a scale to give the greatest benefit of the credit to lower income working families. Since that time, neither the adjusted gross income figures employed in the scale, nor the limit on the amount of employment-related expenses used to calculate the credit, has been adjusted for inflation. My bill provides a measure of much needed relief to working American families. It would index the child and dependent care credit and restore the 
full benefit of the credit. 
The maximum amount of employment-related child care expenses allowed under current law--$2,400 for a single child and $4,800 for two or more children--has simply failed to keep pace with escalating care costs. Unlike other tax credits and deductions provided taxpayers in the Internal Revenue Code, the dependent care credit is not adjusted for inflation. 
Without an adjustment for inflation, we will continue to diminish the purpose of this credit to offset the expense of dependent and child care services incurred by parents working outside the home. While the cost of quality child care has increased as demand exceeds supply, the dependent care credit has failed to keep up with the spiraling costs. My legislation addresses this chronic problem by automatically adjusting the dependent and child care credit for inflation. Under this legislation, both the dollar limit on the amount creditable and the limitation on earned income would be adjusted annually. 
Mr. President, the average cost for out of home child care exceeds $3,500 per child, per year. Child care or dependent care expenses can seriously strain a family's budget. This burden can become unbearable for single parents, almost invariably single mothers, who must balance the need to work with their parental responsibilities. 
Middle-class Americans are working harder than ever to maintain their standard of living. In many families, parents have been forced to work longer hours, deplete their savings, and go deeper into debt. There is an urgent need to enact changes in our tax code that are pro-family and pro-children. The Working Families Child Care Tax Relief Act meets both of these goals.

 Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, the State of Hawaii, its delegation in Congress, and conservation organizations throughout the State are deeply concerned about Federal efforts to regulate hydroelectric power projects on State waters. The question of who should have authority for hydropower regulation--the State or the Federal Government--is very contentious. 
Those who care for Hawaii's rivers and streams recognize that continued Federal intervention may have serious repercussions for our fresh water resources and the ecosystems that depend upon them. Whenever a hydroelectric power project is proposed, a number of environmental considerations must be weighed before approval is granted. Important issues must be evaluated, such as whether the proposed dam or diversion will impair the stream's essential flow characteristics, or what effect the hydropower project will have on the physical nature of the stream bed or the chemical makeup of the water. Will a dam or diversion diminish flow rates and reduce the scenic value of one of Hawaii's waterfalls? Will it harm recreational opportunities? These, and other questions must be answered. 
The effect of a new dam or diversion on the State's disappearing wetlands must be weighed. Wetlands provide vital sanctuary for migratory birds, as well as habitat for endangered Hawaiian waterfowl. They serve as reservoirs for storm water, filtering water-borne pollutants before they reach the fragile coastal habitat, and provide a recharge area for groundwater. 
Historic resources may be at risk on streams when hydropower projects are proposed. When Polynesians first settled our islands, Hawaiian culture was linked to streams as much as it was linked to the sea. The remnants of ancient Hawaiian settlements can be found along many State rivers. Will the Federal Government give adequate attention to stream resources that have unique natural or cultural significance when it issues a hydroelectric license or permit? 
Most important of all, hydropower development must be compatible with preserving native aquatic resources. Hawaiian streams support many species that depend on undisturbed habitat. Perhaps the most remarkable of these species is the gobie, which can climb waterfalls and colonize stream sections that are inaccessible to other fish. These are some of the complex factors that must be considered during Federal hydropower decisionmaking. 
Federal agencies that have responsibility for fish, wildlife, and natural resource protection have raised questions about the State of Hawaii's commitment to protecting stream resources. They assert that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is better equipped than the State to protect environmental values. 
Nothing could be further from truth. The State of Hawaii has demonstrated its commitment to protect stream resources by 
instituting a new water code, adopting instream flow standards, launching a comprehensive Hawaii stream assessment, and organizing a stream protection and management task force. 
Meanwhile, FERC has shown little regard for stream protection and has granted a preliminary permit to a hydropower developer on the Hanalei River. This is the same river that the Fish and Wildlife Service is fighting to preserve. The Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge is the largest refuge on the island of Kauai, and is home to four endangered water birds. Sixty percent of the State's taro crop is grown in the wetlands adjacent to the river. When it comes to protecting environmental values, FERC is off to a very poor start. 
The experience with the proposed Hanalei hydropower project raises serious questions about appropriateness of the Federal efforts to regulate hydropower in Hawaii. Our rivers and streams bear no resemblance to the wide, deep, long, and relatively flat rivers of the continental United States. Hawaiian streams generally comprise groups of short riffles, runs, falls, and deep pools. There are only five streams with a length of 40 miles or more. Only two streams have a median flow rate greater than 100 cubic feet per second. By comparison, the mean discharge of the Mississippi River is nearly 40,000 times the annual flow of Hawaii's longest river, the Kiikii River. 
The Federal interest in protecting the vast interconnected river systems of North America is misplaced in our isolated mid-Pacific location. When it comes to regulating hydropower in Hawaii, FERC is a fish out of water. 
Chairman Murkowski has agreed to include the text of my legislation to exempt Hawaii from the FERC hydropower jurisdiction in section 2 of the hydropower legislation he introduced today. Section 2 would terminate FERC's jurisdiction over hydropower projects on the fresh water of the State of Hawaii. Section 2 is identical to the legislation passed by the Senate during the 103d Congress as part of an omnibus hydropower bill, but the House and Senate could not resolve their differences on the bill. In the 104th Congress, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee again approved the bill. I will continue to fight for the passage of this legislation during the 105th Congress.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, I am naturally interested in this debate over Senate Resolution 39--a funding resolution for the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee special investigation, as amended by the Senate Rules Committee. I object to the action taken by the Rules Committee on Thursday that forces the Governmental Affairs Committee to limit its investigation solely to illegal activities related to the 1996 elections. 
I object because the Governmental Affairs Committee had a bipartisan agreement on a broad scope for this fundraising investigation. However, in an effort to appease those opposed to reforming our campaign finance laws, the Rules Committee overrode the agreement unanimously adopted by the Governmental Affairs Committee on January 30, 1997. The scope of the investigation is now so narrow that we are being forced to operate with blinders. If a fundraising activity is improper--we cannot look at it. If the activity occurred prior to 1996--we cannot look at it. If the activity involves soft money or questionable use of tax-exempt organizations--we cannot look at that, unless it is clearly illegal. 
The Rules Committee resolution narrows the definition of illegal so that the Governmental Affairs Committee would have to show evidence of criminal activity beyond a reasonable doubt before an activity or individual can be investigated. Is there anyone who does not believe that there are some serious allegations that are improper rather than illegal? How can we legislate changes in our campaign finance laws if we cannot look into activities that are not currently illegal, but should be illegal? 
Mr. President, I am proud to be a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee because it is one committee that continually operates in a bipartisan and fair manner. We hammered out the scope of our investigation over a period of several days and it received support from Democrats and Republicans alike. 
Last Friday, I participated in a press conference called by the ranking member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Mr. Glenn, to express concern with the newly amended funding resolution that came out of the Rules Committee. At that news conference, I said that the committee had taken the high ground by unanimously agreeing to a resolution setting forth the scope of its investigation. 
Back on January 30, 1997, the committee agreed on a number of issues relating to illegal or improper fundraising and spending practices which would lead to a consensus of how to best consider the issues at hand. Regretfully, since the adoption of that agreement, there has been discord, insinuations, accusations, and other obstacles to resolving the impasse over the committee's special investigatory funding. 
I object to the revision of the scope previously agreed upon by the Governmental Affairs Committee because past investigations into allegations of misconduct examined improper and unethical conduct as well as illegal conduct. Moreover, if the funding resolution before us today is adopted, we will limit the scope of the investigation to only the 1996 election cycle, thereby eliminating the possibility of looking into the issue of soft money, issue advocacy, and possible illegal use of tax-exempt organizations. 
Under the amended resolution, the Governmental Affairs Committee investigation would be precluded from investigating allegations that may be embarrassing to Congress, and potential problems related to individual members would be referred to the Senate Ethics Committee. I know that most Members of Congress are honest; however, if our citizenry believes that money buys access, then we must look into allegations that point to improper use of office. 
The statement of purpose of the Governmental Affairs special investigation, as amended by the Rules Committee last Thursday, authorizes funds for `the sole purpose of conducting an investigation of illegal activities in connection with 1996 Federal election campaigns.' We have been told that the scope agreed to in the resolution before us was patterned after the Watergate resolution. However, the omission of two key words from that original Watergate resolution--unethical and improper--will undermine any investigation into the influence of money on Federal elections. 
Mr. President, I shall not belabor this issue as I know there are other Members who wish to speak. I want to reiterate, however, that the scope agreed to on January 30, 1997, was very inclusive--it would provide for an investigation into the business of fundraising by both parties. The purpose of our inquiry was to examine all aspects of campaign fundraising--both Presidential and congressional--with the eventual outcome to be substantive and effective campaign finance reform legislation. I fear that without ensuring that improper fundraising practices are included in the investigation that this may never come about. We cannot deny the public a full and thorough inquiry into allegations that may eventually lead to tough campaign finance laws.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce the Fairness in Judiciary Appointments Act of 1997, with my colleague, the senior Senator from Hawaii. Our measure would require the appointment of judges on the circuit court of appeals from all States in the circuit. This legislation is identical to S. 1320, which was introduced in 1995. 
This measure will require no new appropriations and no additional spending authority. It would, however, ensure fairness in the appointment of circuit court judges and remove political pressure in weighing the nomination of a person from a more populated State over an individual from a less populated State. 
Our bill would require that judges on the circuit court of appeals be appointed from every State in the circuit. The impact of the measure on fairness and justice would be long-term and far-reaching. It will assure that all citizens of every State in the Nation are represented by an active circuit judge on each of the circuits. 
I am disappointed that the past three administrations have failed to nominate a circuit court judge from Hawaii, which is part of the ninth circuit. Hawaii's only active judge serves as a senior judge since his retirement over 10 years ago. There are currently 8 vacancies on the court out of 28 seats. Two additional judges are expected to retire this spring, which will mean that a full one-third of the seats on the ninth circuit court will be vacant. 
I will not go into the inability of the Senate to act on judicial appointments in the last Congress at this time. However, I will state for my colleagues that I am hopeful we will eliminate the existing backlog of vacancies at all levels of the Federal court system in a bipartisan manner. 
It is my firm belief that legal decisions should be based on the law, not representation. But representation would add to the credibility and legitimacy of the Federal appellate courts and the decisions they render. I urge my colleagues to support the Fairness in Judiciary Appointment Act of 1997.

 Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I offer a bill to allow the Department of Veterans Affairs [VA] to waive fees at joint parking facilities with the Department of Defense [DOD]. 
Currently, the VA is required to charge its users and employees to park at facilities built with special revolving funds. There is no exemption to this fee requirement for joint VA/DOD facilities, which results in an administrative nightmare for a parking facility in Hawaii. 
The VA parking structure at Tripler Army Medical Hospital will be shared by VA and DOD. While the law currently requires VA visitors and medical staff to pay for parking, DOD visitors and personnel are exempt from such a charge. 
Determining who is a VA or DOD visitor to the facility will be difficult to administer without creating a bureaucratic ordeal. Under the current situation, only VA medical employees at Tripler will be required to pay for parking. Visitors, DOD personnel, and VA regional employees would not be charged for parking. 
In addition, any VA medical employee who is also a DOD retiree would be exempt from the parking charge, because DOD retirees receive free parking at DOD facilities. 
Thus, only VA medical personnel who are not DOD retirees will be required to pay for parking. The cost to administer this parking fee will far outweigh the revenues received. Since parking fees are determined by surrounding area facilities and since Tripler is located in a residential area, parking fees for the Tripler facility would be nominal. Therefore, I am submitting legislation which will allow joint VA/DOD parking facilities to be exempt from the current statute.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, in behalf of myself, Senator Frist, and Senator Inouye, I am today introducing the National Parks Airspace Management Act of 1997, a bill designed to mitigate the impact of commercial air tour flights over units of the National Park System. The measure would establish a new, statutory framework for minimizing the environmental effects of air tour activity on park units. This measure is similar to legislation I offered in the last two Congresses. 
Briefly, our bill would specify the respective authorities of the National Park Service and the Federal Aviation Administration [FAA] in developing and enforcing park overflight policy; establish a process for developing individualized airspace management plans at parks experiencing significant commercial air tour activity; provide for the designation of those parks which did not experience commercial air tour activity as of January 1, 1997, as flight-free parks; establish a new, single standard governing the certification and operation of all commercial air tour operators that conduct flights over national parks; require a variety of safety measures, such as improved aircraft markings, maintenance of accurate aeronautical charts, installation of flight monitoring equipment, and an air tour data base; and, establish a National Park Overflight Advisory Council. 
 Mr. President, aircraft overflights of noise-sensitive areas such as national parks have been increasing in scope and intensity for a number of years, sparking significant public debate and controversy about the safety and environmental impact of such activity. The focus of much of the debate, and much of the controversy, has been the commercial air tour sightseeing industry, which has experienced explosive growth in some areas, notably at the Grand Canyon and in my own State of Hawaii. But significant commercial air tour activity has also been developing in such widely dispersed locations as Glacier National Park in Montana, the Utah national parks, Mount Rushmore in South Dakota, and the Statue of Liberty and Niagara Falls in New York. In fact, at Great Smoky Mountains National Park, commercial air tour overflights have fostered such opposition that the State of Tennessee has passed legislation to restrict such flights. 
In 1987, precipitated by a midair collision at the Grand Canyon, Congress adopted the National Parks Overflights Act, Public Law 100-91. The act permanently banned below-the-rim flights at the Grand Canyon and led to a Special Federal Aviation Regulation--SFAR 50-2--establishing flight-free zones and air corridors at the park. The act also established temporary altitude restrictions for Yosemite National Park in California and Haleakala National Park in Hawaii. Finally, Public Law 100-91 
mandated that the Park Service conduct a study on the impact of low-level flights on units of the National Park System. 
Since passage of the National Parks Overflights Act, a number of important developments have occurred. First, in 1993 a Department of Transportation and Department of the Interior interagency working group was established to address park overflight issues of mutual concern, an acknowledgment by the executive branch that the issue required extensive interagency cooperation, but also a reflection of the deep differences in approach and attitude that existed between the National Park Service and the FAA on this contentious matter. 
In 1994, the overflights report mandated by Public Law 100-91 was completed, identifying and documenting low-altitude flights as threats to park resources and recommending a variety of means to address these threats, such as incentives to encourage use of quite aircraft technology, flight-free zones and flight corridors, altitude restrictions, noise budgets, and limits on times of air tour operations. Also in 1994, in response to a pair of helicopter crashes in the Pacific, the FAA issued an emergency flight rule--SFAR 71--imposing certain altitude and other operating restrictions on air tour operators in Hawaii. 
More recently, last spring, the President issued an executive memorandum directing agency heads to participate in the effort to protect natural quite in National Park System units. The memorandum led to the final rule for the Grand Canyon, issued in December 1996, providing for additional, delineated restrictions on air tour activity at the park. The memorandum also led to a new rule promulgated earlier this year to ban preemptively, for 2 years or until a national rule is developed, flights at Rocky Mountain National Park. Finally, as a result of the President's memorandum, the FAA and the Park Service were required to develop a comprehensive, national rule governing air tour flights at all national parks. Work on the national rule is in the preliminary stages. 
While these developments have been welcome, it is fair to say that overall progress on the overflights issue has been desultory. For every Grand Canyon or Rocky Mountain, there are dozens of parks whose overflights problems remain completely unaddressed. In this regard, problems and delays associated with the development of a national rule have been particularly disappointing. Reportedly, the FAA and Park Service continue to squabble over matters of jurisdiction, and air tour operators and environmental organizations continue to prefer confrontation to accommodation. In the meantime, air tour-generated problems continue to accrete, exacerbating the environmental and safety consequences of park overflights. This experience has shown us that only Congress, through legislation, can produce lasting, effective policy on this matter. 
Mr. President, when all is said and done, the simple truth 
is that the complex problems associated with park overflights cannot be fully resolved administratively. In my opinion, this state of affairs is largely due to the fact that the FAA and the Park Service, the two agencies with the heaviest responsibility for addressing park overflights, are governed by vastly different statutory mandates. On the one hand, the FAA is responsible for the safety and efficiency of air commerce; on the other, the Park Service is charged with protecting and preserving park resources. These mutually exclusive missions have bred different approaches, attitudes, and institutional cultures that have hindered interagency cooperation and development of a consistent, effective park overflights policy. Only by modifying or clarifying their statutory responsibilities with respect to the management of park airspace can the two Federal agencies be expected to work together consistently and systematically to address the overflight problem. 
Mr. President, the legislation we are proposing today would address this and other barriers to the development of a comprehensive park overflights policy. Our bill deals with the commercial air tour overflights issue in a national context, since the safety and environmental concerns which are being debated so vociferously at the Grand Canyon and in Hawaii are being echoed at park units scattered throughout the National Park System. 
At the outset, our bill establishes a finding that National Park Service policy recognizes the importance of natural quiet as a resource to be conserved and protected in certain park units. Toward that end, our legislation creates a new statutory framework for minimizing the environmental effects of air tour activity on units throughout the National Park System. 
The bill articulates a regulatory scheme under which the Park Service and the FAA are required to work in tandem to develop operational policies with respect to the overflights problem. It provides for joint administration in many areas while clearly denoting the FAA's primary on matters related to safety and air efficiency and the Park Service's lead role in identifying the resources to be protected and the best means of protecting them. 
The bill requires the development, with public involvement, of individually tailored park airspace management plans for units significantly affected by overflight activity, as determined by the Director of the Park Service. It calls for good faith negotiations between commercial air tour operators and both the Park Service and the FAA to reach agreement on flights over park areas. 
It provides for the Park Service to recommend to the FAA the designation of individual units as `flight-free parks' for those units which, as of January 1, 1997, experienced no overflights by commercial air tour operators and where air tour flights would be 
incompatible with or injurious to the purposes or values of those parks. 
It also mandates the development by the FAA of a generic operational rule for commercial air tour operations at all units of the National Park System, subject to modification at individual park units based on negotiations among air tour operators, the FAA, and the Park Service. 
Our legislation requires the FAA to implement a single standard, through a new subpart of part 135, title 14, Code of Federal Regulations, for certifying commercial air tour operators. Such a uniform standard, which has been recommended by the National Transportation Safety Board [NTSB], will substantially enhance safety by providing essential consistency in such areas as pilot qualifications, training, and flight and duty time limitations. 
It mandates commercial air tour safety initiatives recommended by the NTSB and others, including the installation of a flight monitoring system and the use of identification markings unique to a commercial air tour operator, the development of aeronautical charts which reflect airspace management provisions with respect to individual park units, and the development of a national database on air tour operations. 
Last, but by no means least, the bill establishes a National Park Overflight Advisory Council which would provide advice and recommendations to the Park Service and the FAA on all issues related to commercial air tour flights over park units and serve as a national forum for interest groups, including representatives of the air tour industry and the environmental community, to exchange views constructively. 
It is significant to note that our bill will not affect emergency flight operations, general aviation, military aviation, or scheduled commercial passenger flights that transit National Park System units. Furthermore, recognizing the special needs for air travel in Alaska, this bill will not affect the management of park units or aircraft operations over or within park units in the State of Alaska. 
Mr. President, I believe that the legislation we are offering today will give us the tools to minimize the adverse effects of commercial air tour flights on park resources as well as on the ground visitor experience, while at the same time enhancing the safety of such flights. I believe it is a balanced measure that, through extensive opportunity for public involvement, attempts to accommodate the legitimate concerns of all park users, including air tour operators and passengers. Indeed, I strongly believe that under certain well-regulated conditions, air tourism provides an important service to many elderly, disabled, or other visitors who might otherwise never enjoy the wonders of our national parks. 
Nevertheless, our bill's central premise is that the 369 park units of the National Park System were created because of their exceptional natural or cultural significance to the American people. All of the provisions of the National Parks Airspace Management Act are therefore designed with the protection of park resources as their essential, if not exclusive, goal. For it is self-evident that a park whose values have been corrupted is a park ultimately not worth visiting, by air or land. 
Mr. President, in closing, I would like to acknowledge the fact that the senior Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] earlier this week introduced related legislation on park overflights. While his bill differs from ours in some details, the intent of both measures is the same--to mitigate the adverse effects of air tours flights on our national parks. Given our common goal, I hope that we can work together in crafting an effective, bipartisan approach to this troubling and divisive issue.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Disaster Victims Crime Prevention Act of 1997, on behalf of myself, Senator Inouye, and Senator Glenn to combat fraud against victims of Federal disasters. Like similar legislation I introduced in the 103d and 104th Congresses, this measure would make it a Federal crime to defraud persons through the sale of materials or services for cleanup, repair, and recovery following a federally declared disaster. 
We are all aware of the tremendous costs incurred during a natural disaster. California is recovering from the devastating floods that have caused nearly $1.6 billion in damage and has made 42 of the State's 58 counties eligible for disaster assistance. Just before the dams and levees in California overflowed, the Pacific Northwest was hit with violent storms, and recently Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota have been declared Federal disaster areas, as have 13 counties in Idaho and four in Nevada. 
During the 1990's, a number of deadly natural disasters have occurred throughout the United States and its territories including hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, wild fires, mudslides, and blizzards. Many were declared Federal natural disasters like Hurricane Iniki, which in 1993 leveled the island of Kauai in Hawaii causing $1.6 billion in damage and Hurricane Andrew which devastated southern Florida. 
Through instant, onscreen media coverage, the Nation has had ringside seats to the destruction caused by these catastrophic events. We sympathetically watch television as families sift through the debris of their lives and as men and women assess the loss of their businesses. We witness the concern of others, such as Red Cross volunteers passing out blankets and food and citizens traveling hundreds of miles to help rebuild strangers' homes. 
Despite the outpouring of public support that follows these catastrophes, there are unscrupulous individuals who prey on trusting and unsuspecting victims, whose immediate concerns are applying for disaster assistance, seeking temporary shelter, and dealing with the rebuilding of their lives. 
The Disaster Victims Crime Prevention Act of 1997 would criminalize some of the activities undertaken by these unprincipled people whose sole intent is to defraud hard-working men and women. This legislation will make it a Federal crime to defraud persons through the sale of materials or services for cleanup, repair, and recovery following a federally declared disaster. 
Every disaster has examples of individuals who are victimized twice--first by the disaster and later by unconscionable price hikes and fraudulent contractors. In the wake of the 1993 Midwest flooding, Iowa officials found that some vendors raised the price of portable toilets from $60 a month to $60 a day. In other flood-hit areas, carpet cleaners hiked their prices to $350 per hour, while telemarketers set up telephone banks to solicit funds for phony flood-related charities. 
Nor will television viewers forget the scenes of beleaguered south Floridians buying generators, plastic sheeting, and bottled water at outrageous prices in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew. 
After Hurricane Iniki devastated the island of Kauai, a contractor promising quick home repair took disaster benefits from numerous homeowners and fled the area without completing promised construction. These fraud victims have yet to find relief. 
While the Stafford Natural Disaster Act currently provides for civil and criminal penalties for the misuse of disaster funds, it fails to address contractor fraud. To fill this gap, our 
legislation would make it a Federal crime to take money fraudulently from a disaster victim and fail to provide the agreed-upon material or service for the cleanup, repair, and recovery. 
The Stafford Act also fails to address price gouging. Although it is the responsibility of the States to impose restrictions on price increases prior to a Federal disaster declaration, Federal penalties for price gouging should be imposed once a Federal disaster has been declared. I am pleased to incorporate in this measure an initiative Senator Glenn began following Hurricane Andrew to combat price gouging and excessive pricing of goods and services. Fortunately, citizens in Hawaii were spared spiraling cost increases after Hurricane Iniki because the State government acted swiftly to counteract attempts at price gouging by instituting price and rent freezes. 
There already is tremendous cooperation among the various State and local offices that deal with fraud and consumer protection issues, and it is quite common for these fine men and women to lend their expertise to their colleagues from out-of-State during a natural disaster. This exchange of experiences and practical solutions has created a strong support network. 
However, a Federal remedy is needed to assist States when a disaster occurs. There should be a broader enforcement system to help overburdened State and local governments during a time of disaster. The Federal Government is in a position to ensure that residents within a federally declared disaster area do not fall victim to fraud. Federal agencies should assist localities to provide such a support system. 
In addition to making disaster-related fraud a Federal crime, this bill would also require the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to develop public information materials to advise disaster victims about ways to detect and avoid fraud. I have seen a number of antifraud materials prepared by State consumer protection offices and believe this section would assist States to disseminate antifraud-related material following the declaration of a disaster by the President. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass legislation that sends a clear message to anyone thinking of defrauding a disaster victim or raising prices unnecessarily on everyday commodities during a natural disaster.

Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Emergency Petroleum Supply Act, a bill to ensure that Hawaii has access to the strategic petroleum reserve during an oil supply disruption. The Emergency Petroleum Supply Act would guarantee Hawaii oil at a fair price and give tankers bound for Hawaii priority loading during an emergency. 
This legislation passed the Senate in two previous Congresses. During the 104th Congress, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources once again approved the bill. Only the inability of the House to adopt strategic petroleum reserve reforms has prevented my bill from becoming law. I will work aggressively during the 105th Congress to enact this measure. 
The objective of the Emergency Petroleum Supply Act can be summarized in one word: access. Because of its tremendous distance from the Gulf Coast, Hawaii needs guaranteed access to the strategic petroleum reserve [SPR], as well as priority access to the SPR loading docks. 
My bill addresses both these concerns. First, it provides a mechanism to guarantee an award of SPR oil. Hawaii's energy companies will be allowed to submit binding offers for a fixed quantity of oil at a price equal to the average of all successful bids. This concept is modeled after the Federal Government's method of selling Treasury bills. It would give Hawaii ready access to emergency oil supplies at a price that is fair to the Government. Without this bill, Hawaii's energy companies, and the population they serve, face the risk that their bid for SPR oil would be rejected and that oil inventories would run dry. 
The second component of my bill addresses the problem of delay. The Emergency Petroleum Supply Act grants Hawaii-bound ships expedited access to SPR loading docks. It would be a terrible misfortune if deliveries to Hawaii were delayed because the tanker scheduled to carry emergency supplies was moored in the Gulf of Mexico, waiting in line for access to the SPR loading docks. 
As any grade-school geography student knows, Hawaii is a long way from the Gulf of Mexico, especially when you have to transit the Panama Canal. The distance between the SPR loading docks and Honolulu, by way of the canal, is 7,000 miles--more than one-quarter of the distance around the globe. 
But distance alone is not the issue. When you add together the time between the decision to draw down the reserve and the time for oil from the reserve to reach our shores, the seriousness of the problem emerges. It takes time to solicit and accept bids for SPR oil, time to locate and position tankers, time for tankers to wait in line to gain access to SPR loading docks, and more time to transit the canal to Hawaii. Obviously, Hawaii is at the end of a very, very long supply line. People overlook the fact that insular areas have a limited supply of petroleum products on hand at any time. While Hawaii waited for emergency supplies to arrive, oil inventories could run dry and our economy could grind to a halt. 
Recently, the Department of Energy asked Hawaii's East-West Center to study this problem. The East-West Center report concluded that my SPR access measure `is an excellent proposal which would greatly reassure the islands that their basic needs would be maintained.' 
The East-West Center report provides strong justification for granting Hawaii special access to SPR oil during an energy emergency. The report found that a major oil supply disruption would have a much more severe impact on the Pacific islands than on the rest of the United States. Although all of Asia would experience some degree of inflation and recession, the small economies of the insular areas would be virtually unprotected from volatile economic forces. While the rest of the United States does not have to rely on ocean transport from other nations for essential goods and services, the economies of Hawaii and the Pacific islands are heavily dependent on ocean-borne trade and foreign visitors. 
The need for this provision is further justified by a December 1993 Department of Energy/State of Hawaii analysis of Hawaii's energy security which found the following: 
Hawaii depends on imported oil for over 92 percent of its energy. This makes Hawaii the most vulnerable State in the Nation to the disruption of its economy and way of life in the event of a disruption of the world oil market or rapid oil price increases. 
Currently, 40 percent of Hawaii's oil comes from Alaska and the remainder from the Asia-Pacific region. The export capabilities of these domestic and foreign sources of supply are projected to decline by approximately 50 percent by the year 2000. This will likely increase Hawaii's dependence on oil reserves of the politically unstable Middle East. 
Hawaii is also vulnerable to possible supply disruptions in the event of a crisis. The long distance from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve in Louisiana and Texas, combined with a declining number of U.S.-flag tankers capable of transiting the Panama Canal, make timely emergency deliveries problematic. 
Other studies have consistently verified Hawaii's energy vulnerability and its need for special access to the SPR. An analysis by Mr. Bruce Wilson, an accomplished oil economist, determined that the delivery of SPR oil to Hawaii from the Gulf of Mexico could take as long as 53 days. That exceeds the State's average commercial working inventory by 23 days. As Mr. Wilson's research shows, an oil supply disruption is Hawaii's greatest nightmare. 
Some suggest that market forces will ensure that Hawaii and the territories receive the oil they need during an energy emergency. Unfortunately, these are the same market forces that cause Hawaii's consumers to pay 50 percent more per gallon of gasoline than consumers pay on the Mainland. When a crisis hits, our energy prices can double or triple. 
Hawaii may be the 50th State, but we deserve the same degree of energy security that the rest of the Nation enjoys. It's simply a matter of equity. Hawaii's tax dollars help fill and maintain the reserve; Hawaii should enjoy the energy security the SPR is designed to provide. 
My bill will safeguard Hawaii from the harsh economic consequences of an oil emergency. The Emergency Petroleum Supply Act is not only good energy policy, it's good economic policy for Hawaii.

Mr. AKAKA. 
Mr. President, today I am introducing the Plant Protection Act, a comprehensive consolidation of Federal laws governing plant pests and diseases, noxious weeds, and the plant products that harbor pests and weeds. 
During the past century, numerous Federal laws were enacted to address problems caused by plant pests and noxious weeds. While some of these laws continue to protect agriculture and the environment, others are ambiguous, outmoded, or difficult to enforce. The Nation's agricultural community, as well as private, state, and Federal land managers, cannot afford the continuing uncertainty caused by the hodgepodge of Federal plant pest laws, some of which were enacted before World War I. Legislation to revise and consolidate federal plant pest laws is urgently needed and long overdue. 
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman highlighted the problem created by federal plant protection laws when he told Congress that `in some instances, it is unclear which statutes should be relied upon for authority. It is difficult to explain to the public why some apparently similar situations have to be treated differently because different authorities are involved.' 
A 1993 report issued by the Office of Technology Assessment reached the same conclusion. The OTA found that Federal and State statutes, regulations, and programs are not keeping pace with new and spreading alien pests. 
The Plant Protection Act will address many of these problems. The bill I introduced today will enhance the Federal Government's ability to combat weeds, plant pests, and diseases, and protect our farms, environment, and economy from the harm they cause. 
Plant pests are a problem of monumental proportions. Insects such as Mediterranean fruit fly, fire ant, and gypsy moth plague America's farmers and cause billions of dollars in crop losses annually. Destructive plant diseases include chestnut blight, which wiped out the most common tree of our Appalachian forests, elm blight, which destroyed many splendid trees throughout our towns and cities, and the white pine blister rust, which eliminated western white pine as a source of timber for several decades. 
Alien weeds also cause havoc, and nowhere is this problem more apparent than in Hawaii. Because our climate is so accommodating, Hawaii is heaven-on-earth for weeds. Weeds such as gorse, ivy gourd, miconia, and banana poka are ravaging our tropical and subtropical landscape. 
Invasive noxious weeds do more than just compete with domestic species. They transform the landscape, change the rules by which native plants and animals live, and undermine the economic and environmental health of the areas they infest. 
Alien weeds fuel grass and forest fires, promote soil erosion, and destroy critical water resources. They significantly increase the cost of farming and ranching. Noxious weeds destroy or alter natural habitat, damage waterways and powerlines, and depress property values. Some are toxic to humans, livestock, and wildlife. 
Alien weeds are biological pollution, pure and simple. Due to the worldwide growth in trade and travel we are witnessing an explosion in the number of foreign weeds that plague our Nation. 
Just how big is this problem? Let me offer an example. Last year, on Federal lands alone, we lost 4,500 acres each day to noxious weeds. That's a million-and-a-half acres a year, or an area the size of Delaware. By comparison, forest fires--one of the most fearsome natural disasters--claimed only half as many Federal acres as weeds. 
Noxious weeds have also been called biological wildfire, and for good reason. Forests, national parks, recreation areas, urban landscapes, wilderness, grasslands, waterways, farm and range land across the Nation are overrun by noxious weeds. 
Farmers experience the greatest economic impact of this problem. The Office of Technology Assessment estimates that exotic weeds cost U.S. farmers $3.6 to $5.4 billion annually due to reduced yields, crops of poor quality, increased herbicide use, and other weed control costs. Noxious weeds are a significant drain on farm productivity. 
Despite the magnitude of this problem, few people get alarmed about weeds. The issue certainly doesn't appear on the cover of Time or Newsweek. Perhaps if kudzu, a weed known as the `vine that ate the South,' attacked the Capitol grounds, weeds would finally get the attention they deserve. 
Several of these foreign weeds are truly the King Kong of plants. Some are 50 feet tall. Others have 4 inch thorns. Some have roots 25 feet deep, and others produce 20 million seeds each year. 
My least-favorite weed is the tropical soda apple, a thorny plant with a sweet-sounding name. It bears small yellow and green fruit. But, like fruit from the forbidden tree, tropical soda apples are a source of great strife. 
This import from Brazil has inch-long spikes covering its stems and leaves. The fruit is a favorite among cattle, and when they pass the seeds in their manure new weeds quickly sprout. As cattle are shipped from state to state with soda apple seeds in their stomachs you can easily imagine how the problem rapidly spreads. Tropical soda apple is a weed control nightmare. 
The saga of tropical soda apple prompted me to introduce S. 690, the Federal Noxious Weed Improvement Act during the 104th Congress. S. 690 would grant the Secretary of Agriculture emergency powers to restrict the entry of a foreign weed until formal action can be taken to place it on the noxious weed list. This legislation would prevent future tropical soda apples from taking root. 
I have incorporated the text of S. 690 into section 4 of the Plant Protection Act. Other provisions of the legislation I have introduced today are drawn from USDA recommendations for consolidating weed and plant pest authorities. 
Because the U.S. Department of Agriculture's authority over plant pests and noxious weeds is dispersed throughout many statutes, Federal efforts to protect agriculture, forestry, and our environment are seriously hindered. To enable the Department to respond more efficiently to this challenge, the Plant Protection Act will consolidate these authorities into a single statute.
