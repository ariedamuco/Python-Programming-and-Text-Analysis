Mr. STEVENS. Yes. The Brady Act did not intend, nor did it authorize the Department of Justice to charge a tax or fee to law abiding citizens to exercise their Second Amendment right. The National Instant Check System (NICS) is a national criminal justice program which was designed to quickly screen prospective firearms purchasers--weeding out prohibited gun pruchases while ensuring that the sale of a firearm to a law-abiding citizen could go forth without significant delay. The NICS is a federal program of benefit to all citizens and therefore the cost should be and will be borne by the federal government in view of the absence of any enabling provision relating to assessment of a user fee to gun owners.

Mr. STEVENS. Again the Senator is correct. The establishment of NICS contained important elements in the law designed to protect the privacy of individual law-abiding gun owners. One of the greatest concerns and legitimate fears of law abiding gun owners is that the federal government will create a federal gun owner registration system where law abiding gun owners exercise of their constitutional rights will be carefully monitored. This is why there are a number of provisions in law which prohibit such action by the government. One such law is the Firearms Owners Protection Act, passed in 1986, which specifically prohibits any record of firearms owners and firearms purchases from being maintained or recorded, for any period of time, in a facility owned, managed, or controlled by the United States government.

Mr. STEVENS. Yes, the Brady Act clearly states that upon approval of a firearm transaction, the instant check system shall `destroy all records of the system with respect to the call (other than the identifying number and the date the number was assigned) and all records of the system relating to the transfer.' 18 U.S.C. 922(t)(2). Additionally, Section 103 
of the Brady Act prohibits the establishment of a firearms registration system to prevent any records generated by the instant check system from being transferred to a facility owned, managed or controlled by the United States government.

Mr. STEVENS. The national instant criminal background check system clearly prohibits such action by the FBI. The centralization and retention of firearms transaction information and records on firearm owners would create a de facto system of firearms registration which has clearly not intended by the Brady Act or any other provision of federal law. In fact it was specifically prohibited.

Mr. STEVENS. I do not believe the law could be any clearer. The NICS statute is transparent and unambiguous on the point that the instant check system `shall destroy' such records. Subsection (t)(2) of 18 United States Code, Section 922, is clearly drafted so that destruction of an approved firearms transaction and personal identifying records shall occur contemporaneously upon the system's approval of the firearms transfer, the assignment of a unique identifying number, and upon the immediate voice or electronic conveyance of such approval and unique identifying number to the federal firearms dealer making the NICS inquiry.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished Senator form New Mexico, the chairman of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee, on the subject of funding which is provided in P.L. 105-245 for the existing joint U.S: Russian program, for the development of gas reactor technology to dispose of excess weapons-derived plutonium. 
As the chairman of the subcommittee knows, the purpose of this program is to develop a new reactor technology which is not only more efficient in burning weapons plutonium but is melt-down proof and more thermally efficient than existing reactors. Because of the promise of this technology, the Russians are very enthusiastic about it and the French nuclear company Framatome and the Japanese company Fuji Electric have been active participants. Further, because most of the technical work on this program is being performed by Russian nuclear scientists and engineers, program costs are reduced considerably the those same Russian scientist and engineers are engaged in stimulating non-nuclear weapons work. 
It is my understanding that this unique and innovative U.S: Russian program to destroy weapons plutonium is the result of the very considerable expense and efforts of a particular U.S. company over several years. Is this also the Subcommittee Chairman's understanding?

Specifically, is it the Senator's understanding or intent that the Department of Energy should receive most of this money or impose a new management structure over this program that is working so well and is so well accepted by the Russians?

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this legislation includes the Olympic and Amateur Sports Act Amendments of 1998, a bill that Senator Campbell joined me in cosponsoring to update the federal charter of the U.S. Olympic Committee and the frame-work for Olympic and amateur sports in the United States. 
This framework is known as the `Amateur Sports Act,' because most of its provisions were added by the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-606). The Act gives the U.S. Olympic Committee certain trademark protections to raise money--and does not provide recurring appropriations--so therefore does not come up for routine reauthorization. 
The Amateur Sports Act has not been amended since the comprehensive revision of 1978--a revision which provided the foundation for the modern Olympic movement in the United States. The bill we will soon pass does not fundamentally change the Act because our review showed us that is still fundamentally sound. We believe the modest changes we will make will ensure that the Act serves the United States well in the 21st Century. 
The significant changes which have occurred in the world of Olympic and amateur sports since 1978 warrant some fine-tuning of the Act. Some of the developments of the past 20 years include: (1) that the schedule for the Olympics and Winter Olympics has been alternated so that games are held every two years, instead of every four--significantly increasing the workload of the U.S. Olympic Committee; (2) that sports have begun to allow professional athletes to compete in some Olympic events; (3) that even sports still considered `amateur' have athletes who with greater financial opportunities and professional responsibilities than we ever considered in 1978; and (4) that the Paralympics--the Olympics for disabled amateur athletes--have grown significantly in size and prestige. 
These and other changes led me to call for a comprehensive review of the Amateur Sports Act in 1994. The Commerce Committee has held three hearings since then. At the first and second--on August 11, 1994 and October 18, 1995--witnesses identified where the Amateur Sports Act was showing signs of strain. We postponed our work until after the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, but on April 21, 1997, held a third hearing at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs to discuss solutions to the problems which had been identified. 
By January, 1998, we'd refined the proposals into possible amendments to the Amateur Sports Act, which we discussed at length at an informal working session on January 26, 1998 in the Commerce Committee hearing room. The bill that Senator Campbell and I introduced in May reflected the comments received in January, and excluded proposals for which consensus appeared unachievable. With the help of the U.S. Olympic Committee, the Athletes Advisory Council, the National Governing Bodies' Council, numerous disabled sports organizations, and many others, we continued to fine tune the bill until it was approved by the Commerce Committee in July. 
I will include a longer summary of the bill for the Record, but will briefly explain its primary components: (1) the bill would change the title of the underlying law to the `Olympic and Amateur Sports Act' to reflect that more than strictly amateurs are involved now, but without lessening the amateur and grass roots focus reflected in the title of the 1978 Act; (2) the bill would add a number of measures to strengthen the provisions which protect athletes' rights to compete; (3) it would add measures to improve the ability of the USOC to resolve disputes--particularly close the Olympics, Paralympics, or Pan-American Games--and reduce the legal costs and administrative burdens of the USOC; (4) it would add measures to fully incorporate the Paralympics into the Amateur Sports Act, and update the existing provisions affecting disabled athletes; (5) it would improve the notification requirements when an NGB has been put on probation or is being challenged; (6) it would increase the reporting requirements of the USOC and NGB with respect to sports opportunities for women, minorities, and disabled individuals; and (7) it would require the USOC to report back to Congress in five years with any additional changes that may be needed to the Act.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we've reached agreement to include the American Fisheries Act in the legislation being passed today (as title II of division C of the bill). This Act will not only complete the process begun in 1976 to give U.S. interests a priority in the harvest of U.S. fishery resources, but will also significantly decapitalize the Bering Sea pollock fishery. 
The Bering Sea pollock fishery is the nation's largest, and its present state of overcapacity is the result of mistakes in, and misinterpretations of, the 1987 Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Anti-Reflagging Act (the `Anti-Reflagging Act'). In 1986, as the last of the foreign-flag fishing vessels in U.S. fisheries were being replaced by U.S.-flag vessels, we discovered that federal law did not prevent U.S. flag vessels from being entirely owned by foreign interests. We also discovered that federal law did not require U.S. fishing vessels to carry U.S. crew members, and that U.S. fishing vessels could essentially be built in foreign shipyards under the existing regulatory definition of `rebuild.' The goals of the 1987 Anti-Reflagging Act therefore were to: (1) require the U.S.-control of fishing vessels that fly the U.S. flag; (2) stop the foreign construction of U.S. flag vessels under the `rebuild' loophole; and (3) require U.S.-flag fishing vessels to carry U.S. crews. 
Of these three goals, only the U.S. crew requirement was achieved. The Anti-Reflagging Act did not stop foreign interests from owning and controlling U.S. flag fishing vessels. In fact, about 30,000 of the 33,000 existing U.S.-flag fishing vessels are not subject to any U.S. controlling interest requirement. The Anti-Reflagging Act also failed to stop the massive foreign shipbuilding programs between 1987 and 1990 that brought almost 20 of the largest fishing vessels ever built into our fisheries as `rebuilds.' Today, half of the nation's largest fishery--Bering Sea pollock--continues to be harvested by foreign interests on foreign-built vessels that are not subject to any U.S.-controlling interest standard. 
On September 25, 1997, I introduced the American Fisheries Act (S. 1221) to fix these mistakes. Senators from almost every fishing region of the country joined me in support of this effort, including Senator Breaux, Senator Hollings, Senator Gregg, Senator Wyden, and Senator Murkowski. As introduced, the bill had three primary objectives: (1) require the owners of all U.S.-flag fishing vessels to comply with a 75 percent U.S.-controlling interest standard (similar to the standard for other commercial U.S.-flag vessels that operate in U.S. waters); (2) remove from U.S. fisheries at least half of the foreign-built factory trawlers that entered the fisheries through the Anti-Reflagging Act foreign rebuild grandfather loophole and that continued to be foreign-owned on September 25, 1997; and (3) prohibit the entry of any new fishing vessels above 165 feet, 750 tons, or with engines that produce greater than 3,000 horsepower. 
I am pleased to report that the package we are approving today accomplishes all three of the main objectives of S. 1221 as introduced. 
I wish to thank Senator Gorton for his tremendous effort in this. For almost a decade now, he and I have had various disagreements about the Bering Sea pollock fishery and issues relating to the Anti-Reflagging Act. At the Commerce Committee hearing in March, and later, at an Appropriations Committee markup in July, Senator Gorton plainly expressed his concerns with S. 1221. In August, however, he spent considerable time with representatives from the Bering Sea pollock fishery and by sheer will managed to develop a framework upon which we could both agree. After he presented the framework to me, we convened meetings in September that went around the clock for five days. Those meetings included Bering Sea pollock fishery industry representatives, industry representatives from other North Pacific fisheries, the State of Alaska, North Pacific Council members, the National Marine Fisheries, the Coast Guard, the Maritime Administration, environmental representatives, and staff for various members of Congress and the Senate and House committees of jurisdiction. 
At the end of those meetings, a consensus had been achieved among Bering Sea fishing representatives on an agreement to reduce capacity in the Bering Sea pollock fishery. For the next three weeks, we drafted the legislation to give effect to the agreement, and spent considerable time with the fishing industry from other fisheries who were concerned about the possible impacts of the changes in the Bering Sea pollock fishery. The legislation we are passing today includes many safeguards for other fisheries and the participants in those fisheries. By delaying implementation of some measures until January 1, 2000, it also provides the North Pacific Council and Secretary with sufficient time to develop safeguards for other fisheries. 
This legislation is unprecedented in the 23 years since the enactment of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. With the council system, Congressional action of this type is not needed in the federal fisheries anymore. However, the mistakes in the Anti-Reflagging Act and the way it was interpreted created unique problems in the Bering Sea pollock fishery that only Congress can fix. The North Pacific Council simply does not have the authority to turn back the clock by removing fishery endorsements, to provide the funds required under the Federal Credit Reform Act to allow for the $75 million loan to remove capacity, to strengthen the U.S.-control requirements for fishing vessels, to restrict federal loans on large fishing vessels, or to do many other things in this legislation. 
While S.1221 as introduced was more modest in scope, I believe the measures in this agreement are fully justified as a one-time corrective measure for the negative effects of Anti-Reflagging Act.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the omnibus package, H.R. 4328, includes a measure involving commercial fishing in Glacier Bay and Upper Dundas Bay within Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. While working on this in the past weeks, a fisherman commented to my office that the choices presented are like choosing whether to cut off your finger, hand, or arm. In short, because the Department of the Interior has taken the position that commercial fishing in Glacier Bay and Dundas Bay should end, there simply has been no solution that Alaskans can fully support. In the omnibus bill we have chosen the lesser of evils. 
Without Congressional action, the National Park Service would have gone forward with regulations to phase out fishing in the Bay over 15 years and eventually ban it altogether. The National Park Service would also have blocked Dungeness crab fishermen who fish in Upper Dundas Bay and the Beardslee Islands, the so-called wilderness waters, from continuing a fishery that has existed for nearly 20 years with no evidence of environmental damage. Whether the Service would have ever agreed to a fair plan to compensate these crabbers is doubtful. Discussions have been ongoing for three years without the Park Service putting a compensation plan on the table. 
Without Congressional action, the Service might have proceeded with plans to shut down the scallop fishery, stop flounder fishing, close out crabbing, and block fisheries outside Glacier Bay itself, again relying on what it believes are its inherent powers to stop commercial activities in parks, the spirit and letter of the Alaska National Lands Conservation Act to the contrary. In my opinion and the opinion of the State of Alaska, the Service has no such authority because regulation of fisheries is a state prerogative in Alaska as well as the rest of the nation. Furthermore, the Alaska Department of Law maintains that the submerged land within Glacier Bay and, as a result, the water column above it, both fall under the jurisdiction of the State of Alaska under the Submerged Lands Act and the Alaska Statehood Act. 
When this issue was brought before this Congress, I supported Senator Murkowski's amendment to the Interior Appropriations bill to block the Park Service's planned regulations to give us more time to work out a solution. I also cosponsored Senator Murkowski's bill to resolve this problem once and for all. Unfortunately, because of Administration opposition, the bill did not pass Congress, leaving us with the provision for a moratorium on regulations in the Interior bill. 
As we approached the end of the fiscal year, the Administration became more vocally opposed to allowing traditional fisheries in Glacier Bay to continue even though there is no scientific evidence that either the fisheries or other resources which depend on them are in trouble. For example, whale counts are actually up in Glacier Bay, an indication that there is an abundance of fish upon which to feed. Secretary Babbitt threatened to recommend a veto of the bill if the provision blocking the Park Service's fishing ban was included in the spending bills. 
At the same time, the Congressional leadership stepped up efforts to develop an omnibus spending package the President would sign. As much as they supported the Delegation's efforts in Glacier Bay, the Congressional leadership were not willing to give the President any excuse to veto bills and shut down the government to divert attention from other matters. I was asked to try to work out a solution that the President would accept. We worked for nearly a week to develop a plan; and after consultation with fishermen, crabbers, and the other members of the Delegation, I reluctantly concluded that this proposal was better than taking no action at all. 
The plan we developed allows the fishermen who have historically operated in Glacier Bay to continue to fish for the rest of their lives. We had sought the right to allow fishermen to pass on their permits to their children or assignees, but that was rejected by the Interior Department. Had the regulations gone forward in their current form, all fishermen would have been banned from the Bay in 15 years. 
The proposal also offers a compensation package to the five or six crabbers who will be forced out of designated wilderness areas in Glacier Bay and Upper Dundas Bay. It will compensate them for their permit and lost income for six years or $400,000, which ever is greater. In addition, if a fisherman chooses to be compensated for his or her permit and lost income, he or she may also sell to the Secretary his or her boat and gear for additional compensation. Each crabber will obviously have the option of keeping their boat and gear and fishing elsewhere. Lost income is net after expenses which should be calculated by taking gross receipts and subtracting the cost of insurance, crew, fuel, and bait. Paper losses such as depreciation used for Internal Revenue purposes only, should not be subtracted in calculating net income. 
The crabbers will have until February 1st to file a claim and the Interior Department will then have six months to act on those claims. There will be an appeals process with a right to go to court if no agreement is reached on an acceptable compensation plan. The office of the Assistant Secretary for Parks and Wildlife has pledged to me to expedite this process so the Dungeness crabbers will be compensated as quickly as possible. 
The compromise that was reached also maintains the State of Alaska's prerogatives with respect to state management of the state's fisheries. There will be a cooperative management plan developed jointly by the Interior Department and the State of Alaska. As that plan is developed, I have been assured by the Secretary's office that the Glacier Bay Working Group representing the fishing industry will be consulted. There will be a full public process including hearings, testimony, and an opportunity to comment on any proposed plan. 
In addition, the legislation includes a savings clause to clarify that nothing in the Act undermines the power and authority of the State of Alaska to manage fisheries in the State. Finally, I want to make clear that unless explicitly provided in the Act, the legislation is not intended to amend the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act which generally and specifically governs management of Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve as well as subsistence and commercial fishing. 
With respect to subsistence fishing, while the Interior Department would not agree to explicitly allow subsistence activities, I was assured by the Secretary's office that personal use fisheries could continue, most notably for the people of Hoonah who have had a long running dispute with the Park Service on this issue. I was advised that the Park Service is authorized under National Park Service Organic Act to recognize a state-run personal use fishery. 
Of critical importance is the status of the outer waters of Glacier Bay. The original proposal made by the Interior Department offered no assurance that commercial fishing could continue outside the Bay itself. Language was specifically included to address this shortcoming, making it clear that commercial fishing is authorized under law and will continue to be permitted in the outer waters. Although the Secretary, acting jointly in consort with the State of Alaska, through the cooperative management plan, may retain the right to protect park resources, that goal must be achieved through reasonable regulation. For example, an area around a seal rookery may be closed to salmon fishing to protect that specific location, but the rest of the outside waters must remain open to salmon fishing. 
I view this compromise as an insurance policy, a safety net that offers better protection to Glacier Bay's fishermen than was offered by the draft Park Service regulations. But I do not view it as the end of the story. There are provisions I do not like. 
Senator Murkowski has already indicated his intention to introduce legislation on this issue and hold hearings in the Senate Energy Committee which he chairs. I also have indications that Congressman Young, the Chairman of the House Resources Committee, has similar plans. The Secretary of the Interior agreed to extend the comment period on the pending agency regulations until January 15, 1999. 
One issue that has not been addressed in this legislative compromise are the losses of local communities and fish processing companies. The Interior Department acknowledges that this is a shortcoming and has pledged to work with me and the rest of the Delegation to address this issue. I pledge to work with local communities and processors in the months ahead.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is with some regret that it is my job to bring before the Senate the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999. Throughout the year, I have urged that we find a way to move on the individual appropriations bills so that we would avoid a repetition of what took place 2 years ago. Unfortunately, that request was not followed, despite the urging of the distinguished majority leader and minority leader to work with the Appropriations Committee. 
We were unable to finish the bills within the normal timeframe this year. 
We had an extremely difficult calendar because of the fact that Labor Day--the first Monday was the 7th of September. We then had the Jewish holidays which we were in recess for. We were just unable to finish in time. We had to get first one and then another and then another and now another continuing resolution in order to try and finish our work. I deeply regret the process that we are going through now. 
It is my task to present to the Senate, I think, the largest appropriations bill in a decade. Mr. President, it contains a grand total of $486.8 billion in appropriations. The regular appropriations bills are a total of $203 billion; the balance are in the supplemental and emergency appropriations. 
It has been a very difficult process to go through. We have had a series of meetings with representatives of the President and with our leaders. I thank the distinguished chairman of the House committee, Congressman Livingston, and his colleague, the ranking member there, Congressman Obey, as well as my colleague and great friend here in the Senate, the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd. 
We have worked many long hours now. And I really think our staffs deserve a great deal of credit, because we worked a lot of long hours, but they worked through the night after we had worked long hours and were there again the next morning when we started our negotiations once again. 
These negotiations have gone on now almost 3 weeks, and the product is the bill that was filed in the House last night. That bill, Mr. President, contains 11 divisions. 
Division A contains 8 of the 13 annual appropriations bills 
for the fiscal year 1999; for the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce-Justice-State, the District of Columbia, Foreign Operations, Interior, Labor, Health and Human Services-Education, Transportation, and Treasury-General Government. 
This division also contains the emergency agricultural assistance package and supplemental appropriations under Energy and Water Development and VA-HUD. It also contains the spending offsets that were presented to us by the administration. 
I might state that those were checked out by our Budget Committees and by the Congressional Budget Office. We believe that we are under the caps as were set by the budget agreement with the President. 
The division B contains emergency appropriations for military readiness and overseas contingency operations, storm damage to defense facilities, antiterrorism, the year 2000 conversions--the so-called Y2K problem--and counterdrug activities. 
Divisions C through K are various authorizing measures that were added to the bill. I hasten to point out that while many of them come from authorization committees, it is the Appropriations Committees that must put our names on these bills as they are presented to the House and Senate. We have done our very best to check through these bills. And I might state that our staffs have read them through not just once but twice to make certain that each one of them is as it was represented to us as these measures were brought to us. 
Division C is in fact a potpourri of measures, including the FAA reauthorization extension, post office namings, the Olympic and Amateur Sports Act amendments, Internet legislation, the American Fisheries Act, Persian Gulf veterans health, and others. 
Division D is the Drug Demand Reduction Act. 
Division E covers methamphetamine trafficking. It is another drug bill. 
Division F covers the marijuana for medical purposes. 
Division G is the State Department reauthorization bill. 
Division H is the new provisions concerning Sallie Mae. 
Division I covers the chemical weapons convention. 
Division J covers tax extenders and home health care provisions. 
Division K contains pay-as-you-go provisions to maintain the separation of mandatory and discretionary spending as outlined in last year's balanced budget agreement. 
Let me just take a few minutes of the Senate, Mr. President, to provide some highlights of the bill under the Appropriations Committee's jurisdiction; that is divisions A and B. 
The total discretionary spending in division A is $206 billion. This includes $2.8 billion in offsets. 
The agriculture portion of the conference includes the conference report on the agricultural appropriations bill that was vetoed by the President with some modifications. It contains an additional $1.64 billion in emergency crop and market loss assistance for farmers and ranchers. This brings the total agricultural emergency assistance funding for this year to $5.9 billion. 
There are also increases for food safety and rural empowerment zones and enterprise communities. The Commerce-State-Justice portion of this bill contains funding through June 15. It supports crime fighting and antidrug activities, counterterrorism, and border patrols. 
The Census Bureau will receive the funding it needs to continue to prepare for the decennial census. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Weather Service, and Science programs are, in my judgment, adequately funded. The State Department would receive funds for international programs and U.N. arrearages subject to authorization. 
The District of Columbia provisions would largely ratify the District's own consensus budget and continue ongoing management reforms. 
The Foreign Operations portion contains funding for export promotion and economic aid, as well as the funding for the International Monetary Fund, IMF, with conditions for reform. I might say, I am personally very gratified that this is finally being sent to the President for approval. 
The Department of the Interior would receive increases for park operations and much-needed maintenance, funding for the Everglades restoration effort, and other public land needs. Full funding for many cultural and historical preservation programs are also included in that portion of the bill. 
The Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education bill provides funds for worker assistance, increases funding for medical research at the National Institutes of Health by $2 billion, and fully funds the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP. Increases were provided for child care block grants, special education, and to reduce class size. 
The Transportation portion of the bill contains the highest limitation in history on obligations in the highway trust 
fund--$4 billion above last year's level. Adequate funds for the Coast Guard and the Federal Aviation Administration and our mass transportation programs are included. 
The Treasury-General Government portion contains funding to increase drug control programs and improve IRS customer relations. 
Two bills already passed by the Congress and signed by the President were, in fact, reopened by the final negotiations and additional materials are available for those bills. 
Division A contains additional appropriations under Energy and Water Development, including funds for the Tennessee Valley Authority, and authorization to refinance its debts, and funds for the Department of Energy's energy supply programs. 
The VA-HUD bill is also augmented by additional spending for urban empowerment zones, the Boston Harbor cleanup, climate change, and the Corporation for National and Community Service. 
As I said, division B contains the emergency supplemental spending in the omnibus bill, with the exception of agriculture assistance, which is in division A. 
The total discretionary spending in division B is $14.9 billion. It includes $6.8 billion to improve military readiness and to fund ongoing overseas contingency operations such as Bosnia. 
Mr. President, $2.4 billion is included to protect our embassies around the world and to fund our continuing fight against terrorism worldwide. And $3.4 billion is provided to address the Y2K problem--the year 2000 problem--throughout the Federal Government as a whole. This is provided in emergency appropriations subject to the President's approval. 
Mr. President, $700 million is included for a package of counterdrug activities. Another $1.5 billion is provided to address the damage caused by Hurricane Georges and Hurricane Bonnie. 
Mr. President, as I indicated, this is a very complicated bill. 
Mr. President, I want to take a moment to talk about two of the provisions that are in the bill that are legislative items. They were bills that I presented to the Senate. One is the American Fisheries Act. It is a culmination of the negotiations that were undertaken with my colleagues from the State of Washington after I had introduced Senate bill 1221. 
We reached the agreement to include this American Fisheries Act in the legislation that is being considered. It is title II of division C of the bill. This act will not only complete the process begun in 1976 to give the U.S. interests a priority in the harvest of U.S. fishery resources, but will also significantly decapitalized the Bering Sea pollock fishery. 
The 1976 act was, in fact, the Magnuson Act, that extended our jurisdiction to the 200-mile limit. The Bering Sea pollock fishery is the largest, and its present state of overcapacity is the result of mistakes in, and misinterpretations of, the 1987 Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Anti-Reflagging Act, which is generally known as the Anti-Reflagging Act. 
In 1986, as the last of the foreign-flag fishing vessels in the U.S. fleet were being replaced by U.S.-flag vessels, we discovered that Federal law did not prevent U.S.-flag vessels from being entirely owned by foreign interests. We also discovered that Federal law did not require U.S. fishing vessels to carry U.S. crew members, and that U.S. fishing vessels could essentially be built in foreign shipyards under the existing regulatory definition of the word `rebuild.' 
The goals of the 1987 Anti-Reflagging Act were to, one, require the U.S. control of fishing vessels that fly the U.S. flag; two, stop the foreign construction of the U.S.-flag vessels under the `rebuild' loophole; and, three, to require the U.S.-flag fishing vessels to carry U.S. crews. Of these three goals, only the U.S. crew requirement was achieved by the 1987 act. 
The Anti-Reflagging Act did not stop foreign interests from owning and controlling U.S.-flag fishing vessels. About 30,000 of the 33,000 existing U.S.-flag fishing vessels are not subject to any U.S. controlling interest requirement. 
The Anti-Reflagging Act also failed to stop the massive foreign rebuilding programs between 1987 and 1990 that brought almost 20 of the largest fishing vessels ever built in the world into our fisheries as `rebuilt' vessels. 
Today, half of the Nation's largest fishery--which is the Bering Sea pollock--continues to be harvested by foreign interests on foreign-built vessels that are not subject to any U.S.-controlling interest standard. 
On September 25, 1997, I introduced the American Fisheries Act, S. 1221, to try to fix these mistakes. Senators from almost every fishing region of the country joined me in supporting that effort, including Senators Breaux, Hollings, Gregg, Wyden and Murkowski. 
As introduced, the bill had three primary objectives: requiring the owners of all U.S.-flag fishing vessels to comply with a 75-percent U.S.-controlling interest standard, similar to the standard for other commercial U.S.-flag vessels that operate in U.S. waters; two, to remove from U.S. fisheries at least one-half of the foreign-built factory trawlers that entered the fisheries through the Anti-Reflagging Act foreign rebuild grandfather loophole and that continued to be foreign-owned as of September 25, 1997; and, third, to prohibit the entry of any new fishing vessels above 165 feet, 750 tons, or with engines producing greater than 3,000 horsepower in the North Pacific fisheries fleet. 
I am pleased to report that the package we are submitting to the Senate today accomplishes all three of these main objectives of S. 1221 as introduced. I thank Senator Gorton and his colleague from Washington, Senator Murray, for their efforts, particularly Senator Gorton for his tremendous effort in finally reaching an agreement on this bill. For almost a decade now, he and I have had various disagreements on the Bering Sea pollock fishery and issues related to the Anti-Flagging Act. 
At the Commerce Committee hearing in March of this year, and later at an Appropriations Committee markup in July, Senator Gorton plainly expressed his concerns with my bill, S. 1221. In August, he spent considerable time with representatives from the Bering Sea pollock fishery and by sheer will managed to develop a framework upon which we could agree. After he presented the framework to me, we convened meetings of fishery representatives in September that literally went around the clock for 5 days. Those meetings included Bering Sea pollock fishery industry representatives, industry representatives from other North Pacific fisheries, the State of Alaska, North Pacific council members, National Marine Fisheries, the Coast Guard, the Maritime Administration, environmental representatives and staff for various Members of Congress and the Senate and House committees that have jurisdiction over this. 
At the end of those meetings, a consensus had been achieved among Bering Sea fishing representatives on an agreement to reduce capacity in the Bering Sea pollock fishery. For the next 3 weeks, we drafted legislation. We have spent considerable time with the fishing industry from other fisheries that were concerned about the possible impacts of the changes in the Bering Sea pollock fishery upon their areas in offshore fisheries. 
The legislation we are passing today includes many safeguards for those other fisheries and for the participants in those fisheries. By delaying implementation of some of the measures until January 1, 2000, it also provides the North Pacific Council and the Secretary of Commerce with sufficient time to develop safeguards for those other fisheries. 
This legislation is unprecedented in the 23 years since the enactment of what is now known as the Magnuson- Stevens Act. With the council system, congressional action of this type is not needed in Federal fisheries anymore. However, the mistakes in the Anti-Reflagging Act and the way it was interpreted created unique problems in the Bering Sea pollock fishery that only Congress can fix. The North Pacific Council does not have the authority to turn back the clock by removing fishery endorsements, to provide the funds required under the Federal Credit Reform Act to allow for the $75 million loan to remove the overcapacity in the area, and to strengthen the U.S.-control requirements for fishing vessels, to restrict Federal loans on large fishing vessels, and to do many other things we have agreed to do in this legislation. 
While S. 1221 as introduced was more modest in scope, I believe the measures in this agreement are fully justified as a one-time corrective measure for the negative effects of the Anti-Reflagging Act that I have mentioned before. 
There is also in this bill the Olympic and Amateur Sports Act Amendments of 1998. This legislation includes that bill, a bill that Senator Campbell joined me in cosponsoring to update the Federal charter for the U.S. Olympic Committee and the framework for Olympic and amateur sports in the United States. This framework is known as the Amateur Sports Act because most of its provisions were added by the Amateur Sports Act of 1978. 
The act gives the U.S. Olympic Committee certain trademark protections to raise money--and does not provide reappropriations--therefore, it does not come up for routine reauthorization. 
The Amateur Sports Act has not been amended since its comprehensive revision in 1978 which provided the foundation for the modern Olympic movement in the United States. The bill we are considering does not fundamentally change that act. Our review showed us it is fundamentally sound. 
We believe the modest changes that we ask the Senate and the Congress to make will ensure that the act serves the United States well into the 21st century. The significant changes which have occurred in the world of Olympic and amateur sports since 1978 warrant what I call fine-tuning of this act. 
Some of the developments of the past 20 years include, first, that the schedule for the Olympics and Winter Olympics has been alternated so games are held every 2 years instead of every 4--significantly increasing the workload of the U.S. Olympic Committee; second, that sports have begun to allow professional athletes to compete in some Olympic events; third, that even sports still considered `amateur' have athletes who with greater financial opportunities and professional responsibilities now compete more than we ever considered in 1978; 
 four, that the Paralympics--the Olympics for disabled amateur athletes--have grown significantly in size and prestige. 
These and other changes led me to call for a comprehensive review of the Amateur Sports Act in 1994. 
The Commerce Committee has held three hearings since then. 
At the first and second--on August 11, 1994 and October 18, 1995--witnesses identified where the Amateur Sports Act was showing signs of strain. 
We postponed our work until after the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, but on April 21, 1997, held a third hearing at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs to discuss solutions to the problems which had been identified. 
By January 1998, we'd refined the proposals into possible amendments to the Amateur Sports Act, which we discussed at length at an informal working session on January 26, 1998, in the Commerce Committee hearing room. 
The bill that Senator Campbell and I introduced in May reflected the comments received in January, and excluded proposals for which consensus appeared unachievable. 
With the help of the U.S. Olympic Committee, the Athletes Advisory Council, the National Governing Bodies' Council, numerous disabled sports organizations, and many others, we continued to fine tune the bill until it was approved by the Commerce Committee in July. 
I will include a longer summary of the bill for the Record, but will briefly explain its primary components:: (1) The bill would change the title of the underlying law to the `Olympic and Amateur Sports Act' to reflect that more than strictly amateurs are involved now, but without lessening the amateur and grass roots focus reflected in 
the title of the 1978 Act; (2) the bill would add a number of measures to strengthen the provisions which protect athletes' rights to compete; (3) it would add measures to improve the ability of the USOC to resolve disputes--particularly close the Olympics, Paralympics, or Pan-American Games--and reduce the legal costs and administrative burdens of the USOC; (4) it would add measures to fully incorporate the Paralympics into the Amateur Sports Act, and update the existing provisions affecting disabled athletes; (5) it would improve the notification requirements when an NGB has been put on probation or is being challenged; (6) it would increase the reporting requirements of the USOC and NGB with respect to sports opportunities for women, minorities, and disabled individuals; and (7) it would require the USOC to report back to Congress in 5 years with any additional changes that maybe needed to the act. 
Mr. President, I am the only Senator from President Ford's Commission on Amateur Sports who is still serving. 
It has therefore been very helpful to have Senator Campbell--an Olympian himself in 1964--involved in this process. He is a good friend. 
Over my objection, he attempted to have this package named after me--an honor that I have declined. 
There are many others who deserve recognition for their work to bring about the 1978 Act, and that continues to be the case. Specifically, I refer to my friend from Colorado, who has done a tremendous amount of work on this.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, let me mention one final section in the bill. We have had a lot of contention in conferences over the small fishing village of King Cove, which lies at the tip of the Alaskan peninsula, 625 miles southwest of Anchorage. It is exposed to the Pacific Ocean and the Bering Sea, and this community is often ravaged by 80-mile-per-hour winds, or more, and by driving sea winds. This extreme weather often shuts down access into or out of King Cove for days at a time. 
In an effort to improve King Cove's access to emergency medical facilities, I added language to the Interior appropriations bill that would grant a right-of-way from King Cove to the giant airport at Cold Bay. Mr. President, that road would have gone through a portion of the old army military base that is now known as Izembek Wildlife Refuge. This 30-mile road would have provided the cheapest and most reliable means of access to my constituents who live at King Cove. 
However, the administration raised environmental considerations regarding the wildlife refuge and refused to accept the provision that would authorize the road. 
After much discussion on a series of options being offered to us by the administration, we have crafted a compromise that provides for the health and safety of the Alaskan Native people of King Cove and still protects the refuge, as it was indicated that the administration believed that was its highest priority. 
This provision now provides King Cove Natives with the money to build a road from King Cove to a small lagoon some 20 miles away. There they will build a dock and use a small vessel to cross over the lagoon to property that they own adjacent to the runway at Cold Bay. The provision also provides funding to improve the airstrip at King Cove and for improvements to the health clinic at King Cove; namely, to put in state-of-the-art medical facilities and telemedicine capability there to protect our people until these transportation facilities are constructed. 
Mr. President, I will have other comments to make about this bill later. I have taken too long already.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments concerning Senator Byrd and myself. I do want to emphasize just a few things as we close. 
In this year, the Appropriations Committee has tried very hard to move forward as quickly as possible to get bills before the Senate as early as possible so that this would not happen. 
I wish to place in the Record a status of appropriations bills in the second session of this 105th Congress. It shows, and I have circled--and I hope in the Record they will highlight those dates circled--the days that the Appropriations Committee first brought to the Senate's attention its work product of the 13 subcommittees that deal with appropriations measures. They were all in June and July, with the exception of one bill, Labor, Health and Human Services, which was brought first to the Senate's attention on September 1 when we held the full committee meeting and reported the bill to the Senate on September 3. This was because of the illness of one of our colleagues. But all of these bills were available for the Senate to act on and for the Congress to act on very early. 
This also shows the action by the House committee under Chairman Livingston--probably one of the earliest periods in history when all of the bills were completed, except one to bring before the House, and the delay has not been the delay of the appropriations process; but it has been caused by the process of handling those bills once they were reported to the House and Senate. 
I decry the process also, as so many people have here today, but I am not ashamed of the work product. I have signed my name to the work product, as Chairman Livingston has, and a majority of both of our committees has endorsed these bills to be reported to the House and Senate. 
We are still the largest military power in the world, the last superpower in the world. We have added $7.5 billion so the men and women who serve us in uniform can be fully equipped, they can be assured we are trying to get them the best systems available, and we are doing our best to restore the lifestyle we believe a person should be able to lead in the uniform of the U.S. military. 
We have not been able to handle one basic problem, and that is the problem over the pension system. I hope that the Armed Services Committee early next year will address that problem and that we can present in the first bills brought out to the floor by the Appropriations Committees money to fund the restoration of a pension system that is adequate and is an incentive to people to stay in uniform and particularly to use the skills they have developed as members of the armed services in our defense. 
Mr. President, this is a good bill. I know a lot of people are going to vote against it for one reason or another, but I hope that the public understands, while this is the largest bill to ever be presented, it is large because it contains eight separate bills plus three supplemental appropriations bills. It contains really 11 appropriations bills. The total adds up to almost $1/2 trillion. It is large in the sense of spending, but we do spend a lot of money as a large Government, and we have kept these bills to the minimum in terms of the appropriations process. These negotiations that we have been talking about added $20 billion to that total--plus $20 billion. 
I do believe that the bill is a good one, and I urge our colleagues tomorrow to vote for it.

Mr. STEVENS. I would like to ask the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works a question regarding S. 2364, the Economic Development Administration Reform Act, which passed the Senate on Monday. As they are aware, the State of Alaska, while rich in resources, also has communities that suffer serious economic distress. EDA assistance can make a difference to many of these communities. Thus I am pleased to support the efforts of my friends to reauthorize this important agency; and indeed, I am a cosponsor of this bill. 
Let me ask specifically about an issue that is very important to Alaskans, especially those in Southeast Alaska. Under this bill, EDA programs are available to aid distressed communities with both public works and economic adjustment assistance. In Southeast Alaska, many communities have faced economic adjustment problems, such as high unemployment, as a result of Federal regulatory changes with regard to timber harvests. If these communities meet the definition of `distressed' as outlined in the bill, would a situation such as theirs qualify as eligible for EDA assistance?

Could my colleagues tell me whether EDA has flexibility in applying this criterion to areas--such as these timber-affected Alaskan communities--that are requesting EDA assistance?

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I take a moment to honor Dave Rose, an Alaskan who has dedicated his life to public service. This weekend the American Diabetes Association (Alaska area) is honoring Dave for his leadership in raising funds to combat this disease. He will be the first recipient of the `Golden Rose Award' honoring his commitment in the fight against diabetes. 
Dave has diabetes, but he hasn't let the disease slow him down. Even with impaired vision and regular dialysis treatments, he has been a tireless fund raiser, spokesman, and volunteer organizer. When Dave isn't working to help combat diabetes he lends his time to a whole host of causes including the Anchorage Concert Association Foundation, the Alaska Pacific University Foundation, the Alaska Federation of Natives Sobriety Foundation, and the Alaska Community Foundation. Dave and his wife Fran also have their own foundation which distributes funds to arts, health, and higher education programs. 
Dave's leadership in Alaska goes beyond the philanthropic. After a distinguished career in the Army, he spent many years on the Anchorage Assembly. He also shepherded Alaska's permanent fund from a fledgling portfolio to the multi-billion dollar account which stands as a rainy day fund for the time when Alaska's oil revenues decline dramatically. 
Dave's optimism, his love of people, and his willingness to share his talents for the betterment of others deserves our recognition. Alaska is a better place for Dave's dedication and commitment.

Does he know the State study also said the best option to solve this problem is, in fact, the road that I want to discuss?

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas wants 2 minutes. Please inform when I have used 3 minutes. 
It is my privilege to present to the Senate this fiscal year 1999 Department of Defense Appropriations Act. I am especially pleased to present the bill with the full bipartisan support of the conferees on the bill and in partnership with my good friend, the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye. 
Unlike the previous 3 years, the bill before the Senate matches the budget request levels sought by the President for 1999. Pursuant to the bipartisan budget agreement reached last year, we live within the budget authority and outlay limits on defense spending. 
It is my judgment, though, that the levels set last year do not adequately fund readiness, quality of life, modernization, and the needs of our Armed Forces. I will be speaking more on that today. 
The conference report before the Senate places a clear premium on meeting the personnel and readiness needs of the military. The bill provides the 3.6-percent pay increase for all uniformed personnel. The bill also increases funding for urgent operation and maintenance requirements for the military services. 
The conferees on the bill also worked to address the top modernization priorities established by the service chiefs. The conferees did not solve funding challenges presented by the budget caps by taking large general reductions to procurement and research accounts. 
Tough decisions were made on each program. Very few programs, Mr. President, were funded at the full House or Senate level. Where there was a difference, we sought to find a compromise between the House and Senate spending accounts. 
One very important provision of the bill was offered in the Senate by Senator Roberts. That is on the prospect of deploying U.S. troops to Kosovo. Following consultations with Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs Chairman General Shelton, the conferees modified the provision to focus attention on any additional deployment of U.S. troops to Yugoslavia--which does include Kosovo--Albania and Macedonia. 
This reporting requirement, related to the introduction of ground troop units, does not apply forces introduced in accordance with U.N. Security Council 795 or other circumstances determined by the President to be an emergency necessitating the immediate deployment of forces. 
In addition, the conferees added language making clear nothing in this section shall be deemed to restrict the authority of the President under the Constitution to protect the lives of U.S. citizens. 
I again commend Senator Roberts for this initiative and believe the modifications included in the bill are consistent with past requirements enacted concerning the deployment of U.S. forces in this region. It will be very important in connection with any potential deployment to Kosovo. 
As I noted earlier, there is not enough money for defense in this bill, Mr. President. We recently received a letter from the President identifying the need for additional funds for 1999. The Armed Services Committee today is hearing testimony on this issue from the service chiefs. 
It is my intention to recommend to the Senate that additional funds be provided in the emergency supplemental bill for readiness, counterterrorism, the war on drugs, and intelligence needs. 
Our committee will work with the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs to ensure we meet the needs they present to Congress. 
Mr. President, let me close by recognizing the excellent work undertaken by our colleagues in the House, Chairman Bill Young and Representative Jack Murtha. 
The four of us have been handling these defense bills for several years now, and it is truly a pleasure to work with them each year on this bill.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President. My colleague from Alaska is correct. The Committee believes that it is important for Congress to be fully and currently informed on the military balance in the tense Taiwan Strait, as Congress directed in the Taiwan Relations Act. The Committee expects the report to detail recent additions to the offensive military capabilities of the People's Republic of China, as well as new challenges to the deterrent forces of the Republic of China on Taiwan. This report should carefully examine the balance as it exists today, as it may exist in the future, given expected procurement programs, as well as comparing the balance with the situation that existed in 1979, when Congress adopted the Taiwan Relations Act.

I, too, have been very supportive of the Navy Theater Wide program and will work closely with him to ensure that the entire system, including the radar, is developed on schedule. I fully support the conference's decision to provide $28 million for Radar Improvements Competition in Fiscal Year 1999 and I encourage the Navy to factor the radar development into their overall plan for Navy Theater Wide development and fielding.

It is my understanding that the time for making remarks will follow the vote on the bill. So there will occur a vote on this bill immediately. Following that vote, the Senate will hear remarks concerning the distinguished Senator from Kentucky and, following that, any legislative or executive items cleared for action, including the Internet tax bill if an agreement can be reached today. 
As a reminder to all Members, a cloture motion was filed yesterday on the so-called vacancies bill. Therefore, Members have until 1 p.m. today to file first-degree amendments. The cloture vote has been scheduled to occur at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, September 28.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is the Wendell Ford National Air Transportation System Improvement Act, as Chairman McCain just pointed out. 
I see my good friend from Kentucky is here. I think that this is an act that should be named after the Senator from Kentucky because of his long service on the Commerce Committee and particularly on the Aviation Subcommittee. 
Our Nation has come through a very interesting period during the time that Wendell Ford has been Senator from Kentucky--a total revolution in aviation and a concentration on safety and improvement of our airway system. 
Wendell Ford has been a leader in that effort. This bill signifies the totality of what he has done for the aviation community. 
I come to the floor today, because, as I believe most Members of the Senate know, Alaska is completely dependent upon air transportation. 
Over 70 percent of our communities can only be reached by air year-round. We believe in the safety of that system. 
I have been pleased to have the honor to be able to work with the Senator from Kentucky on a whole series of matters dealing with operations, with safety, and with the maintenance of the airways system, and in particularly with the development of air transportation facilities on the ground. 
As you go throughout this country and go to these major new terminals, you should think of Wendell Ford, because he has led us, through the period when he was chairman of the Aviation Subcommittee, and during the period when he has been ranking member of that subcommittee, to an understanding of what is 
necessary to keep the lead that we have as a nation in aviation. 
I come to the floor to thank my good friend for all he as done for us and for the Nation, but particularly to thank him on behalf of all of us in Alaska who rely so much on this system that he has improved and made more safe. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.

Mr. STEVENS. The last time Congress enacted legislation on the overflights matter was in the 100th Congress under Public Law 100-91 (101 Stat. 674 et seq.). Prior to enactment, this legislation was reviewed by both the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Senate Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation. As a Commerce Committee member then and now, I would like to discuss P.L. 1001-91. 
Under P.L. 100-91, Congress mandated a study by the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, to determine the impacts that overflights of aircraft have on park unit resources. Section 1(c) expressly excluded all National Park System units in Alaska from the research and the study. In a hearing held during the 105th Congress on S. 268, the park overflights bill that ultimately became Title VII of S. 2279, the National Park Service testified that Alaska parks were not a part of the study commissioned in 1987 and completed in 1995. Therefore, that study mandated by Congress did not provide a basis for applying S. 2279's park overflights provisions to Alaska.

I come to the floor to congratulate him and the other members of his committee for the action they are taking tonight to recognize the continuing support of the Congress for the determination by the people of Puerto Rico of what their future status should be. 
The first resolution dealing with Alaska was introduced in the Congress in 1913. Final action on statehood for Alaska took place in 1958. We became a State in 1959, as Senator Murkowski said. It is a long process to seek to change the political status of a portion of the United States, and Puerto Rico is a portion of our country. Its people really deserve the opportunity to express themselves on what their future should be. 
So my congratulations to everyone for moving this resolution forward. I hope the day will come when I am still in the Senate that we can vote on statehood for Puerto Rico.

If we retreat from the vote that we achieved last spring, I think we will send a terrible message to the world at a time when we should be viewed as a leader in trying to restore the economies of the world. 
So I hope this Senate will vote once again to support, providing the additional funding for the IMF that it needs, and that we will insist that we achieve the agreement of the House on this provision that is in the bill. 
This is not the time for us to change our minds. This is a time to show the strong will of the Senate, that the United States remains clear in its objectives to assure that there are mechanisms to deal with international crises such as so many of our global trading partners face today. 
I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his leadership. As a matter of fact, I thank all of those who come from the Agriculture Committee; they have been very forthright and direct in supporting the proper position on the IMF. I thank the Chair and the Senator from Nebraska.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senate begins consideration today of the 1999 Defense appropriations bill, to fund the military activities of the Department of Defense for the upcoming fiscal year. 
This bill provides $250.5 billion in new budget authority for 1999, an increase of $2.8 billion over the amount appropriated in 1998. 
The committee reported this bill on June 4th. Unforeseen circumstances delayed the consideration of the bill, but I believe it is vital that we pass the Defense funding bill prior to the recess. 
The military must know how much money it will have to meet critical operational and modernization requirements at the beginning of the fiscal year, October 1. 
Fiscal year 1999 represents the first budget cycle under the 5 year bipartisan budget agreement--the amount requested by the President corresponds to the cap agreed to for Defense. 
That results in a fundamentally different dynamic for balancing this bill compared to fiscal years 1996, 1997 and 1998. 
For the previous three fiscal years, Congress and the White House were at odds over the total level of funding for Defense. The budget submitted by the Pentagon failed to fully accommodate the readiness and modernization priorities of the Joint Chiefs. 
For 1999, the committee received a budget proposal consistent with the bi-partisan budget agreement--not enough for Defense, but at the level agreed to last summer at the summit. 
The content of that budget reflected the priorities and strategy of the Quadrennial Defense Review, submitted by Secretary Cohen and Gen. Joe Ralston last spring. The FY 1999 budget kept faith with the concepts and priorities advocated in the QDR. 
I want to begin by commending Secretary Cohen and Deputy Secretary John Hamre for their efforts to present a budget that did not require a major overhaul by Congress. 
We do not agree on every item, and fact of life events resulted in adjustments on many programs, but essentially, this budget request meets the minimum needs of the Armed Forces. 
The recommendations from the committee focus on three goals: ensure an adequate quality of life for the men and women of the Armed Forces; sustain readiness; and modernize to assure future battlefield dominance by our Armed Forces, if needed. 
To achieve needed quality of life for our troops, and their families, this bill fully funds the 3.1 percent authorized military pay raise. 
During consideration of the DOD authorization bill in June, I joined the managers of that bill in co-sponsoring an amendment to increase the pay raise to 3.6 percent for 1999. 
The first amendment that Senator Inouye and I will jointly offer to this bill will provide the additional appropriation for the 3.6 percent raise. 
Additionally, the Treasury-General Government bill that we will pass later today provides a comparable pay raise for civilian Pentagon workers. Those amounts are funded from within the general operation and maintenance appropriations. 
The pay raise solves only a part of the compensation crisis facing the Department of Defense. 
My discussions with the service chiefs, the service secretaries, field commanders and the men and women of the Armed Forces, serving in my State of Alaska and around the world, lead me to conclude that an equally pressing challenge is retirement pay. 
The changes adopted by Congress in 1986 reflected the cold war priority of attracting men and women to serve a full 30 year career in the Armed Forces. 
Our victory in the cold war led to a wrenching realignment of the force, and radical new personnel priorities. 
There is great pressure today for individuals to spend only 20 years in active service. The revised retirement plan puts them at an unfair, and unacceptable disadvantage, as compared to serving a full 30 years. 
It is my intention to work with the leaders here in Congress, and with the Secretary of Defense, to put us on a track to fix the retirement system--in my mind, there is no higher defense funding priority, for it has led to a series of decisions by men and women in the services, not to continue because of their feeling about the unfairness of the retirement policies. 
The considerable operational demands on our Armed Forces dictate that we also ensure the welfare and quality of life for those on active duty now. 
Based on the committee's recent trip to Bosnia and Southwest Asia, a new $50 million MWR and retention initiative is included in this bill. 
These funds will provide added resources and flexibility to address the though living conditions and family separation challenges of deployments to Bosnia and Southwest Asia. 
More than $100 million is added for quality of life enhancements in the service O&M accounts, to upgrade barracks, dormitories, and other personnel support facilities. 
Our second focus, maintaining readiness, has been stressed by overseas deployments during the past three years. 
For 1998, this committee succeeded in providing needed contingency funds as an emergency, without disrupting other Defense programs. 
For 1999, the recommendation adds funds for flying hours, depot maintenance, training, and base operations. 
We recommend savings resulting from changed economic factors, such as fuel costs, foreign currency, and inflation--but restore all those amounts to the O&M appropriations. 
There is no option to trade near term readiness for future modernization. As long as our Armed Forces face the range of missions overseas underway today, we must sustain the O&M accounts at least at the levels provided in this bill, and the House bill. 
No sector of Defense has suffered more the past few years than acquisition. We must invest more to protect the technological superiority that our smaller military force counts on. 
These recommendations fully fund the combat priorities advocated by the Joint Chiefs: F-22, the Crusader, F-18, new attack submarine, the JASSM missile, V-22, and national missile defense. 
In many instances, the recommendations add funds for technology development programs, to look even further down the road, past the systems we will deploy over the next ten years--out for the next thirty years. 
Achieving these three priorities was especially challenging given our fixed budget caps. 
Every dollar shifted among programs came from a reduction to an item in the budget request--there were no additional dollars to spend this year for Defense. 
Senator Inouye and I sought to allocate the resources available to the subcommittee as equitably as possible, and consistent with the military needs identified by the Chiefs. 
In most cases, we could not provide large increases in existing procurement programs, or to restore programs already terminated. 
No member of this committee, or the Senate, secured every priority which he or she advocated to the committee. On the other hand, we reviewed all of them, and have done our best. 
I believe the recommendations are fair and achieve a balance between the budget and the priorities of Congress. It is my intention to do everything we can to work with all of our colleagues to meet the needs they have brought to the Committee. 
Finally, there is one notable change from the bill reported last year by this Committee--in the area of medical research. 
In the bill we reported last year, we provided $176 million for medical research. Coming out of conference, that total grew to $344 million, almost twice the level of the Senate. 
In the context of adding $6 billion to the budget, that total was manageable. 
Let me explain that again. Last year, we had an additional $6 billion by the time we came out of the conference, and it was possible to increase that amount. This year, we have no top line margin to allocate. Whatever is added to this bill will come out of either readiness, or future acquisition, or the quality of life concepts that I have discussed. 
For 1999, Senator Inouye and I recommended a new appropriations of $250 million in the defense health program for medical research grants. 
This increase over last year's appropriation provides adequate resources to sustain growth in the breast cancer and prostate cancer programs, while enabling the Department of review other research programs and opportunities. The report lists all the programs seeking funding this year. 
The bill establishes a floor for breast cancer and prostate cancer research 
at the minimum; at least they must be provided at the level that we finally agreed to in conference in 1998. 
The bill also seeks to address the funding priorities of the National Guard. In testimony before the subcommittee, the Army Guard identified as shortfall for 1999 $634 million for their operational requirements--not for future involvement for just their operational requirements. 
The bill reported by the committee provides an additional $20 million for the Guard counterdrug operation, $225 million for the Army Guard O&M account, and $95 million for Army Guard personnel account. 
A total of $475 million will be added to the National Guard and Reserve equipment. That is a cut, however, of 25 percent from the level appropriated in 1998. 
Finally, the bill reported by the committee did not include the $1.9 billion requested by the President as emergency spending for Bosnia. 
The Senate considered several amendments during debate on the defense authorization bill concerning our future force levels and operations in Bosnia. 
Later this morning, I know Senator Hutchison, Senator Byrd, and others will raise at least one amendment related to our presence in Bosnia. 
At the time we considered this bill in the Appropriations Committee, it was premature for this committee to consider funding for that mission for 1999. 
Based on our visit to Bosnia in May, and to NATO headquarters after that, it is clear that a long-term presence in Bosnia is envisioned by NATO and the administration. 
That long-term role cannot in the future be funded on an annual emergency basis. The Congress must be part of the decision on the size of the force, the duration of the mission, and the cost of the operations. 
Mr. President, we bring this bill to the Senate with the hope of commencing the August recess tomorrow. Securing passage of this bill at a reasonable hour will require the cooperation, consideration, and assistance of every Senator. 
It is my hope that we will obtain early today an agreement to have all amendments filed at the desk so we can most efficiently dispose of those amendments--accepting some, debating some, and encouraging Members not to raise others. 
This bill has been available to all Members since June 5. The bill closely approximates the level authorized in the defense bill we passed last June. 
That authorization bill is in conference with the House, and we have continued to work closely with Senator Thurmond, Senator Levin, and others on that committee to support the priorities passed by the Senate in that bill. 
Mr. President, the presentation of this bill to the Senate would not be possible without the leadership and partnership that I have enjoyed with my friend from Hawaii, Senator Inouye. 
This is the tenth year that the two of us have come to the Senate jointly to present and recommend the defense appropriations bills. Six of those years Senator Inouye served as chairman, and I have enjoyed that privilege for the past four. 
It is a pleasure and a privilege to work with the Senator from Hawaii on defense matters and other matters. I enjoy our personal friendship. And the opportunity to bring this bill to the Senate on a full bipartisan basis is one that I think comes from the tie between us that we enjoy. 
Mr. President, I yield to Senator Inouye for his statement.  
Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I reciprocate in thanking my good friend for his comments. It is interesting when we reflect back on World War II. We as a nation knew who we were, what we were doing, and we had unanimous support for what we were doing. Today, each of us faces comments from time to time about our commitment to defense and questions of whether we could not cut this budget. If anything, we should have a great deal more money. I shall speak to the Senate later about that during the consideration of this bill. 
Let me point out to Members of the Senate that we have knowledge of 46 amendments on this bill. We have reviewed them with our staff and with the staff of those who will present those amendments, and 23 of them we are prepared to accept. Of the balance, 13 of them we have not seen. It would be very helpful if Members will bring their amendments to us so that we can look at them and determine whether or not we can work with the person who wishes to present the amendment and accept it or modify it in a way that it becomes acceptable. I expect we will have some substantial votes today and into the night. But it will be much easier for all of us if we can see these amendments and we can try to find some way to accommodate the needs of the Senate and the demand of our defense spending with the individual desires of Members of the Senate.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment will raise the military pay to 3.6 percent. This pay raise will add $185 million to the Active Forces, Guard, and Reserve pay accounts. Over the last year, our committee has heard repeatedly in both hearings with the service chiefs and during field visits to Bosnia, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Alaska, and other places throughout the world that our military members perceive an erosion of existing benefits. This adjustment in pay matches the private sector wage growth at a time when many service members are questioning the value of continued service due to an increasing pace of deployments. 
Some economists estimate that the pay gap between the private sector and the military may be as high as 13.5 percent. This amendment will, at a minimum, provide a fairer base for military pay raises in the future. 
I ask if my friend has any comments to make in regard to this amendment. He is a cosponsor.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I commend Senator Roberts. He is following the path that he followed last year. The Senate adopted his amendment that he presented last year, which has had a salutary effect on the considerations involved in Bosnia. And we will soon have announced the basic reduction in forces in Bosnia, brought about in many ways because of the study that Senator Roberts' amendment last year mandated. 
I have reviewed this with my friend from Hawaii. And I note that he has put in even another provision this year that recognizes that there might be an emergency that would be such where the President would not have time to prepare the report that is listed. I think that is very wise to offer that flexibility to the administration. 
I am prepared to accept this amendment. I ask the Senator from Hawaii what his views would be concerning Senator Roberts' amendment?

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on another subject, time will expire at 2 o'clock on the items to be voted on included in the Treasury and general government operations bill. I offered amendment No. 3385 regarding recomputation of some Federal annuities. I point out that this option is not mandatory. The only way future retired employees can take advantage of this provision is if they make a payment into the Federal retirement system. 
Several times in recent years, Congress has denied COLA adjustments for Federal employees. In some years, only Members of Congress were denied COLAs. In other years, other employees were affected. 
My amendment provides that Federal employees covered by the Civil Service Retirement System and the Federal Employees Retirement System who did not receive automatic pay adjustments because of an act of Congress may, upon retirement, have their high-three salary recomputed as if they received the COLAs provided to annuitants. 
This option cannot be exercised until the covered employee pays into the Civil Service Retirement Fund the amounts required by the amendment; namely, the contributions to the retirement fund the employee would have made if the employee had received the annuitant COLA. 
It is really a fairness issue, to me. I am most concerned about survivors. Currently, 26 percent of all those who receive Federal annuities are survivors and the median time for a survivor annuity is just over 12 years. Survivors live on 55 percent of the employee's annuity. But, Mr. President, when an employee does not receive a COLA received by retired annuitants--and I point out that in almost every year, the retired annuitant, the people retired, have received the COLAs--then it simply means that survivors of retired employees receive greater annuities, greater compensation than those received by survivors of employees who continued to serve during the period when Congress denied COLAs to current Members and employees. 
I believe the right thing to do is to adopt this concept. It allows the employee or the survivor of the employee who has passed on to ask for recomputation of the high-three concept based upon an assumption that the retiree had received the cost-of-living adjustments that were given to retired annuitants in the period when those were denied to Congress or other Federal employees. 
I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment. I will have a minute to talk about it when the amendment comes up for a vote, as we start voting at 2 o'clock. I wanted this in the Record at this point. 
I thank the Chair.

Senator Byrd told me once that to have a grandchild is to touch infinity. And it is a very sobering thing to think about. But it is a joy to have these grandchildren.

It would move that money into the National Guard. We have already increased the National Guard by more than $500 million above the budget request. So that approval of the National Guard Adjutants is a facade. This is to kill the F-18. I urge that the Senate support my motion to table.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to inform the Senate that tomorrow there will be another funeral. It is the funeral for Officer Chestnut. The agreement today was we would not have any votes until 1 p.m. Then we made that 2 p.m. because of the Intelligence Committee meeting. But we are going to have the same agreement now that we will not vote on the amendments that we take up later this evening until tomorrow at 1 p.m. 
I am soon going to seek agreement that all amendments will have to be debated tonight, and we will start voting tomorrow at 1 p.m. on those that require a vote. We will have taken over half--we have agreed to take over half the amendments we know of now, and we very soon hope to be able to know what amendments there are, but we will work out that time agreement. 
I think Senators should realize that without regard to anything else we do now, we are going to be here tomorrow, and we are going to start voting at 1 o'clock and not before. The alternative is if we get through these--we might be able to get through them tonight if Senators want to do that and be finished tonight. But we can't do that unless we see the amendments. 
Now, I have asked two or three times for an agreement that Senators bring amendments through, that we have a time limit on when they must be disclosed, and we will try that again after the next vote. But we have to have some certainty. If Senators want to, we are going to be here until Sunday, because I will never, never allow a defense bill to hang over a recess. It just will not do. And I think anybody who understands defense understands it cannot happen. So we are going to finish this bill tonight or tomorrow or Saturday or Sunday. My plane doesn't leave until Monday.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are proceeding now to a look at the amendments that are not in the managers' package. I would like to address that issue with the Senate. 
It is my understanding that Senator Baucus has an amendment that he wishes to have 20 minutes equally divided; Senator Bingaman has two amendments; Senator Boxer's amendment that was on the list is in the managers' package; Senator Bumpers' amendment is on the list in the managers' package; Senator Byrd has two amendments which are to be in the managers' package; Senator Daschle's relevant amendments are withdrawn, as I understand it; Senator Dodd has one amendment dealing with Army pensions which we have not seen; Senator Durbin's amendment on land conveyance is in the package; his amendment on military operations and war powers will be opposed and we will have to deal with it; Senator Dorgan's amendment on Indian incentive program is in the package, and I understand his second amendment will not be offered; Senator Ford's amendment on National Symphony is not in the package and would have to be debated; Senator Graham has a land transfer amendment which is in the package now, and the space amendment, as I understand it, is the same as the amendment from Senator Mack, and that will have to be debated; Senator Harkin has the outlay amendment, and the POO amendment is in the package, the vets medals amendment we have not seen and we cannot discuss now; Senator Hollings' amendment will be accepted; Senator Inouye's manager's amendment is in the managers' package; Senator Kerrey's SOS payroll tax amendment cannot be accepted and will have to be debated; there are two relevant amendments by Senator Kerry which we have not seen; Senator Leahy's amendment cannot be accepted; Senator Reed's amendment we have not seen; and Senator Robb's amendment on reimbursement we would like to discuss with Senator Robb--it is in the House bill; we prefer not to take it up at this time if we can avoid it--and Senator Wellstone's amendment on child soldiers has been accepted, the domestic violence one has not been agreed to yet--we will have to discuss it with them. 
Those are the amendments on the Democratic side.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I say with regard to the unresolved issues: We ask Senator DeWine or his staff to show us the drug interdiction amendment; the D'Amato Serbia amendment; the two Coats amendments on SOS, and the next QDR, so that we can proceed to review those. 
Similarly, we have a series on the Democratic side that we have not seen, and I urge that we see those: the Dodd Army pension issues; the Harkin vets' meals issue. Other than that, I believe we have seen them all. 
I might state, it appears that the one amendment that will take the longest time to dispose of is Senator Durbin's amendment, and I see he is here. I invite him to offer his amendment so that we might determine how to handle it. 
Is the Senator prepared to suggest any kind of a time arrangement with regard to that? We would like to have a vote sometime around 8 o'clock, to make sure people understand we are going to stay here until we get done.

Mr. STEVENS. I say to the Senator, I have talked with Senator Byrd. We are perfectly prepared to have him continue to take time. 
Under a unanimous consent agreement, at 8 o'clock we have Senators coming back to vote, and hopefully we can vote at approximately that time. I don't know how long my good friend is going to speak, but I will limit the amount of time spent in opposition. We will just make the motion to table when the time comes. We do not want to extend it now. We are going to have to be here until 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning as it is, so I object to any further change in this time agreement, and I urge my good friend from West Virginia to make his statement. He knows we will accommodate him with such time as he needs. But let's not change the time agreement yet.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is my understanding when the Senator returns to the floor, Senator Byrd will speak. I state to the Senate, there is substantial opposition to this amendment. I am one who voted against the War Powers Act, but I think this goes too far. It is an amendment that should be considered by the Armed Services Committee and not debated at the last minute on an appropriations bill. 
In the old days, we had a point of order against legislation on an appropriations bill. This is purely legislation on an appropriations bill. That point of order is not available to us now, but the concept is still there, and that is what we are trying to establish once again--the concept that we limit this to relevant amendments to the provisions of this bill that regard spending of money for our defense in the fiscal year 1999. 
This is a provision that is ongoing for years. It is not related to this bill. It is not a matter that was before the Senate Appropriations Committee in any way, and it should be part of the Armed Services' consideration. There was an Armed Services bill brought before us before. It would have been perfectly proper to have that brought up at that time in connection with the Armed Services' bill. But I do not think it is proper to bring it up in this bill. 
For that reason, as I said before, when the time for Senator Byrd has expired, I intend to move to table the amendment. But, as I indicated to him, I offer him the full amount of time that was allocated to this side to present his statement, plus what is left to the Senator from Illinois.  
Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I just conferred with Mr. Cortese, the staff director. I am told that we have but one other Senator who has indicated an intention to debate an amendment tonight. We are working now on the remainder of the second managers' package which we should be able to present to the Senate in about 10 to 15 minutes. I ask the cloakrooms to send out notice to Senators that after presentation of that second managers' amendment, I shall move to go to third reading, unless Senators who have amendments on this list come forth to debate them. 
We have a very serious situation tomorrow morning. Many Senators told me they want to go to the second funeral of our deceased friend, the officer who was killed in the line of duty. That means we cannot commence voting until 1 o'clock. 
We have accepted a great many of these amendments and are prepared to accept them. If Senators want to know whether that is the case, I urge them to come and review the managers' package. 
I will not indicate the name of the Senator who we think wants to debate the amendment, because he may not want to debate it. If no one comes after the motion to table the Durbin amendment to present an amendment, I shall move to go to third reading. It is a debatable motion, and we may have some debate on that. I recall my good friend from West Virginia taught me how to do that, Mr. President. So we are going to proceed along that line. I ask my friend from Hawaii if he knows of any amendments or any matter to take up at this time.

I add to that amendment the following amendments: the Bingaman amendment on donation of surplus dental equipment; the Bingaman amendment on furnishing of dental care to dependents; the Dodd amendment on retired pay backlog; the Harkin amendment on backlog of medals; the Harkin amendment on smoking cessation; the Frist amendment on Marine Corps lightweight maintenance enclosures; the Dorgan amendment on environmental cleanup; the DeWine amendment on drug interdiction; the Wellstone amendment on family violence.

Like you, I am dismayed that the Department has failed to make available to PFNA the $3 million appropriated by Congress in FY 1998 and so far has demonstrated an unwillingness to carry out the PFNA test program according to congressional intent. It is the clear expectation of this Senator, and the Committee as a whole, that the Department will place no further obstacles in the path of a meaningful PFNA field test program.

Mr. STEVENS. I am familiar with that legislation and fully support its adoption. In closing out its operations and responsibilities on Adak I understand the Navy wishes to transfer from Navy ownership as much as the base as possible; this includes both facilities that have foreseeable reuse and those that do not. Many of the moth-balled buildings on Adak were constructed before restrictions were imposed on the use of asbestos and lead paint. The environmental conditions at Adak, to which anyone who has visited there can attest, take a hard and quick toll on buildings and other facilities, especially those that are unused and not maintained. The Committee has included $15 million to resolve potential environmental hazards from deteriorating facilities. This funding will help to protect those who move to Adak to participate in its economic revitalization.

I had no intention of interrupting him. I know he intended to make his speech. I assured him that he would have the time to make the speech that he wished. We had entered into an agreement concerning a time limit on the amendment of the Senator from Illinois. 
I deeply regret the misunderstanding that occurred. I know my good friend from West Virginia has a long and serious speech to make about the war powers and the amendment that was offered by the Senator from Illinois concerning the power of Congress to declare war.

<TEXT>
Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have had a series of visits with the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I particularly recall the discussion I had with Secretary of the Navy John Dalton and with Admiral Johnson. There is no question that the Navy representatives have informed our committee that full F/A-18E/F funding is the administration's top appropriations priority for defense and the Navy. 
This amendment would take these funds from that priority, the F/A-18E/F, and move it to the National Guard. 
We have added, as I stated this morning, $95 million to augment the Guard and Reserve personnel accounts. 
We have added for the Guard and Reserve operation and maintenance funds an additional $225 million. 
Finally, we added $450 million to the Guard and Reserve procurement account. 
I have to tell the Senator we have exceeded the requests in many instances. We added almost $1 billion in the zero sum budget for the Guard and Reserve priorities. 
Furthermore, the F/A/-18E/F is just entering production. The Senator's amendment will seriously disrupt the production program, and substantially increase the unit cost, if the Senate approves this amendment. To me it does not make common sense to increase the cost of the F-18, the Navy's top priority planes which we must buy to meet the Navy's previously approved program requirements. We have helped the Guard and Reserve. I do not think we should punish the Navy in order to help them any more. 
If the Senator wishes to make any comments, I yield to him for those comments. 
I intend to make a motion to table his amendment. But before I do that, I ask unanimous consent that, on any votes that are laid aside in order to join the priority list that is already in existence under the Guard and Reserve the common procedure of a minute on each side be the procedure for this bill: That there be 2 minutes equally divided on any vote that occurs on this bill on an amendment that is set aside for a later time.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, before I respond, I again would like to request Senators to come forward, and let us see their amendments. 
Earlier today I said of the 46--it is now 47 amendments that we know of--that we had agreed to accept 23 of them. 
My staff informs me that the difficulty is we can't accept them because we haven't seen the final version of them. We hope that those will be produced here so we can dispose of the amendments that we are willing to accept expeditiously with very short comments from Members. 
We are going to have over 50 amendments. We are going to finish this bill by tomorrow. I advise Members and staff to 
start bringing in cots for people to rest on tonight unless we get through them very quickly. 
Mr. President, I have to confess to my friends, both of them who have spoken in favor of this amendment, that this Senator is at a loss to understand section 9012, which says that no funds can be used to pay the travel expenses and per diem for the participation in conferences, exchanges, programs, et cetera, of any national from the People's Republic of China who is the head or political secretary of any Chinese Government-created or approved organization. And it lists the Chinese Buddhist Association, the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, the National Congress of Catholic Representatives, the Chinese Catholic Bishops' Conference, the Chinese Protestant Three-Self Patriotic Movement, the China Christian Council, the Chinese Taoist Association, the Chinese Islamic Association, and then a series of civilian and military officials and employees of Government to carry out the specific policies that are listed, such as promoting or participating in policies or practices which hinder religious activities, or the free expression of religious beliefs. 
I am at a loss to understand that section. Perhaps the Senator would explain that to me.

Mr. STEVENS. I am sad to say to my friend I don't understand that section to have that limitation, but, in any event, it is a very controversial subject to be added to the Defense appropriations bill. In conferring with Members yesterday, it was the position that we took at the time that we were going to do our utmost to keep controversial subjects that would lead to extended debate off of this bill. The only way to do that is, once we have had a short explanation of it in courtesy to the presenting Senator, it was going to be my intention to move to table any such amendment, not just this one but any such amendment. 
Therefore, on the basis of the policy that we have announced, I move to table the Senator's amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I keep asking and requesting that Members come forward with these amendments. I have asked now the leadership to clear a unanimous consent request that all amendments have to be filed by 4. I know it is not cleared yet, but I am again requesting that and letting people know somehow or other we are going to get these amendments. It may be that I will just have to move to go to third reading, we will have a vote to go to third reading and cut them all off. 
For those people who want to go home, I will give them an avenue to get home, and that is let's just vote on this bill. But if people won't bring the amendments to us, we are going to have to take some drastic steps here to limit the number of amendments we can consider. I know that it is an extraordinary procedure, but these are extraordinary times. I would like at least to have the amendments we have said we would accept. Twenty-three Members out there with amendments I said we would accept, and they have not brought them over. I plead with the Senate to think about proceeding with this bill. 
Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, one of the most significant economic problems facing Alaska is the underdevelopment of the business sector in our rural areas. Alaska's vast size, lack of highway infrastructure, and numerous small, remote communities present unique problems requiring unique solutions. If we want to empower people to move from assistance to self-sufficiency we have to grow small businesses in rural Alaska. During the conference on the Commerce, Justice and State appropriations bill, I will ask the conferees to address these issues. 
Specifically, my State is suffering from an acute shortage of technical assistance funding to provide training and other services specific to rural needs. This is a need that can be satisfied under SBA's 7(j) program. Additionally, I am informed that regulations promulgated in 1995 have virtually eliminated all small business lending by banks and other financial institutions in Alaska under SBA's 7(a) lending program. Before 1995, the 7(a) program provided critical financing in rural Alaska, and I intend to explore ways to make the program viable once again in Alaska. Finally, Alaska's size and remoteness will require SBA to adopt high-tech solutions to facilitate service delivery. I will seek to create an electronic assistance center within the SBA specifically designed to provide Internet connectivity, outreach and training to rural areas specifically in Alaska. 
I look forward to working with Senator Gregg and his staff and others on this issue. It will be within the scope of the conference, I believe.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am saddened to have to attempt this, but I want to state to the Senate that it is to me a watershed issue now for this year. This bill really is going to go into serious gyrations if the Lugar amendment is adopted. In the first place, if it goes to the House with this amendment, it means an entirely different committee will have to review this amendment and it will make conferencing this bill very difficult. 
I find myself in the position where I probably support a lot of what is in the amendment of the Senator from Indiana. I understand it is a bill that was introduced and has not moved forward as he would like. We do have a task force that was appointed by the leader to look into the problem of sanctions; the whole approach of Senator Lugar is under review by that task force. We are hopeful we will have a proposal to act on that, we will have bipartisan support. Broad support in the Senate would be necessary to pass it. 
The Senate, last week, passed legislation that was suggested by a group here in the Senate and it has been considered by the House. It has been modified and sent to the President to deal with one part of the sanctions program. I congratulate the current occupant of the Chair for his part in that effort. I think it is an effort that must be made. 
As chairman of this committee, I want to tell the Senate that we are approaching the time when we will lose the first week of the August recess. We will probably have to come back the first week of September and we still won't finish by September 30, if we add to appropriations bills full bills that deserve the consideration of the Senate. That will add to the time it takes to get the appropriations bills through this process. 
I hope that the majority leader will assist in trying to convince Members of the Senate, let's not do this this year. There are legitimate riders. There are legitimate limitations on expenditures. There are legitimate concepts in terms of dealing with the appropriations process that we will have to fight out here on the floor, but we should not have to fight out here on the floor amendments that will require the bill, when it goes to the House, be subject to conference by another full committee in the House. It is not right to do that, and I hope the Senate will agree with me. 
I move to table the amendment of the Senator from Indiana, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, 
Mr. President, I earlier filed two amendments concerning the authorization of funds for continuing the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia. 
After discussions with the distinguished manager's of the bill, I will not call up those amendments on this bill. 
The President's budget did not present any request for funds for the Bosnia mission for FY 1999. The Congress received a supplemental budget amendment requesting $1.858 billion for Bosnia operations. 
After four years, there is little merit in treating Bosnia costs as an `unforeseen, emergency requirement' as required by the Budget Act. 
I do not oppose the mission in Bosnia. On a visit to Tuzla last month, the delegation that I and Senator Inouye led were much impressed by the commitment and morale of the army forces deployed to Bosnia. 
Major General Ellis deserves much of the credit for the recent success of this mission. 
Despite these positive indicators, we face dealing with Bosnia costs again this year without a clear plan for the size of the force, OPTEMPO levels or future mission objectives. 
Further, no decisions have been made about the future funding for Bosnia in the five year budget plan now under consideration by the Department of State. 
Many of us agree we need more money for defense. The army cannot continue the Bosnia mission without additional funds. 
As the Senate proceeds to the Defense appropriations bill for 1999, we will have to consider further the approach the Senate will take for Bosnia. 
If our forces are to remain, and potentially face additional responsibilities for Kosovo, we must decide how much we are prepared to spend, and whether these amounts will come from within the current defense caps, or with additional real appropriations. 
I appreciate the willingness of the managers to provide me this opportunity to discuss these amendments, and for their concern about the impact of Bosnia on the well-being of the men and women of the Armed Forces.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, military construction is down $2 billion from 2 years ago. 
It is down $700 million from last year. This is not an increase. To the contrary. 
I do want to assure my friend from Arizona, if there was some test that these projects had to be for members of the Appropriations Committee, I can assure him there would be one for Alaska. There are none for Alaska on this list. This is not a pork list. This is a list that was prepared by our staff, the staff of the subcommittee headed by Senator Burns and part of the full committee staff working with the staff from the Pentagon to find quality projects that could be commenced in this next year that are ready to go. 
We have, I think, a very good list. In times gone by, people have said we should not proceed with these projects unless they are authorized, so we brought this amendment to this authorization bill to be sure they would be authorized. 
This is not an increase. We still will be $700 million below 1998 and $2 billion lower than 1997. I urge that Senator Burns' amendment be adopted. 
I yield back the remainder of our time.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, during the last recess, I took a group of our people to Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Bosnia and Belgium. We talked personally with members of the armed services and questioned them about their decisions, some of them, not to re-enlist. 
When we come back from the recess, we will have the defense appropriations bill before us. There are initiatives in there to deal with retention, to deal with additional quality-of-life issues, and to deal with some of the basic problems with which the young people in our military service are really trying to cope. 
Mr. President, I had breakfast this morning with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. One of the great problems we have in deploying people now is very often husband and wife are in the same unit, and they are subject to being deployed. We have 
to have, literally, foster parents to assure that these families are treated right while husband and wife are deployed abroad. 
This is not a simple matter to deal with, and it does take money for military construction to meet these needs. I hope that the Senate will be ready for a debate when we get to the appropriations bill, because there are some very controversial issues in there that we seek to initiate to try to deal with the problems of families in the armed services today. 
I urge you to approve this as a quality-of-life amendment. I yield back the remainder of my time.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is with a sadness and real heavy heart that I report to the Senate that the former chief counsel of the Appropriations Committee passed away this morning at 7 a.m. at NIH. Albert McDermott was a longtime friend. He and I met during the Eisenhower administration when he was the Assistant Secretary of Labor and I was Assistant Secretary of the Interior. 
After having been with the Hotel-Motel Association for some 25 years, I convinced him to join the staff of the Rules Committee when I became the ranking member of that committee. He came on board, as I recall, in about 1991. He was a graduate of Georgetown Law School, a distinguished naval officer in World War II who was in charge of an LCT, landing craft tank, that hit Normandy beach several times, I believe. 
He became the chief of staff of the Rules Committee when I became chairman, and then moved to the Governmental Affairs Committee and was chief of staff there. When I became chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I asked him to take on the job of counsel for the Appropriations Committee. 
He retired from that position late last year. He was a grand friend, and I shall miss him very much. He was my best man when Catherine and I were married and I was his best man when he married at the age of 70. 
He has left behind his beloved wife, and she was a longtime friend. Krieks is a great friend now of my wife Catherine. She was also very close to my first wife, Ann. 
I announce to the Senate that there will be a visitation at Gawler's Funeral Home on Wisconsin Avenue from 7:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. on Thursday and a memorial service at 10 a.m. at the Annunciation Church on Massachusetts Avenue in Northwest. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

<TEXT>
Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am one of the members of the 
Commerce Committee who voted to report this bill. I think I am one of the Members of the Senate who does not take tobacco contributions. And I have very serious intentions to see to it that there is a bill passed. 
But I am also chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and we have 13 bills to pass. We have taken 4 weeks, now, on this bill, and I don't see any hope that it will be finished before the Fourth of July recess, the way things are going. Now, this country has to have a government and it has to have the appropriations bills come out of our committee. 
Members of the Senate seem to think that we are sort of the obnoxious people who bother them all the time until the time comes to decide what goes in those bills, and then I have a lot of friends. I am not going to have a lot of friends on what I want to do today, and I am sure there are people who are going to get involved, and unless the chairman of the Budget Committee wishes to make a point of order, I will make a point of order that if cloture does not come into effect--we have known all along, Mr. President, this bill violates the Budget Act. 
When I voted to bring it out of the Commerce Committee, I did so on the basis that we thought we could clean it up on the floor and eventually get it to conference, where it would become a bill that we would all be proud of. The trouble is, now it is just too complex and involves too much money. 
I decided to get involved when I heard about CBO's latest letter that went to Senator Lugar, chairman of the Agriculture Committee, and pointed out that over 25 years this bill would be in effect, the cumulative cost of title X is $28 billion and the cumulative cost of title XV is $18 billion. That is just two titles. This bill is totally out of whack with the Budget Act. 
When I bring a bill out here for the Appropriations Committee, our whole committee brings it out. We are subject to a point of order if we violate the Budget Act. The beauty of anybody who deals with the legislative process is, you are not subject to points of order until you get to the point that it is so extreme, as this one is, and now it does violate the Budget Act. 
I believe that it should go--I have suggested the idea of a task force being created. I agree with what the Senator from Massachusetts said actually. We are going to see something come back here. This concept of trying to deal with tobacco and its impact on society is not gone. But this bill has become too complex and too bulky, too cumbersome. We can't agree even on what amendments to be offered next, and we are not sure what the amendment does from the titles that are already here. 
Now, I had hoped that I could stay with my good friend from Arizona and provide support to get this bill to conference. I don't see any hope of going to conference. I am taking the floor to announce that while I am still for a bill that would try to satisfy what the 40 attorneys general tried to do in trying to find some way to settle this matter, I am not for a bill that continues to create more commissions, more boards, more entities, more spending, and does so in the name of spending the money that will come out of the tobacco settlement. 
This is a bill to spend money out of the tobacco settlement. It is not a bill to deal with stopping smoking by teenagers, but particularly targeted young women--which is something I have always been appalled by--the targeting of young women by the tobacco industry. 
As a practical matter, we spent too much time on our bill. We must get back to our regular, ordinary, drudge work of getting the 13 appropriations bills through the Senate and to the President. 
If no one else makes a point of order after the cloture on the vote, if cloture is not invoked, I will make that point of order.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the tobacco bill violates section 302 of the Budget Act as a result of exceeding the committee's spending allocation. 
The bill violates section 302, but I will highlight problems with the substitute. 
In my judgment, the substitute is vulnerable to a point of order under section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended. Section 302(f) provides a point of order against legislation that would cause the spending allocation of the Committee reporting the bill to be exceeded. The bill was reported from the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and the direct spending contained in this bill exceeds that Committee's allocation. 
As a matter of fact, the bill and the substitute violate section 302(f) in a multitude of provisions. 
For example, the substitute contains a State Litigation Settlement account. Amounts allocated to the account would be automatically appropriated and available for grants to States. Once again, the Appropriations Committee's jurisdiction will be reduced and not subject to annual allocation. CBO estimates new spending of between $5 and $6 billion per year from this account. 
The substitute would prohibit the sale of cigarettes in vending machines and provides for paying the owners of cigarette vending machines (other than machines that could be used for other products) an amount equal to the fair-market value of the machines before the prohibition (section 1262). The legislation states that such payments would be subject to appropriation, but other provisions make it likely that the government would be required to make the promised payments even if discretionary appropriations are not provided. CBO estimates new spending of a billion dollars per year from this account over the FY 2000-2002 period.

<DOCNO>105-stevens-ak-7-19980617</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. STEVENS. I did make it, yes, against the bill. 
The substitute includes two titles that provide spending from a Farmers Assistance Allocation account established in the bill. According to CBO both title X and title XV would provide direct spending authority. CBO estimates that title X would increase direct spending by $18 billion over the 1999-2008 period and that title XV would increase direct spending by a billion dollars in 2009 and by half a billion dollars annually from 2010 through 2023. 
The substitute contains additional provisions that would cause additional direct spending. These provisions would require Medicare to pay for a demonstration project of cancer care (section 455), Medicaid to cover tobacco cessation products, (section 221). In addition, the bill would prohibit the Federal Government from recovering any of the payments made to States under this legislation as overpayments of Medicaid costs to the States (section 451(a)(5)). 
I believe the point of order is valid. I yield the remainder of the time to the Senator from New Mexico.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the other day, I had the pleasure of being invited to join my son Ben at the Blessed Sacrament School in Arlington to see my granddaughter participate in one of her first events at that school. I appreciated that opportunity because I had occasion to meet up with a friend, Elizabeth `Betsy' Downs Engelken, who has been a teacher there for some 20 years. We have something in common. She happens to also have a relationship to my granddaughter, because she is the mother of my son's wife, Elizabeth. 
As Betsy retires after 20 years, I thought I would come to the floor and talk about this lady who has developed such creative teaching skills and has endless enthusiasm for the children with whom she works. She has a sparkling sense of humor, and it is really a delight to see what she has done working with the Diocese of Arlington for these past 20 years. 
While she has been there, Betsy Engelken has developed unique talents to identify students that need special assistance and have learning disabilities. She has been a representative of the teachers on the school board and successfully initiated action to bring about additional recognition for teachers and pay increases. 
She has worked on developing new techniques to find ways to bring children into the 21st century. She has brought them awareness of the new kinds of systems that they encounter as they go through school. But above all, I think she has really had a great impact on the many children she has taught because she has a real commitment to children. 
So I want to share with my colleagues the joy I have had recently in terms of being able to participate in this event with my granddaughter Susan. And I also want to congratulate Elizabeth `Betsy' Downs Engelken for her years of commitment to the children of this area. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I lend my strong support to Senator Murkowski and Congressman Young in their efforts to provide better access to emergency medical services for the people of King Cove, Alaska. Senator Murkowski's bill, S. 1092, and its companion bill in the House will put an end to the recent string of deaths resulting from emergency medical evacuation efforts out of King Cove. 
King Cove is one of the most prolific fishing communities in the nation and has the largest fish processing operation in Alaska. It sits at the tip of the Alaska Peninsula, 600 miles southwest of Anchorage in the North Pacific Ocean. 
King Cove is served by a small dirt runway. The runway has no lights and no instrument capability, and has no personnel manning it. It sits in a valley between two large mountains. The weather and the surrounding terrain create winds that are described as `venturi effects'--under these conditions the wind can blow in opposite directions at opposite ends of the runway. The winds aloft over the runway create wind shears that have flipped planes and thrown them into mountains. King Cove's airstrip is closed roughly one out of every three days, often for many days at a time. 
Cold Bay also lies on the tip of the Alaska Peninsula. It is a community built entirely around the third largest nonmilitary runway in the state. Cold Bay is a ten minute plane ride from King Cove, just on the other side of a wildlife refuge. The main runway at Cold Bay is over ten thousand feet long. The crosswind runway is over five thousand feet long. Both are paved. Cold Bay's airport has runway lights and supports full instrument approaches. It is a designated landing site for the space shuttle, and is closed an average of two days a year. 
The people of King Cove need emergency access to Cold Bay when the weather turns bad. Ferry service is not a viable option. The same wind that shuts down King Cove's runway can drive forty foot seas on Cold Bay. Recently, state officials looking into King Cove ferry service saw a one hundred twenty foot fishing boat fail to make it into the harbor because the seas were too rough. 
The people of King Cove want to build a single lane gravel road to Cold Bay, but they need an easement through seven miles of federal land to do it. Many people who have never been to Alaska don't want to see this road built. They cite the cost of the road, the precedent of granting a right of way, and the availability of other options. What they don't cite is the eleven people who have died in recent years trying to fly out of King Cove. 
Senator Murkowski's bill does not authorize a single dollar of federal funds to build this road. It merely provides a land exchange in which the refuge gains five hundred acres of wilderness area. 
The bill does not establish any precedent with respect to land use in wildlife refuges. There are currently 42 miles of road in this refuge, about a third of which are in wilderness areas. The Fish and Wildlife Service already encourages people to use these roads for bird-watching. Congress frequently allows a number of uses in wilderness areas. Just last Congress we allowed the use of all-terrain vehicles in the Anaktuvuk Pass land exchange. 
Some people say that telemedicine is the answer to King Cove's emergency medical needs. I am a strong supporter of telemedicine, but I know that it is a diagnostic tool. Once a diagnosis is made, patients still need to get to a hospital. Telemedicine cannot reattach limbs or provide prenatal care. 
Alaska is used to being micromangaged by Washington, but we will not sit by and listen to specious arguments made to raise funds for extreme environmental groups. We have a simple bill to fix a simple problem, and if we don't do it more people will die. 
The people of King Cove deserve reasonable access to medical facilities. They have made a generous land exchange offer in return for the right of way. I strongly support Senator Murkowski's efforts and urge my colleagues to support him as well when the bill comes to the floor. I ask that I be added as a cosponsor to the King Cove Health and Safety Act.

 Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I introduce for proper referral the No Gun Tax Act of 1998 to address the implementation of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) which takes effect November 30, 1998. 
As you know, the Brady Act had two provisions: an interim provision, which will expire on November 29, 1998, and permanent provision which will take effect on December 1, 1998. The permanent provision mandates the establishment of a National Instant Criminal Background Checks System (NICS). The operation of the NICS will be the responsibility of the Justice Department. 
The Department of Justice now proposes to charge fees for the NICS using the authority of a provision in the 1991 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Act (Public Law 101-515)--an Act that was passed two years before the NICS program and which was never intended to allow fees under the NICS program. This limited 1991 authority allowed fees only `to process fingerprint identification records and name checks for non-criminal justice * * * and licensing purposes.' It was not intended to apply to programs like the NICS program, which checks the criminal background of purchasers and has nothing to do with licensing. 
For years I and others pushed for the instant check system as the most thorough and efficient way to ensure that criminals cannot buy firearms. The imposition of a fee would encourage some to try to obtain firearms on the black market. No matter how you feel about gun control, we should all do what we can to make sure the new background check system works.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. Leader, I regret deeply the death of your father. I have similar feelings when cancer comes before the Senate because my grandfather, father and brother all died from cancer. I understand those feelings. 
However, I also understand that our committee has responsibility for the controllable expenses. This bill reduces controllable expenses, if I am told right, by at least 2 1/2 to 3 percent. It further will require, if I am informed right, that if there is an increase in the highway tax revenues, we must spend them, even if it means changing the budgets for other subcommittees. If there is a decrease and the estimates are not met, I am told we will take the money from controllable accounts and put it in this account to pay for highways at the cost of all the other functions that are controllable. 
Now, I think that is something that I have a right to look at and Senators have a right to debate if they want to do that. I regret deeply being in a position of apparently opposing my leader who I do support and am committed to, but I feel this process needs to be understood. 
Again, I am only reporting what I have been told because I have not been privileged to have a copy of this yet, despite the fact that I am on that conference committee. Now, I have been here almost 30 years, and I have never seen this happen before. Never.

Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will yield further, there are lots of programs where the taxes are collected for a particular purpose. 
Take the airports and airways funds, for instance. There is a whole series of them. Those funds come from the appropriations 
process and they are appropriated. 
You have created an entitlement in this bill, the most massive entitlement other than the Medicare trust fund entitlement, that I know. There is no discretion for anyone to change that except by an act of Congress, a subsequent act of Congress. There is no individual allocation of those moneys to meet needs. 
The President will submit a budget in January. It will lay out what the highway department believes will be the return as estimated to have been brought into the Treasury from the year before and it will be spent. It will be spent according to this bill. There will be no review of what has happened in the year before, and we in the appropriations process would go over the budget request through the year and in September send a bill to the President to spend the money as we believe--that Congress believed, not the Appropriations Committee, but Congress believed--it should be spent. 
That will not occur because this money will be spent according to the budget received from the Federal Highway Administration every year. That will be done by the Federal Highway Administration under their understanding of this law for 5 years. It will not be changed except by an act of Congress. 
To this Senator, that is the most stringent entitlement that we have on the Federal laws in this country, that we have ever had.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I appreciate what the Senator from Texas has said. This Senator supported the concept that moneys which come in through gasoline tax should be spent for the purposes the taxes were collected. We have not had an argument over that. 
Where we have the argument is over whether there should be a bill passed every 5 years that sets absolute corridors for the spending of money, with no discretion on the part of appropriators or the Congress itself to change--6 years, I beg your pardon. That is even worse. 
The real problem we have with it is flexibility. I still haven't seen the bill. I have come to tell the Senate that I have visited with the chairman of the Budget Committee, for whom I do share with the Senator from Texas our admiration of the Senator from New Mexico as the chairman of the Budget Committee. Based upon his understanding of the bill, there is not a great problem, at least in the first 2 years of 1999 and the year 2000 with regard to the nondiscretionary funds that are within the jurisdiction of the Appropriations Committee being reduced because of the expenditure of more moneys to highways that are currently estimated. 
Now, that is our understanding. We haven't seen the language yet. To my knowledge, no one in the Senate yet has read that language. Under the circumstances that we have, I have come to this conclusion after having the meeting with our committee members and listening to the staffs of the Budget Committee and the Appropriations Committee with regard to the impact of this bill on the appropriations process. 
I will not insist upon the delay of this bill. However, I believe it may set a new unfortunate course with regard to the flexibility and expenditure of taxpayers' money and the ability to use the money for the purposes that have the most need at the time the bill is passed annually. 
This is going to lock us in for 5 years. Again, I am saying to the Senate, with I hope at least the understanding of my great friend from West Virginia, this Senator, who is chairman of the appropriations bill, intends to look at this bill, examine it very closely, and if it does constrict us so that we do not have the flexibility we should have, we will bring before the Senate this year an amendment to this bill and we will have it out. 
We are not arguing over whether the highway tax money should be spent for highways; we are arguing how it should be allocated and when the determination should be made as to what the priorities are for the use of that money. This bill will set it for 6 years now. If it went through the appropriations process, we would determine that annually. 
I see my great friend here, Senator Daschle, who just went through that horrible flood up in his area. We have disasters in this country. We have earthquakes and floods, and we have enormous tornadoes. We have to have discretion to allocate funds in a way that meets the best needs of our people as a whole. 
I do not think that the bill that is going to come before the Senate can be followed without an enormous spillover into the areas of other nondefense discretionary funds, which must be allocated by the Appropriations Committee annually. What I mean is, I think the effect of this bill will be that we will have to constrain other nondefense discretionary spending in order to accommodate the extraordinary demand here that if the revenues from the gas tax money exceed the caps, exceed the estimates, it is going to be spent anyway. And we have a 4-percent leeway, what I call a `fudge factor.' But if they go up to 10 percent, we are going to have to absorb 6 percent of that from other nondefense discretionary accounts. That is going to affect every single State in the Union adversely. It is going to affect the operations of this Government adversely. 
I can't tell the Senate it will happen now. I can only tell the Senate that, as I understand the way the bill has been written, it could happen. And if it does, I do think that would be a disaster. Again, to a certain extent, I sense a feeling here, particularly from my friend from Texas, that the Appropriations Committee has not provided funds for highways. We have exceeded the amount that came in from the gas tax in the period of the last 5 years. We have spent more money through the appropriations process for highways than would be spent under this bill for highways, if we had had the allocation of funds that the Budget Committee has generously brought back into this process and made available for this entitlement. 
This turf battle that I sense is not coming from our committee. All we are saying is that there is not flexibility here. If the authorizing committee wants to pass a law saying you are going to allocate this money, then pass a law saying you are going to allocate it every year. But don't sit around and tell people you have done a good job for the country when you have allocated for 6 years, based upon an estimate that the two organizations that really are most concerned--OMB and CBO--disagree, as you know. They have about a $10 billion difference in the estimates of expenditures. We are taking the high one, of course; we are going to follow the high one. If we were wearing our budget-cutter hats, we would take the low one. But here we are spenders, so we are taking the high one. 
The problem is that one section of this bill says--and I have not seen this yet--if the money doesn't come in, we have 
to make it up. I was just told by one of the staff that that probably is not true. He used the words `flexible guarantees.' I am going to be anxious to read how we write a bill that is flexible every year based upon the variations of one anticipated and estimated revenue, as opposed to estimated actual revenues, when either one is any more than an estimate. I have to adjust the budget and meet a total cap level under the budget agreement and be subject to a point of order if we are not right. 
I say to my friends who have been involved in this, I wish you luck. Don't feel surprised if this Senator is back out on this floor this year with amendments to this bill to do it right.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Olympic and Amateur Sports Act Amendments of 1998, a bill to update the federal charter of the U.S. Olympic Committee and the framework for Olympic and amateur sports in the United States. Senator Campbell joins me as an original cosponsor. 
This framework is commonly known as the `Amateur Sports Act,' because most of its provisions were added by the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-606). The Act gives the U.S. Olympic Committee certain trademark protections to raise money--and does not provide recurring appropriations--so therefore does not come up for routine reauthorization. 
The Amateur Sports Act has not been amended since the comprehensive revision of 1978--a revision which provided the foundation for the modern Olympic movement in the United States. 
Key components of the 1978 Act included--

 Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I join Senator Murkowski as a co-sponsor of this Senate resolution commending the Prince William Sound Community College, which is located in Valdez, Alaska, as it celebrates its twentieth anniversary. 
In 1971, concerned citizens of Valdez and in the neighboring town of Cordova petitioned the University of Alaska to establish extension offices in each of these communities. In 1976, a Learning Center was established in this area. Community college status was granted in 1978 and the centers officially became known as Prince William Sound Community College. 
In 1989, the College received accreditation from the Commission on Colleges of the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges and has maintained that status. Since that date, the College has established several new programs, such as the Prince William Sound Community College Theater Conference, which attracts nationally-known dramatists; the Industrial Safety/Marine Response Training Department; a wellness center; and a television station. 
The University of Alaska merged all community colleges into the university system in 1987. Prince William Sound Community College has remained the only individually-accredited community college in the system because of the continuing strong support from the City of Valdez. The University of Alaska's Board of Regents has recognized the growth and accomplishment of the College by approving several new degree and certificate programs. 
In twenty years of existence, Prince William Sound Community College has developed into a recognized leader in the University of Alaska system and continues to serve Prince William Sound and the Cooper Basin area as a comprehensive community college intent on life-long learning. 
I urge other Senators to help us pass this resolution to commend the Prince William Sound Community College for these accomplishments in conjunction for these accomplishments in conjunction with its 20th anniversity on May 10, 1998.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have a reasonable amendment to this bill relating to a very unique `tool of the trade' in the fishing industry of Alaska. the bill already would increase the cap for the value of tools of the trade exempted from IRS levy to $5,000, up from $1,250. 
My amendment addresses a class of tools--State-issued permits that give their holder the privilege to commercially harvest fish or game in our State. 
The State of Alaska has never conceded that these permits are property that may be seized by IRS. Yet, the IRS seizes them, without giving any consideration to the unique circumstances in Alaska, particularly western Alaska. 
In those villages, commercial fishing is the only industry. If you don't have a fishing job, you do not have a job. 
When a fisherman in that area fails to pay taxes on time, the IRS never gives any consideration to the fact that without the fishing permit, the taxpayer would have no way to pay back taxes. 
In addition, he or she will then have no way to support their children, their family, pay child support, or buy heating oil for their house, or face other problems. 
We do have a problem in western Alaska--the IRS estimates that commercial fishermen owe over $20 million in back taxes. That is not much, nationally. But as one IRS agent visiting rural Alaska pointed out, they have in some cases been trying to collect taxes from people who did not even know the IRS existed. 
There are positive changes, in the bill with respect to IRS collection procedures, but the language and cultural barriers, and isolation of vast areas of Alaska still lead to results that people in the rest of the country find hard to believe. 
Instead of exempting State permits entirely from IRS levies, I have accepted a compromise. Under section 3445 of the bill, the IRS will be required, before seizing the assets of a small business, to first determine that the business owner's `other assets' are not sufficient to pay the back taxes and expenses of IRS proceedings. 
My compromise would require the IRS to consider future income from State-issued fish and game permits as `other income' in its determination before making a levy on such permits. This means the IRS must consider whether the future income from the permit would allow the fishermen to pay the tax debt and procedural expenses before the maximum time possible for repayment under law has occurred. 
In treating these permits as an asset used in a trade or business, Congress does not intend to determine whether such permits are property or a right to property. We only mean to say that as long as the IRS asserts that the permits are property or a right to property, the holder should have the added protection of having future income considered.

Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, last spring, the Duma Chairman of the Committee on the Problems of the Russian North, Vladimir Goman, met with Senator Cochran and myself to ask us for our participation in a new project which would help facilitate Russia's efforts in the remediation of nuclear wastes. 
Since that meeting, the Russian Duma has passed a Resolution pledging funding and infrastructure for the Advanced Technology Research Project (ATRP). In Europe, industry and key decision makers of the European Parliament, the German Bundestag, the Union of European Labor Parties, and several national nuclear waste management and research and development institutions, including the Swiss NAGRA, have all pledged their support for the ATRP. 
This ATRP, originally proposed by the Russian Duma, with participation from academia, private industry and governmental and public organizations, is a privately funded, neutral organization. It will facilitate information exchange on nuclear waste management technologies, and the development of a worldwide nuclear waste management technology marketplace. It is the goal of this project to advance self sufficiency in nuclear waste management in Russia and to globally provide advanced and affordable solutions to nuclear waste. 
ATRP will be entirely privately funded through private industry, public interest, and scientific organizations. This Private-Public Partnership will be implemented through ATRP's global nuclear waste technology clearinghouse, database, conferences, workshops, and trade shows worldwide. The objective is advanced, safer, and efficient nuclear waste management at the lowest possible cost. 
The management of nuclear waste is one of the world's most pressing concerns and perhaps Russia's greatest ecological threat. ATRP will help Russia help itself by developing an international market for technology exchange. It will also benefit United States and all other nuclear nations by making nuclear waste management technology more readily available in the international market place. 
I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this Resolution which will help us all work toward an international solution to this very pressing issue of nuclear wage management.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, with the amount included in the emergency supplemental, the United States will have expended over $7.5 billion for operations in and around Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia by the end of this fiscal year 1998. It is estimated that the United States is paying over 50 percent of the cost of maintaining the peace in Bosnia, nearly $200 million a month in 1997 alone, and no end is in sight to the United States presence there, with the current wish of the President to extend our mission there. 
Defense overseas funding to NATO countries continues. The cost of maintaining our U.S. forces there averages $10 billion a year. Let me state that again. Defense overseas funding in NATO countries is such that the cost of maintaining our forces there averages nearly $10 billion a year. Security assistance alone to NATO allies since 1950, and that includes military assistance and military education and training, now totals over $19 billion. 
No other member of NATO has the global defense role that the United States has, nor the forward-deployed presence in potential flash-point areas such as the Middle East and the Korean peninsula. It is for this reason, Mr. President, that I wish to discuss the two amendments that I proposed. I presented them last month. 
The amendments both deal with the challenges of defining and controlling NATO expansion costs. My original intent in proposing these amendments was to bring some greatly needed accountability to the critical issue of recognizing and clarifying all the costs to the United States to enlarge the NATO alliance. 
My first amendment is No. 2065, which requires all costs related to either the admission of new NATO members, or their participation in NATO be specifically authorized by law. It is my understanding that the managers of the bill have not accepted this amendment for inclusion in the resolution, and for that reason I will, in a moment, ask for the yeas and nays on that amendment. I will explain it further if anyone wishes me to do so, but I think it is very plain. It just says any further costs must be authorized by law. 
The second amendment has evolved since I originally offered it for the Senate's consideration. My original amendment would have restricted the use of funds for payment of NATO costs after September 30 of this year unless the Secretaries of Defense and State certified to the Congress that the total percentage of NATO common costs paid by the United States would not exceed 20 percent during the NATO fiscal year. 
After the administration expressed their concern that this would be too difficult to achieve in such a time period, I redrafted this amendment to reduce the total U.S. contribution by only 1 percent each year over a 5-year period. That would have been no more severe a reduction than the Department of Defense has experienced as a whole in real terms since 1995. 
However, during the extensive consultation that I have had with the Secretary of Defense, our former colleague, Secretary Cohen, and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joe Ralston, they have requested further changes to this amendment. 
Subsequently, I have sent to the desk now a modification of the latest version which is what I will ask the Senate to vote on, and that is a sense of the Senate, that beginning in fiscal year 1999 and over the next 5 years, the President should require the U.S. representative to NATO to propose to NATO a 1-percent reduction in U.S. contributions to the common-funded budgets of NATO. Sixty days after the proposal has been made, the President is requested to submit to Congress a report outlining the action taken by NATO, if any, on this U.S. proposal. 
Additionally, this amendment directs the limitation on the total expenditures by the United States for payment to the common-funded budgets of NATO to the fiscal year 1998 levels unless an increase over that is specifically authorized by law. 
Mr. President, a soon-to-be-released report of the General Accounting Office that has been conducted confirms--and I have seen the draft--confirms that NATO does not systematically review or renegotiate member cost shares for the common budgets. And it is well past time for this practice to be instituted. As I have stated before, this reassessment is long overdue in light of the United States' global defense responsibilities. 
No formal renegotiations have occurred in the military and civil budgets in NATO since 1955. Let me repeat that. There have been no formal renegotiations in the military and civil budgets of NATO since 1955. 
When Spain joined NATO in 1982, there was a pro rata adjustment in the civil and military budget shares based upon Spain's contribution. The NSIP, or the NATO infrastructure budget, has been adjusted five times since 1960 because of changes in the way projects were approved or funded, but there was no attempt to reallocate the percentages. 
Mr. President, I think that is long overdue. I understand there will be no objection to my amendment, No. 2066. If that is the case, I would urge that it be adopted as soon as the managers have made their statements.

Mr. STEVENS. To me, this is a matter of simple justice. As the surviving superpower of the world, we must take action to limit our international commitments at least to the extent that we have limited our own budgets within the United States for the Department of Defense. Both of my amendments do that. They merely say there is a restriction on the future obligation of funds of the United States to these NATO processes unless they are previously authorized by law. 
There is no barrier to going above the 1998 limit, and there is no compulsion to reduce down to 20 percent as far as the total overall commitment to the common budgets. But my amendment will bring about a process by which further expenditures will have to be authorized by law and will give Congress a specific control every year over the additional cost, if any, that may be incurred because of this NATO expansion.

The other one is intended to cover those costs where I believe the United States is going to venture out and say we will do this. 
We have had that experience with the expenditures before. I think we will have it again in these new areas, and these new areas are the ones that need the most in terms of expenditure. Very frankly, we cannot afford to go it alone anymore. We want to see a requirement that Congress review the expenditures of funds in these areas.

Mr. STEVENS. I state to my friend from Delaware that I am preparing to change the amendment so that it reads, `requirement of payments of funds specifically authorized, no cost incurred by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, other than the common funded budgets of NATO in connection with the admission of membership participation of any country not a member of NATO as of 
March 1, 1998, may be paid out of funds from any agency,' et cetera. 
We do not seek to be redundant with the second amendment, but 2065 addresses the voyeurism of our people in Europe to go and do it alone in interoperability, in communications, in the whole series of things that they wish to have these new members of NATO have, without regard to common funded budgets, and to go obligate the United States, and then we get the bills brought to us in Appropriations without any authorization, without any review of Foreign Relations Committee, of Armed Services Committee, and suddenly the Appropriations Committee is faced with making decisions which we shouldn't have to make. 
I am told all the time these areas should be authorized by law, and here is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee saying why don't we have a requirement they be authorized by law. It is sort of like a role reversal here of the husband saying, `I've got a headache tonight, dear.' It is not quite the normal thing to be hearing from an authorizer that this is wrong for us to say. Make them get the authorization by law before they present the Appropriations Committee a bill to be paid.

There is an additional period of time in three instances for regulations to be reviewed by Congress. We did not meet at night; only during the day. But this is a very serious matter to get this bill passed to assure that men and women of the armed services get the support they need to continue their training and also to meet the disasters that have occurred to this country during this year since we passed a 1998 appropriations bill.

<DOCNO>105-stevens-ak-2-19980402</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am offering a Sense-of-the-Senate Amendment which urges the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Defense, and the Congressional Budget Office to develop a common estimate of outlays under the fiscal year 1997 Defense budget. 
Last year, the Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997--putting the Federal Government on a path to living within its means. The act specified the budget authority and outlay levels for the Defense Department for fiscal years 1998 and 1999. 
The Department of Defense is a $250 billion organization--an organization which needs stability to run effectively. 
The Defense Department relied on last year's Budget Act to build its fiscal year 1999 budget. 
Currently, the fiscal year 1999 budget submitted by the Defense Department, and scored using OMB rates, complies with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. 
OMB and the Defense Department built their outlay rates based on the specific spending plans of each DOD program and based upon the policy changes contained in the fiscal year 1999 Defense budget. In many cases, the Defense Department increased outlay rates over last year's levels. 
DOD also adjusted working capital fund policies, and billing rates, to generate positive balances and keep these funds solvent. 
Mr. President, the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, which I chair, has for the last 3 years, transferred cash into the working capital funds and directed DOD to change its billing rates and policies. 
The Defense Department has done what the Congress asked. However, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that outlays under the fiscal year 1999 Defense budget will exceed the limit imposed by the budget agreement, as well as the OMB quality estimate, by $3.7 billion. These differences are based on statistical analyses and projections of the future based on the past. While this may all be theoretically interesting, it has severe implications for the Defense Department. 
The Defense Appropriations Subcommittee would have to totally restructure the fiscal year 1999 Defense budget to reduce outlays by $3.7 billion. We would have to cut military personnel funding unexpectedly forcing thousands of soldiers, sailors, and airmen out of the force structure. 
We would have to cut operation and maintenance funds--funds which keep our troops trained and ready, which pay to day-to-day bills for our bases, and which repair the aging equipment relied upon by our military personnel. 
Lastly, we could turn to the procurement and research and development accounts--cutting $2-$10 of budget authority for every dollar in outlays we must save. This would bring modernization to a virtual halt and increase the cost of the remaining, less efficient programs. These cuts would not serve the Senate, and Defense Department, or the Nation well. 
I understand that there may be new and more detailed information on the Defense Department's budget policies and execution plans--information that the Congressional Budget Office did not consider. 
It is essential that there be a common agreement on the outlay estimate of the Defense budget--an agreement that does not punish DOD based on a disagreement over statistical predictions and historical interpolation. 
My amendment urges that everyone work toward this common agreement--an agreement which I hope will allow us adequate flexibility to maintain balance in the fiscal year 1999 Defense budget.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there are a number of cosponsors to this amendment. The amendment I offer is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment which directs the Office of Management and Budget, the Department of Defense, and the Congressional Budget Office to develop a common estimate of outlays under the fiscal year 1999 defense budget. The modification of my amendment adds a corresponding sense-of-the-Senate section which urges OMB, CBO, and the Secretaries of nondefense agencies to also develop common estimates for the 1999 outlays for the nondefense discretionary programs. 
I believe this amendment is one that is needed. It is a sense of the Senate, but it directs, as far as the Office of Management and Budget and CBO and the Defense Department, to find a common ground before we start marking up either the authorization bill or the appropriations bill. It has been cosponsored by both sides. I believe it will be accepted. I ask for the adoption of the amendment.

Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, as the Senator from Arkansas is aware, the bill now before the Senate does contain emergency appropriations for both defense and domestic emergencies. As such, those appropriations have not been offset. I agree with the Senator's understanding that when offsets are required, the defense accounts must pay for defense appropriations, the nondefense must pay for nondefense appropriations. And that would comply with the so-called walls that exist between defense and nondefense spending. 
As I understand the situation, should we bring back a bill 
that has defense appropriations which are offset with reductions in nondefense accounts, the Budget Act would treat the defense funds to be over the cap that exists for 1998 and would not allow the treatment of the nondefense offsets to reduce that amount down below the cap. 
I call attention to the fact that our committee is the only committee that is subject to the point of order under the Budget Act. The House can propose whatever it wants to propose, but should we bring such a bill back to the Senate floor, it would be subject to a point of order, and it would certainly not be my intention to do that. 
Furthermore, as the Senator knows, it has already been indicated that the budget, the account for defense, has already been rescored and is $22 million over the cap now, which we will have to deal with later. But this bill is not over the cap. The defense account is over the cap before this bill. And we have a real problem with dealing with any funds that might attempt to be appropriated for defense on a nonemergency basis because they would automatically be subject to a point of order. 
So the Senator's amendment No. 2134, as I stated to him yesterday, in this Senator's opinion--and I checked with Senator Byrd yesterday--we believe that the Senator's amendment states the interpretation of the Budget Act as it applies to the Senate now and therefore is unnecessary.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this would be, in our judgment, a very bad precedent. It would allow litigants involved in a case against the United States to come to the Senate, through their Senator, and try to obtain passage of a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that would assist them in their negotiations with the U.S. Government. Although the amendment would not be binding, it could be used in a court of law to argue the merits of the case. 
I do not know much about this case other than I have discussed it with the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, but as I informed him, we have a letter from the Attorney General--and it is signed by the Attorney General personally--written to the chairman and ranking member of the State, Justice Commerce Subcommittee. 
I understand that the distinguished chairman is here. I yield to him for the balance of the time to explain further why we are opposed to the amendment.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, my colleague has stated the problem. Actually, if we do not adopt his amendment, the budget is more out of balance than it is if we do, because the sale of this oil at a time when the market is so low, which is the current mandate, would cause revenue to be so low that there would be a loss, as I said, to the overall budget process and it would be greater than this emergency amendment which provides the money for the SPR without selling the oil. 
I have had no objection to this amendment. I think we may face a substantial battle in the other body to justify this, but I believe we should accept it. And I know of no problem on the other side of the aisle, either. So I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my time and urge the adoption of the amendment.

I further ask unanimous consent that when the Senate receives the House companion bill to the IMF supplemental appropriations bill, the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration, and all after the enacting clause be stricken, and the text of the IMF title in this bill be inserted, and the bill be advanced to third reading and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, all without further action or debate. 
Finally, I ask unanimous consent that in both cases the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, all occurring without further action or debate.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I might state--and the Senator from Oklahoma just raised the same question over here--last evening we had a discussion about how to handle the Bosnia issue. I hope the Senator from Texas will not mind my saying, we reached agreement with the Senator from Texas that she would call up this amendment and discuss it for a while and then withdraw it. 
As a result of that, there will not be other Bosnia amendments offered at this time. They are waiting for the main bill. It is a matter of getting before the Senate the concerns the Senator from Texas wants to raise, and then we will go to the Nickles amendment. It will be some 15, 20, 30 minutes--I don't know what the Senator wants to take. I urge the Senate to allow us to manage the bill that way. The Nickles amendment will be the first amendment after the Senator from Texas has completed her comments. 
Mr. President, before we yield on this, if I may, is it possible to get a time agreement on the Nickles amendment?

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there are a few times when a chairman faces dilemmas of this magnitude. I support the concept of more funds going to schools and to the Disabilities Act. If I make a point of order, and the Senator makes a motion to waive the point of order, I think that will carry. I think the Senate will vote to waive. I know that my friends on the Democratic side of the aisle would vote to make that money available and, obviously, I think Members on this side of the aisle think this is a way to somehow or another deal with the budget in a different way using the stabilization fund. 
The net result of the Senator's amendment, if the budget is waived, is that there will be $5 billion spent from the stabilization fund and that, in effect, would require our committee to go back and take $5 billion out of the nondefense side of the budget and rescind it. If we did not do that, our whole bill is subject to a point of order and the disaster money and the defense money that we so vitally need will not be available. 
I can tell the Senate, it would take me a week to find $5 billion in nondefense money that we could rescind for 1998. The Senator is aware, I am sure, that his amendment makes the money available in 1998. It says that in 1998 the administration is directed to spend $5 billion from the stabilization fund. 
At the time of the Mexico crisis, I did a study of the stabilization fund. It was created at the time the United States went off the gold standard, and someone in the Treasury decided that since we are off the gold standard, we ought to figure out what the gold in Fort Knox is worth, and they did. As the price of gold went up, the stabilization fund went up. It does not represent any capital in the sense of income that is saved; it represents the value of the gold in Fort Knox. 
Literally, in order to pay for the expenditures that the Senator's amendment would authorize, otherwise pressed, the 
Treasury would have to sell the gold in Fort Knox. Unfortunately, the value of that has gone down, and the stabilization fund may really not be worth as much as people think it is. 
In any event, this amendment has some strange quirks to it, as far as this bill is concerned. I do not want the Senate to waive the Budget Act, because if we waive the Budget Act, as I said, the whole bill is subject to a point of order. If we adopt the amendment, the bill is subject to a point of order similarly, in my opinion, unless we go back and take out the $5 billion that it would spend in 1998. 
I may be misinformed on that regard, but I know the effect of spending that kind of money would require us to go back and take the money out of existing accounts on the nondefense side. 
I think the Senate ought to have some time to think about this. I think the Senator ought to think about it, because it is not going to achieve the result the Senator seeks. It is not going to embarrass anybody on the Democratic side. They are going to vote for his amendment. It is not going to embarrass anyone on our side of the aisle; they are going to vote for the amendment. And it is not going to embarrass the administration; they want to spend that kind of money, $5 billion more money. 
As my grandmother said, it is money made of whole cloth. It is not there. It wasn't in the budget to start with and somehow that money will have to be accounted for in the budget process this year. 
I understand what the Senator from North Carolina is trying to do, but it is not going to achieve the result that he seeks. I can tell him I am informed the Democratic Members will vote for his amendment, as Democratic Members will vote to waive, as he seeks to make. The net result is the Senator will increase spending by $5 billion, unless we go back, as I said, and take $5 billion out of the nondefense side of the budget that is left to be taken out in the last 6 months of this year. 
I can tell the Senator, in order to do that, you have to take out about $15 billion, because we are talking about outlays, and it is just not possible this time of the year to get that kind of money without doing severe damage to a lot of programs, whether they be agriculture programs--they would be on the nondefense side. We cannot touch defense on this amendment. 
It is a nightmare, really. But it comes about because I understand Senators do not want to vote against the Senator's amendment, as he might have anticipated. They will not vote against this amendment. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set the Senator's amendment aside to a time certain at 5 o'clock, and we will find some time to deal with it between now and then.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Feingold amendment strikes the emergency designation for the Bosnian funds from the bill. This supplemental request is mandated by section 8132 of the appropriations bill for 1999. If the President certifies that the mission to Bosnia must continue, under the law this then continues. Bosnia costs are emergency, as Congress specifically funded only through June 30, 1998. 
The problem we face now is the cost of the continued deployment has already been paid. The administration has sought to seek these funds to avoid damage to the readiness and the quality of life that the military faces, which is not currently deployed, but they may face missions, as I have told the Senate before, to Bosnia or Iraq within the remainder of this year. 
The emergency designation allows those moneys necessary for this deployment to come out of the emergency fund rather than having to come out of reprogrammed accounts for the moneys we have already appropriated for quality of life and for readiness for the remainder of the force that is not deployed. 
Under the circumstances, I agree with Senator Feingold's position. We, however, thought we had a commitment that the troops would be out on July 1. I think the Senate realizes that. The President made the finding that the law required it if he was going to continue the deployment, and that is not only for 1998 but for 1999. 
We will address, as we have already indicated with the comments of the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison, today, the continued deployment in Bosnia at length during the consideration of both the authorization bill and the defense appropriations bill this year as we look to 1999. But for the purpose now of dealing with the continued deployment for the remainder of this year, I implore the Senator not to require, by striking the emergency designation, that these funds must be taken from other portions of the Department of Defense that are already accounted for in the appropriations we have made for those functions. And we would again just be doing that. 
I feel like a white rat in one of those circular wheels. We just continue to go around and around. And we don't get anywhere if we appropriate money and we have to go back and take that money and put it into another purpose, particularly this late in the year. 
It would also have a problem because some of the moneys that have already been committed would not actually be spent until 1999. We went into that yesterday in connection with another matter. 
But, clearly, if we do not have the emergency designation, those moneys that are actually spent in 1999 will be counted against our allocation that we are already working on for 1999 in terms of the new bill for fiscal year 1999. And, unfortunately, the Congressional Budget Office has already told us we are $3.7 billion short to meet the level of funding that is indicated in the budget. 
There is this battle between the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget. This will add to that deficit. When we try to correct that deficit, it would mean the moneys that are basically emergency moneys to deal with the continued deployment through September 30 of this year must actually be counted against 1999. I have to tell you, Mr. President, that makes that problem of the deficit and defense allocation for outlays for 1999 even that much worse. 
So, under the circumstances, I have no alternative but to urge the Senate to table the Feingold amendment. Let us deal with Bosnia in terms of the 1999 bill, and let us address the whole subject of the continued deployment and the funding for anything that goes on. 
I will tell the Senate that it is not possible to get those soldiers out of there at one time. There has to be, if we are going to have a staggered withdrawal, a staged withdrawal, a downsizing to the point where we can do it legitimately, and without risk to anyone. 
So I urge the Senate to support me in the motion that I am going to make in order to prevent us from forcing the Department of Defense to use moneys that have already been appropriated for other functions in the Department to pay the cost of this emergency caused by the President's determination that the troops will stay there after July 1. 
I am about ready to make the motion to table. Before I do so, does the Senator wish to make one last statement concerning his amendment?

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment will provide $260 million for emergency Community Development Block Grants that will fund disaster relief, long-term recovery, and mitigation in communities affected by Presidentially declared disasters that have occurred in this fiscal year, 1998. This funding is needed to supplement funding provided through the more traditional emergency disaster programs under the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, the Small Business Administration, SBA, and the Army Corps of Engineers. 
I have concerns about using CDBG funds for emergency purposes, especially since the Department of Housing and Urban Development did not really provide adequate data and accountability concerning the use of these emergency CDBG funds in the past. Nevertheless, this legislation is designed to ensure that funds go to disaster relief activities that are identified by the Director of FEMA as unmet needs that have not been or will not be addressed by other Federal disaster assistance programs. 
In addition, to assure accountability, States must provide a 25 percent match for these emergency CDBG funds and HUD must publish a notice of program requirements and provide an accounting of CDBG funds by the type of activity and the amount of funding and the recipient. 
Mr. President, I know of no opposition to this amendment. I ask for the immediate adoption of this amendment.

<TEXT>
Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment would replenish FEMA's disaster relief fund by $1.6 billion, as requested by the administration, consistent with FEMA's current estimate of the additional funds needed to meet the fiscal year 1998 and prior year disaster requirements. 
So far this year, there have been Presidential disaster declarations in 17 States and territories. These disasters include snowstorms, typhoons, tornadoes, flooding, and ice storms. Most of these disasters have been related to the weather phenomenon we now know as El Nino. 
While funds are currently available in the disaster relief fund, there are not sufficient funds on hand to meet the total costs which are estimated to stem from current disasters. In fact, FEMA estimates it will need every penny currently in the disaster relief fund to meet the existing cost projections of more than $3 billion from the disasters that have occurred prior to fiscal year 1998. 
Included in the $1.6 billion appropriations request are funds for disasters which are also anticipated to occur in fiscal year 1998 based on the 5-year historical average cost of disaster relief. To date, FEMA disaster relief has been running very close to that 5-year average, despite the fact that a number of Senators and some people have raised questions about there being more damage that is caused by El Nino than has been caused in recent years. 
I support FEMA's expeditious provision of aid to many of the needy communities that are stricken by disasters and wish to be sure that the disaster fund is fully funded, but, as I stated yesterday, I continue to be deeply concerned about the cost of disaster relief. Each year, we are seeing these costs rise exponentially, and the need for cost containment now is paramount. I urge the authorizing committees to look at these costs and determine if there is some way to reduce the costs for these funds. In the last 5 years, we have appropriated a staggering $18 billion to FEMA for disaster relief compared to $6.7 billion for the prior 5-year period. Clearly, the costs associated with disaster relief are growing out of control. 
Unfortunately, we also have learned over the past few years that disaster funds have gone to some facilities like golf courses or to refurbish shrubbery in high-income communities, to facilities associated with universities that already have impressive endowments and revenue-generating capabilities, and to provide housing assistance to some who are really not in need. I really hope that the administration will realize it must put controls on these expenditures if FEMA is to continue to get the support of the Congress. 
Moreover, Senator Bond, over the last few years, has pushed FEMA to submit a legislative plan of reforms to control disaster costs. With some reluctance, FEMA did submit a proposal for reforming the Stafford Act last summer. The proposed amendments address several very important areas, including new incentives for mitigation, streamlining the grant process, and eliminating certain facilities currently eligible for disaster relief, such as I said, golf courses. It is critical that this FEMA reform legislation be acted upon by the authorizing committees this year, and I urge them to work with Senator Bond to enact these reforms. 
Meanwhile, while it is clear that we expect and need reform of FEMA programs, we also believe that Congress must complete action on this disaster relief funding legislation as quickly as possible, so that the disaster needs of our communities can be met. 
I see the Senator from Oklahoma is here. I wish to state, I did reconsider the vote on the prior amendment. I did not know whether it was this amendment or the prior amendment that the Senator wished to address. If he wishes to address the first one, I will be happy to withdraw that and bring it back to where the Senator can offer an amendment to it.

That is why it came in yesterday.

It is my understanding that about seven amendments on what we call the finite list are before the body now. We have two that have been brought forward on this side. 
I now ask unanimous consent that, unless an amendment is listed on that list tonight before we conclude business today, no further amendment other than what is on that list be in order for tomorrow. 
If you want to read that list, I will be happy to read that list.

Mr. STEVENS. I do thank the leader for raising the issue and urging us to move forward. I urge Senators to come forward and discuss with me and Senator Byrd and our staffs any amendments they may wish to raise. We will insist on a time agreement on amendments that are going to need a vote. 
Let me state at the outset, however, the real difficulty with this bill now is the IMF amendment. I think the Senate should realize what the situation is. We had a time agreement on the IMF amendment. That time has been exhausted. At my request, it was set aside to consider other amendments. I have been notified by Members on both sides of the aisle that they will not allow this bill to come to final vote without a vote on that IMF amendment, and that there is some indication of a desire to have that amendment wait for a time when the House passes a separate bill dealing with IMF and other subjects. 
I want to state to the Senate that I am normally neutral on most of these subjects but I am not neutral on this subject. The Senator from Hawaii and I have traveled to the Pacific for many years together, and only in February I traveled through the Pacific with several other Members of the Senate. We heard, from New Zealand to Australia and into Hawaii, comments about the Asian flu, what was taking place in Asia. Just recently when I went home, I was exposed to headlines which said, `Market Sales for Salmon Falling Off.' I talked to people involved in the coal industry, and they are worried about their markets in Asia. I talked to the people handling the great flow of freight 
through my State onto the Asian rim, people who handle freight that is on these wide-bodied airplanes. As my friend from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye, says, most people don't realize that four out of five wide-bodied airplanes that take cargo out of this country go west, not east. 
Everyone I have talked to is apprehensive of what is going on. We see our markets declining. We see our customers questioning whether they are going to buy in the future. The other side of the coin is that I had noticed we have already seen signs in Alaska of dumping of goods that are coming in from the Far East, where their markets are declining for consumer goods. They are bringing them to our country. It might be a good thing temporarily, but it is something that is very worrisome to those of us who live on the Pacific rim. 
Then I talk to my friends from the great grain belt of the country, and they tell me about the problem of the farmers who found a way to independence by opening up the global markets to our farm products, and the primary place where those farm products were sold, the increased production of our farms has been sold, in the Pacific rim. 
The Asian flu is the El Nino of economics. Unless we understand that, unless we understand the fear that is coming in our country, we are liable to make a great mistake. I do not want to see games played with the IMF. The IMF is serious to us, those of us who already have felt the touch of this wind that is coming to us from the Pacific rim. Unless we respond, and respond forcefully, and create the image of being willing to assist these people to come through this economic disaster, we will pay a high price. We will pay a price in not only our markets but in our prestige in the world. 
These people are expanding a private enterprise economy in a place where 15 years ago there really was not a private enterprise economy. They have had banks that have failed. So did we, 10 and 15 years ago. We should remember the savings and loan crisis and the other crises in banks we faced. 
The IMF reforms that Senator Hagel, Senator Roberts, and others have worked on--Senator Gramm--are good reforms, and they will bring transparency to the banks and the banking transactions. They will protect consumers in the area affected by the Asian flu. But they will also protect our people who want to sell to those markets and give them greater stability. 
The IMF money, to me, is money that creates the image of the United States being aware of what is going on and being willing to help, help in the sense of saying we will be there provided you reform. Crony capitalism cannot be allowed to spread throughout the world. The way we can stop that now is to act, and act forcibly, on IMF. 
I am one who is going to vote for IMF. It may be that others want to delay it, others want to handle it in different ways. I want to make sure that the first bill that goes to the President has IMF on it, and I hope the rest of the Senate will agree with me. We will have some discussions when we get to the House, but I want the House to know I am going to be arguing for IMF on the first bill that goes to the President. It should be something we act quickly on, for the benefit of this country. 
I am happy to yield the floor. The Senator from Texas has an amendment she wishes to call up, Mr. President.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to have that remain the pending amendment now so we can see if we can dispose of it. 
I am not sure we can do that before noon, but I hope that we can. I urge any Members who have any questions about this to come and discuss them with me. Unfortunately, Senator Kyl is not here. I am not sure whether he will be here today because of illness. It is not serious; he just has a problem, I am told. 
Let me say this to the Senate. I and a number of my colleagues have watched with concern as Iran has worked aggressively to develop longer range theater ballistic missiles. 
There have been many reports that a new Iranian missile, the Shahab-3, may be tested within the coming year. 
This new missile, with a range approaching 1,300 kilometers, can now reach targets in the Middle East that were previously not threatened by ballistic missiles from Iran. 
Further, the Shahab-3's velocity and range could require changes in our own theater missile defense systems currently under development. 
Obviously, our allies, particularly Israel, are very concerned about this new Iranian missile development effort. In parallel--and I believe this is of utmost importance--North Korea has continued to pursue the development of a longer range missile. They are working on the no dong and the taepo dong missiles. These missiles have created concern not just in Asia, but in my home State of Alaska, as well as in Hawaii, which is the home State of both of my colleagues from Hawaii. 
Now, I believe the Senate should know that the first targets within the reach of the longer range Korean missiles are in fact the States of Alaska and Hawaii. 
As a nation, I think we have to react swiftly to the threat posed by these new ballistic missile development and test efforts. 
Senator Kyl and others who have watched this issue closely have urged that we take action now to respond to this threat. Therefore, I have offered this amendment on behalf of Senator Kyl and myself to provide emergency appropriations to respond to this dangerous new threat. 
The amendment will provide $151 million for urgent development efforts which directly address these new missile threats. I might say that this matter has been reviewed by the Deputy Secretary of Defense. They have indicated that if additional resources are not made available, they can address these initiatives with reallocation of existing funds. Now, that is exactly what we don't want. The funds have already been allocated, and what this bill is doing is trying to make additional funds available to make up for the ones that have already been used in Bosnia and in the deployment in Southwest Asia. 
This amendment provides for better integration of Army and Navy missile defense systems and radars, for additional testing of the Patriot and lower tier systems against these longer range theater ballistic missiles, and other efforts which will link our existing sensors, communications, and weapon systems to defeat improved theater ballistic missiles. 
In addition, the amendment specifically provides funds to assist Israel in purchasing a third arrow missile battery. The capabilities of the emerging Iranian threat force us and Israel to add additional batteries to protect not only our forces, but our allies in Israel. 
Mr. President, I believe these efforts have some of the most urgent projects we could undertake in the Department of Defense. As I indicated, Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre wrote a letter bringing these needed investments to the attention of our colleagues in the House. The emergency supplemental before us provides an opportunity to deal with these critical investments. But we cannot do it from here directly. This amendment provides that the moneys in the amendment will only be available if there is an official budget estimate for the amounts that are designated to be an emergency. This would be in a request transmitted to the Congress as emergency requirements, as defined in the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended. 
Now, as I say, the amendment I offered for the Senator from 
Arizona, Mr. Kyl, does not make that money available. It will only be available if the administration agrees that there is a critical issue here and that these moneys should be available now to deal with these issues. 
Mr. President, we have troops, once again, stationed in this area. We do not have an adequate theater missile defense system. We don't have a missile defense system that is even currently planned for the total 50 States. When it was presented to our committee, the Department specifically pointed out that it was not possible for a period of 15 or more years to cover the States of Alaska and Hawaii. But a theater missile defense system would. 
I believe there is an emergency. I believe it is highly important that we proceed to make these investments. I do not think the investments should be made available from funds we have already appropriated for other critical projects in the Department; nor do I think we should defer acquisitions of new systems. That has been done too much already. 
Mr. President, we spent more time in the last 3 years reprogramming money we have already made available to the Department of Defense than we have in considering how much money should be available to the Department of Defense. I don't want to start the concept of reprogramming. What this does is, it says to the administration that if they are as serious as we are about proceeding now with the ballistic missile defense system--we have made the finding ourselves that it is an emergency, and we ask the President to simply make the decision. I hope the executive branch will agree that these funds will respond to security crises and the projects should be added. If they do not, these funds would not be available under this amendment. I do believe that my good friend from Hawaii wants to make a statement on the matter when he arrives.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this came to light during a hearing we held in the Defense Subcommittee of our Committee on Appropriations last week. Since that time, I have discussed it with members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other members in the armed services. 
These young people who go through the Challenge Program get a general equivalent degree, a GED, but under our existing law a person must have a high school diploma to enlist. This amendment covers only those people who come through that program with a GED. They will have spent 20 weeks or more with the National Guard in a semimilitary situation, and they go through and get their GED, which is acceptable to colleges and universities but not acceptable for enlistment in the Armed Forces. Having spent their time with the National Guard in its Challenge Program, many of them really want to continue and go into military service and continue their education as a member of the armed services. We believe that opportunity ought to be there for these young people who have made a commitment to change their lives and who have made a commitment that they want to be part of the military system. 
This, as I said, is something that is very limited in scope and only deals with a few hundred people in the country as a whole. But they are people that the Guard has worked with, and they have worked with the Guard. 
As I said, that was one of the most impressive hearings that I have conducted in the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. It was very emotional, really, to listen to these young people who came forward and told us they had problems with drugs, or being members of gangs, and they decided they wanted to change. And they have changed. One young man was in his second year at The Citadel. He got into The Citadel with a GED, but he could not have gotten into the Army, or the Navy, or the Air Force. We think that ought to change. 
This provision will change that. I believe it should be adopted. It has been cleared on both sides, and Senator Byrd wishes to be listed as a cosponsor.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am informed that this amendment is acceptable on both sides. This substitute is very similar to the original section 2004 of the bill before the Senate. We have made some changes based upon input from several Senators in segments of the telecommunications industry. 
This amendment and legislation addresses the fact that the GAO has determined that the Federal Communications Commission established the Schools and Library and Rural Health Care Corporations in violation of the Government Corporations Control Act. That law states that agencies must have specific statutory authority to establish such corporations. 
Our bipartisan bill urges the FCC to come to Congress with an acceptable structure. Our effort also mandates that the FCC report to Congress by May 8 of each year on the cost of this program. 
Consumers experienced a 4.9 percent rate increase on their business phone bills after initial collections to fund this program. Congress needs to know why rates went up and how we can avoid such an outcome in the future. 
I want to personally thank Senators Hollings, McCain, Burns, Dorgan, and Rockefeller for their help with this amendment. As I said, it has now been found acceptable to both sides as a substitute to the provisions that are in this bill as reported by the committee. I urge its adoption.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I announce that this morning's session will be one where we resume consideration of the emergency supplemental appropriations bill, with hope of concluding action on the bill during today's session. 
As under a previous consent agreement, from 12:30 to 2:15 the Senate will recess for the weekly policy luncheons to meet. As a reminder to all Members, the second cloture vote on H.R. 2646, the Coverdell A+ education bill, is scheduled to occur at 5:30 p.m. if an agreement cannot be reached prior to that time. In addition, by consent, all second-degree amendments to that legislation must be filed by 4:30 p.m. 
Again, it is hoped that good progress can be made on the emergency supplemental appropriations bill during today's session. All Members should contact either Senator Byrd or myself regarding this legislation if they intend to offer an amendment as the Senate attempts to complete action on this supplemental appropriations bill before the cloture vote. 
Also, it is hoped that headway will be made on the Coverdell education bill. In addition, the Senate may consider any executive or legislative items cleared for action. And, on behalf of the majority leader, I thank our colleagues for their attention to his message.

Mr. STEVENS. For myself, let me say this, Mr. President. If we do get cloture on the Coverdell bill, that will mean we cannot finish this bill, the supplemental, until the cloture time has expired. We believe that we are very close to having cloture on the Coverdell bill, and it is imperative that we finish this supplemental bill so that when the House passes its bill we can go immediately to conference. It is our intent to take this bill through third reading and have it ready for immediate action without any further requests, based on a unanimous-consent agreement, to send the bill to the House for conference as soon as we are aware that the House bill has been received in the Senate. 
That means it is imperative, if Senators believe, as I do, that our first job must be to assure we do not take money from the defense accounts to repay the costs of the deployment that has already been made in Bosnia, already been made in southwest Asia. If we cannot get this bill passed before April 1, that money is going to start coming out of the readiness accounts that apply to the men and women in the armed services who are still deployed in the continental U.S. and throughout areas other than Bosnia and the Iraq area. 
The consequence of not passing this bill before April 1 is that the people who may have to be sent over to replace those already deployed--and we are making our rotations every 6 months--might not have the readiness and the edge that they need to go into a combat area. It is just imperative that we pass this bill before April 1. I have said that before on the floor. I again urge Senators to realize there is a timeframe problem on this bill and we do not want it to get involved in waiting for the cloture period on the A+ bill to expire. 
I hope Senators will contact us. We are more than willing to consider any amendment. I hope Senators will listen to us 
with regard to time limits on their amendments. And we do have a pending amendment. Senator Ashcroft is here to present his amendment. As soon as that is over, we really have a schedule of amendments ready to proceed, and I hope Senators will come as we call them and assist us by entering into time agreements. The time we will be taking off for the period of the luncheons is certain. 
I remind Senators, tonight we start a new routine--the leader's seminars that are going to take place, with the distinguished former majority leader coming at 6 p.m., in the Old Senate Chamber, for Members only. A chance to listen to the former majority leader, Senator Mansfield, I think is something we must all make time for. It is a memorable thing. We are starting, I think, a great new tradition in the Senate from today.

Mr. STEVENS. The Senator makes a good request, and I will consult with the majority leader on that. As the Senator knows, we took almost 2 hours yesterday on that bill. But I do think it would be a fair thing to have a period prior to the vote at 5:30 so both sides might state their positions. 
It is not our intention this morning to have any morning hour time. We have Senator Ashcroft's amendment pending. Senator Hutchison is waiting to bring up an amendment, and there are other amendments waiting in line behind that. So it is our hope that we can dispose of many of those this morning if possible. And if we can, that will mean we can open up some time later in the afternoon for a period for the discussion of the Senator from Massachusetts. I hope that is agreeable.

Mr. STEVENS. This amendment was offered last evening and is the pending amendment. It needs to be disposed of. I hope as soon as possible we will dispose of this amendment and move on to another amendment that Senator Hutchison also discussed 
last night, and that is the amendment pertaining to some conditions on the Bosnia deployment. That is relevant to the money in the bill. We expect to get to that as soon as possible. 
But I commit to the Senator from Massachusetts, we will notify him if there is a lull in activities here and try to accommodate his request for some morning hour time. Senator Coverdell still has about 20 minutes coming under the agreement we reached yesterday for equal time, under the discussion that took place yesterday, but now that has to be accommodated, and we will do our best to do so. 
I yield to Senator Ashcroft.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, to begin with, let me say to my friend from Texas, I hope he will never again say that this Senator brought a bill to the floor to cheat. If he wants to start arguments here sometime, this Senator is fairly well ready for that. But I will just put that aside for now and discuss the merits of the issue that the Senator has brought to the Senate. 
We have followed the Budget Act. If you look at our report that we filed with the Senate, on page 36, Members of the Senate will see the 5-year projection of outlays is in compliance with section 308(a)(1)(C) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 as amended. We have provided the 5-year projection associated with the budget authority that we provide in this bill. There are, in fact, follow-on costs for the outlays for moneys that are expended this year. They have to continue to spend for a period of years, and the Budget Act requires us to do this. It requires us not only to do it but to inform the Senate how much it is going to cost. There has been no cheating here. As a matter of fact, we have gone out of our way to make certain we have complied to the exact letter 
and dot and paragraph of that bill. 
Now, I want the Senate to know the effect of this amendment was just the contrary to what the Senator from Pennsylvania said. If we do not provide this money on the basis of ongoing accounts based upon the emergency that exists now, every year subsequently, when there are amounts to be expended, the commanders will have to do the reverse of what the Senator from Pennsylvania said. They will have to take something out of their budget. Remember, we have a flat line budget now for 5 years. They will have to take something out to accommodate for an emergency that existed in 1998. We are providing money pursuant to the President's designation of an emergency, primarily for Southwest Asia and for Bosnia. 
There are ongoing costs to this emergency. We have deployed people to Kuwait City and to the Persian Gulf. When the emergency is over, they will have to be brought back. Those costs are part of the emergency. But under the amendment of the Senator from Texas, they will be part of the normal operating costs of that year, and it will be just that much less available for training or for acquisition, for procurement of various items. Whatever the bill authorizes that year, these moneys will have to come out first because they have already been obligated first. 
For instance, the Department of Defense estimates that it will cost $250 million to redeploy these forces that went to Southwest Asia. Once they are redeployed to the United States, they are reconstituted in their units, and that cost of reassociating with various units, the total cost of that is $250 million. That is still part of the emergency. That is not something that is just a normal event taking place in subsequent years, in the year 1999 or the year 2000. The impact of what the Senator from Texas has suggested would be to say: `The President can declare an emergency and have the funds not be counted for this year only' means that the emergency is over on September 30. Right? Wrong. Even if the deployment stopped at the end of September 30--I hope it will stop sooner--there would be ongoing costs associated with the emergency, and that is what we have covered as the Budget Act requires us to cover. 
If this emergency designation is lifted, what are the consequences in 1999? We go into 1999, according to the CBO, with a $3.7 billion outlay deficit. What the Senator from Texas is saying is, notwithstanding that, we are going to add all the costs associated with the emergency from 1998 that are actually paid in 1999. If you talk about complicating the bookkeeping of the Department of Defense, I don't know of any better way to do it. If there is $400 million that remains unobligated as of September 30, and it pays out in 1999, CBO is going to score that $400 million for 1999. Even though it was an obligation that came about because of the 1998 emergency, and it is spent in 1999, we are going to have to take $400 million out. I wonder how many things are going to come out of Texas or Pennsylvania if that happens. 
I am not going to do it because that is over to the Department of Defense. But I can assure you that any State involved that has outlays is going to suffer, and the program will be reduced. Accommodating this amendment will bring about $2 billion in 1999 of budget authority being utilized because it will take the outlays for that year based upon procurement rates of outlays and say you cannot start $2 billion worth of acquisitions because of an emergency that happened in 1998. We should tell the Department of Defense, cancel the F-18s, cancel the ships, cancel whatever it is we are going to try to procure. I am talking about procurement outlays, which are the ones that are going to suffer the most. 
Mr. President, we have in this proposal--the Budget Act is very wise, really. There is an incentive to manage the money correctly, to not wish to spend it before the end of this year. The effect of the Senator's amendment would be if you can get the money spent before the end of the fiscal year, then you can take it all off this year, it doesn't count. But if you take anything into the next year, guess what. It counts against your next year's outlay allowance. So what does that do? It is a rush to the cash 
register for September 30; a total disincentive to manage money right. 
I have seen amendments that have been brought to the floor that attempted to reconstruct the whole apparatus of the Budget Act, and I have to say I have some problems with the Budget Act, and the Senate will hear about those later with regard to scoring. But this is not one of them. The Budget Act was correct. When we have an emergency or a disaster--this would cover the disaster money too, by the way. 
I don't quite understand what they are doing, because we have disasters. When we had our great earthquake in 1964, we did not pay for some of those things that we had to do until 1966. Look at what is going on in Georgia right now, and Mississippi and Alabama. Does anyone think that all of those levees are going to be reconstructed by September 30? I want the Senate to start thinking, and, above all, I want to say again, I want the Senator from Texas to be careful when he accuses this Senator of cheating with an appropriations bill. That does not go down lightly with me. 
I remember the days before when I saw majority Members arguing, and I can tell you the majority didn't last very long. The majority doesn't last very long when people come out and accuse chairmen of motives that are just absolutely unfounded. 
Mr. President, at the appropriate time I will move to table the Senator's amendment. I can tell the Senate I will remember the Senators who do not vote to table this amendment.

<TEXT>
Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the law we passed in August 1997, Public Law 105-33, contains this provision, which is the one I referred to before, but I want to read it now. It pertains to sequestration. When the OMB determines spending--they determine whether we lived up to the caps that are in the budget agreement--it first is instructed to examine those budgets. What it says is this: 
OMB shall calculate in the sequestration report and subsequent budgets submitted by the President under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, shall include adjustments to discretionary spending limits and those limits as adjusted for the fiscal year in and each succeeding year through 2002 as follows: Emergency appropriations--If for any fiscal year appropriations for discretionary accounts are enacted that the President designates as emergency requirements and the Congress so designates in statute, the adjustment shall be the total of such appropriations in discretionary accounts designated as emergency requirements and the outlays flowing in all fiscal years from such appropriations. 
Mr. President, what we are looking at is a finding by the Congressional Budget Office which has determined--that is what we put in our report on page 36, the 5-year projection. Incidentally, just as a footnote, I hope everyone knows, they assumed we won't pass this bill, it won't become law until July 1; therefore, the outlays cannot be made until subsequently in July, possibly August and September. So they moved into 1999 a considerable amount of money that actually is going to be spent this year because we are going to pass this bill and it is going to become law before the end of April. There is no question about that. It will, hopefully, become law the 1st of April. 
But in any event, what has happened is we have complied with the law, and the law says we list the amounts. Although they are authorized for emergencies that have taken place this year, the spending may continue for a series of years. 
The Senator used an interesting analogy about Johnny breaking his arm. We have disaster money here, and there are lots of homes that have been broken. If those homes were covered by insurance, they take a look at it, the insurance adjustor says we are going to pay X dollars, and you proceed to spend that money over a period of 
years. You get it from your insurance account. 
They don't come by and say, `OK, you only get the amount of money you can spend this year.' That is what the Senator from Texas is saying. The disaster account is a taxpayer insurance against the calamity of disasters that take place in this country. And as such, the impact of the Senator's amendment--anyone who has had a disaster in their State this year better listen to me now because he is saying that all you can do is count the emergency only for the money that can be spent this year. It is outlays. Very little of that money is going to be outlaid this year. We know that. It is primarily the disaster money that is carried out for a period of years. 
The Senator mentions Bosnia, and I have opposed the Bosnian deployment. He is not correct in saying we have not budgeted and spent money, programmed money on a nonemergency basis. We have, in fact, appropriated money for Bosnia. We did this year but only through July 1. The emergency came about when the President of the United States found that we could not withdraw. Under his determination and the Joint Chiefs, they decided we have to stay there. We face the problem of paying between now and July 1 and through the end of the year for that deployment. 
If we do not put up the money, the money comes, as I said before, from the readiness accounts for moneys we have already appropriated for the fiscal year 1998. That will mean the readiness accounts for the rest of the military not deployed to Bosnia or to Southwest Asia will pay the cost of the emergency. 
Mr. President, that is a nice question, whether this is an emergency, but the President has declared it is an emergency and we have agreed it should be an emergency because we really believed when we made the bill up last year for 1998 that the troops would be out by July 1. 
Having done that, we spent the balance of the money in the procurement accounts and in the readiness accounts. We were operating under a ceiling. What the Senator from Texas does now, if it is not considered emergency as the President declares it is an emergency, is we have to go back, as I said, and take it out of moneys that we put into, whatever it might be--aircraft acquisition, whatever it might be--in the Department of Defense. 
It is not easy to find that kind of money, particularly when we have troops deployed in the field. Over 40 percent of our personnel are deployed overseas right now. If we are going to readjust anything, it has to be in the procurement accounts, and the procurement does not outlay dollar for dollar. If we cancel procurement, we only probably get 10, 15, 20 percent adjustment for outlays. 
Again, I say, it will take billions from the 1990 account to deal with the millions that are involved in this bill for expenditure. 
I am not going to belabor it except to say, once again, this is a killer amendment. I think it is against the Budget Act. I leave that to the Senator from New Mexico. I hope he will talk about it. At least in purpose it is against it. I think actually it is subject to a point of order, but I don't intend to raise a point of order. If the Senate doesn't understand this amendment, it doesn't understand defense economics and defense spending. I understand there are some people here who want to put the screws on us in terms of the next year. 
Remember this, Mr. President. We have no firewall between defense and nondefense next year. We have to legislate it if we can get it. The effect of this is to take money out of defense when defense is already going to be under attack as far as money in 1999. 
I just cannot be emphatic enough to deal with this in terms of what it means. It means that we are readjusting the concept of the accounting for emergency money. If you look at just the disaster account alone, it reneges on the commitment we have made to the people who are in the disaster area to help them pay for the cost of adjusting to that disaster. 
My State has more disasters than any State in the Union. We don't have any right now, except me, and I feel like a disaster right now because I really don't like this amendment. 
I think if Members of the Senate think about it, they will understand what we have done. This amendment impacts defense most damagingly because the funds for Southwest Asia assume current force levels and the current op tempo--the tempo of operations. We made these moneys available until expended. That means they can be expended in 1999 and subsequent years. That gives an incentive to the Department to manage their money wisely and not rush to expend it before the end of this year. 
The effect of the Senator's amendment would be to reverse that decision of our committee. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Mr. STEVENS. I say to the Senator, I do not know if a disaster can recover under that situation--not one. We declared a disaster in South Dakota. We declared a disaster because of the earthquakes in California. We did it because of the fact we had to have the emergency designation in order to spend the money. 
As a matter of fact, the Senator from New Mexico says there was not enough money. We had to add to it. That is what we are doing to it; we are adding to the money that we previously had. But whatever you spend in connection with these disasters, you do not have to account for it at the time of sequestration. It is only at the time of sequestration.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, let me make sure that everybody understands what we are voting on. The Senator from Texas complains--and I think rightly--that we are spending really a great deal of money on disasters. They grow every year, and it is because the moneys that we have allocated to disasters under authorization laws and under regulations have increased. 
I tell the Senator that the money available during the period right after the great earthquake in Alaska in 1964 compared to the amount of money that was available to those people who were harmed by the California earthquake--the California program for recovery--was much more heavily financed, and necessarily so. New concepts of assistance have grown since that time. 
If the Senator wants to examine and ask the Congress to examine and put limits on what we spend after a disaster, this Senator would be pleased to work with him on it. If the Senator wants to say that we ought to predict how much money we are going to have available for disasters and put a cap on that, this Senator would never agree with that. 
If the great Madrid Fault down by Tennessee ever slips again, as it did in the middle of the last century, to the extent that the bells in Boston rang when that earthquake took place in the middle of our continent, if that would happen today, the cost of that disaster would be just overwhelming. There is no way to predict how much money we are going to spend on disasters. 
As applied to this bill now, I say to the Senator, if the Senate adopts this amendment, I will move to recommit this bill to the Appropriations Committee because we cannot afford to have such a heavy balance on the 1999 bill that we are working on now for fiscal year 1999 if the Senate adopts the amendment of the Senator from Texas. Disasters aside, the major impact of this amendment is on defense. It would say that any moneys that are spent for the Bosnian or Iraqi deployments after September 30 would count against the allocations that we are already looking at for 1999 under the budget that the President has submitted to us. 
I have said before to the Senate, we believe that the impact of this amendment would mean procurement cuts--cuts in the amount of money we allocate to procurement of $2 billion in 1999. That is because when we authorized the use of $2 billion in 1999, the amount that actually would be spent would be about $400 million. That is what it does to the bill we are planning now. 
I just do not think that we should have a supplemental that so hamstrings the budget for the full year of 1999 in a way that was never contemplated by the President's budget nor is it contemplated by the budget before the Budget Committee and ready for submission to the Senate. This issue should come up but should come up in other ways, and that is how much money we will spend per person on a disaster. 
Does the Senator seek time before I make a motion to table?

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am grateful to the Senator from Arizona for raising these issues, and I think it is good to have a dialog on what we are doing. I am trying to get the answer to the question the Senator asks. 
On page 14 of the report, we report that we have recommended $4 million for the development of the electric wall accelerator technology, in the atomic energy division of the Department of Energy. It is fully offset by a reduction in Federal funds for defense. It is not an emergency; it is not an add-on. It really is a reprogramming through this bill. I understand it is at the request of the Department. It was presented by a Senator to the full Appropriations Committee. I might add, I am a member of the committee and I am trying to get further information about the wall accelerator technology. It is related to the smaller accelerators, I am told, not the large types. It is a $4 million item using money that has already been allocated to another form of defense activity and moved over to this, and the other account has been reduced accordingly. 
I might say, this is one of my problems about the bill, Mr. President, because when we reprogram this money, it is my understanding that the Congressional Budget Office still charges us with the original $4 million and the second $4 million. This is what has led us into this great debate with the Office of Management and Budget and the CBO about the scoring for the purpose of our Budget Act of transfers, reprogrammings, and recessions. I hope to talk about that at a later time. 
I note, also, the Senator has given us a list of the items. He is correct; there is no question about it that Olympics cost us money. There isn't a nation in the world that doesn't fight to have Olympics. I have just come back now from Australia where I looked at the venue for the Olympics to be held in the year 2000 by that country. I can tell the Senator that every National Government expends substantial funds. I saw the changes in the wharfs, I saw the changes in the site. As a matter of fact, they are making an addition to one of their national parks as their venue for their world Olympics. There is a considerable amount that will be spent there in the effort to assure that those games are carried on to meet their national needs. Many of these items really are moneys that are in advance of expenditures under other Federal programs. 
I also went up to look at the site of the 2002 Winter Olympics. I am sure the Senator remembers, as chairman of the Commerce Committee, my interest in the Olympic movement. I can report that he is absolutely correct. This is not the last time we will hear about the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. It does require a substantial change in traffic patterns there, both in terms of rail and road connections, to assure that we can handle in this country the tremendous number of foreign visitors who will come to our country when we once again host the 2002 Winter Olympics. 
Beyond that, Mr. President, as I said, as I look at these questions that the Senator has raised, there is no question that there are terrible ice storms in the Northeast. One of the substantial problems there is to make available funds for the damage that occurred there in the area where they produce, as one of the major economic activities, the maple syrup. That is a lot of money, but it is something that we looked at, and it is consistent with the precedence of the Senate in dealing with the disaster. We accepted the amendment in regard to that. 
I personally, as I told the Senate, went to Georgia, met with the people handling the transportation activities in Georgia, and at the time met others who were involved in dealing with some of the difficulties that were encountered there in the floods. I did not make a trip to Alabama and Mississippi, but I did get a briefing on levy and waterway repairs in both of those States, and I believe that money that the Senator from Arizona has questioned is within, again, the precedence of the Senate in dealing with emergency funding. 
As a matter of fact, I might say to my friend from Arizona, we expect either today or tomorrow another request from the administration for FEMA money, Federal Emergency Management money, because of the two very difficult storms that occurred the past weekend. That money must be added to this bill or wait until fall when we approve the regular bill. I do not expect we will have another supplemental between now and consideration of the regular appropriations bills for the fiscal year 1999. That could change, but I do not expect it at this time. 
The road moratorium money is another item here that was questioned, section 405, that requires payments to counties to replace funds counties expected to receive from the timber road construction projects. This is another precedent established by the Congress. As a matter of fact, it was established in my State of Alaska when, by action of the Forest Service and the Department of Agriculture, existing programs for road construction and for timber utilization were canceled and there was, in fact, passed by the Congress a substantial bill to replace those funds for a period of time because the schools in these counties where the timber activity takes place relied to a great extent on the revenue-sharing provisions of Federal law to maintain the schools. We have taken action in the past to replace funds under similar circumstances, and this section of this bill is to continue that precedent, also. 
I am pleased to try and answer any other question the Senator has. To deal with a bill of this type, you have to come back to the concept of the eye of the beholder. I honor and respect the Senator from Arizona as chairman of the authorizing committee that looks very carefully at all of the funds that are authorized in the normal process. This type of bill--a supplemental appropriations bill, disaster appropriations bill, and a defense emergency appropriations bill--relies to a great extent on items that have not been authorized. They are authorized by virtue of the very nature of the occurrence as disaster or emergency or defense matters, and, as such, these matters that the Senator from Arizona has raised have not been reviewed by the legislative committees and they should be fully examined by all Members of the Senate. I invite all Members of the Senate to examine these matters. We tried to go into these in depth in the Appropriations Committee and, because of the time circumstance, we may not have gone into each one to the extent we should, but I was convinced as chairman, and I know that other members of the committee were convinced through their own listening of the presentations, that these items do merit the approval of the Senate as legitimate disaster expenses or as legitimate funds to replace funds already spent by the Department of Defense. 
This defense money is to replace the money that has been spent and is necessary to be spent in terms of the deployment to Southwest Asia and in Bosnia, and they are declared emergencies. I believe they should be so classified.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we have a series of amendments that have been agreed to on both sides. I would like to just review them and make sure the Democratic members of the committee and their staffs concur that these are the ones that have been cleared. 
Let me read them. Then I will send them all to the desk at one time. 
First, I propose an amendment to make technical corrections to section 405 to the bill that pertains to the Forest Service transportation system moratorium. That has been cleared on both sides. I offer it on behalf of Senator Craig. It has been also cleared by the chairman of the subcommittee involved. 
I have a second amendment. This is offered on behalf of the distinguished minority leader, Senator Daschle. It deals with emergency river and shoreline repairs along the Missouri River. That has been cleared on both sides. 
I have another amendment on behalf of Senator Cochran, Senator Bumpers, Senator D'Amato and Senator Boxer. It deals with assistance to replace and rehabilitate trees and vineyards damaged by natural disasters. 
I have an amendment on behalf of Senator Boxer that deals with emergency levee repairs at Suisun Marsh in California. That has been cleared on both sides. 
Mr. President, I have another amendment on behalf of the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye. It deals with Apra Harbor in Guam. That is another emergency amendment and has been cleared. 
Another amendment on behalf of Senator Cochran and Senator 
Bumpers, that deals with additional boll weevil eradication loans. It is for the amount of $222,000. This is to the natural disaster bill and emergency defense bill, but it is to correct a shortfall in the fiscal year 1998 appropriation due to an interest rate subsidy miscalculation. So it is to correct an error in the previous law. 
I have another amendment that has been cleared on both sides. It is on behalf of Senator Boxer. It deals with not applying changes in a prior act of Congress to the projects that are resulting from fall and winter flooding. 
Mr. President, there is another amendment here that I offer on behalf of the majority leader and Senators Lieberman, Gregg, Hollings, Kyl, myself, McConnell, Helms, Shelby, Brownback and Kerrey. It deals with the availability of funds for the activities in connection with the Iraqi Democratic opposition; the second portion of this deals with the establishment of Radio Free Iraq. That has been cleared on both sides. 
To my knowledge, those are all the amendments that we have cleared. I now send these to the desk. I ask unanimous consent they be reported and the amendments be considered en bloc.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider the supplemental appropriations bill. It is a bill for emergency disaster needs and for overseas military operations. 
Our Committee on Appropriations reported this bill, S. 1768, along with S. 1769, on Tuesday, March 17. S. 1769 provides funds for the International Monetary Fund. We reported both of these bills by one roll call vote, and that vote was 26-2. I call that to the attention of the Senate because it indicates a substantial agreement within our committee on the terms of these two bills. 
Prior to the date we reported this bill, the administration had transmitted four supplemental or rescission messages to the Congress for 1998. This bill addresses each of those requests and makes other adjustments based on our committee's review of agency needs and priorities. 
Our committee originated this bill ahead of the House Committee on Appropriations in order to complete action on these two urgent measures prior to the April recess. We have also done it to get ahead of some of the problems that are involved in the cloture votes before the Senate, because we just don't want this bill to be held up by the period of time that has to run if we do vote cloture on any other measure. 
We have consulted with the House committee, and particularly the House committee chairman, on this approach, and I am pleased that the House understands what we are doing. The House committee will take up these two matters later this week. It is our hope that both of the bills will be in conference by the last week of March. 
We have to have these bills passed before the recess. 
That is necessary, as I will explain later, as far as military implications and the disaster moneys that are involved. In order to do that, we must start this bill today and finish the bill before the cloture vote tomorrow, which is scheduled for 5:30 tomorrow evening.

<TEXT>
Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am going to speak for a few minutes about the issue of NATO expansion, and I want to offer these two amendments today. These amendments, I believe, will serve to bring greater accountability to the unresolved issue of the additional costs that will result with the accession of Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic to the NATO alliance. 
My first amendment requires all costs related to either the admission of new NATO members or their participation in NATO to be specifically authorized by law prior to the payment of these costs. I am speaking of the U.S. costs. Our U.S. costs would have to be specifically authorized by law before they could be paid. 
Actually, this ought to be the proper interpretation of the Constitution. But too often we find that costs--particularly those of foreign policy objectives supported by the Department of Defense--are incurred and then we are asked to pay for them in the budget process later. 
The costs related to NATO enlargement are still general estimates, but the debate is continuing as to what is actually required and what portion of these requirements should be paid by the NATO common budgets. These estimates will continue to evolve and change in the coming months, well past the completion of the NATO expansion debates here in this Chamber. 
U.S. costs could increase as NATO finalizes its implementation plans and eligibility criteria for common funding, or if new member countries have problems paying for infrastructure improvements. A Congressional Budget Office study released last week confirms that the United States is likely to incur bilateral costs for expanded exercises, training, and programs to incorporate NATO compatible equipment into the central European militaries. 
My amendment would ensure a more accurate accounting for, and explanation of, the actual costs related to NATO enlargement as the process continues to develop. 
My second amendment will restrict the use of funds for payment of NATO costs after September 30 of this year unless the Secretaries of Defense and State certify to the Congress that the total percentage of NATO common costs paid by the United States will not exceed 20 percent during the NATO fiscal year. Historically, NATO has not systematically reviewed or renegotiated member cost shares for the common budgets. This amendment would effectively require a reduction of the U.S. percentage paid in support of NATO common budget costs from a historic average of 24 or 25 percent. And I believe it is actually higher than that, but that is the average that they use. This is a reassessment that is long overdue in light of U.S. global defense responsibilities. 
We have to remember that NATO was formed at the time when we were coming out of World War II, before the United States had started really to carry out its global responsibilities. When Spain joined NATO in 1982, there were pro rata adjustments to the civil and military budget shares based upon Spain's increased contribution. No other formal renegotiations have occurred since 1955 in these two common budget areas. The NSIP--or NATO infrastructure budget--has been adjusted five times since 1960, but that was due more to the way projects were approved and funded than any actual attempt to reallocate the percentages. 
With the amount included in the emergency supplemental that we will consider today, the United States will have expended over $7.5 
billion for operations in and around Bosnia and the former Yugoslavia by the end of fiscal year 1998. Mr. President, it is estimated that the United States is paying over 50 percent of the costs of maintaining the peace in Bosnia--nearly $200 million a month in 1997 alone--and there is no end in sight to the U.S. presence there with the President's decision to keep deployments there indefinitely. 
Our defense overseas funding in NATO countries--the cost of maintaining our forces there, including the operations and maintenance, military pay, family housing, and military construction--now averages nearly $10 billion a year. Security assistance to the NATO allies since 1950--this is the military assistance and military education and training--has totaled over $19 billion. 
No other member of NATO has the global defense role of the United States, nor does any other member have the forward-deployed presence in potential flash point areas such as the Middle East or the Korean peninsula. 
There is just no alternative but to take the two steps that I am going to ask the Senate to propose to the House and to the President by these two amendments. 
I would like to introduce the amendments. 
The first is an amendment that I mentioned to require prior specific authorization of funds before U.S. funds may be used to pay NATO enlargement costs. It is cosponsored by Senators Byrd, Campbell, Roberts, Thurmond, and Warner. 
The second amendment is the amendment to require that certification of payments to NATO will not cause the U.S. share of NATO common budget accounts or activities to exceed 20 percent, and that is cosponsored by Senators Byrd, Campbell, Roberts and Warner. 
I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I am constrained to come here in two roles. One is as chairman of the Appropriations Committee. And I am certain everyone will understand that problem. This is, obviously, a situation in which we negotiated a very tightly wrapped package, and it will eventually come to our committee. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia and I will allocate money under it. 
The real difficulty I see with the amendment of the Senator from Florida is, having reached an agreement of what to do with the 4.3 cents of the tax revenue, now that we have transferred it to the highway trust fund, it would be repealed. I just cannot understand an attempt to do that at this time, I say respectfully to my friend. 
I do understand people who are insisting that the donor States ought to be totally recognized to get 100 percent of their money back, and this obviously would be one way to do that. 
I am here in the second role as a Senator from the largest State in the Union, 20 percent of the landmass in the United States. I repeat for the Senate, we have a thousand miles more of roads now than when we became a State almost 40 years ago. We are completely locked out of this highway program. 
I wonder what Dwight D. Eisenhower, the person I consider to be one of the greatest leaders of the 20th century, would feel about the concept that roads would only be built by those people who lived within the State. The national concept of highways was, in fact, the Eisenhower dream, and it has been fulfilled in the Interstate Highway System, but the difficulty is it does not reach our State. 
Furthermore, this concept that people who drove from Florida to Alaska would suddenly stop at the border and be told, `Sorry, we don't have tax revenues, so we can't build you any roads,' or you drove to Seattle and went to the dock where we currently maintain the ferries for citizens of the United States and others to come to Alaska by Alaskan-owned and operated ferries--you would find out they wouldn't be there any longer. 
The concept of highways in this country has always been a national concept, and I have always thought, as I paid my gasoline taxes as I drove across the country--and I have driven across the country and up to my State many times--as we drive even into our neighboring country of Canada, we pay a Canadian gasoline tax. It never entered my mind that the Canadians somehow would think I was a Canadian citizen paying taxes in Canada. 
Nor do I think that all the people who travel on the roads in Florida or any of the rest of these roads around the country are necessarily residents of that State. The States collect the taxes, but they certainly have no right to collect the taxes from people from outside their State who are traveling through that State to come to mine. 
The idea of repealing this gas tax at this time is just completely abhorrent to this Senator's way of thinking. But beyond that, I am here, once again, to say to the sponsor of this amendment, the amendment is unfair, basically, to the States that do not have the highways totally constructed yet. 
This is a bill to improve existing highways, not to 
continue the idea of making sure that there are highways in this country to reach every portion of this great continent that Americans who travel with their families, travel in RVs, travel in their personal automobiles want to go. I just can't believe we are going to abandon the concept that there is one national system of highways. And if there is a national system of highways, some of this highway money has to trickle into Alaska. 
Somehow or another, we have to find some way--I see the Senator from Oklahoma smiling. I wonder what would have happened if I just returned from Philadelphia, and suppose we put in the Constitution that there would be no money spent coming from the original 13 States beyond the confines of the 13 States. That is what you are saying--you cannot spend money beyond our State if it was taken into the Treasury through our State. 
Again, I say to the Senate advisably, we send 25 percent of the oil of the United States to the United States, to what we call the `south 48,' every day--every day. It is the oil that is used to produce the gasoline that your States tax. The taxes are derived from that oil. They do not come back to our State. 
How about we put in a provision that says 100 percent of the revenue of the United States from the development of any resource in any State comes back to that State? Would that be agreeable? Would the Senator from Florida like to see that? We have the store house of the United States as far as resources are concerned. We would be able to build roads then, Madam President. 
As long as we base this concept that the money has to go back to the very State in which it was collected from any citizen of the United States traveling through the United States, no matter where they are from, it goes back to the State that collected the money, then we won't have a National Highway System. 
I am against this concept of repealing this tax. I hope that the Senate will find that the point of order is well taken. I congratulate the Senator from Virginia for making it.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are down to the point where this Senator wants to get some information. I don't serve on this committee, so I want to serve notice to the managers that I have a series of questions I want to ask them. 
I keep being told that the money under this bill is allocated, that there is no way at all to consider any amendments that might deal with the marine highway system. 
So, in the course of the next few hours, I intend to find out what has happened to the money that is in this bill and why there is no money to fulfill the needs of our State. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum, until I get the information that my staff is bringing.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, my amendment will extend and provide a modest increase for the national ferry program under section 1064 of the previous ISTEA bill. The old ferry program provided $18 million a year nationwide in contract authority for ferry boat and ferry terminal construction. We have raised that to an average of $30 million per year in contract authority and in addition have authorized $20 million to be appropriated. The amendment would require that $12 million per year of the $30 million of contract authority be used for ferries, ferry terminals, and approaches to ferry terminals within marine highway systems which are part of the national highway system. As many of my colleagues know, the Alaska Marine Highway System is unique in this nation in that Congress has deemed it important enough to designate it as part of the national highway system. Alaska is by far the largest state in the union. We possess half of all the coastline, twenty percent of all the border, and almost half of all the federal lands in the United States. 
For these and other reasons, the amendment is of particular importance to Alaska. Alaska has very few roads. In fact, our State capitol lies within an area of Alaska the size of West Virginia which contains no intercity roads at all. Practically all of this land is federally-owned, and the present Administration has made it very difficult for us to build roads on federal lands in Alaska. Ferries are the only form of surface transportation for Alaskans in this area. The ferries currently serving Alaska are almost thirty years old. The oldest ones have been in service since the Kennedy Administration. These vessels must be replaced soon. 
I would also like to point out that twenty percent of the nation's oil comes from Alaska. Our oil produces 25 million gallons of gasoline each day. This translates to $1.6 billion dollars in gas taxes going straight to the federal Treasury, for which Alaska gets no credit whatsoever. This money is on top of the income taxes paid into the Treasury by the oil companies and their employees in my state. Alaska gets no credit in the highway formula for fueling the nation's cars. While this amendment does not help us build more roads, it will improve transportation for many Alaskans. 
A number of Senators (Inouye, Akaka, Lautenberg, Breaux, Murray, Faircloth, Kerry, Kennedy, Snowe, Collins, Moynihan, Helms, and Reed) had joined Senator Murkowski and me in an earlier amendment that would have provided $50 million per year in contract authority for ferries. While this compromise does not provide all of the funding needed for ferries nationwide, it is an improvement over the existing program. 
Mr. President, again, this will amend the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act reauthorization for the ferries and ferry terminals. It has been under discussion here for some time. I am delighted that we now have an allocation of contract authority that could be applied to this. It also provides for an authorization for appropriations for the balance of the months we needed for the circumstances I described previously.

Mr. STEVENS. I might say to the leader, I am one of those who is disturbed over this `donor' or `donee' designation. As I said the other day, my State is in neither circumstance because we don't have the roads yet. I don't know what this does to us as far as the process is concerned. 
May I inquire, before this cloture vote, will we have a breakdown and analysis of the bill on what each State would be entitled to? I have been trying to get that, and I have seen several different versions of what each State is entitled to under the bill. But beyond that, I have some questions about what happens to States that don't have roads. 
We have the situation in our State where we are trying to build roads. This bill basically deals with the improvement of existing roads. I think this donor/donee thing sort of means maybe we ought to have a referendum to see whether the State of Alaska can become independent rather than Puerto Rico, because we would be much better off with the money we send to the Treasury. We send money to the Treasury in terms of the revenue from 25 percent of the oil that is produced in the United States. We try to get some of that back in terms of highways and find out we can't do it. I find that it's getting a little serious, as far as we are concerned. 
Mr. Leader, I looked, and we have increased the number of miles of roads in our State by 1,100 miles in 40 years. But we had none to start with. Alaska is one-fifth the size of the United States. I am afraid what this means, suddenly, is that we are shut out again for another 6 years. The leader may remember that I had a little bit of an argument 5 years ago on this. We are right back there again. I am at a loss as to what this means to us.

Mr. STEVENS. What I am disturbed about is this concept of 91 percent of the money paid into the Treasury on the gas tax will be returned to each State. How about 91 percent of the money paid into the Treasury from any oil-producing State? We send more money to the Treasury every day than any one of these donor States do. We are not getting it back and we are not getting any roads. I am really getting disturbed. 
I must say, Leader, I asked to be notified so I could come and deal with the objection. I understand there is nothing to object to over the cloture vote. But somehow or other, we have to find some way to recognize the plight of States that do not have revenue going into the gas tax fund because they don't have roads. But we are sending more money to the Federal Treasury than any State in the Union with regard to resource production. How about some of that coming back to us? Let us build highways with part of our own tax revenues. Somehow, that has to be worked out. I don't want to be at cross purposes with the leader, but I shall have to vote against cloture once again. 
I don't like to do that with the leadership, but it seems to me that there ought to be some way to work out this donor/donee business with relationship to how much money is the State paying into the Treasury from its activities. 
These are State lands, Mr. President. We own the lands that the oil is produced from. We send 25 percent of the domestically produced oil to the United States. We could sell it in the world market for a lot more money. But it is getting to be a great problem to me to figure out how to deal with the future for my State. If we can't build roads, we are no longer going to be able to get subsidies for mail transportation, and we have many more of our communities becoming totally isolated now because of the Federal policies that forbid us from building roads across Federal lands in the first place.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I just want to take a few minutes here, and I won't object in a few minutes to that request, but I think some consideration has to be given to some aspects of the highway and mass transportation problem. It has been very difficult for some of us to deal with. Neither my colleague nor I serve on any of the committees dealing with this subject. I do call attention to the fact that I will be chairing the committee that will deal with it later. 
I am a little disturbed about what is happening in terms of small States--in particular, my State. I brought for Members to look at a comparison of my State and the whole United States and the delineation of the highways that exist in my State now. Those little gold dots are the villages and communities in my State that are not served by a highway or road yet. We have been a State now for 40 years and what do we find? If you look at the southeastern part, it looks like a panhandle on the right-hand side of this chart. That is the area of the marine highway system. We now are told we can't build any roads through the Forest Service land, and that is all Forest Service land down there except for a few communities and small areas of Native lands. 
We are not considered a part of the mass transportation system although we haul about 2 million of your constituents per year through that area on our ferries. When we built those ferries 30 years ago, the price of them was a lot less than it is now. Today, the cheapest boats that you can buy of this type--they have to be ocean-going ferries--are built overseas, except we can't buy those because the Jones Act says we can't use foreign-built vessels from port to port in the United States. So, we can't use the land to build roads, we have to build our own ferries, and now we have to pay five times as much for those ferries than if we could buy them overseas. Now, it is mass transportation but this bill doesn't recognize ferries of this size as being any part of mass transportation. 
I have some concerns that I have mentioned to my great friend from West Virginia about where the money is coming from when we do get to the process of financing that. I know he has some comments. I hope he won't get into that right now. We will work that out, I'm sure. But I want to point out to the Senate that we are going to have to work out a lot of things to finance this bill. This Senator wants to be a little happier with this bill. Right now I'm unhappy with the bill. 
Take, for instance, the border money that is in this bill. We have analyzed that Border States Road Program. Our State at the present time has 1,538 miles of border with our neighbor, 20 percent of the total border of the United States, and we figure we are not even included in this. If you want to know why, it is because, for instance, money is made available for contract authority to grant States to improve international gateways, but, by definition, the gateways are groupings of border stations. Well, if you go along our border, you will find one border station; there is no grouping. 
We have $18 million in this amendment for States for multistate corridor analysis. Well, we don't share the border with any other State, so obviously we are not involved in that allocation of money either. 
Then there is $750 million authorized to be awarded by the Secretary, based upon commercial traffic volume, comparison of other traffic volume. Our State has a volume in just 4 months of the year. We can't compare with anyone for 12 months of the year in terms of traffic volume. 
Mr. President, I don't have any objection to this; we are increasing the amount of money in a substantial way. As we do so, it seems that people are forgetting there are some places that don't have roads yet. In this bill, the whole philosophy here is, how do you improve existing roads or how do you really find a way to handle more traffic on the existing corridors that serve our country? I have no problem about that, but what is it going to do for a State like mine? Those roads that we need--we need to connect some of the villages to share schools, so we can share all of the services available from the State, local, and Federal Government. We are told now we can't go through parks, wildlife refuges, and other lands that are owned by the Federal Government. So in order to build them, we have to build longer roads to connect them. 
I argued last year about RS 2477, and we lost that battle. We cannot use the original rights-of-way. Along the Kuskokwim and Yukon, in order to build the roads, instead of using the rights-of-way that traditionally have been used the last 100 
years, we have to go far inland and build the roads back and then come back to the river again. You can't follow the traditional roads because RS 2477 rights-of-way are no longer valid. Do we have any recognition for the increased costs of building roads where Federal policy prohibits us from using Federal lands in Alaska that would be available in any other State, particularly any other Western State? No, we don't have any. 
We do believe we have to have some analysis on a national basis. Other States use ferries. I went over with my good friend from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, and traveled on one of their brand-new ferries. It was a wonderful experience. I urge every Member of the Senate to do it. They have some ferries that are based on a new concept of suspension, and we were traveling 35 knots in a 6- to 7-foot sea. That is really very good. But those increased island ferries won't do any good for us. We have to comply with the Federal and international laws concerning safety of life at sea. We have to build enormous vessels in order to cross the Gulf of Alaska. 
Now, again, the concept of ferries and of the marine highway system, of recognizing that my State is not going to build roads across land, it will use ferries and it will use the marine highway system for our connections, has to be thought about in terms of this bill. So far, I've not been able to get that consideration. I want to see what we can do about dealing with that. 
The marine highway system, by the way, several Congresses ago--and I think my good friend from West Virginia will remember this--we made it part of the National Highway System. We thought that was a great advantage. But the money is in the interstate highway system and in the mass transportation system in this bill. So that is not going to do us much good for our marine highway system. That is not where the money is being increased. 
I also call the attention to the Senate of the fact that some of these ferry laws--there is a provision of existing law that deals with the requirements for crew, the requirements for other things that apply to the offshore States--in Alaska and Hawaii are burdensome and increase the cost of ferries. I have talked to the Senator from New York about trying to get some understanding of that. 
We also have a problem about the Indian reservation roads, the parkway and park roads, the National Wildlife System roads. All of those are covered by this bill. However, we have 70 percent of the parklands, we have 60 percent of the wildlife refuge lands, we have 50 percent of the Federal lands, and we are getting 4 percent of the money that is involved in those. Do you know why? We are prohibited from building roads through those systems, so we have to build roads around the systems, but we don't get any consideration of that cost as we try to face the cost of building a highway system. 
I remember sitting in the gallery once right after we became a State, and one of my predecessors, Senator Gruening, was here on the floor speaking about roads in Alaska. That was 1959. I have to tell the Members of the Senate, the map he used was this map. We have not been able to build roads in Alaska because of the obstinate position--this is not partisan, it is not this administration--of the Federal Government. We have not been able to get access to build roads to connect our villages, our communities. We have depended until this time on air transportation to even ship bricks and hay. 
Now the Postal Service, very wisely, is saying, `Look, the ratepayers pay the subsidy for Alaska transportation and we are not going to do it anymore.' Think of that now. Here is another county, as my grandmother used to say; we are hearing from someone else and they are saying, we are not going to continue to subsidize the transportation of goods in Alaska. We should do the same thing, they say, as everyone else--ship it by road. I remember one of them suggested we ought to be able to ship it somehow by Kodiak, by road. It would be an awful long bridge. Anyone that wants to, I would like them to ride that ferry. We call it the Dramamine Express. 
When you talk about my State and the way we function under this bill, it's unfortunate. Maybe we should shift our committee assignments just before the highway bill passes so we can be heard in committees. I am becoming aware of the fact that every 5 years I come here to the floor and I complain. This year, I am going to do more than complain. This year, I am going to make some promises. I am not going to insist on carrying out the functions of this bill unless it becomes fairer. 
I understand that donor States want back 91 cents out of every dollar their people pay into the road system. We wish we had more roads so we can pay more into the system. We can't increase that payment into the system until we can build some of these roads. Currently, we are using air-cushioned vehicles in some parts of Alaska to deliver mail. Good idea, right? We are getting no assistance whatsoever in any way to prepare the rights of way for air-cushioned vehicles. It would be a lot cheaper than running trucks over that land and cause a lot less environmental damage than running trucks over the land. But guess what. Rights of way for clearance for air-cushioned vehicles is not covered by this bill. 
Now, Mr. President, it is not easy for us to come and really represent a State that is so far away. That is why I have developed such a fondness for my friends from Hawaii, because they go almost as far to get home as my colleague Senator Murkowski and I do. What you don't realize is that, after we get home, we travel farther in our State to get from community to community than many of you travel to get home. We want to have some ability to come into the next century with a basic highway system that will at least meet the needs of some of the rural areas in terms of massing them together, connecting them together, so they can get the advantage of scale in dealing with their problems. That is particularly true of our problem now with regard to schools and villages and communities that are isolated through that vast area we call `the bush.' 
I could go on a little longer. We are going to go ahead with this bill, and I hope some Members who are working on it will think a little bit about what we are doing. As I said, we have the longest international border in the whole Nation. Under the trade corridor and border-crossing program, we qualify for little or none of the $775 million that deals with border-crossing problems. At least we should be able to deal with these increases. Again, the donor States problem--we have faced that problem. My good friend from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, has worked out a way of dealing with that in terms of increasing money so that there isn't any damage to the existing allocation. 
I congratulate him, Senators Gramm, Chafee, Baucus, D'Amato, all of those who worked on this, so that we can have more money available to deal with the highway problems. The `surface transportation problems' is what we ought to really call this bill, a bill to solve surface transportation problems. My State is at least one-fifth of the land mass of the United States, and it is not recognized in this bill as being a State that needs highways, a State that needs assistance in dealing with the areas where we can't build highways in the marine highway system. Particularly, we need assistance in dealing with how do we get our ferries built under the Federal law that requires them built in this country and recognize them as mass 
transportation? If you go into the corridors where they are putting money into mass transportation, you will find we are buying rights of way, laying track, building terminals. We are doing a lot of things. Those same people who go to Seattle and then go up to Alaska on our ferries can travel all the way across the country under mass transportation, but when they get on our ferries to go up into Alaska, it's no longer mass transportation. If you ask the people on the ferries, they believe those are part of the mass transportation system, but it is not under this law. 
I withdraw my objection to the request of the Senator, but I am going to be around here for a few days until we get some of these issues settled to our satisfaction and know that we can come into the 21st century along with everybody else as far as a new surface transportation program. Thank you very much.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send to the desk for proper referral the Old Alaska Native Health Center Conveyance Act of 1998 to address a serious issue in Anchorage, Alaska. 
The Federal government finished construction of the Alaska Native Hospital Center in 1953. This facility is situated on a 15-acre parcel of land near downtown Anchorage. It was substantially affected by the 1964 Alaska earthquake, but was patched up and maintained until it could be replaced. In 1997 a new Alaska Native Health Center was opened. The old facility was boarded up and abandoned after being stripped of fixtures, wiring, heating, and ventilation systems, and other components. It now awaits disposal action by the General Services Administration. The facility is unsalvageable in its present condition and is in violation of multiple safety codes. A recent environmental assessment found not only the presence of asbestos but also lead-containing paint. 
Anchorage has a unique and pressing need for this site. The Port of Anchorage is the largest port in Alaska and the 17th largest in the nation--it has grown steadily in recent years, and the tonnage of goods moving through our major port is expected to continue to increase. However, truck access to the Port is limited to either a single two-lane road or through the streets of downtown Anchorage. This is a limiting factor to continued growth, and is already negatively affecting the transfer of goods on and off the domestic and international container ships that call on the Port of Anchorage. The solution is to have new access to the port through the land now occupied by the abandoned hospital center. 
My bill would assist the Municipality of Anchorage with this plan by instructing the General Services Administration to clear the land and transfer it to the Municipality of Anchorage.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senate is going to vote soon on the override of the President's veto to H.R. 2631, the bill disapproving the line-item vetoes of projects contained in the fiscal year 1998 military construction bill. I am here as chairman of the Appropriations Committee to urge all Members to vote in favor of the override of the President's veto in this matter. 
Let me begin by congratulating Senators Burns and Murray for their leadership in handling the military construction bill and the line-item veto process over the past few months. 
At no time has the discussion on this military construction bill and the line-item veto been marked by partisan rancor. These two members of our subcommittee, Senators Burns and Murray, and our full committee have proceeded in a completely bipartisan fashion to deal with this bill and the line-item process. As Senator Burns noted in his comments earlier today, this debate and vote provide the first test of the line-item veto process enacted by the Congress. 
As chairman of the conference that presented the final version of the line-item veto bill to the Senate, I am pleased that the procedures established in that bill have worked. 
I regret that we must act to override the President's veto of this disapproval bill. In a hearing before our committee and in numerous public statements, administration officials conceded that errors were made in handling the military construction bill. During a time of intense pressure on our defense budget, there could be no consideration of foregoing these critical projects that are necessary to support our military efforts. 
Override of the President's veto restores 38 projects, totaling $287 million, for this fiscal year 1998. All of these projects have been defined as necessary by the Armed Forces and are executable during this fiscal year. 
Subsequent to the President's action on the military construction bill, the administration took a very different approach to the remaining 12 appropriations bills for fiscal year 1998. I do believe that the confrontation that has occurred over this bill has refined the process for dealing with the line-item veto. While I do not support the President's decision with regard to many of the specific line-item vetoes he presented to Congress with regard to the 1998 bills, our committee did not hold any hearings or report disapproval bills on any of the other line-item veto messages. We did not challenge the President's decision on any line-item veto on any bill other than this military construction bill, although, again, I will say, as chairman, I disagreed with many. For 1998, the President transmitted 81 line-item vetoes of specific appropriations totaling $483.4 million. 
In my judgment, the line-item veto has proven to be a useful and appropriate tool for any President to reconsider spending matters passed by the Congress. 
Consideration of this bill, however, and this override will demonstrate the effectiveness of the process created by the bill that created the line-item veto. We definitely prepared a process to overturn a Presidential veto of a disapproval bill, and that is what we are dealing with now. We passed the original bill, the President line-item vetoed it, we passed a disapproval bill, and he vetoed that. This is a process to overturn that veto of our bill whereby the Congress decided to literally overturn his veto. 
I again regret that the President chose to veto this measure. I think he did so on the basis of misunderstanding or upon misinformation presented to him. As I said in the beginning, the criteria used by the White House, as applied to these projects, just did not fit. This was not a proper veto of the items in this military construction bill. 
I am here to urge all Members to vote to override the veto on this bill, restore the funding for these projects that are urgently needed for military construction, and validate the process that the line-item veto bill presented to the Congress and make it work. Thank you, Mr. President.

 Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Defense Department and Congress recently lost an able and dedicated adviser. Mr. Philip Hitch, Department of Defense Deputy General Counsel for Fiscal Matters died recently at the age of 52. Phil had served the Department of Defense for 27 years in a number of positions. 
Mr. Hitch began his career in the Army, serving from 1971 to 1975 as an Assistant Staff Judge Advocate for the Military Traffic Management Command. Upon leaving the Army in 1975, he represented the Office of the Counsel for the Navy Comptroller. He became the Counsel for the Navy Comptroller in 1981. 
In 1992, Philip Hitch became the Deputy General Counsel for Fiscal Matters for the Department of Defense. In this role, Phil served the Defense Department capably by supporting DOD's legislative proposals regarding financial matters. Equally important, at a time of significant Congressional activity in the areas of Defense navigate its way through the process of change. 
However, few know that the Congress, particularly the Senate Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Defense, relied heavily on Phil for advice on general provisions and other financial legislation under consideration. In this sensitive and occasionally conflicting role, Phil was able to provide thoughtful and precise legal counsel while maintaining the trust the Committee needed in the delicate task of seeking Defense Department views on legislative proposals. In this role, Phil was able to make a significant contribution to the nation's defense acquisition process, serving both the Defense Department and committee on Appropriations as confidant and counsel. 
In a busy town dominated by people seeking to be heard and recognized, Phil Hitch generally sought neither. Indeed, one of Phil's strong qualities as his willingness to take time and listen to all aspects of the issue at hand. When asked for his advice, it was clear and concise--formulated to make the process of managing fiscal legal matters more productive for the nation as a whole. 
Fortunately, I can tell you that the quality of Phil's work was recognized through his receipt of the Presidential Rank Award for Meritorious Service and the Navy Distinguished Service Award. The Navy Distinguished Service Award notes that `Mr. Hitch has left indelible contributions to the management and operations on the Department of the Navy.' 
Mr. President, the Defense Department and the Senate will miss his wise counsel.

 Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call the Senate's attention to an individual who has dedicated his life to liberating his people and restoring his nation. Eduard Shevardnadze's career of government service is marked most significantly by his personal journey from being a member of the Soviet hierarchy to being the prominent democratic leader he is today. I am proud to have met him on several occasions and draw the Senate's attention to this extraordinary man's accomplishments in celebration of his seventieth birthday which was January 25, 1998. 
Eduard Shevardnadze's career began with a steady rise through the Communist Party. As the Minister of Foreign Affairs, his ability as a diplomat brought the United States and Soviet Union into a better understanding of one another. He was a significant force in ending the Cold War peacefully and ushering in an historic era of improved world-wide relations. In 1991, however, Eduard Shevardnadze was at odds with the dictatorial policies of the Communist Party. His strong principles ultimately drove him to forego the trappings of the elite political class and he resigned his position. 
Upon his resignation, Eduard Shevardnadze returned to Georgia. In the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, his homeland was destabilized and struggling economically. Eduard Shevardnadze began assisting in the revitalization of Georgia, and in November, 1995, he was elected president. His policies have focused on restoring territorial integrity, as well as promoting economic and political independence. Since his election, President Shevardnadze's notable achievements include adopting and implementing a new constitution, introducing a new currency, cracking down on organized crime, and negotiating important treaties with neighboring countries to secure Georgia's future. 
President Eduard Shevardnadze's personal journey from communist to democratic leader is a compelling example of the triumph of the human spirit. His high standing among Western leaders has been earned through his principled democratic leadership and perseverance in the face of adversity. I would like to express my warm regards to President Shevardnadze in wishing him a prosperous seventieth year.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this joint resolution, the Flag Desecration Constitutional Amendment, proposes an Amendment to the Constitution that would empower Congress to prohibit the physical desecration of our Flag. I am proud to join Senator Hatch and my other colleagues as a sponsor. 
Two years ago the Senate came close to passing this amendment. At that time, ninety percent of Alaskans who contacted me supported this effort. I am confident their stance has not changed. Alaskans support our flag and the freedom it represents. Alaskans strongly support the protection of this symbol of freedom. 
Our flag has a special place in my heart and the hearts of all Americans. As those who have served overseas know, the flag was our reminder of America and our freedom. Freedom much greater than any country ever offers. Our missions oveaseas were to protect that freedom and the flag which symbolizes it. Too many have devoted their lives for our country for us not to protect its most sacred symbol. 
Forty-eight states had laws preventing flag desecration before the Supreme Court struck them down. The flag is a direct symbol of our country. Fifty stars for fifty states. I remember the day the forty-ninth star was pinned on the flag. Having played a role in the Alaska statehood movement, I can say it was one of the proudest moments in my life. I support every effort to preserve the sanctity of America's flag. 
The Supreme Court has given us a choice. We can accept that the First Amendment allows the desecration of America's flag. Or we can change the law to prevent it. The power to amend the Constitution demands a cautious respect. It is a considerable power--one that has helped chart the course of our history. We should not jump headlong into amendments. But we should not be afraid to act on our beliefs, either. The people of Alaska are strong in their belief that our flag should not be desecrated, and we support this amendment.

Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Pennsylvania is correct. While the Department of Defense chooses to group selected FFRDC's in the category of advisory and assistance services, the Congress has for several years dealt with these issues separately. FFRDC's should be exempt from the reduction in contractor advisory and assistance services.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the day before Thanksgiving the University of Alaska's Athletic Department marks a milestone--the 20th anniversary of the Great Alaska Shootout. 
The shootout is a basketball tournament that began as an impossible dream of Bob Rachal, a coach who wanted to put his fledgling University of Alaska Anchorage basketball team on the map. 
Now, the shootout continues under Charlie Bruns and Tim Dillon, athletic director and has become an annual Thanksgiving tradition for Alaskans and basketball fans across our Nation. 
In the 20 years since the shootout began, our Nation's greatest college teams have traveled to Alaska over the Thanksgiving break to vie for the tournament trophy. 
Twenty former NCAA champions have taken part in the shootout over the two decades; last year marked the fifth time the defending national champion has participated in the shootout. 
The first game, 20 years ago, was played in a drafty field house on Fort Richardson, a military post in Anchorage, to about 2,500 fans. 
Now, the shootout fills our state-of-the-art Sullivan Sports Arena in Anchorage, and is televised live nationwide via ESPN. Sportswriters from the wire services, newspapers and magazines regularly travel to Anchorage to cover the shootout. 
Because the teams that participate are the best, the games are invariably closely contested; 60 of the previous 228 games have been won by margins of five points or less. Six have been settled in overtime; four in double overtime, and one in triple overtime. 
It isn't only the games that are important in the shootout, it is the opportunity players, coaches, and the families of the players and coaches, have to experience the greatness of Alaska and Alaskans, and the opportunity Alaskans have to meet these young athletes, their coaches, and their families from across our Nation. 
Volunteers open their homes to shootout participants and support the players and the guests in countless other ways, including transportation, entertainment and other special events. Our largest Alaska grocery chain, Carr's, provides important corporate support. 
The National Collegiate Athletic Association recognizes the special place this tournament holds by its votes over the years to allow the tournament a special place in American collegiate sports. 
The teams represent the finest programs in NCAA basketball history, and the University of Alaska Anchorage has gained a reputation for hosting one of the best tournaments in college basketball. 
The players and coaches and all who work to make the shootout a success bring credit to the University of Alaska, to Anchorage and to Alaska. Mr. President, I commend Chancellor Lea Gorsuch and the University of Alaska as it observes the 20th anniversary of a very special sports event. I know Dr. Lee Piccard, the former vice chancellor, who has seen every shootout game during all 20 years will enjoy it again.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to recognize the assistance I have received over the years from a longtime friend, A. Michael Arnold, whose intellectual capacity and international insights have proven to be of significant value to me and others. I have often passed on Mick Arnold's comments to many Members of Congress including our leaders. Since the early eighties, Mick and I have corresponded regularly, and occasionally have had the opportunity to meet either here or in Britain. He is a resident of Great Britain. We are both blessed with wonderful wives. Mick's wife Wendy is a respected author in her own right. My wife, Catherine, and Wendy share in our friendship. 
These insights in Mr. Arnold's correspondence have run the gamut from the 1980's arms buildup in South America, to the current conflict in Bosnia with its implications for world peace, the internal convulsions in Russia, the tensions between Israel and the Arab world, the threats from Iran and Iraq, and to the reason d'etre of the United Nations. Mick's observations have been provocative, accurate, and full of sage advice. He has not sought recognition for his efforts. He told me that knowing that his observations may help to bring clarity to a confused world scene was sufficient to him. 
I recall several specific instances of Mick's perceptiveness in international affairs. Mick's assessments in 1983 and 1984 of the political scene in the Soviet Union: He anticipated that Chernenko would stabilize his power base and advance Gorbachev as one of his key deputies. By early 1984 Chernenko had made Gorbachev his No. 2. Noting Chernenko's precarious health, Mick then anticipated that Gorbachev would succeed Chernenko. History records the accuracy of that assessment. That advice was very helpful to those of us who were working on Soviet affairs in the 1980's. 
In 1991 Mick expressed anguish over the potential for a conflagration in Yugoslavia * * * one that could envelope Bosnia-Herzegovina. Once again Mick's international instincts proved accurate. Many times that he shared his worries in papers I then passed on to others, those fears were realized in what did take place in Bosnia. 
In April of this year, Mick commented on the upcoming Presidential elections in Iran and observed that Mohammed Khatemi would, if elected, be more open to foreign relations. History has yet to validate the accuracy of Mick's assessment of Khatemi's but many are hopeful he is correct. 
He continues to be one who observes the world scene from his background being a Don at Oxford. 
The world would be a far better place if there were more people with the intellectual capacity, compassion, and common sense of Mick Arnold, ones who would pass on their opinions without any publicity, without seeking any remuneration for their work--just to be a friend. It's from the point of view of friendship. 
I look forward to continuing this friendship and value Mick's informed observations on the international scene. I come today because my friend has told me he is going to reduce the frequency of his comments. He is not totally retiring, but he's going to limit the scope of his activities. But I wanted the Senate to know that, whether many are aware of it, the U.S. Senate has benefited from his counsel and his insights. I have benefited greatly from his friendship. 
My wife and I wish Wendy and Mick many more years of success, and I continue to value his advice. 
I yield the floor.  
Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, last year the Congress enacted, and the President signed into law, the Line Item Veto Act--Public Law 104-130. This act delegated specific authority to the President to cancel in whole any dollar amount of discretionary budget authority identified by Congress, new direct spending, and limited tax benefits. As the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee at that time, I was chairman of the conference committee and one of the principal authors of the act. Another principal author was the Senator from New Mexico, my good friend and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. We are here on the floor today to say that the President exceeded the authority delegated to him when he attempted to use the Line Item Veto Act to cancel section 642 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 1998, which is Public Law 105-61. 
Section 642 of that law would allow a six month open season for employees currently under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) to switch to the Federal Employee Retirement System (FERS). The last such open season was in 1988. 
On October 16 President Clinton sent a special message to Congress in which he claims to have canceled section 642 pursuant to the authority delegated to him by Congress in the Line Item Veto Act. Under the Act the President is permitted to cancel in whole any dollar amount of discretionary budget authority, any item of new direct spending, or any limited tax benefit if the President determines that such cancellation will reduce the Federal budget deficit, not impair any essential government function, and not harm the national interest. A cancellation must be made and Congress must be notified by special message within five calendar days of the date of enactment of the law providing the dollar amount of discretionary budget authority, item of new direct spending, or limited tax benefit that was canceled. 
The President's special message number 97-56 on the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 1998 states that the President is canceling $854 million in discretionary budget authority provided by section 642. The President arrives at this figure by estimating the dollar amount that employee contributions to the CSRS would be reduced as a result of Federal employees shifting to FERS. Unfortunately for the President, these contributions do not represent a `dollar amount of discretionary budget authority' as defined by the Line Item Veto Act. Therefore those funds could not be canceled pursuant to that Act.

Mr. STEVENS. The senator from New Mexico is making my point exactly. The President's advisors cannot change the definition of budget authority to permit him to reach this provision. As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee I was particularly concerned with the precise nature of the authority delegated to the President, and worked very hard along with my staff to ensure that the definitions were clear and unambiguous. That is the reason for the detailed definition in section 1026 of the Budget Act, as added by the Line Item Veto Act, which incorporates the long established definition of budget authority in section 3 of the Budget Act. Is it the Senator from New Mexico's understanding that prior to the attempted cancellation of section 642 that the President's own documents classified employee contributions to retirement accounts as governmental receipts that are counted as revenue and not offsetting receipts that offset budget authority and outlays?

Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for that explanation. In closing, I would like to take this opportunity to clarify further how the Line Item Veto Act operates. Section 1021(a)(3)(B) of the Budget Act--the section of the Line Item Veto Act that provides the cancellation authority--makes it clear that the authority is limited to the cancellation of a dollar amount of discretionary budget authority that is provided in the just-signed law before the President. Under the specific terms and definitions provided in the Line Item Veto Act, the President cannot reach a dollar amount of discretionary budget authority provided in some other law that is not the one before the President. The Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act did not provide $854 million in discretionary budget authority for section 642, so that amount could not be rescinded under the terms of the Line Item Veto Act. The $854 million figure came from the President's estimates of the loss of employee contributions to CSRS government-wide. As we have explained above that loss is not budget authority, so it cannot be canceled. But even if it were, the President could not reach dollar amounts of discretionary budget authority government-wide unless the dollar amount of budget authority needed government-wide was provided in the specific appropriations law before him. 
As the definition of cancel in section 1026 of the Budget Act clearly states, in the case of a dollar amount of discretionary budget authority the term `cancel' means `rescind'--a term which itself has a long history in congressional-executive branch relations. The recission of budget authority in a specific law does not change the operative effect of a general provision in that specific law with respect to budget authority provided in another law. As the statement of managers accompanying the Line Item Veto Act makes clear, the delegated authority in the Act does not permit the President to strike out or rewrite the law. It merely allows him discretionary authority to close the doors to the Federal Treasury and refuse to spend funds appropriated by Congress in that particular law. 
In contrast, the definition of `cancel' with respect to new direct spending, which also results in the expenditure of budget authority, is to prevent the specific provision of law or legal obligation from `having legal force or effect.' This distinction recognizes that provisions of law that result in new direct spending may not actually provide budget authority that can be canceled at that time--say for example a provision of law that simply increases the amount an individual will receive at a future date under an existing benefit program provided in a law enacted years before. Such provisions create a legal obligation or right that may be exercised in the future, or which result in a future increase in expenditures from budget authority provided elsewhere. If the President wishes to remove the legal force or effect of a specific provision of law that applies to budget authority provided in a law other than the appropriations law the provision is in, then he may only do so if that provision is new direct spending under the Line Item Veto Act. 
Section 642 is not an `item of new direct spending' as defined in section 1026 of the Budget Act because it results in savings to the government when compared to the present budget baseline. As explained above, the President's wish to the contrary notwithstanding, it does not result in a dollar amount of discretionary budget authority. Thus, the President has exceeded his delegated authority by violating the terms of the statute, and I would urge the Justice Department to concede that the cancellation of section 642 was outside the authority provided by the statute.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I concur with Senator Inouye that this is a critical problem for Alaska and Hawaii. I would suggest that it is in the interest of all States to ensure that no State is left behind as we enter the digital age. 
Researchers in Alaska and Hawaii must have the same access to resources that their colleagues in other areas of the country have--without compatible access our universities will be left behind in the race to secure research funding and they will not be able to compete when it comes to attracting top researchers and professors. 
There is another side to the problem. Just as our universities will be cut off from their colleagues--universities in the continental United States will be cut off from the expertise and resources that are housed in the universities of Alaska and Hawaii. 
Senator Inouye laid out our concerns with respect to participation in the next generation Internet project, I would like to take what he said one step further. 
The technology--the high speed access to the Internet that is the goal of the next generation Internet project--is currently being slated to be developed on top of the existing Internet infrastructure. 
The existing Internet infrastructure can be visualized as a series of pipes, of varying capacity. The main conduit of the pipe system connects the West Coast to the East Coast--essentially through the middle of the United States. 
Those States that host the main conduit are fortunate--they have low cost access to relatively high capacity. Those States that are not close to the main conduit face increasing costs the further they are from the main conduits. 
The NGI project has agreed to include some States--like Montana that face challenges connecting to the main conduits. However, our States--Alaska and Hawaii--have been essentially written off. 
This isn't just a question of our universities being left behind. It is a question of our entire states being left behind as we enter the new millennium when high speed connectivity will be essential to every aspect of life. 
We are already witnessing mass scale technological convergence. From my computer here in the Senate I can make telephone calls, I can listen to the radio, I can watch television--all over the Internet. This is not possible from most of Alaska and Hawaii--the connections are simply too poor. 
Currently data traffic is growing at a much faster pace than telephone traffic--if this continues, early in the next century data traffic will surpass telephone traffic. Where will that leave Alaska and Hawaii if we don't have the infrastructure in place to send data? 
Right now many villages in rural Alaska can only access the Internet by dialing a 1-800 number which connects them to an Internet service provider in Anchorage. They are connected to the Internet at speeds of around 1200 BAUD. Not only is this access slow--considering that most Americans now normally connect at at least 28,800 BAUD--but it is also costly. 
I join Senator Inouye in asking that those universities and agencies who receive part of the $95 million that we have provided for the next generation Internet project use the funds in a manner that will advance the interests of our country as a whole. 
I also ask for the assistance of private industry in helping us to solve the technical problems that our States face in obtaining connectivity levels that are comparable to the rest of the country. As one of the witnesses said earlier this week at the NGI hearing before the Science, Technology, and Transportation Subcommittee, it will take an innovative solution to provide Alaska with good connectivity. 
Conventional solutions, such as laying high capacity fiber to every village are simply not feasible economically at this time. 
I am committed to finding a solution to these problems--I know that Senator Inouye is too--I hope that our colleagues will join us and that this will be viewed as a national problem and not just as a competition for Federal research funds.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regret that I have objected to the amendment. I tell my friend from Oregon that the practice that he seeks to change is embedded in our rules; not in any law. During the period of time that I served here, 8 years as whip, Republican assistant leader, 4 years in the minority and 4 years in the majority, we had a different way at that time of handling what is now known as a hold. 
A hold is nothing more than an agreement of another Senator to object on behalf of a Senator at the request of the second Senator to prevent a unanimous consent agreement from coming into play. There is nothing in the rules about holds. It is a practice that has built up. To try to pass a law to deal with a practice of the Senate--I would call to the attention of the Senator from Oregon, there is a law that Congress cannot sit in Washington after July 31st. It has been the law for many years. 
We will not change the practices of Senate by law. What we have to do is get some rule changes, or a standing order that would apply to Senators. But the issue is whether a Senator in each instance, in this case whether the leaders, may object on behalf of a Senator who says, `I want to object and I may not be there at the time the subject comes up, and I want you to object for me.' That is known as a hold today. 
When I first came to the Senate there was an official objectors' committee. It was unofficial in that sense, but on each side they had two or three Senators who agreed to be on the floor. At any time, one of them was here. And they objected to unanimous consent requests if they had been requested to do so by Members. 
It later became a prerogative of the leadership to do that. I think I would have to rely on my friend from West Virginia to give the complete history of it. I do not have the memory that he has. But I can assure you that he will instruct us one of these days about the history of this practice. 
But I do regret having to object. I understand what the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Iowa are trying to do. I wish them success, because I find holds to be very burdensome to deal with, whether it's from the leadership point of view or the point of view of a chairman of a committee.

We have included the Small Business Administration reauthorization bill, a portion of the State Department authorization bill which deals with reorganization, and with authorization for the United Nations arrearages. We have included the Highway Safety and Transit Contract Authority Extensions, due to the expiration of ISTEA. We have technical corrections to the Department of Defense Authorization Act with regard to land transfer in New Mexico. And we have the agreement that deals with the census provision that was in the State-Justice-Commerce bills that passed the Senate, but it has been altered substantially. I should call attention to that. 
Let me ask the Chair, what time now remains on this bill?

Mr. STEVENS. I want to thank the Senate for its consideration of the desire of the Appropriations Committee to finish this work for this Congress. We had hoped that we would pass 13 separate appropriations bills. That has not been possible. But we have taken the opportunity to put two of the bills that have not been finished on this bill--that managed by Senator Faircloth and Senator Boxer, with the hope that we could resolve the differences with the House. It will go to the House now as an amendment to the House bill. It is an omnibus appropriations bill now. And the House will work its will on it. I am hopeful that it will decide to send the bill to the President. 
In any event, it is my understanding we will soon be presented with a continuing resolution. The continuing resolution in effect now would expire at midnight tonight. The one I expect to be received by the Senate will expire tomorrow night. So we are hopeful that we will be able to resolve the differences between the House and the Senate by tomorrow night with regard to the matters under this bill. 
Again, I thank everyone for their consideration of our position. And if there is nothing further to come before the Senate on this bill, I yield back the balance of the time. It is my understanding that would yield back all time on this bill. Is that correct, Mr. President?

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to make a statement concerning the bill that has been approved by--really an amendment approved by the Appropriations Committee. This afternoon we met, and the Appropriations Committee has authorized me--and Senator Byrd--to present an amendment to the District of Columbia appropriations bill. It is before the Senate. And this will be an amendment in the nature of a substitute. 
We had hoped to be able to proceed at this time and get an agreement with regard to that. I have asked the distinguished Democratic leader to join me. And I have discussed the matter with our leader. 
The difficulty is that several Members still want to read over portions of that proposed amendment before we seek to proceed on it. After discussing it with the distinguished Democratic leader, I think that is the better part of valor. 
I had previously made the announcement that we would offer it tonight and hope to have debate tonight and vote tomorrow. We have a continuing resolution that expires tomorrow evening. But if the Democratic leader agrees, I think we will just hold off, and it would be the intention of the leadership to try and move to bring this matter before the Senate tomorrow, as I understand it, sometime around 1 or 1:30 tomorrow afternoon. 
If that meets with the Democratic leader's approval, we will just not proceed tonight. 
Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.

Because of the expiration of the continuing resolution tomorrow night, and the desire of Members not to be here next week on matters that would require votes, I hope that we will be able to get to it tomorrow, and get it to the House in time for the House to consider it and dispose of it. We may face this bill coming back to us with an amendment from the House before we are through tomorrow. So it would have been my wish that we could have done it tonight, but under the circumstances we will defer until tomorrow. 
I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished Senator.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want this record to reflect my disappointment with the levels authorized in this bill for the National Guard. 
Since the end of the cold war, we have undertaken the most massive restructuring of our military forces since the end of World War II. 
The cornerstone of these initiatives has been greater reliance on the National Guard and Reserves to meet both day-to-day and major crisis military requirements. 
Sadly, the bill before the Senate retreats from, and does damage to, the expanded role for the Guard. 
This year, tens of thousands of Guard and Reserve personnel have been deployed to Bosnia, Haiti, Southwest Asia, Central America, and Korea. 
By the account of every regional commander in chief, they have performed these duties with a level of professionalism and excellence indistinguishable from the Active Force. They are simply that good. 
Their performance in the field merits the total support of the House and Senate. 
The Guard and Reserve comprise 38 percent of the total force. However, funding for these components in this bill equates to only 8 percent of the total funding for the Department of Defense. 
The cost of forces in the Guard and Reserve is less per capita--significantly less than the active components. 
But 38 percent of the force deserves more than 8 percent of the available funding. The Guard needs modern, new equipment. They need training--particularly flying hours and adequate maintenance money for tanks, trucks, and other vehicles. 
They need ammunition and travel money. They need the funding to continue to be fully ready to deploy. 
This bill does real damage to the force structure, readiness, and morale of our National Guard. 
Fortunately, the Defense appropriations bill passed by the Senate last month does provide the increased funding for the Guard. 
The Defense appropriations and military construction bills achieved a real bipartisan consensus in support of the National Guard. 
We carefully reviewed the needs identified by the National Guard and Reserves. 
We allocated funding to meet their most urgent personnel, readiness, and modernization priorities. 
The National Guard and Reserves cannot be asked to take on more missions, more deployments, and more responsibility without the support of Congress. This bill fails that test. 
The levels authorized in this bill would require a 5,000 personnel reduction in the Army National Guard. 
This bill authorizes $108 million less in the vital Army Guard Operation and maintenance account that was appropriated by the Congress and signed by the President for 1998. 
This bill reduces funding for the Air National Guard by almost $14 million. 
I regret that on the levels provided for the National Guard there are these differences between the 1998 authorization and appropriations bills. I do not regret the actions we took in the appropriations bill, which provided greater support for the National Guard. 
Even that was not enough. Our committee deserves to be criticized also for not having provided even more. But this bill means we can't spend the money we have already appropriated. 
There are other differences between our two bills--especially in the procurement and research and development accounts. 
Our committee worked hard to pass an appropriations bill early that incorporates the Department's and the Senate's priorities. 
We attempted, as much as possible, to follow the authorization bill that passed the Senate. When the Defense authorization bill undercuts these accounts and programs, it causes great concern within the Department of Defense. 
They will be asked by the Armed Services Committee not to spend the money as it was intended by the appropriations bill--and DoD cannot spend the money for items in this authorization bill for funds were not appropriated in the bills that were already passed. 
The funding could has been allocated more effectively. This does not serve the institution well. 
A further blow against the position taken by the Senate in support of the National Guard was the rejection of the increased rank and role for the next chief of the National Guard. 
Forty-nine Senators cosponsored this effort on a total bipartisan basis. 
Instead, this conference report creates two new advisory positions for the National Guard and Reserves. 
The National Guard already has a chief and two very capable directors--it does not need additional advisers. 
This legislation is, in fact, a step backward for the National Guard and Reserves, and they do not endorse or support this approach. 
I want to assure the Senate, and our friends in the National Guard, that we will be back next year--this matter is not closed, as far as this Senator is concerned. 
The men and women of the Armed Forces deserve, and should receive, the pay raise funded in the Defense appropriations bill that is authorized in this legislation. They must have that. 
The military construction projects appropriated for 1998 will be stalled unless we pass the bill. 
Incidentally, 38 of the projects in the military construction bill, line-itemed by the President, are in this bill. All 38 of them are authorized by this bill, and the House will soon send us a bill to ask the President to reconsider the line-item veto of each of those 38 projects. 
So, I am not asking the Senate to defeat the bill. I do urge others to speak up and to commit to readdress these significant Guard and Reserve component issues next year. 
It is with great regret, however, that I announce to the Senate I will not vote for this conference report. It will be the first conference report on a Defense authorization bill that I have not voted for in 29 years. I feel very strongly about this. That is why I want to make it a matter of record. I don't intend to support an authorization bill again until we do address the problem of the readiness account and the status of the National Guard in the defense structure.

 Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today marks the 100th anniversary of the Thomas Jefferson Building, the crown jewel of the buildings occupied by the Library of Congress. As vice chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library, it is my privilege to mark this important day. 
The Library of Congress occupies a unique place in American history, and in the vast flow of information that crosses the globe and drives America's economic well-being. The Library is Congress' legislative library, our major research arm, and a national library as well as cultural institution. Congress has nurtured this Library from its creation in Philadelphia, through the legislature's move to the new capital city of Washington, through the 1814 British invasion of Washington that burned the Capitol and the Library of Congress, and through our purchase of Thomas Jefferson's own extensive library to recommence the Library of Congress as a universal collection of knowledge. 
By the 1870's, the Library of Congress collections had grown to more than 300,000 volumes and had already outgrown the space in the Capitol that it had occupied since its move to Washington. It was the foresight of Ainsworth Rand Spofford, the sixth Librarian of Congress, that helped transform the Library of Congress into an institution of national stature, and eventually lead to the building of the Thomas Jefferson building we celebrate today. 
Spofford recognized the importance of copyright deposit as a means to ensure the continued development of the Library's collections. After the 1870 revision of the copyright law, two copies of every book, pamphlet, map, print, photograph, and piece of music registered for copyright was to be deposited with the Library of Congress. The copyright law today continues to fuel the Library's special collections, including film, television, digital materials, and computer software. 
The growth of the collections through copyright deposit created the need for a new building for the Library of Congress. The building, later named for Thomas Jefferson, was authorized in 1886 and completed in 1897, on time and under budget and was immediately hailed as a national monument--an imposing structure of the Italian Renaissance style. Every Member of Congress has had the opportunity to visit the magnificently restored Jefferson Building and admire the extraordinary beauty and grandeur of the Great Hall, the Main Reading Room, and the Members' Room. 
It is not a simple matter to authorize a new Federal building, let alone a building to be constructed immediately adjacent to the Capitol. Librarian of congress Spofford had two staunch allies: Senator Daniel W. Voorhees of Indiana and Senator Justin S. Morrill of Vermont. Today, Senator Morrill's efforts will be recognized. A plaque honoring his commitment to the Library and construction of the Jefferson Building will be unveiled by our current Librarian of Congress, James Billington, and the Vermont congressional delegation. The Morrill plaque will flank that recognizing Senator Voorhees so that each Senator might be honored by all who enter the Great Hall for their dedication to and vision for Congress' Library. 
This evening, on behalf of the Joint Committee on the Library, I will join the joint committee chairman, Representative Bill Thomas, Librarian James Billington, and Architect of the Capitol Alan Hantman to light for the very first time the restored Torch of Learning that crowns the Thomas Jefferson Building. The Main Reading Room is the heart of the Thomas Jefferson Building. It is covered by a beautiful dome, the exterior of which is covered by a great blazing torch and flame, marking the center and apex of the Jefferson Building. This torch and flame are symbolic of the learning and knowledge in the Library of Congress. From now on, the glowing Torch of Learning will light the skyline over the Capitol, a worthy companion to the lighted dome of the Capitol. 
I thank, on behalf of my colleagues on the joint committee, the Office of the Architect of the Capitol which has overseen the restoration of the Jefferson Building we celebrate today. As the Library of Congress moves toward its Bicentennial in the year 2000, Congress will continue to reap the benefits of the Library's incomparable collections. In particular, our constituents will benefit from Librarian James Billington's efforts to extend the Library's unique special collections and service nationwide through the Internet. 
One hundred years ago, the Congress supported the vision of Ainsworth Rand Spofford and provided the means for the collections to grow and to be housed in a building described as the most beautiful in America. As the Library of Congress approaches the 21st century, it needs and deserves the continued support of Congress as our nation's strategic information reserve.

 Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, yesteday, the Federl employee community said a final goodby to John Sturdivant, the president of the American Federation of Government Employees. John lost his battle with leukemia on October 28. 
John Sturdivant lead the American Federation of Government Employees--AFGE--since 1988. In fact, in August he won reelection to another term. To say that he will be missed is an understatement. 
Although we did not always agree over the years, there was never any question of John's ultimate goal--protection of the interests of Federal employees. 
John Sturdivant was a strong leader and forceful defender of the rights of Federal employees. He recognized the need for public servants. Federal employees provide a necessary and valuable service to our country. They should not be misunderstood or mistreated or maligned. John was himself a good public servant and worked hard to be a strong advocate.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there are 10 hours, as I understand it, on this bill. I do not have any knowledge yet as to how much time we will take. I will give myself such time as I need in the beginning of this statement. 
On October 6, the President impounded funds for 38 projects contained in the fiscal year 1998 military construction bill, which totaled $287 million. Let me first take a moment to review the merits of this bill. 
Mr. President, in June, President Clinton reached a budget agreement with the bipartisan leadership of the Congress. That agreement provided for an increase of $2.6 billion for national defense over the amount the President had requested for the budget in the fiscal year 1998. The President's action on the military construction bill, in my judgment, reneges on the budget agreement that he reached with the Congress. Congress was given spending caps. We then allocated that within the appropriations process, and the Appropriations Committee presented the Senate with 13 appropriations bills consistent with the spirit, terms, and limits of the revised budget. 
Mr. President, I state to the Senate, without any chance of being corrected, that the Senator from West Virginia and I have done our utmost to live within the terms of the budget agreement, although we didn't agree with it and we weren't present at the time it was made. Now, we have upheld the congressional commitment to the President. Simply stated, the President did not when he used the line-item veto on this bill. 
After consultation with Senator Byrd, the committee held a hearing 3 weeks ago to evaluate the President's use of the line-item authority and review the status of these projects for military construction. We asked military witnesses from three services to testify. They told us there were valid requirements for each of these projects, Mr. President. They were mission-essential to the U.S. military. They also informed the Appropriations Committee that each of these projects was, in fact, executable during the coming fiscal year. 
Now, these projects clearly did not meet the criteria intended by Congress to eliminate wasteful or unnecessary spending. Those were the tests under the line-item veto law. Instead, the President chose to cancel a project because of three criteria that were announced after the action taken by the President. First, he would veto a bill if it was not in the President's 1998 budget request and no design work had been initiated and it did not substantially contribute to the well-being and quality of life of the men and women in the armed services. 
Senator Byrd is going to speak at length on this. He is an expert in this area, and I don't want to go into the area he will cover. It is very clear that that was not within the terms of the bill passed, the law that the President signed, which set forth the process for using the line-item veto. At our Appropriations Committee hearing, it was apparent that, in fact, some design work had been initiated on most of these projects--not all of them, but most of them. 
The generals that were before us confirmed what many of us already knew. The White House decision conflicted with the military needs of the Armed Forces. In every instance these projects were needed and desired by the military services. Since that time the administration has stated--and even today, the President has a message out today--that mistakes were made. The administration has indicated that it will support many of these projects. But so far it has not told the committee which ones, Mr. President. We have a criticism of this bill from the administration, but the administration vetoed 38 projects, and it says it made some mistakes. But it has not publicly said which ones. 
It is my belief that we will be successful in our effort to overturn these line-item vetoes in this instance because the projects the President has attempted to eliminate are meritorious. They are sought by the Department of Defense and by the services involved in each instance, and they are within the budget agreement. 
I want to go back and emphasize that, Mr. President. We had a budget presented to us by the President that was lower than many of us thought was necessary to meet our national needs. The President, in the budget agreement, agreed to that, and he agreed to an increase in defense spending. Our committee received no specification on what he thought that increase should be spent for. So we did what the Constitution gives us the right to do. We determined where the money would be allocated. None of these projects have been listed as being either wasteful or excessive spending. Again, almost all of them are in the 5-year plan, and those that were not in the 5-year plan were indicated to be necessary and ones that were needed by the military. 
I believe that our military people, soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen, and Coast Guardsmen are the ones that are being shortchanged by the President's veto--not the officials in the Pentagon or the White House. 
Let me tell you why I believe the President is reneging. If this line-item veto application, the application of that law to these projects, is sustained, we lose part of the increase that was in the budget agreement. This $287 million is no longer available for expenditure to meet military needs. It is a way for the administration to renege and not meet the goals that we sought for military spending. The President indicated some protected areas in the budget--areas that he wanted protected because of his priorities. Our committee has met every single one of those. We have not stood here and used a pen and taken them out. We have not used what would be a congressional line-item veto and said, no, we don't agree with you on this or that. We have not done that. 
But in this instance, the use of the line-item veto reduces the amount that is available for defense spending for fiscal year 1998 by the amount of the application of the line-item veto. 
I am differing with my good friend from West Virginia. Although for many years I opposed the line-item veto, I came to the conclusion that because we needed additional impetus behind our efforts to bring about a balanced budget, I indicated I would support the line-item veto--and, as a matter of fact, due to circumstances that developed, I was the chairman of the committee and the chairman of the Senate side of the conference on the Line-Item Veto Act. I supported it because I believed it should be used for the stated purpose to eliminate wasteful and excessive spending, and only to eliminate wasteful and unnecessary spending--not to be used as the display of Presidential executive or political power. 
I urge the Senate to support this bill that is before us. We have conferred with all of those involved in the projects. I state that all of the projects except 2 that were in the President's 38 are in this bill. There are two not in there at the request of the Senators involved. Those two, however, are in the House bill.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, that means that there are two projects that are not in this bill that are in the House bill. If the Senate passes this bill--and I seriously urge that it do so--we will go to conference, and the only matters that can be considered in the conference are those two projects. If the House passes the bill--and I presume it will--which has all of the 38 projects, and we pass this one which has 36 projects, the only 2 things that can be discussed in that conference are the 2 projects. And we will bring the conference report back before the Congress very quickly, I believe. 
But, Mr. President, this bill goes beyond the question of what should normally happen under the Line-Item Veto Act concerning actions of a President. This bill pertains to projects that were eliminated at a time when there was an agreement entered into by the leadership of the conference and the Presidency on the level of spending in several discrete categories. From the point of view of this Senator, the most important one was the agreement on the level of spending for the Department of Defense. If this bill does not become law, $287 million of the amount we thought would be available to meet our needs of the Department of Defense will not be there. That $287 million is part of the most vital part of our spending. It is spending for facilities for our people to live in and to work in. I can't think of anything that is more essential right now than to try to maintain our efforts to modernize our bases, modernize our facilities, and to assure that we maintain the quality of life for the military by doing so. 
Mr. President, I urge the Senate to stand together with the House to assure that the President--and really the Presidency--lives up to the bargain that was made with the Congress. I do not speak of the President in a personal vein. I think he relied on the advice that was given him. I do object to the use of the concept of the criteria that was announced by the White House. I think Senator McCain will speak about that. 
Senator McCain and I are in agreement in terms of what the White House should have done when the law was passed. It should have announced then the criteria the President and the administration would use to review individual bills and then match every bill up against that type of criteria. That was not done, Mr. President. 
I believe this bill should become law. 
I thank the Chair. 
I yield to my good friend from West Virginia.

Mr. STEVENS. I understand the position of the Senator from Virginia, but I would like him to consider this: We had $800 million allocated to the military construction budget out of the budget agreement that was entered into with the President. That still left us $700 million below the 1997 level. The action of the President in vetoing 38 projects here has removed $287 million from that. 
If this bill does not pass, that money is gone. But not only is it gone, the President has announced the 18 he made a mistake on he will fund by reprogramming over other money. So the net result of the President's veto is an excess of $450 million that is lost from the defense budget this year. 
Now, it was a mistake. This was not a line-item veto that made sense. It was a sheer mistake. They will not tell us which projects, by the way, he made a mistake on. I wonder if the Senator from Virginia knows that? 
The net result of not passing this bill will be that almost half a billion of the money that we got through the negotiations with the President to increase the defense budget will be gone forever, including quality-of-life projects, barracks, mess halls, housing. I ask the Senator, how can you justify voting for this if you are in favor of the line-item veto? 
I was the chairman of the Senate conference on the line-item veto. I know the requirements of the line-item veto law. The President did not follow it. He did not establish criteria. He announced the criteria after--after--after the decision was made. 
In the case of Virginia, as the Senator pointed out, the criteria didn't fit the Virginia projects. That was true on 36 of the 38 projects. Those 36 are in this bill. 
Now, I say to my friend from Virginia, bad facts make bad law. If this bill doesn't pass, I guarantee the Senator from Virginia, this case will be taken to the courts, and if it is taken to the courts, this will be the vehicle that will lead to the destruction of the line-item veto. 
We are coming at it from different directions, the Senator 
from Virginia and I. I still believe in the line-item veto, but if the President's veto is not overridden, I will join the Senator from West Virginia in seeking to repeal the line-item veto, because this is wrong. This is arrogance, an abuse of power, and it is an overwhelming mistake on the part of the executive branch. 
I thank the Senator for listening to me. If the Senator from Virginia wishes to have time to respond, I yield from our time.

Mr. STEVENS. There is no Alaska project that was eliminated by the President. 
Second, the difficulty that I really have with what the Senator has said is the line-item veto was intended to eliminate waste or projects that would lead to a deficit. We asked for the list. Can the Senator now tell me what 18 or 19 projects the President made a mistake on? Can he give us a list? We never got a list. We have 36 to 38 projects in this bill--because we never got a list from the White House as to what projects the President admitted were erroneously line-item vetoed.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will yield to the Senator from New York when he comes. I know he wants to make a statement. 
But the Senator from Texas has just made the point that I have been trying to make. This is the process of the Line-Item Veto Act. It is the first time we have attempted to use it. This is the override mechanism that is provided by that act, and it was provided by Congress because mistakes could be made. In this instance we now know that mistakes were made. 
The statement came to us today from the Office of Management and Budget that admits there was erroneous material given to the President on which they matched against the criteria that they had used under the Line-Item Veto Act to determine whether any projects should be eliminated. We asked for the list of those projects. 
My staff tells me we still have not received the ones that mistakes were made on. We have no alternative under the circumstances than to include them all. There are two here that are not included because of the specific requests of the States involved not to have their projects involved. But the administration has now clearly said on the record that there were mistakes made. 
The veto message, as I said, violates the spirit and intent of the balanced budget amendment. 
That again is why the override mechanism is in the act. This action taken by the administration does not comply with the act. We have a way of saying to the Presidency we intended that money be spent, and we want it spent for these projects. 
Let's look at this criteria again that the administration used. 
It set forth three criteria, one of which was that the project had to be in the President's budget by definition. In this instance, that was an erroneous criteria because the Presidency had agreed to increase the amount of money that was in the President's budget for defense by $2.6 billion. In the budget agreement that was worked out with leadership. Of that $2.6 billion, $800 million of that was allocated to military construction. Nothing came forward from the administration that indicated that it had any desire to decide where that money went. 
So our committee allocated the money. In allocating it, we gave money to these 38 projects. Our criteria was they had to be projects that the military supported. We had a hearing after the line-item veto took place. At that hearing the military witnesses stated that every project on the list was supported by the Department of Defense military people. They were essential to the program. And I believe all but five were in the long-range program. The other five were covered by changes in circumstances since the long-range 5-year program was devised. But they were specifically supported by the military witnesses. 
The criteria that the Presidency used to determine whether to apply the line-item veto does not stand up to the scrutiny of this Congress. 
I am corrected about one thing. One of the criteria was that no design work had been done. The impact of that is that again there were projects where the information was erroneous that was received by the White House. These projects were in fact underway and could be completed in the next fiscal year. 
I thank you for telling me about that. 
But the problem of the criteria is they were not designed to find projects that were wasteful, or would increase the deficit. 
In this instance, I failed to point out that since we obtained the increase in money allocated to our committee for defense we looked into the long-range program, and we brought up into the 1998 year years that are in the long-range program but were specified to commence at a later time. We did that because some money had already been allocated to those projects by the Department of Defense, and those projects could be more efficiently completed if money was available this year. 
My point is these are not wasteful projects. No one can claim that there any one of these projects that meets the criteria of the Line-Item Veto Act will increase the deficit. By definition they are within this budget. They are within the amount that the administration agreed could be spent this year for defense. And, second, they are not by definition wasteful. 
Those are the two criteria of the Line-Item Veto Act. The President can use the Line-Item Veto Act to eliminate wasteful projects, or projects that would increase the deficit. Neither apply to any one of the 38 projects. 
Under the circumstances, Mr. President, having allocated $800 million to military construction, what we find now, as I said just a little while ago, is a line-item veto eliminates $287 million from the $800 million which was part of the $2.6 billion overall increase for defense. The line-item veto eliminated 35 percent of the money we put into projects to use the increased amount which was available for military construction. That means right now that if the administration goes forward with what is stated in this announcement today from OMB that Senator Byrd has read, they will reprogram money from other projects that have already been approved by the Presidency and move it over to the 18 in which the mistakes were made. 
What does that do to the rest of the budget? It means that we are paying twice. We have lost the $287 million, if this bill does not pass. And, in addition to that, they are going to take somewhere in the vicinity of $175 million. We believe it will be $450 million not spent for needed projects, if this bill is not passed. 
Mr. President, this is the mechanism. That is why I say I will support and, as a matter of fact, introduce a bill to repeal the act, if this mechanism doesn't work. If there is any example where it should work, it is this one. It is admitted that there are 18 projects on which they made mistakes. They refused to tell us which ones. 
I don't know how to handle this when people say you can't do this because this violates the spirit of the Line-Item Veto Act. This is the spirit of the Line-Item Veto Act. And I urge Senators who supported the line-item veto to consider that. If this mechanism is ever to work, this is the point where it should work. If it won't work in this one there is no reason to support this act anymore, in my opinion, because this is really the worst example I could think of a situation where information provided to the President leads the President to line-item veto items that were eliminated by mistake. 
Another avenue, of course, is for this to go to court. If it goes to court, and the court finds in the final analysis that the line-item veto is unconstitutional, which is what my good friend from West Virginia says, then the money will be restored thereto. 
But let's see if the mechanism works. There are already some court challenges. I don't see any reason to have another court challenge to the Line-Item Veto Act. The Senate and the House ought to do its duty on this and the duty is to try to remedy the mistake that was made when the line-item veto was wrongfully exercised in connection with these 38 projects. 
Mr. President, I don't see anyone else seeking time. 
I ask how much time remains?

Mr. STEVENS. It would be very hard, Mr. President, to figure out the net amount. The actual savings would be determined by how much of the projects fall into this year by reprogramming and then how much more money has to be requested next year to pay for the money that is spent for the projects that had been delayed because of the transfer of the money to these projects. I believe that the net will be that there will be $450 million less this year. But I do believe it will increase the cost of defense in later years because of the fact that these projects have been deferred and other projects will be deferred in order to pay for the 18 according to that document.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is always a pleasure to be in the Chamber with the Senator from West Virginia. But mine is a more mundane task right now, and that is to try to get the Senate to understand that this is the process provided by the Line-Item Veto Act. If it is not followed, the defense budget per se and the military construction budget in general will be lowered. If we pass this act and it becomes law, the President still has control over these projects. He has already reprogrammed money for military projects for Bosnia. Next spring we will face another problem of paying for Bosnia. But should we let $450 million go astray here now because of mistakes? I regret that the mistakes were made, but I hope the Senate doesn't make another one. This bill should be overwhelmingly passed to tell the Presidency the line-item veto is a very discrete mechanism and it must be used with care. Above all, its use cannot be based on mistakes. 
I ask for the yeas and nays if they have not been ordered.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am grateful to the Senator from Washington for the manner in which he has handled this bill as the chairman of the subcommittee for Interior appropriations. 
I presented to the conference at a very late moment an amendment, which is amendment No. 128, that modifies the regular amendment that was in the original House bill dealing with the problems associated with management of Alaska fish and game. 
I want to tell the Senate, in July at our request the Secretary of the Interior came to Alaska and met at Senator Murkowski's house with me and Congressman Young, with the Governor, the attorney general, and members of what we know as the Governor's task force on subsistence. We agreed then to try to work together to assure that Alaska, along with all other States, would continue to manage fish and game on Federal lands within its borders. 
It is a very difficult problem for us, but very clearly Secretary Babbitt has carried through with the commitments he made at that time, and we have worked toward finding a resolution to these problems. 
This task force did come up with a report. It is a very interesting task force. It is made up of the Governor and Lieutenant Governor, Governor Knowles and Lieutenant Governor Ulmer, also the speaker of the house, Gail Phillips; the president of the senate, Mike Miller; a former Republican Governor, Jay Hammond; and the former Republican attorney general, Charley Cole. Byron Mallot, Director of the Alaska Permanent Fund, who has held leadership roles in Alaska Native organizations, was also on that task force. 
This task force worked hard over the summer and came up with some recommendations. We hoped those recommendations would be presented to a joint session of the Alaska Legislature this year. That was not possible. When it was really evident it could not be done, I asked the conference to adopt this amendment. It is covered on pages 94 and 95 of the conference report, and I will not comment at large about it. 
But I do want the Senate to know and the Record to show that we have done our best to meet this. Senator Murkowski has just said he is going to hold some hearings, and Congressman Young may hold some hearings. I do hope they will hold them. I hope they will hold them in Alaska. There are a lot of Alaskans who want to be heard on the matter of what should be done. The Congress may be asked to adopt further amendments next year. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. STEVENS. The lands at issue were selected by five Alaska Native village corporations pursuant to the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. The lands were selected in 1974, pursuant to an agreement among the villages, a full 6 years before the creation of Lake Clark National Park. For years, the Department followed a course of processing village land selections outlined in both appendix A and appendix C of the agreement. This prior course is well documented including formal conveyance decisions and reservation of easements. 
In the 1990's, the Department changed its course effectively denying the village corporations the land to which they are entitled. This provision is designed to allow the Native corporations to challenge the Department's refusal to convey them their land in a court of law. While the Alaska congressional delegation believes the Native people are entitled to the land, the Department of the Interior disagrees. We have agreed to allow an objective third party decide, based on the facts of the case and an interpretation of the 1974 agreement, whether the Native people are entitled to the lands in appendix C. 
Because the Interior Department has taken so long to process the villagers land claims, the statute of limitations for challenging the Department has almost expired. To allow a suit to be filed, the conference report extends the statute of limitation through October 1, 1998, under which the five village corporations and Cook Inlet Region, Inc., the regional corporation, may bring litigation challenging the Department's refusal to convey the appendix C lands to the village corporations. 
The amendment clarifies that if litigation is brought by the village corporations or Cook Inlet Region, Inc, it shall be filed in the U.S. district court. The court trial permitted in this amendment will result in a fresh hearing on the merits of the case. 
The court record will not be limited to the current, incomplete administrative record, but shall consider new evidence introduced that is relevant to the interpretation of the agreements and conveyances in dispute. The language allowing introduction of new evidence was proposed by the Office of Management and Budget. This will provide for a neutral hearing on the total circumstances of the dispute.

Mr. STEVENS. Yes. It is the intent of the amendment that a trial on the merits be conducted in the U.S. District Court if the villages decide to file suit. Such a trial would be held in lieu of an administrative hearing conducted by the Department of the Interior and in lieu of a court appeal of any administrative decision that was limited to the current, incomplete administrative record. 
The court must hear all relevant evidence related to the circumstances surrounding the land selections and conveyances and should not be limited to hearing only the views of the Interior Department or reviewing the limited administrative record that currently exists. Nor, in my opinion, should it defer to any prior decision that was not based on a hearing and a full review of the facts. 
In order to ensure justice for the parties, it is necessary that the court have all relevant evidence available to it. Since this dispute has a complex fact pattern that stretches over 20 years, the case should not be resolved on a motion for summary judgment. 
The lands sought by the village corporations were originally selected in 1974. The selections were accomplished with the assistance of officials at the Bureau of Land Management. The village corporations have never varied in their selection priorities, and the selection priorities must be honored by the Federal Government. Those of us who are familiar with the history of this dispute understand that the purpose of the Deficiency Agreement was to give effect to the land selections made by the village corporations. 
The lands should be conveyed to the villages in the priority order in which they were selected, the same requirement that applies to all land conveyances made to Native corporations under the Alaska Native Land Claims Settlement Act. It is important to read all provisions of the agreements in question in the context in which they were negotiated and in light of the legislative purpose the agreements served to fulfill village land selection rights. 
I regret that litigation may be necessary in this case. I am disturbed that the Department of the Interior decided to change its interpretation of the conveyance requirement and is using a very limited interpretation of the Deficiency Agreement to clear title to the appendix C lands. The Department is attempting to acquire more land for Lake Clark National Park. However, it is important to note that the boundaries of Lake Clark National Park were not expanded to potentially include appendix C lands until 6 years after the original land selections were made by the village corporations in 1974. As a result, the appendix C lands are not park lands by virtue of the prior valid Native land selections. 
Since enactment of ANCSA, there has been a substantial amount of litigation regarding interpretation of the statute, but no case has been heard that is directly on point with respect to appendix C. Further no opinion--including Court of Claims cases--has been issued interpreting the Deficiency Agreement based on a full hearing of all the relevant evidence. It is one purpose of this amendment to ensure that the district court's resolution of the present matter will not be bound by any decision or opinion not based on a full review of the legal and factual record. The court must take a new look at the dispute after reviewing a full and complete record.

Mr. STEVENS. I also rise to explain section 120 of the Interior appropriations bill, which provides a right of action for owners of mining claims in the area in Denali National Park and Preserve known as the Kantishna Mining District. This provision is designed to bring an end to nearly 20 years of uncertainty surrounding the future of these claims, and it will ensure that the owners of the claims receive just compensation in return for their interests. 
The plan envisioned by this provision addresses the unique needs of both sides of the debate over the future of mining at Denali National Park and Preserve. The American people, through the National Park Service, will receive the title to lands within the Denali National Park and Preserve and near its crown jewel--Mount McKinley. With this provision, we are assured that those lands will be held for the benefit of all Americans. In return, the owners of mining claims who participate in the program will be fairly compensated for the loss of their interest that has been uncompensated since mining was effectively terminated in the mining district many years ago. 
At this time I wish to clarify my understanding of the provision. We have provided a way for the Secretary of the Interior to take title to mining claims inside Denali National Park, following procedures outlined in the Declaration of Taking Act. We have also identified the mechanism by which the owners of the mining claims who choose to participate and transfer title to their claims are to be compensated for the loss of their claims. The Congress has not, however, fixed the dates as of which the claims at issue were taken, as that is a factual question best left to the parties to determine or, if necessary, for resolution by the jury in proceedings under section 120. Moreover, it is our intention that any action that is brought either by the Secretary or affected claim owners be conducted in accordance with the substantive and procedural law of the Declaration of Taking Act, except where inconsistent with claim owners' rights under section 120, and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, including the claimaint's right to have a trial by jury.

Under President Wolfensohn's wise guidance, the World Bank Group is facilitating global changes through the application of systems and knowledge developed in the United States.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call to the attention of the Senate the fact that in a few days one of our Nation's most distinguished military officers, a veteran of World War II and of the Korean conflict, will celebrate his 90th birthday. 
Lt. Gen. William W. `Buffalo Bill' Quinn, a 1933 graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, completed Command and General Staff School the day before Pearl Harbor. 
He had served as G-2 of the 7th Army, responsible for the intelligence on which the August 1944 allied landing in southern France was based when the 19th German Army was routed. 
The following year he helped to liberate the survivors of the Nazi death camp at Dachau. What he saw there so horrified him that he said he would never let the world forget, so that nothing similar could happen again. 
After the war, General Quinn became director of the Strategic Service Unit that was formerly known as the Office of Strategic Services. Later he was assigned to Korea where he boosted regimental morale by setting up a system for sending word of the accomplishments of individual soldiers to their hometown papers. He also served as G-2 for the daring and historic landing at Inchon. 
His duties as a combat commander began when he was assigned to command the 17th Regiment in Korea, which was known as the `Buffaloes.' 
On a cold winter day in 1951, ending a report on his regiment, he said, `Tell the old man'--and he meant by that Maj. Gen. Claude Ferenbaugh, commanding general of the 7th Division--`that Bill of the Buffaloes said everything will be all right.' 
From then on, Bill Quinn became known as Buffalo Bill. 
After Korea, he served for 2 years as an adviser to the Greek Army. Later he assumed command of the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Lewis, WA, and then returned to the Pentagon as the first Deputy Assistant Chief for Intelligence of the Army. In 1959, he became the Army's Chief of Public Information. 
Assigned to the Defense Intelligence Agency as Deputy Director in 1961, he was then promoted to lieutenant general. In 1964, General Quinn was appointed the 18th commanding general of the 7th Army in Germany. He retired 2 years later. 
I met General Quinn when I went to visit Senator Barry Goldwater once over on the Chesapeake. He is a great individual, Mr. President. General Quinn's distinguished military career provides a picture of a great man. Those of us who are fortunate enough to call him a friend know that he has many more dimensions. He is a fine writer, who has contributed to many periodicals. He wrote a successful television series on our American infantrymen. General Quinn is an ardent fisherman, an outdoorsman, a golfer. In his Academy days, he played end on the football team and attack on the lacrosse team. 
As a father and grandfather, he has a family which is extremely proud of him. His list of citations, decorations, and civic activities and many accomplishments would be a long one and still would not tell the story of the whole man. I know him as an almost professional Irishman. He knows more jokes about Irish people and can tell them at length. And he enjoys Irish whiskey, as a matter of fact. 
Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in honoring a great man, Gen. `Buffalo Bill' Quinn on his 90th birthday, which he will celebrate with his friends and family on November 1. 
I thank the Chair. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

<TEXT>
Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this resolution would extend the continuing concept of our appropriations to Friday, November 7, of this year. The terms and conditions are exactly the same as the bill that was passed by the Senate in September. The 1997 fiscal year funding levels and policy limits will prevail during the extended period of this continuing resolution. 
We have made considerable progress on the appropriations bills for fiscal year 1998. The Defense, military construction, Treasury, energy and water, and legislative branch bills have all been enacted. 
The Transportation and VA-HUD bills are pending before the President and should be signed within the next few days. 
The Agriculture conference report has passed the House and is pending here in the Senate. 
We expect to file an Interior appropriations conference report later today. 
And it is my opinion we will complete the conference on the foreign operations, Commerce and Labor, Health and Human Services bills this week. 
Additionally, we should pass or obtain cloture on the District of Columbia bill this week. 
I am here to say I am grateful for the cooperation of the two leaders, Senator Lott and Senator Daschle, in aiding our Appropriations Committee in passing these bills with significant bipartisan majorities. 
We continue to need the help of all Members to complete our work prior to November 7. 
Mr. President, I do not hope to come back to this floor again during this session of Congress to seek another continuing resolution. 
We have very difficult policy issues to be settled on foreign operations, the Labor bill, and the Commerce bill, but I do believe we can complete the budget aspect of those bills this week. The controversial riders that are attached to the bills will dictate whether we can complete all of our work on these appropriations bills within this extended period. 
I urge Senators who are concerned about these bills to support this continuing resolution, to give the committee the time it needs to work out the remaining differences between the House and the Senate on the bills that I have just enumerated. 
Mr. President, again, it is my hope that we will, in this session, pass the separate appropriations bills, let the President exercise his will with regard to each bill, and conduct our affairs in the Appropriations Committee with separate appropriations bills and not to have one all-encompassing global type of continuing resolution as we wind up this session. 
It is possible, Mr. President, to do our job, as we should do it--13 separate bills. That is my plea to the Senate. Help us work out the 13 separate bills. 
I thank the President and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, at a later date I will enjoy entering into the discussion that has just been commenced. I assure the Senate it is not finished. I have great fondness for all participants, but I have two worries. One worry is the worry that the head of the Federal Reserve just announced we are coming into a period of inflation, and the second worry is whether the impact of the amendment as supported by the Senator from Texas would require a reduction in discretionary spending for other accounts in the years covered by the amendment of the Senator from West Virginia. That still has to be examined, in my opinion.

Mr. STEVENS. That is cosponsored by the Senator from West Virginia and a series of other Senators, Mr. President. I do wish to have it referred. 
I had it read because I think the Senate and those who are watching this proceeding should know how sanitized this process is. Those projects listed by the simple numbers in the President's message were denied the use of $287 million for the men and women of the armed services. As was pointed out by Senator Faircloth of North Carolina, that is approximately the amount of money we are spending per month in Bosnia. Yet, each one of these projects was very much sought after by the Department of Defense, was reviewed by eight committees of the Congress, was reviewed on the floor of the House and here on the floor of the Senate and in conference, and once again brought back to each House. 
I say again, the Senator from West Virginia makes a compelling case for his position, if this is to be the policy of this administration, if there is to be an indiscriminate use of the line-item veto without regard to waste, without regard to the necessity of the money that Congress says must be spent. 
So, I look forward to this bill being referred to our committee. When we return from the coming recess we shall proceed expeditiously. Senator Byrd and I have agreed these matters will be kept in full committee so we will not have to go through the subcommittee process. And we will return this bill to the Senate as quickly as possible.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have sought the floor now to introduce a disapproval bill to reverse the President's use of the line-item veto in the fiscal year 1998 military construction appropriations bill. I believe at least 37 of my colleagues will join as cosponsors of this bill. 
The Line-Item Veto Act, public law 104-130, provides very specific fast-track procedures for consideration of a disapproval bill. I want to discuss those in detail later in these comments. 
Congress received the President's special message listing the 38 cancellations in the military construction bill on Monday, October 6. The bill we introduce today is within the 5 calendar days of session timeframe provided for fast-track process. 
Let me take a minute on the merits of this bill, Mr. President. In June, the President reached a budget agreement with the bipartisan leadership of the Congress. That agreement provided an increase of $2.6 billion for national defense over the amount that the President had requested in the budget for fiscal year 1998. The President's action on the military construction bill, in my judgment, reneges on the budget agreement he reached with the Congress. We were given our spending caps under the agreement and the Appropriations Committee presented the Senate with 13 appropriations bills consistent with the spirit, terms and limits of the revised budget. 
We upheld our end of the agreement with the President. The President has not. This afternoon the Appropriations Committee met to evaluate the President's use of the line-item veto authority. 
I called this hearing after consultation with Senator Byrd because of the manner in which the President had used this new prerogative on this military construction bill. I asked the committee to consider whether that tool was used as intended by Congress, and that intention was that the line-item veto would be used to eliminate wasteful or unnecessary spending. The committee heard testimony from the Air Force, Navy and Army regarding the merits of the 38 military construction projects. Today's hearings afforded our committee the chance to review the status of these projects in the military's future budget plans and whether or not they could be executed in 1998. Our military witnesses testified that in fact these projects were mission-essential and that they could be commenced in 1998. These military witnesses stated that the military services were not consulted in deciding which projects should be vetoed on this bill. These witnesses also informed us that 33 of the 38 projects in the President's message on the line-item veto are in the Department's future year defense plan. Let me repeat that. Thirty-three of the 38 projects the President indicated he wished to line-item veto were in a plan he had approved himself. 
They told us that the President's January budget constraints had prohibited them from including many of these projects in this year's budget. If the military services at the beginning of the year had had the extra $2.6 billion that the President agreed to in July, it is my judgment that all of the projects listed in the disapproval bill could and probably would have been included in the President's fiscal year 1998 budget request, if he listened to the military departments. 
It's my belief that we will be successful in what we are starting today, which is an effort to overturn these line-item vetoes because the projects that the President has attempted to eliminate are meritorious, are sought by the Department, are within the budget agreement, and they are not wasteful or excessive spending. 
These projects reflect a combination of quality of life, safety, readiness and infrastructure enhancement initiatives, Mr. President. A substantial number of them would significantly improve the day-to-day working conditions for men and women in uniform. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines are the ones that are being shortchanged by the President's veto, not officials in the Pentagon or in the White House. 
I will urge my colleagues to support us in this important endeavor. We must stand together to require that the President live up to the bargain he made with the Congress this summer. The Line-Item Veto Act provides a process to resolve the issue quickly, so I want to take the time of the Senate to outline that process so that we all know this is a new process for all of us. 
Under this act, the President sent to Congress one special message for each law in which the President exercises his cancellation authority under the Line-Item Veto Act. That special message must contain a numbered list of each item the President seeks to cancel. The Line-Item Veto Act includes a fast track--a process for the speedy consideration of one disapproval bill for each message. Our action today only pertains to the military construction bill. 
In order to overturn one or more of the cancellations in a special message, the Congress must send a bill to the President disapproving the cancellations. That bill may be vetoed by the President using his constitutional veto authority. As with any other bill, the President's veto then may be overturned only by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Members of each House. In order to qualify for this expedited process, the provisions of the Line-Item Veto Act require that a disapproval bill must be introduced within five calendar days of session after the Congress receives a special message from the President. With respect to the Senate, a calendar day of session is a day in which both Houses of Congress are in session. This fast-track procedure applies only in the House for 30 calendar days of session. There is no time limit 
on the Senate's consideration of the bill, other than the time for introduction of the bill and the discharge from the committee. 
A disapproval bill in the House must contain a list of all the items canceled in the special message. A disapproval bill in the Senate may contain any or all of the items canceled. I might say, Mr. President, that the bill I will introduce with my cosponsors will not include all of the measures, because some Senators have indicated they do not want to move forward with their items. The format for the disapproval bill is spelled out in the Line-Item Veto Act, and the fast track process is available only if that exact format is followed. 
The addition of anything other than the numbers from the list of the items canceled in the special message, whether on the floor or in conference, results in the loss of the fast track process in both the House and the Senate. In other words, no amendments to this bill, other than dealing with the specific items by number as listed in the President's message, are in order. Once introduced, the disapproval bill is referred to the committees with jurisdiction over the items that have been canceled, and it must be reported within 7 calendar days of session. After 7 calendar days of session, it is in order in either the House or the Senate to have the committees discharged. Special rules then apply in the House and the Senate with respect to debate and amendments on a disapproval bill. 
In the Senate, there are no more than 10 hours of debate with one extension of time for up to 5 additional hours. That is possible at the request of the leadership. Debate on any amendment is limited to one hour with up to a limit of 10 hours, at which time all amendments then pending are voted on. 
Special rules are also provided in the act for the conference committee. The conferees are directed to accept any item in a disapproval bill that was included in both the House and the Senate and are limited to accepting or rejecting any item in disagreement. In other words, there can be nothing added in conference that is not in one bill or the other. 
Debate in the Senate on a conference report is limited to four hours. This will be an expedited process, Mr. President. We intend to start it as soon as we return. Let me say again that there is a learning curve for us on the line-item veto process, and I am also constrained to say to the Senate what I just said at the conclusion of the hearing on the subject of the President's special message before the Appropriations Committee. 
It is obvious to me that the use of the line-item veto by the White House in this instance was very excessive. It is also obvious to me that the information process in getting the details to the President concerning the items in the bill that he used the line-item veto on were very, very badly handled. We are now awaiting the President's action on the Defense Appropriations bill. As chairman, I have been notified that the Department of Defense wishes to discuss that bill with our staff and with Members, and there was an indication that we might be asked to `negotiate' to see what items would be subject to a veto under the Line-Item Veto Act and what items the President would yield to that Congress desires to not have vetoed. 
I have notified the Department of Defense and the White House that we are not prepared--Senator Byrd and I have agreed--to negotiate with regard to any of those items. We will--and our door is open--explain to the White House or the Department why we put in any of the items, or why we left them out, but we will not negotiate. Our constitutional duty is to pass legislation. As a matter of fact, the Congress is given the specific authority for the legislative process. The President may recommend to the Congress, but he cannot dictate to the Congress, and he is not going to dictate to the Congress during the watch of this Senator. I think I am joined in that regard by the Senator from West Virginia. We do not intend to negotiate with regard to items that have already been passed by the Congress. We do discuss it before we pass a bill with the administration and we listen to them at times about threats of vetoes. But we are not going to listen to those threats after a bill is passed. 
I urge the Senate to understand this process that we are going through now because it is obvious that the process will be followed again and again. I announced at the conclusion of the hearings on this message on the Military Construction bill that if the same process is followed on the Department of Defense bill, an arrogant abuse of power, I intend to introduce a bill to repeal the Line-Item Veto Act. I was a supporter of the Line-Item Veto Act; as a matter of fact, I was chairman of the conference on the Senate side of that act. But I believed it should be used for a stated purpose, only to eliminate wasteful or unnecessary spending. We make mistakes at times and we make compromises at times, which perhaps could lead to what a President could class as being wasteful or unnecessary spending. But a wholesale condemnation of an act passed by Congress by use of the line-item veto pen, to me, is arrogance. From my point of view, I will persist in trying to repeal that statute and take it away from this administration--it will only be extended to the executive branch for a short period of time anyway--if it is abused again.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the conference report on H.R. 2269, the Department of Defense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1998, closely follows the bill passed by the Senate on July 15. 
The bill provides $247.5 billion in new budget authority for the Department, an amount within the levels set in the budget agreement with the White House. 
As in July, the conference report reflects a bipartisan effort, and I am grateful to my friend and colleague from Hawaii, Senator Inouye, for his partnership in bringing this bill back to the Senate, and bringing it back as a very good bill. 
The House passed the conference report by a vote of 356 to 65, today. 
The full text of the conference report, and the accompanying statement of the managers was printed in yesterday's Congressional Record. 
The print of House Report 105-265 has been available to all Members today. 
The tables and descriptive text of the statement of the managers details the funding levels for all the programs considered by the conferees--I will not take the Senate's time to summarize those adjustments. 
I do want to highlight the toughest policy issue we faced--continued funding for operations in and around Bosnia. 
The House of Representatives in its original bill passed a provision which was a total prohibition on spending for any operations in Bosnia after June 30, 1998. 
Personally, I believe we should withdraw our forces from Bosnia. 
Secretary Cohen and General Ralston met with us, and urged us not to take that unilateral step, at this time. 
Prior to this conference, several of us traveled to the United Kingdom, for the periodic United States-United Kingdom interparliamentary meetings. 
In those talks some of us came to appreciate better the total dependence by our European allies on the United States forces in Bosnia. 
The compromise we reached retains the position of the House that we bring our forces out of Bosnia by June 30, but the President can waive that requirement if he certifies to the Congress the forces must stay in the interest of our national security. 
The President must also inform the Congress on seven points: First, the reasons for the deployment; second, the number of personnel to be deployed; third, the duration of the mission; fourth, the mission and objectives; fifth, the exit strategy for U.S. forces; sixth, the costs for operations past June 30; and seventh, the impact on morale and retention. 
This certification to Congress will constitute the first time this President has informed the Congress about Bosnia before deploying or extending our forces there. 
I want to recognize the leadership of my good friend from Kansas, Senator Pat Roberts, who contributed to our discussions in the United Kingdom following the visit he made to the continent. And it was his ideas that he passed on to me that really led to the compromise that we have reached in this conference. 
The Congress and the American people, Senator Roberts told me, deserve to know why our forces are in Bosnia and how long they must stay. The provision in this bill requires such a statement. 
The President is also expected to submit a supplemental appropriations request for additional amounts needed to maintain our forces in Bosnia if he decides to keep them there without damaging the readiness or the quality of life of our Armed Forces. 
Virtually every program funded in this bill when we originally passed it the House and the Senate were funded differently. And ultimately we had to find a compromise level between those two bills. We actually had to eliminate some $4.5 billion of items that were funded in one bill or the other. 
Let me point out just some instances. 
In the case of the Dual Use Applications Program, we sustained the full $125 million that was provided by the Senate. That is $25 million more than the House had provided. 
On ACTD's, we reached an even split with the House, which provides $81 million--nearly a 50 percent increase compared to the level appropriated for fiscal year 1997. 
For overseas humanitarian, disaster, and civic aid, we again split the difference with the House providing $47 million. 
One program where we sustained the full administration request is in the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, known as the `Nunn-Lugar' initiative. 
Secretary Cohen made the strong plea for the full $382 million sought by the President, and we have convinced the conference to accommodate that request. 
I again want to thank all conferees on both sides, and especially the House Chairman, Congressman Bill Young, and the ranking member, Congressman Jack Murtha. 
I feel very proud about the work that was done by the conference working as a team. 
I urge all Members of the Senate to vote in favor of approving the conference report before the Senate. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the conferees have included a general provision, sec. 8129, within this conference report containing language to permit the Navy to enter into a contract for the procurement of four submarines under the New Attack Submarine Program. I would like to point out that this section does not provide new budget authority, but rather is an earmark of the amounts appropriated under the heading `Shipbuilding and Conversion, Navy' for the New Attack Submarine Program. The intent of the conferees was not to create new budget authority over and above amounts set forth elsewhere in the bill, but rather to clarify the terms and conditions under which the New Attack Submarine contract may be entered into between the Navy and the contractor team. 
C-17 
Mr. President, the conferees on the Defense spending bill understand that the manufacturer of the C-17 is building two additional aircraft in fiscal year 1998 for potential commercial sale. However, the Air Force has an agreement with the contractor which may permit DOD to accept early delivery of these aircraft within the Defense Department's C-17 multiyear contract. This agreement, combined with positive cost and schedule performance under the C-17 contract, may permit DOD to purchase up to 11 aircraft within the fiscal year 1998 appropriation. Thus, I believe the Senate's objective of delivering additional C-17 aircraft in fiscal year 1998 may actually be achieved without the appropriation of additional funds at this time.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in review of the printed copy of the `Statement of the Managers' that accompanies H.R. 105-265, the fiscal year 1998 Department of Defense conference report, we have found a typographical error in the Patriot modification line of the `Missile Procurement, Army' account. The President's budget request included $20,825,000 for the continued modification of the Patriot missile system. It was the decision of the conference committee to provide a total $28,825,000, an increase of $8 million above the budget request for this program in fiscal year 1998. The additional funds provided by the conferees are for the procurement of additional GEM +/- upgrades for the Patriot system. I would note that the tables on page 90 of House Report 105-265, do not reflect the intent of the conferees. 
It would be my hope that the Army would execute this program to reflect the intent of the conferees and further, that the Army use its reprogramming authority to provide the recommended funding level of the conference committee. I intend to work with my ranking member, Senator Inouye and Representatives Young and Murtha to insure this program is not inappropriately reduced because of a administrative error.

Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of Senator Hollings' bill to require a wholesale review of the Nation's oceans and coastal policies to prepare for the 21st century. We have not done this since the 1960's, and the time has come. 
The bill has three important components: First, it calls for the development of a coherent national ocean and coastal policy; second, it establishes a 15-member commission similar to the Stratton Commission to make recommendations within 18 months on this national ocean and coastal policy; and third, it creates an interagency council of all the Federal agencies involved in oceans and coastal matters, chaired by the Secretary of Commerce, to coordinate the implementation of the national policy. 
I applaud Senator Hollings for developing this legislation. As has been pointed out, over half of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of our shores. In my State, the oceans employ more people in the private sector than any other industry. The demands on our oceans and coastal resources continues to grow, and we must be prepared to meet these demands in the 21st century.

 Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, yesterday I attended a ceremony to mark the 50th anniversary of the Department of Defense. It was a most impressive event to honor the men and women who serve in the defense of our Nation. 
Our former colleague, Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen, highlighted the achievements of the Department over these past 50 years. He reminded us of the Department's great legacy and challenges that lie ahead in the future. 
The Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and my good friend, Gen. Joe Ralston, also spoke at this event. His remarks illustrated the significant changes that have occurred since the Department's inception and saluted our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who so honorably serve our country. 
Mr. President, I request that the text of the remarks of both Secretary Cohen and General Ralston be printed in the Congressional Record.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment provides funding to help resolve some of the most pressing concerns relating to national park and State recreation facilities, and to the ocean areas off Alaska. 
The amendment would reserve $800 million that was not anticipated to be received by the Federal Treasury in a case recently decided by the Supreme Court. 
That case--cited at 117 S.Ct. 1888--involved a dispute between the Federal Government and the State of Alaska over the right to mineral lease revenue on the natural formation off the coast of Alaska known as Dinkum Sands. 
The Federal Government prevailed and received lease revenue plus interest totaling $1.6 billion. 
The Congressional Budget Office estimated earlier this year that the Federal Treasury would receive only $800 million. 
Our amendment would deposit the other $800 million in a new fund called the National Parks and Environmental Improvement Fund. Beginning with fiscal year 1999, the interest from this fund would be available for: First, capital projects in the National Park System; second, State outdoor recreation planning, development, and acquisition; and third, marine research important to the vast Federal and State waters off Alaska. 
Forty percent of the annual interest would be available to design, construct, repair, and replace National Park Service facilities to enhance the experience of park visitors. 
In Alaska this will go a long way toward expanding and upgrading the overcrowded visitor facilities that have become a significant problem. 
As Senator McCain mentioned, the need to upgrade the Park Service facilities nationally is great, and may run into the billions of dollars. Our bill would create a mechanism specifically designed to begin to address this problem. 
Our amendment would make 40 percent of the annual interest available under section 6 of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act to the States to be used for outdoor recreation planning, development, and the acquisition of land. 
The States, too, face a backlog in upgrading existing park facilities and creating new facilities. 
Finally, our amendment provides 20 percent of the annual interest from the National Parks and Environmental Improvement Fund for marine research in, and relating to, the north Pacific Ocean, Bering Sea, and Arctic Ocean. 
These vast marine areas off Alaska comprise more than half of the Nation's coastline, provide over half of the Nation's commercial fisheries harvest, and contain vast mineral resources important to Alaska and the Nation. This income was derived from those waters. 
We face pressing concerns in these waters that touch every part of Alaska's coastline. Some of the immediate concerns include, to name just a few: 
Declines in certain bird and marine mammal species in the Bering Sea; a failure this year in our Bristol Bay and Kuskokwim salmon returns; excessive fisheries harvests and other unknown activities in the Russia portion of the Bering Sea; environmental contamination in the Arctic Ocean; subsistence whaling concerns; the need to develop new products and more environmentally efficient fishing methods; and the need to develop fisheries for underutilized species (such as the dive fisheries in southeast Alaska) that could help take the pressure off other fish stocks. 
Our amendment would establish a North Pacific Research Board that would set marine research priorities and recommend grants to tackle those priorities. The Secretary of Commerce and Alaska Department of Fish and Game, or their designees, would serve as cochairs of the Board. 
The Secretary of Commerce would approve or disapprove the Board's grant recommendations. The amendment gives the Board very broad discretion in setting the priorities for the research grants. 
We know of some of the issues that need immediate attention, but not all of them, and we can't know what the priorities should be in the future. To summarize, the amendment Senator McCain and I are offering will improve the experience visitors have at our national parks and State parks, and will greatly increase our knowledge about the vast waters off Alaska. 
I urge other Senators to support this measure.  
Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Department of the Interior has interpreted a provision I sponsored in the 1996 lands bill. This interpretation reduces monies intended to go to Alaska's unorganized borough as a payment in lieu of taxes [PILT] by over $950,000. I offer an amendment to the Interior appropriations bill to correct this. 
After many years of working on this issue, the Congress last year enacted my proposal to qualify the unorganized borough in the State of Alaska for PILT. This provision of law--section 1033 of P.L. 104-333--made clear that `any area in Alaska that is within the boundaries of a census area used by the Secretary of Commerce in the decenniel census,' and which did not qualify for PILT under the existing clause, would qualify for a PILT. The only entity in Alaska that would qualify under this provision is Alaska's unorganized borough. The Department--through the Solicitor--has correctly interpreted that the unorganized borough qualifies, but has incorrectly calculated the amount the unorganized borough should receive under the 1996 amendment. 
PILT payments are generally calculated based on population and land acreage. The 1996 amendment specified that the unorganized borough's entire population and entire acreage would be used in the calculation. The Secretary has not counted the entire population in the unorganized borough in calculating the borough's PILT allocation. Specifically, the Department has not counted the population of certain cities which have federal lands within the unorganized borough. 
According to the Regional Solicitor's May 30, 1997 opinion, if the population of each city within the unorganized borough were counted as intended by the 1996 provision, the State would be entitled to $3,362,339. If in Alaska the cities within the unorganized borough are calculated separately, according to the opinion, the payments to the cities would be $78,557 and the payment for the unorganized borough would be $2,333,764. These two payments total $2,412,321, $950,018 less than the $3,362,339 the unorganized borough should be receiving. 
The amendment today would clarify that the population of the cities within the unorganized borough in Alaska should be counted in calculating the PILT allocation for the unorganized borough, and not separately, as intended by the provision in the 1996 lands bill.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to take just a few minutes of the Senate's time to comment upon the passage of Senate bill 1061, the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Act. 
During the 104th Congress, the bill from this subcommittee was the center of political controversy between the Congress and the White House, and within the Senate itself. We did not succeed in passing a bill as a separate measure for these functions in the 104th Congress. 
Thursday's vote of 91 to 8 sent a clear signal of the Senate's support for the leadership shown by Senators Specter and Harkin. They crafted a bill that emerged from our Appropriations Committee unanimously. 
The statement of administration policy raised a few differences, but it indicated strong bipartisan support for this bill. The most contentious votes we have faced this year on appropriations bills were on the Labor, Health and Human Services bill. 
Despite the strong feelings generated by those issues, the debate was fair. The entire Senate came together to pass the bill, and sent the unambiguous message that I referred to--we want to see this bill enacted this year. 
Supporting the work of the subcommittee has been an extremely experienced and effective staff. Craig Higgins serves as clerk of the subcommittee. He is joined by Marsha Simon, who assists Senator Harkin as the minority clerk. Bettilou Taylor, Dale Cabaniss, Lula Edwards, and Carole Geagley round out the subcommittee staff. 
I commend not only the chairman and ranking member but all of the staff for the hard work and the effort they put into preparing the bill in a fashion that received such strong, strong support in the committee, and from the Senate. 
We eagerly now await the passage of that bill by the House, so we can have the conference commence and get the bill to the President prior to September 30, I hope. 
I also report to the Senate that the Agriculture and legislative conferences are proceeding. We should have those bills from conference today. 
We have just passed a military construction bill. 
We have in conference the Department of Defense conference which had its first meeting yesterday. 
The VA-HUD bill, the Energy bill, the foreign ops bill, and Transportation--we expect, Mr. President, all of those will be out of conference early next week. 
That will leave us five bills to still finish. 
The District of Columbia bill has not passed the Senate yet, nor the House. 
We have before us now, under the guidance of the Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], the Interior bill. We expect it to be finished here this week and go to conference and, hopefully, come back to the Senate next week. 
As I have said, the Labor, Health and Human Services bill, the House needs to pass that. We hope it will get to it soon. That will leave us the Commerce, State, Justice bill, and the Treasury bill--all of which, Mr. President, it is still our goal to try and get them to the President by the 30th of September. 
Mr. President, it will mean perhaps, though, we will have to have still a continuing resolution to give the President the time that he needs to review all of these bills. I am hopeful that the House will send us a continuing resolution--a clean continuing resolution--sometime early next week. 
I commend the Senator from Washington on this bill. I am hopeful the Senate will work with us to make sure that this bill is finished here today, if it is at all possible. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I thank my good friend from Arizona for his comments concerning my participation in the dialogue on this amendment which has just taken place in my office. Let me state at the outset that I believe that in this country there is a period of rising expectations on the part of our 
Alaska Native and native American peoples that there will be more assistance coming to them from the Federal Government. And, of course, we all seek to have greater self-determination on the part of those people who are part of the Indian tribes and native peoples of our country. The great difficulty is that this is not just an expectation but an increasing demand now for additional money to enable these peoples to carry out the legitimate roles that they have in their own tribal and native organizations. This comes at a time when we are living under a budget ceiling with diminishing resources, as far as the Department of Interior is concerned, caused primarily, in my opinion, because of the vast increase--the enormous increase--in the amount of interest we are paying on the national debt, which is literally squeezing out a lot of the items that we were able to afford previously. We are working on that in connection with the balanced budget process. But it is hard for many people on the reservations in the contiguous States and small villages throughout my State, and throughout our Nation, to understand that there is a limit on the amount of money we have available to put into such funds, like the Tribal Priority Allocation Fund. We face this year a situation where there is a budget request for an increase in money. Yet, because of actions that have taken place in the last 3 years, there are almost 100 percent more tribes in number than we previously dealt with under this account. Those are primarily in my State, the State of Alaska. Alaska now has 226 different entities that are called tribes by the Department of Interior. In the past, they were Native villages. The population of the Native villages belonged to the several different tribes in our State. 
The net result of this is that, despite the increased request for funds, it is not really possible to meet these legitimate requests, and, as I said, in some instances, demands for increased money. This has led to a series of alternative suggestions--some from the Senator from Washington, as the chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee dealing with these issues, and others from those who serve on our Indian committee, led by my good friend from Colorado. And I say to the Senate that I think it is time that we really have some more information to deal with this. I know some people are reluctant to solicit that information. But I have joined the Senator from Washington in asking the GAO to do some examination into the various types of options that may be available to Congress to deal with these increasing demands which exceed our ability to provide funds in all these areas. 
It does seem to me that we have to realize, despite our own personal feelings that some people might have on the subject, that the people who live on Indian reservations and in these very isolated Indian and Native communities in my State are literally the poorest of our poor. They are the people that need our consideration, and our help, more than any I know in the Nation. Many of us have spent years trying to find ways to help them deal with their problems. There has been no real panacea. We have not discovered a way yet. But we clearly now have increasing participation in governmental affairs in a democratic way in most of these tribes and villages of our Nation. 
I am hopeful that these tribal priority allocations will, in fact, be used to provide a greater degree of democracy, a greater degree of participation, and a greater attempt to satisfy the needs of the people who should be receiving the benefits of the Federal money that we provide through the Bureau of Indian Affairs. We all have some serious questions about the BIA. It is an institution that may well have outlived its usefulness in the sense of being able to deal with the problems of the native American and Alaska Native people. But, for the time being, it is the only institution we have. 
As Members of Congress we are vitally interested in the affairs of the Indian tribes and Alaska Native people. We need to take more time in trying to not only work out the differences among us, but also work out solutions with respect to how the Federal Government can further the aspirations of these people to become 
more able to deal with the problems of the present and the future and better able to find a way to preserve their own culture and have greater participation in American affairs. 
For that reason, I am pleased that we have had these meetings. I think that the meetings that have taken place between the Senators who are on the Appropriations Committee and the Indian Affairs Committee have been most helpful for us not to only understand one another but understand some of the problems that are different. They are different in Colorado, they are different in Arizona. They are different in Hawaii. Most people do not think of Hawaii having Indian problems. But there are issues involving the indigenous peoples in Hawaii that are very, very complex. My friend from Hawaii is spending a lot of time on this issue, as is the Senator from New Mexico, and legitimately so. 
Our constituents, by the way, don't all make the same requests. They don't necessarily seek the same goals. They don't even seek the same solutions to their common goals. What I'm saying is that it is not an easy thing right now for us to deal with this issue in appropriations. 
Therefore, I am delighted as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee that we have this commitment from the Indian Affairs Committee that there will be hearings on the subject, that there will be really an examination in depth into the possible solutions to the problems presented by these issues arising out of the allocation of funds in the tribal priority allocation. 
I thank the Senator from Washington for his willingness to step down from some of the requests he has made of the Senate, and to give us a chance to go back and get some basic data and information that will be necessary for us to deal with this. I hope and pray we will deal with it next year in a fair and open way, and find a way to ensure that the moneys that are available are made available first to those who have the greatest need for them, and particularly that the people who are seeking this money understand what it is for. It is for assistance in maintaining the governance of these tribes and villages. These aren't slush money accounts. They are very strictly limited by law, and we want to make certain that they are, in fact, used for the benefit of the people who are on reservations, as well as in those very isolated villages in my State. 
Let me thank all of the Members who have participated in this. I do hope that the Senate will accept our compromise amendment to the amendment on this subject that was originally in the bill as reported from our committee. 
I thank all concerned for their participation.

Mr. STEVENS. I appreciate the statements made by the distinguished Democratic leader, but I have just counted days and we have 8 more days in this month to vote. And we have 14, 15 bills to bring across this floor from the Appropriations Committee that should all be passed by September 30. Tomorrow night is the President's picnic, and by tradition we would not be voting tomorrow night. That means we are not going to be voting Friday. Unless we get some agreement very quickly, I would say by tomorrow afternoon, we probably cannot finish this bill this week. We have the Interior bill and we have the D.C. bill yet to pass and 14 bills after that--13 conference reports, managers' statements from the conferences, and 1 continuing resolution. 
I am beginning to see a problem developing as far as our ability to handle these bills if these extraneous amendments are going to weigh them down. I urge that we find some way to make up a list to see how many more amendments we have out there and then see what we can do about the time or getting some agreement to terminate this. This bill actually is a larger bill than the defense bill. We have been on this bill now for a substantial 
period of time. I think we have to find some way to get it to a resolution by at least Thursday afternoon and lay down the Interior bill so we can start that and get some of the debate going on Friday on that at least. I hope that we would find some way to get some resolution on some of these items that appear to be unlimitable right now. 
Is there some way we could agree on getting a list and say there will be no more amendments? Could we get a list that there will be no more amendments raised?

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this pending Lieberman-Coats amendment is a good one. We see no reason to take further time on it because the House bill does have the $75 million for charter schools. The effect of this amendment would be to increase it to that amount. 
It is the intention of the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Specter, to notify the House that in conference we will recede to the House on this item. 
I appreciate the indulgence of the two Senators, Senator Lieberman and Coats, and ask under the circumstances that they accept our word that will be the amount of money provided for charter schools under this bill when it comes out of conference.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am constrained to follow the statement that is made by Senator Specter, the chairman of the subcommittee. It is my understanding also that the election officer's recommendation has not been approved by the court. I share the consternation of many people here about the timing of that election officer's report of her findings concerning that Teamster election. 
It is clear that under the existing situation there is no order of the court. Even the court hasn't even considered that recommendation, if we have one who has exercised severe bad judgment in terms of the timing of the announcement of her finding. And it is apparent that she could be overruled as to even her findings. But the main thing is that this is a bill that has nothing in it pertaining to this matter. 
There now comes another one of our cause celebre riders that could well lose the product of this bill. 
Mr. President, we have 14 appropriations bills to pass by this Senate before September 30, 13 bills coming out of conference, and one continuing resolution. That says that if we can't send them all to the President and get them signed before the 30th, there will have to be a continuing resolution in any event. In addition to that, we have this bill and two other bills to pass. 
We are really going to be in appropriations every day during this period of September. 
I have great respect for my friend from Oklahoma. But I have to say the time to deal with this issue is when and if the administration asks Congress for money to pay for this election. We don't even know that there is going to be a new election. If the court rules there is to be a new election, there is no authority in the Department of Justice or the Department of Labor to use existing funds for that election. They will have to come up here with a supplemental request. That is the time we should deal with it. 
I have to say that it is my feeling, very frankly, as chairman of the committee, that I would rather risk a supplemental--an issue where we disagree with the administration--than risk the whole year's bill. To my knowledge, this is the only issue that would lead this bill to be subject to a veto. 
So I really have to say, as I did to my friend from Oklahoma, that I disagree with the Senator from Massachusetts, too; that I don't think his amendment is necessary, the amendment in the second degree. And I don't think it is timely to raise the Nickles amendment now. 
What we need to do is get on with our work and get this bill passed. We still have the Interior bill, we have the District of Columbia bill, and then we have all 13 bills to pass as conference reports, and then we have to pass a continuing resolution. And it has a conference report, too. 
So, if we want to be here all year working appropriations, then we can spend our time on these riders again. For me, there is no necessity for the second kick of a mule. I got kicked the last time we had this problem on that supplemental. I don't see any reason to go through it again. 
I urge the Senate not to approve these riders that are controversial. Every one of them has something we would like to have settled. And, if they are noncontroversial and we can work them out, we should do it. But this is a controversial matter. It is, obviously. I am told that the Department of Labor believes it is cheaper to pay for the supervision of the election rather than to have to deal with many complaints on the next election, if one is ordered. 
So this is a very complicated issue. 
From my point of view, it is not involved in this bill before us. I respect my good friend from Oklahoma in terms of his views about that election officer, as I have said, and the timing of the release, but there is nothing before us yet. The court has not approved that report. We are dealing with speculation as to whether there will even be another election. So why tie up this bill and tie up the Senate on an issue that is premature, Mr. President, and I urge the Senate to join me in voting against both my friend from Massachusetts and my friend from Oklahoma.

Mr. STEVENS. I also share the concern expressed by my colleagues about the new air travel segment fee in this bill. I regret that the Senate was not able to sustain its position of a simple extension of the 10 percent ticket tax in the conference committee. 
We had a vigorous debate last year over financing the Federal Aviation Administration in the Senate Commerce Committee on another congressional committees. We decided to establish the National Civil Aviation Review Commission to examine FAA's true funding needs and various mechanisms for raising the revenues to meet those needs. 
The Senate and the administration proposed extending the ticket tax during this budget debate to allow the commission to do its work. 
The new fee undercuts the work of the commission by prejudging their decision. This is not the way public policy should be made, especially on a matter of such direct importance to the pocketbooks and the safety of the American public.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, first, let me thank the distinguished occupant of the chair. I was fearing that this issue might come up for a ruling while I had the privilege of sitting in that chair and was fearful what I might do, because I can tell the Senate that if one examines the signatures sheets for reporting this bill, you will find that I excepted from my approval of the bill as a conferee on the Commerce Committee side this provision on the universal service fund. 
Mr. President, I am not going to raise a proper point of order, and there is a proper point of order, but it would bring down the whole bill, and it is not timely. I would raise it if this went into effect next year. It will not go into effect until October 1 in the year 2000. So we have time to work this out and find a way to make peace on this subject. 
I intend to pursue that after the hearings that the Senator from Arizona has announced, as chairman of the Commerce Committee, he will hold. 
I don't think anyone really realizes what this does. I will say, and I know the Senator from New Mexico was trying to get it to me, the first time I saw this was today, although it had been described to me, and that is why I would not approve the Commerce Committee portion of the bill pertaining to the service fund. As a matter of fact, this is the old interstate rate pool, Mr. President. People in the business still refer to that in many ways. It became the universal service fund. I was the one who dreamed this up about 5 years ago when we first introduced the bill to modify the old Communications Act of 1934, and really that was carried through in the Telecommunications Act that passed. 
I am pleased to have been part of that, because what this does is it gives us a fund which the industry itself can use to equalize the costs of assuring service anywhere in the United States so that our telecommunications will, in fact, be capable of being delivered wherever there is a person seeking to send or receive communications as defined by our act. 
This money is kept by the National Exchange Carriers Association, [NECA]. It is not Federal money. It is not subject to Federal control. As a matter of fact, it is not even enforced by the Federal Government in terms of payment into the fund. It cannot be a tax. 
With due respect to my friend from New Mexico, I think we have a Supreme Court of the United States that will determine 
eventually what is on budget and what is not. The Director of the Congressional Budget Office, in my judgment, has made a serious mistake, and we are pursuing that mistake here. But there is more than just his mistake. The basic mistake has been made by the White House itself, when it conjured up this new approach to using this fund which is not Federal money, it is not taxpayer's money. It is paid by the ratepayers, not the Federal Government. You might have dipped into the Postal Service surplus in the bank right now under this theory. That is ratepayer money, too. 
It is not on budget, but, as a matter of fact, this money is not subject to Federal control. But this bill says there is appropriated $3 billion to put into this fund that NECA manages for the telecommunications world, and it sits there for a year, Mr. President. Of course, it is going to earn interest, right? At the end of the year, it is paid back by the fund, and the fund can keep the interest it earned during that period. 
Once more, the people who would have paid into the fund don't have to make a payment for a year. They keep that money that they would have paid the fund in their own banks and they pay it to NECA the following year, and guess what? They make money off it, too. So this is one of the greatest shell games I have ever seen with Federal money. The Federal money being fooled with is the $3 billion from the Treasury that goes into the fund before the game begins, and these guys get to play poker with this for a year, and then after a year, they can keep whatever they earned with it and pay back $3 billion to Treasury. It is a win-win thing for everybody but the people who should be served, because the earnings for the fund ought to accrue to the fund, the people who are the recipients of universal service, and this is just too cute. This, in my opinion, is the worst gimmick since the Budget Act was enacted, and I am glad the Senator from New Mexico has indicated he really didn't dream this one up, because I think he is smarter than that, and I think he is embarrassed to have to carry it, as I would be. 
The proper point of order, Mr. President, is a constitutional point of order. I will not raise it because it will pull the whole bill down, and we have to have this to bring about a balanced budget. It will take place in the year 2000, as I said. But I warn the Senate, before 2000 gets here, we will raise a constitutional point of order to take this out of here unless it is straightened out, because it is nothing but smoke and mirrors. It is the worse case of smoke and mirrors that ever came out of the White House. 
Somehow or another, someone has to understand that it is not right to play with money, that $3 billion of taxpayer's money goes into this fund, managed by a private association; it stays there for a year, the interest on it accrues to private associations, and at the end of the year, they pay back $3 billion. Meanwhile the people who should have been paying in for a year have earned their own money, and guess what? It is not a wash in the sense of everybody who keeps their own checkbook and everyone who pays bills and the people who need this service, this universal service; it is a wash under the Budget Act, which I thought was a stupid act to begin with, and now I know it is a stupid act, if it can conjure up something like this. It is not in the public interest. 
So, Mr. President, I am now satisfied that I was right. I signed this bill and approved it, except for this provision. I urge everyone to read it, section 3006. If there is anything that demonstrates we need a new Budget Act, this is it, if people can sit in the basement of the White House and dream up a charade like this and say that it balances the budget. This is why people don't believe us. They really don't believe us, because they think we play funny games with their money, and this demonstrates they are right, Mr. President, unfortunately. 
I will swear to you--I am glad you came, Mr. President, because I would be hard pressed not to approve the point of order that is raised by the Senator from North Dakota, and I would have hated to be in that chair and to have said what I don't believe. I am not saying you have to believe it either, Mr. President, just follow what the Parliamentarian tells you and we will pass this bill, and we will live to the year 2000. 
Meanwhile, someone has to put down a marker on these people. They have to stop using smoke and mirrors. That is why we don't have a balanced budget now, because people play games with money, and those of us who don't have much money don't understand it. 
It took me a little time to find out what they were trying to do, I say to the Senator from New Mexico. I see him smiling a little bit. He is my great friend, and I know he is embarrassed to have to carry someone else's brainchild like this. I hope we will find some way to stop this business, to give us a chance to deal with straight up-and-down money, and straight up-and-down provisions and not more smoke and mirrors.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will let me have a couple minutes, it would be nice to have this discussion. There are no smoke and mirrors in the appropriations bills. We sometimes have devices in order to enable us to meet the objectives of the Budget Act, but we never end up by appropriating money to an account that is not controlled by the Federal Government, nor do we give up interest on that $3 billion for a year and expect just to get the straight $3 billion back. If there is something like that going on in an appropriations bill, I don't know about it. 
He is right, we have our devices for making sure that we have control on spending money, and sometimes that is subject to criticism, similar to what I have just given him.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from New Mexico that we have studied this and there is no impact on any universal service provider or universal service beneficiary that is adverse. There may actually be a beneficial effect, in terms of some of the providers. But it is not a provision that harms universal service. It is a provision that tinkers with the funding of universal service, but not adversely to the system. I will agree with that.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I introduced S. 39, the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act, in January of this year at the request of the administration. 
The bill would implement the international conservation agreement called the Panama Declaration, which was signed on October 4, 1995, by the 12 nations that fish for tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean [the ETP]. 
These countries include: Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, France, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Spain, Vanuatu, and Venezuela. 
The President and Vice President strongly support the bill, as do Greenpeace, the Center for Marine Conservation, the Environmental Defense Fund, the National Wildlife Federation, the World Wildlife Fund, the American Sportfishing Association, U.S. labor unions, and the U.S. tuna industry. 
The House of Representatives has passed measures similar to S. 39 twice--in both the 104th and 105th Congresses, by large bipartisan majorities. 
Under the Panama Declaration and S. 39, a binding international agreement to reduce dolphin mortality and conserve fishery resources in the ETP will be created. 
This binding agreement will cap dolphin mortality in the ETP at no more than 5,000 dolphins annually, with the goal of reducing the mortality of dolphins to zero. 
It will also create binding observer, bycatch, and other conservation and management measures in the ETP similar to those we just enacted in our domestic fisheries in the Magnuson-Stevens Act. 
These important conservation measures are contingent on specific changes to U.S. law. 
The key changes include: A change to allow tuna caught in compliance with the Panama Declaration--including through the encirclement of dolphins--to be imported into the United States; and a change so that dolphin safe will mean tuna in the ETP caught in a set in which dolphin mortality occurred. 
Under the agreement we have reached with Senators Boxer, Biden, and Breaux, the second of these changes will be delayed. 
Tuna caught by encircling dolphins in the ETP will only be able to be labeled as dolphin safe beginning in March 1999. 
Before this happens, the Secretary of Commerce must determine--as we believe he will based on the scientific data we have already seen--that encirclement is not having a significant adverse impact on depleted dolphin stocks. 
I have strong doubts about whether this delay is necessary, but the Latin American countries who signed the Panama Declaration with the United States have agreed to the delay. 
It is appropriate that in 1997--the 25th anniversary of the passage of the Marine Mammal Protection Act--we are making improvements with respect to the protection of dolphins, a primary focus in our enactment of the original MMPA. 
Since passage of the MMPA in 1972, dolphin mortality in the ETP has been reduced from over 400,000 per year, to below 5,000. 
This decrease in dolphin mortality is primarily due to the development of a practice called the back-down technique, in which dolphin are safely allowed to escape from the net. 
Our bill today acknowledges the vast improvements that have been made in this encirclement fishing method.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, an agreement has been reached to address concerns with S. 39, the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act. The agreement is contained in the manager's amendment to S. 39 offered by Senator Snowe. Under the agreement, the Secretary of Commerce is required to conduct a multi-year study on dolphin and dolphin stocks taken incidentally in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP) purse seine fishery. The Secretary will use the information from this study to make two separate findings that will determine whether or not tuna caught in the ETP by intentionally encircling dolphins can be labeled as dolphin safe in the United States. Senator Snowe's amendment authorizes appropriations of $4 million in fiscal year 1998, $3 million in fiscal year 1999, $4 million in fiscal year 2000, and $1 million in fiscal year 2001 to complete the study. These amounts are based on National Marine Fisheries Service estimates for the costs for the study. I have received a letter from the White House indicating that the administration will request funds for the study in fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001. If the administration follows through on its commitment to request these funds, I will do everything I can to ensure they are appropriated.

I will call attention to the fact that the bill in the other body has the same amount of money that is in the amendment as proposed here. This matter will be at conference. And it will be a long and sustained conference whether this amendment is adopted or not. 
I believe that we should keep on course. I am not an opponent of this matter. As a matter of fact, I have always voted for it. But I do not think it gains anything to have a prolonged discussion here at this time.

But I do want to tell the Senate that we are spending time on an amendment that deals with a subject the House has always insisted on in conference. I don't know why we spend time debating here on the floor whether or not we are going to give this subject approval by the Senate, because it is one item that the House will not let us come out of conference on unless we approve it.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I shall not use that much time. I do appreciate the courtesy of the manager of the bill. 
Mr. President, we have studied this matter to death. The issue, in 1973, was recommended by Senator Hruska and the Hruska Commission was created. It recommended then, in 1973, that the ninth circuit court be split. Every Congress we hear the same thing from the large delegation in the House and the two Senators in the Senate from California: we need more study. I think that is what we are hearing again now--have another study. 
It has only been 24 years now that we have been studying since the first commission reported. But, of course, we do need the advice of another commission. 
Mr. President, I am a California lawyer. I was raised in California, and I am pleased to have that background. But I tell you, in all sincerity, I cannot believe that we can continue this situation. This chart--I am not sure it can be seen, Mr. President. This chart shows the population and caseload of the circuits. Clearly, the population is almost 50 million people in the ninth circuit, and it requires some change when, clearly, the average of all of the others is somewhere around 20 million people. 
I want to address the concern spoken to, I think, by my good friend from Hawaii, Senator Inouye. It has been 13 years now since a Hawaii resident was appointed to the ninth circuit. Fourteen judges have been seated on the circuit since that time, but Hawaii was never recognized. Senator Inouye has included an amendment in this provision that guarantees that at least one judge will be appointed to the circuit court of appeals from the new circuit, when it is created, from each State. Now, I think the Senate should listen to that kind of frustration and should listen to the frustration of those who see how long it takes for a case to be decided by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
Mr. President, I said the other day that the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals judges come to our State. They come during the summer, and they have a delightful time visiting our State. In the wintertime, all our people fly south and some of our lawyers like that. But the litigants don't like it because the average time that an appeal is pending before the ninth circuit is so long, it puts a great burden upon our States, the smaller States in this circuit. 
Now, in 1995, the Senate Judiciary Committee report showed that New York accounted for approximately 87 percent of the second circuit docket; Texas cases were approximately 70 percent of the fifth circuit docket. We have considered splitting the ninth circuit before several times since I have been in the Senate. Mr. President, the overload of the ninth circuit is now such a serious problem, and it is only going to get worse if we continue to talk about another commission to discuss whether this split should take place. 
The appellate process, for almost one-fifth of the citizens of the United States, will continue to be inadequate. I believe we are doing California a favor by splitting this court. They are the only State that has one circuit all to itself, all to itself--well, Nevada could make the decision to join if they wish. But the establishment of tribunals is a responsibility of the Congress, not of a commission. It is one of our most important responsibilities under the Constitution. I believe the Senate will shirk its responsibility if we do not act to correct this problem of the ninth circuit, and I urge the Senate to do what this amendment would do: create a new twelfth circuit and allocate to it the States that are suffering greatly by the current crowded situation and long delays in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
I thank the Chair and yield back the balance of my time.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, very soon, Senator Murkowski will submit for himself, for me, and for Senator Gorton and Senator Helms, a resolution condemning the Government of Canada for its failure to protect the right of innocent passage of the Alaska ferry Malaspina in the Canadian territorial sea. The Malaspina entered the Port of Prince Rupert on Sunday morning and was blockaded by, we are told, about 200 Canadian fishing vessels and was prevented from leaving that port. 
On Sunday, at the request of the State of Alaska, a Canadian court issued an injunction against the blockaders. The governments of Canada and British Columbia ignored the court's directions to enforce that injunction. The Malaspina was finally able to leave Prince Rupert on Monday evening, only when the Canadian fishermen agreed to end the blockade. 
In my judgment, through its inaction, the Government of Canada has exhibited a disregard for its own domestic laws, for international law, and for what I would call the concept of being a good neighbor to our country, the United States. 
Mr. President, over the past 3 years the Government of Canada has shown a pattern of complacency--and, in some cases, complicity--in the harassment and illegal treatment of United States vessels and our citizens. 
In 1994, Canada charged an illegal transit passage fee to United States fishing vessels proceeding from the Seattle area north to Alaskan waters. Following that, at my request, Congress directed the State Department to reimburse these United States fishermen and to seek repayment from Canada for the illegal fees that were imposed upon our citizens. To date, Canada has not repaid and, as a matter of fact, has ignored the request for reimbursement to the United States for these costs. 
The Government of British Columbia continues to seek to prevent use by the United States of an underwater missile testing range that is critical to NATO activities, at a place called that Nanoose Bay. I found that to be unacceptable, Mr. President. To have one NATO partner use land that has been made available under NATO for leverage on a fisheries issue is unprecedented. 
The United States vessels have also periodically been harassed by the Governments of Canada and British Columbia under the guise of enforcement of Canada's customs laws. My colleague and I are here today to call on the Government of Canada to put a stop to these actions. We ask that the President of the United States now take action to ensure that harassment of our citizens comes to an end. 
The measure my colleague will submit condemns the Government of Canada for its failure to protect United States citizens from these types of illegal actions and harassment while our people exercise their absolute right for innocent passage through these Canadian territorial waters. They are international waters under international law and available to our people just as our inside passage in southeast Alaska is available to and used by the Canadian people. 
Our resolution calls on the President to ensure that this pattern of harassment will not continue. We ask that the President use assets of the United States to protect our citizens if necessary, and, also his authority to prohibit the importation of Canadian products into this country until Canada agrees to protect our citizens. 
We also believe the President should find a way to provide financial support to those who were damaged by the blockade of the Malaspina. 
Mr. President, there were, I am told, over 300 people on board that vessel, and many had to be removed and transported by air to Alaska. In addition to that, it is my information that the Malaspina carries the United States mail. It is absolutely unheard of for the Government of Canada to interfere with the delivery of United States mail. 
I hope that Congress will consider favorably the resolution that my colleague will introduce, and we intend to consider other measures as well. 
We have already passed a bill and sent it to conference with the House that will deny funds for the environmental cleanup of defense sites that were used by Canada and the United States during the cold war period because of the action of British Columbia authorities to try to discontinue our use of Nanoose Bay. That, Mr. President, is essential to our testing program for torpedoes. It has been a joint venture between our Canadian neighbors and our Nation in defense efforts for many years. I am really saddened by that in terms of our relationship for our mutual defense. But we believe that we should assure that Canada will protect our citizens as they exercise their right of innocent passage through Canadian waters, and we believe very sincerely that Canada or its citizens should repay those people that have been damaged by the illegal blockade of the Malaspina. 
We also call on Canada to repay the United States the illegal transit fees that were charged to our fishing vessels in 1994. And, further, we plead with Canada and its citizens to match the good-faith efforts of the United States to continue to negotiate 
and renew the Pacific salmon treaty. 
Mr. President, it is a time for leadership in these matters. We risk getting more and more rhetoric involved. I have tried to be restrained today. I think Alaskans share this point of view, but we are pushed to increase the stakes. 
Our people are most upset. They are even more upset by the act of burning our U.S. flag. I think for a neighbor that shares such a long border to allow citizens to burn a flag of this country is really uncalled for. I don't know really how to express our deep concern about that. To my knowledge, there has been no action at all taken with regard to that. We have a flag-burning issue here in our own country. But to see it done as an act of defiance by people illegally blocking the ferry owned by our State is upsetting. That vessel is owned by the State of Alaska, and it is part of the trek for people who come from all over the world. Many take a ferry up to Canada. Then they take a Canadian ferry from Vancouver Island to Prince Rupert. They take the Alaska ferry on up into Alaska. It is a right of all vessels to have innocent passage through the waters of a neighboring country. 
This blockade of our vessel on top of the harassment and seizure of our fishing vessels is too much, Mr. President. 
I don't know. We are few in number in Alaska. If this happened to California, there would be 54 Members of the House talking about it. We have one. And, unfortunately, right now he is recovering from a very serious operation. 
But, Mr. President, the rights of American citizens should be protected by our Federal Government. We have heard nothing really yet from our National Government in response to these measures. I think that it is high time that this Government stands up to Canada and explains once again what the role of good neighbors really must be. 
I do not want to get to the point where we really have to start retaliating and raise the level of this rhetoric even further. But, clearly, those people who say, `Well, now, just let it cool off,' don't understand. We cooled off after 1994 when they put our people in jail and charged them fees. Congress agreed, and we paid the fishermen back for the fees they paid to the Government of Canada. Now we see our vessel with 300 Americans on board held up for more than 2 days, denied the right to keep their schedule and go on to Alaska according to the ferry schedules. 
Mr. President, I hope the Senate and the Congress will view this matter with as deep concern as we do and will assist Alaska in assuring that we have the same rights of all Americans as we try to pursue our right of innocent passage through the territorial sea of our neighboring country. 
I urge the support of the measure prepared by Senator Murkowski. This happens to be the part of our State that Senator Murkowski came from. He knows Ketchikan very well, and he is proud about his heritage and about the area he comes from. He has transited these waters down to Seattle many times. 
I sincerely believe there must be some recognition by the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of this trespass on the rights of Alaskans and other Americans that were on board the Malaspina. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to appeal to the Senate on this bill. It is my hope that we can finish this bill tonight and move on to State, Justice, Commerce bill tomorrow and finish it before we recess for this week. We still will have two more to do or three more to do next week, in terms of appropriations bills. Our goal has been to try and finish all that we can before the recess. 
Mr. President, this amendment that is pending, the Harkin amendment, as I understand it, would require that this bill be referred to Ways and Means when it goes to the House. I do not believe that we should be handling this amendment on this bill. The Senator knows that has been my feeling. I am grateful to the Senator for bringing it to the floor rather than having a prolonged discussion of it in the Appropriations Committee. But it is my hope that the Senate will understand this motion I am about to make and support it, so that we can keep the momentum we have for our appropriations bills and finish this bill tonight. I do not think the bill will be able to be finished tonight unless we do get this motion of mine agreed to.

Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I have made this motion to table. We have an extraordinary procedure, having the right to debate before it is voted upon, but, in fairness, I thought that should be the case. 
Let me state to the Chair and the Senate, we have checked with the Ways and Means Committee. The tax counsel for that committee has informed my staff that this provision will require a review by the Ways and Means Committee. What it is, it is a revenue-raising measure. This is an appropriations bill, a bill to spend money. It is not a bill for legislation. Until just a couple of years ago, we had a point of order about legislation on appropriations bills. That is no longer a valid technique for us to control the bill. The only way we can control a bill and keep amendments like this off is to have a motion to table. 
I urge the Senate to come back to our senses concerning legislation on appropriations bills, particularly legislation that raises money. The House is the place where revenue-raising measures start, under the Constitution. They have every right to take this bill to their committee. I do not disagree with the purpose that the Senator from Iowa seeks to fulfill with this money. But if he wants to do it, he should go to the legislative committees and have the tax committees raise the money, and then we will help him spend it. Our job is to spend money, not to raise money. 
This is a wrong provision on this bill. It is going to delay. We are not through tonight. I don't think we are through with this amendment unless we table it. 
Beyond that, if it passes, it is going to go over and this bill will go to the Ways and Means Committee, and the Ways and Means Committee will send it back to the Senate. That is no way to handle appropriations bills. 
I have tried my best as Appropriations Committee chairman to move these bills, to move them through, to be absolutely fair in consideration of provisions that could be in an appropriations bill. The Senator has part of his amendment which provides money to spend to FDA. We don't have that money. So what he does, he also puts in a provision to raise revenue. We do not have that right in an appropriations bill. The Senate doesn't have that right. Revenue-raising measures must start in the House of Representatives. 
I urge the Senate to read the Constitution, read it again, and table this amendment. Because that is the only way to handle amendments like this, is to table them, now, under our procedure. I believe we should not vote on this in a substantive way. We should table it and leave it to the tax-raising committees to raise the revenue. We should handle spending. 
Has my time expired?

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the provision in this bill requires compliance with existing law. Our information is that the cost of modernization of these facilities to the Federal Government is approximately $4 billion. Unless existing law is complied with, it will cost us $1 billion more than it would if we had true competition. The figures show it would cost $3 billion if they complied with the law; it would cost $4 billion if they continue to flout and ignore the law. 
The Bingaman amendment would take out of the bill the requirement no funds can be spent except in compliance with existing law. I do not understand a refusal to accept the fact that that is the law. If the committee of jurisdiction doesn't like the law, they should come to the floor with suggestions to amend it. But we should, supporting expenditures of Federal funds, require compliance with the law that mandates competition in this area. 
I move to table the amendment. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. STEVENS. For the information of all Senators, a number of votes were scheduled to occur beginning at 5:15 today. Over the weekend, and most of today, the managers of the Treasury appropriations bill have been working to resolve those outstanding amendments, and it now appears that the Campbell amendment offered on behalf of Senator DeWine regarding abortion funds and passage are the only remaining votes that need to occur with respect to the Treasury Appropriations bill. There may also be a Bingaman amendment, but we are not clear about that yet. 
As many Members are aware, the U.S.S. Constitution made its maiden voyage as a refurbished symbol of America's proud past today on the waters off Massachusetts. However, the ceremonies surrounding this event were delayed. Consequently, several of our Members will not be returning in time for the vote. 
Therefore, on behalf of the majority leader, I ask unanimous consent that the rollcall votes scheduled to occur today now be postponed to begin at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, July 22. Obviously, needless to say, there will be no rollcall votes that will occur in today's session, but there will be some further matters.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I know there is a Senator waiting here, but I would just like to ask my friend about the national parks, if he would respond. I can remember so well, I helped, worked with, President Eisenhower for what we called Mission 66, a 10-year period to improve the parks. I think, if the Senator would look at that period, at the end of 1966 the parks were in the best condition they have been since the turn of the century. Since that time, the vision of the Park Service has been to add acreage to the parks. Today we see the parks in the worst condition they have been in in my lifetime. Maintenance of the parks, the accumulated maintenance that has been deferred, is just overwhelming. I think it would take the total annual appropriation of the Park Service to catch up just on deferred maintenance at the historic park sites, Yosemite, Yellowstone, and all of those that are in the south 48. 
But my question to the Senator is, we have now almost 80 percent of the land that is in the Park Service in my State and we have about 1 percent of the Park Service money. I don't think anyone has looked at what has happened to the parks, in terms of this rush to add acreage to the parks instead of maintaining discrete park areas that are absolutely beautiful and need to be preserved. 
One of my predecessors, Senator Gruening, introduced a bill to establish parks in the State of Alaska. I did, too. Those parks that we sought were ignored and, instead, we have vast areas of parks that are out there. All they have in them is Park Service employees, accommodation for Park Service employees, no roads into them, no airports in them, but they are listed as national parks. 
I ask you, if there is to be a rational park system in the country, don't you think we ought to have accessibility to areas that are set aside as national parks? Don't you think we ought to be concentrating now on maintaining the parks that are there so visitors can use them? 
The answer now to people who are in charge of the parks is to close the parks, to limit the number of people that go into the parks because the maintenance is so bad that they think the people coming in the parks will now destroy them. I agree, maintenance is very bad. But parks are for people, I thought. 
I would like to have the Senator speak up. I do hope one of these days we can have a long discussion about the National Park System and how it has changed. It has changed to people who want to control land from people who want to preserve the very best and most beautiful portions of our country, and that disturbs me greatly.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I understand the temper of the times, but I think some of us who have been through this time and again have the duty to come forth and warn the Senate what it is doing. 
Since 1970 to this year, 27 years, in 17 of those years the Senate has denied itself the cost-of-living adjustment. The net result is that while Social Security recipients' pay, whatever you want to call it, their checks have gone up by 421.3 percent in that period, the pay for Members of Congress have gone up 214.4 percent.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the last time congressional salaries were given a cost-of-living adjustment--and this is not a pay raise--was in 1993. The pay raise for Federal employees that year was 3.7 percent, the COLA's for Congress were 3.2 percent. In 1992, the cost-of-living adjustment for Federal employees was 4.2 percent, and for Members of Congress it was 3.5 percent. 
We are now in a situation where, in my judgment, if we don't take this cost-of-living adjustment for this year, I am sure we will not take it next year being an election year. That means we will not take it until 1999. Since that is the year before a Presidential election year, we will not take it then either. We will not take it in the year 2000, which is a Presidential election year. I suggest we are going into the next century with this maladjustment, as far as congressional salaries. 
It does not make any difference to me. It does not make any difference to any of us. We are here. We made our commitment. What about those out there who should come and serve their country by being part of the legislative branch of this Federal Government? We have raised the salaries of the people who are Federal civilians downtown. We have raised the salaries of the Federal employees. We have raised the payments made to Federal retirees. We have raised Social Security recipients. We have not raised for Members of Congress, and I predict we will not do it unless we face up to the problem now. 
The problem is not ours. The problem is what is going to be the judgment of the people who want to serve in the Congress when they start looking at the income levels here in Congress compared to their own income levels. 
Now, Mr. President, in 1970--and I was here then--my wife and I had just bought a home here in Washington the year before for $65,000. At the time, our pay was $42,500. That house has now sold--we sold it some time ago--but I know that it sold for $450,000. Our pay here is roughly--not quite, but roughly--three times the salary we had then. 
What I am trying to make people in the Senate think about is, what will be the decision made by young people who are thinking about coming here when they look at the cost of living in Washington, DC, which is the highest now in our Nation--the cost of property here, the cost of renting a home or a condominium. I am talking about family people. When we came down here, we came down here with five children and had to have a home that five children could live in. There is no way a person can come here now at the salary level we have now and buy a home for that, where five children can live with their mother and father, unless they are extremely wealthy. 
What the Senate is doing, in my judgment, is setting the course to assure that the people serving in this body will either be multimillionaires or they will be the people who are not capable of earning over $100,000 anyway. Now, maybe I am being too tough about this, but I think it is time to get tough about this issue and have people understand that the cost-of-living adjustment is less than the Consumer Price Index increase--less. In other words, it means for people living here now, we are adjusting their salaries now with a cost-of-living adjustment, for the cost increase, really, for the period starting 18 months ago until 6 months ago, and we are trying to adjust it now for what the costs were back then. It is not a salary increase. This is for the cost of living in this area. 
Now, people talk to me, well, you can live in Minnesota or maybe you can live in Kansas, maybe you can live somewhere else for a lot less money. It happens to be, in my case, my cost of living in Alaska is just slightly higher than this. But as a practical matter, the judgments made by future generations will be: We, as a family member, cannot take that job. 
Now, we get a lot of demagogic type of letters--they come in from my constituents, too--`You are not worth that money; why don't you come home?' The real question is, what would they do if the people were here that they believe should be here? The people would either work for nothing, because they are so rich they can, or the people that could not make the money that they would make here would come for the pay. Now, Mr. President, we have to make up our mind what kind of a body we want in the Congress. From my point of view, we want people with capabilities who can perform jobs that are needed to be performed. 
Take my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, the only accountant in this body--the only accountant in the Senate. What are we dealing with now? Massive, complex tax issues, complex problems of accounting. The people that are going to come here are going to be motivated by trying to do a job. The ones who cannot come here, despite that motivation, will be the ones who cannot afford to live a family life in this town at that salary. 
Keep in mind something else. We don't come here permanently. As a matter of fact, most people who would vote for this do not want us to come for more than two terms anyway. But as a practical matter, we all maintain a home in our home 
States. We have expenses there and we have expenses here. There is no one in the employment scene today that has that situation other than Members of Congress. 
Now, I voted--it was a voice vote--but I voted against it and I would vote against it on a recorded vote because we were taking an action to deny Members of Congress, for the fifth time, a cost of living, which is a structural change. What it will mean is, downstream someone will have to have the courage to make the adjustment. Incidentally, we have had three times when that happened. In 1977, the Congress made a 28.9-percent change. That was a salary increase, but it was to make up for the fact that in 6 of the previous 7 years Congress had not taken the cost-of-living adjustment. Again, in 1982, we took a 15-percent change. It was because in 3 of the previous 4 years Congress had not taken a cost-of-living adjustment. In 1987, we again took a change. It was because, again, we had in 2 of the previous 4 years not taken the cost-of-living adjustment. Again, in 1991, we had a 27.1-percent increase. 
What I am saying is, you kid yourself as much as you want, the time will come when Congress will have to recognize that this structural change in the salary, vis-a-vis the salaries of comparable jobs in the economy, that the salary increase must come. So instead of recognizing this as a cost-of-living adjustment and treating it as such and providing that we take a minimum amount--and by the way, in most instances we have taken less than was available. For instance, in 1979, the Federal employees got a 7-percent increase, Federal retirees got 11.1, Congress gave itself 5.5. We kept the cost of living down each time. But when we did it, we did not have the total structural impact of denying it altogether.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is not an easy task to appear in opposition to this amendment. It is not easy for me personally, because I am a survivor of prostate cancer. I come from a family where my oldest brother, my father and my grandfather and my mother all died prematurely of cancer, and I thankfully just received word today that my younger brother has now survived prostate cancer. 
The question before the Senate is not cancer. The question before the Senate is how to raise money for cancer research. I have strongly urged that this amendment not come before the Senate, because we reformed the postal system and made it an independent entity. It has evolved from the old Post Office Department, where a member of the Postal Service, the Postmaster General, was a member of the President's Cabinet, to one that is run, basically, by a board of governors with a Postmaster General that is appointed by that board of governors, and we have not issued a stamp in Congress since 1978. 
There is no power in the Congress to do what this amendment asks. The power under existing law was given to the Board of Governors, the Postal Service, and the Postal Rate Commission. As a matter of fact, the Postal Service does not have the authority to issue a stamp and charge more than that established by law by the Postal Rate Commission. 
I refer the Senate to section 3622 of title 39 which specifically says that the cost for the stamps must be established through the postal rate procedure. 
This comes at a time when all I can say is this is plainly wrong, and I have urged the sponsors to remember what they are doing. If we have this stamp--and it looked nice. I saw it beside the Senator from California on C-SPAN. But we have AIDS problems, we have prostate cancer problems, we have problems raising money for the Boy Scouts and the Girl Scouts and the community programs to raise money for all sorts of problems. 
They have real trouble raising money, but, Mr. President, I started the concept of putting up defense money for cancer research for breast cancer at $25 million from the defense funds, and I have just urged the Senate to pass a bill from the subcommittee I chair, Defense Appropriations. It has in it $175 million for breast cancer research, specifically earmarked for breast cancer research. 
This stamp, if it is issued, if it sold as many as the famous stamp--I think it was the Elvis stamp was the one that sold more than any stamp in history, a penny from each one of the Elvis stamps would bring in $1 million. So what we are seeing is a public relations campaign by people who want credit for being for cancer research, but it is really not an effective fundraising mechanism. 
I urge them to use a process like we did for selling savings bonds, to have the Postal Service sell cancer stamps that would go into booklets. You can have one for breast cancer, one for prostate cancer, one for just the general National Institute of Cancer. But you buy the book, put them in a booklet, and when you get $25 worth, you get a $25 bond. If you do that, you would make $1 out of every $20 that came in. If this stamp becomes approved, they get 1 out of every 35 cents. In other words, $1 out of every $35, but the cost of raising this is horrendous for the Postal Service. A person who wants to buy one of these stamps will go to a window and say, `We want 100 breast cancer stamps.' 
`We don't have that. We have one that shows Jimmy Doolittle or one that shows World War II stamps, but we are out of those.' This is not an effective way to sell stamps is what I am saying. 
It is true that there are stamp collectors, and on a one-time basis, as the Elvis stamp showed, a lot of people buy them just for collection, but I have to tell you, that is a one-time thing, but it is not a one-time thing for the Postal Service. It is plainly wrong, because its job is to deliver the mail. It is paid for by the ratepayers. The taxpayers do not support the Postal Service any longer. 
The Board of Governors is on record against this. The Postal Service is against it. We have seen that this has been done.

Mr. STEVENS. I will take 2 more minutes, if I may, and then I will quiet down. 
Canada issued a semipostal, that is what they call this, a semipostal stamp, to support literacy. It was a surcharge of 5 cent per stamp, and it raised $252,000 net. This is not an effective way to raise money for breast cancer. We have shown these people how to raise more money for breast cancer, how to improve breast cancer research. I want to work with them, but I tell the Senate that this is not the way to do it.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, before he leaves, I do want to thank the majority leader and the minority leader for their cooperation with our committee. 
This has been a historic week for the Appropriations Committee. With the cooperation of my good friend from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, and the chairman of the subcommittees and the ranking members, we will now complete debate on five separate bills in 4 days. They have all passed by sheer weight of bipartisanship and cooperation and willingness to work together to work out problems. 
I am hopeful that we will see the same thing next week when we again want to bring before the Senate at least five bills. We will have them ready to go before the Senate next week, and we will try to work them in according with the schedule. 
But it is imperative, if we are going to avoid the problem of an enormous continuing resolution that we passed in the last Congress, that we get these bills to conference before we go off on the August recess so that the work can be done. Not all of the staff will have to stay here for the whole month. But we will have them at least ready to go to conference when we come back. They will be preconferenced during the period of August, and I think we will avoid any continuing resolution. 
So I am, again, grateful to everyone here. But I hope the Senate itself is making history, and it is doing so in really 
the best spirit I have seen in the Senate for many years.

Mr. STEVENS. The amendment of the Senator from New Mexico would eliminate from the bill a provision that I requested be inserted because of a conference I had with a former staff member of the Commerce Committee, as a matter of fact. He pointed out to me that the basic law, the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, requires the competitive process. 
According to the Office of Technology Assessment, Federal agencies spent about $4 billion annually on power, light, water and other utility bills, and that that could be cut by 25 percent, about $1 billion a year, if we required agencies to improve energy efficiency. That led to this new law. 
Our provision does not call for new funding. It does not change existing law. It restricts the use of appropriated funds unless procurements are made through the competitive process. The language in the bill that I requested effects no change in that law, the existing law. The existing law does require a full competitive procurement to be used by Federal agencies to obtain energy-efficient goods and services. It is within the jurisdiction of our Appropriations Committee. It is primarily because it limits the expenditure of funds. Our language really does no more than direct Federal agencies to abide by the law, to follow the law which requires specific procurement procedures. It will not disrupt any existing contracts. It will not prohibit any utility or nonutility provider of energy-efficient services from competing for Federal contracts. It simply directs the Federal agencies to use the competitive process for procuring services for all energy efficiency providers as current law directs. 
Mr. President, my problem with striking it is it will mean that we will continue to not receive the savings that we are supposed to receive as a result of the basic law of the land which is the Energy Conservation Policy Act. I do believe that this is a law which ought to be pursued. I call the Senate's attention to that act, which is basically the 1978 act. It has been improved on several times since that time. 
I might say, the person who talked to me was part of the staff at the time that basic law was devised, and pointed out to me how it has not been enforced. What we are talking about is basically the provision that is required under Section 551(4) of Title I of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act which basically says this: 
The term `energy conservation measures' means measures that are applied to a Federal building that improve energy efficiency or are life cycle cost effective and that involve energy conservation, cogeneration facilities, renewable energy sources, improvements in operation and maintenance efficiencies, or retrofit activities. 
That is the law, Mr. President. Senator Bingaman's amendment would strike from this bill my amendment which requires and--prevents the use of funds under this bill for those activities unless they follow the law regarding competitive procurement practices. I know Senator Bingaman will have a minute when he comes on Monday. I wanted to take this time now to explain it.

That is entirely within the jurisdiction of our committee, and I hope the Senate will not pursue the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico. I have not decided whether to make a motion to table that amendment. As I understand the procedure, the motions to table were not waived and therefore I reserve my right to make a motion to table this amendment should the Senator from New Mexico seek to pursue it further on Monday.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, let me begin today by thanking the managers of this bill, Senator Mitch McConnell and Senator Leahy, for their leadership in bringing this bill to the floor so quickly. They have had a very tough job managing the foreign assistance programs that are undertaken by our country. In this bill what they have produced merits the support of every Member of the Senate. 
Mr. President, at the committee meeting, several Members, including myself and Senator Byrd, were not comfortable with the deletion of the earmark for assistance to Egypt. We certainly do understand Senator McConnell's position. We were together in Cairo at the meetings that he mentioned. But after consulting with the subcommittee chairman, Mr. McConnell, we decided the best way to proceed was to come to the floor and have a discussion. 
I want to now call up the amendment No. 885 that is before the Senate, at the desk, as I understand it. I ask unanimous consent it be in order to consider that at this time.

Mr. STEVENS. I want to thank those who have cosponsored this amendment, in particular Senator McConnell. It is a managers' amendment and will restore the balance in the allocation of funds for our partners in the Middle East process. 
Egypt has had problems. We all know that. And yet it stands out as one of our Nation's most important global allies. It really is the bedrock of our engagement with the Arab world. Simply put, Mr. President, there would have been no Middle East peace process without commitment of Egypt and the personal leadership that was displayed by President Sadat, and then by President Mubarak. 
I say this not just as an advocate of the peace process but as a Senator who has traveled many times to the Middle East. I have witnessed Egypt's evolving role. During the gulf war, Senator Inouye and I made two trips to that region, one at the request of the President of the United States, to assess what was happening with regard to our military plans, and to meet with our key allies. We found, then, in President Mubarak, a friend and a leader who aligned his great nation with the alliance, and when he did, he brought the rest of the Arab world along. In the years since the gulf war, Egypt has remained at the center of our Nation's efforts to maintain calm in the gulf area and to advance the peace process. 
As Senator McConnell said, earlier this year, we had a delegation that went to Israel, Jordan, Gaza, Egypt, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Mr. President, at each stop I became more aware of and convinced of trying to do everything we can to assure the continuation of our 20-year partnership with Egypt in the peace process. 
Now, the things that Senator McConnell mentioned did happen. But late this spring President Mubarak came to Washington and met with our President and congressional leaders. In those talks he again showed his personal enthusiasm and dedication to the peace process. It was very evident, as was his determination to keep Egypt engaged in that process. 
Based upon the continuum of the track record of Egypt's support for the peace process, and my personal experience working with Egypt on so many vital national security interests, and we do have others, Mr. President, beyond the peace process itself, I believe it is imperative that we show the equity in the identification of funds for foreign assistance once again this year. Maintaining a strong and economically developing Egypt is an essential piece of this Nation's total Middle East strategy. 
I believe President Clinton summarized the current state of relations of Egypt very well during President Mubarak's visit early this year. President Clinton said:  
Since the Camp David Accords in 1979, Egypt has been a powerful force for peace in the Middle East. That has continued to be true through the last 3 1/2 years--a time of extraordinary progress towards peace and repeated challenges. Now, as Israel and the Palestinians embark on the difficult task of permanent status negotiations, as we look to revive negotiations between Israel and Syria, and then bring Lebanon into the process to complete the circle of peace, we know that Egypt's leadership will be vital to finish the job. 
That is President Clinton's statement earlier this year about Egypt. 
After 20 years of commitment and investment in this effort, this is just not the time to put at risk all that we have achieved. I welcome the support of the other cosponsors of this amendment and I am sure there are other Members who share our concern that our ties to Egypt remain strong and we continue to foster and support this alliance. 
This is not to say that Egypt should not listen to the words that Senator McConnell has delivered here this morning and to the statements he made in the committee. I believe we are all grateful to Senator McConnell for his willingness to work with us in this matter. If there is to be any change in our status with regard to Egypt in this process, I believe it must be done on a bipartisan basis with the President involved. At this time I am hopeful that will never have to happen but, as a matter of fact, the modification of this bill before the Senate, I think, that shows our willingness to go back to the process that has been followed in the past, I hope, will make a significant contribution to the Middle East peace process and will help us advance the interests of the United States there and in other regions with Egypt's support and collaboration. 
I do, however, believe there are reasons for us to make sure everyone understands, as Senator McConnell said, that the provisions of support from this bill are not an entitlement. These are funds that are dealt with on an annual basis by our Government, the Senate and the House, the full Congress, as part of that process. It is my judgment that it has been a bipartisan process that has included both the executive and congressional leaders and leadership in the past and I think it should continue that way again this year. 
I do hope that our friends in Egypt--and I don't have to hope, Mr. President, I know they have heard Senator McConnell's statement, and I know they are aware that there have been questions raised, but based upon this continuum that has taken place, the friendship and cooperation and the important contributions that Egypt has made to the attainment of our goals in the Middle East, I have offered this amendment with my friends. It is a managers' amendment. I do ask that the Senate consider this amendment now.

Mr. President, I support the Smith amendment, and I remind the Senate that at the time of the great upheaval in the Soviet Union, when the tanks rolled into Red Square, there was a group of people that was prodemocracy from throughout the world which carried Bibles into that square and literally handed them out to the drivers of the tanks which were coming into Red Square, supposedly to dislodge the new government. 
While I was chairman of the Presidential prayer group one year, I asked our former great symphony director, Rostropovich, to come and tell about his experience there. He told us of these people coming into the square and handing out those Bibles. 
What is happening now in Russia is a direct reversal of the open-door policy for those people who believe that freedom of religion is an international freedom. I do believe that the Senate should go on record in support of the Smith amendment today. That is why I urge its adoption at this time.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I, too, want to commend the subcommittee chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee. I also want to call to the attention of the Senate the fact that 
this hearkens me back to the days when we had real bipartisan cooperation on the Appropriations Committee. 
I want to thank all members of the committee for that cooperation, for showing what can be done when we work together and try to resolve issues and accommodate the needs of the various Senators and our individual States. These two Senators have done an excellent and admirable job today on a very difficult bill. I am confident that we will see that in final passage tomorrow. 
Tomorrow, we will proceed to the foreign assistance bill. I hope we see a similar approach on that bill so that we can go forward and have the legislative bill before the Senate on Thursday. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

<DOCNO>105-stevens-ak-2-19970714</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I apologize to the reading clerk for not having it drafted properly to start with. But I do ask that these changes be made so that the amendment is as read by the reading clerk. 
It is an amendment that is a direction to the Department of Defense to provide the Congress with two specific reports. 
First, the amounts necessary, by appropriations account, for all anticipated costs to the United States for the admission of three new members to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and that report to cover the current budget cycle of fiscal year 1998 through 2002. 
Second, a report on any new commitments or obligations entered into or assumed by our Nation in association with the admission of these new members of the alliance, including--it is not limited to--but including deployment of U.S. personnel, the provisions of defense articles or equipment, training activities, and modification and construction of military facilities. 
I am one who has still strong reservations about the determination to add new members to NATO. I am not opposed to NATO. I have been a firm supporter of NATO. On the other hand, we are doing some studies now on the history of the expansion of NATO and how United States participation in deployment of forces there has just constantly increased. 
We, I think, need to know now what the obligation is that we have undertaken and really what will be the costs of this obligation in connection with the expansion of NATO. This really is, I think, a fairly restrictive list of things that we should have. But, clearly, we should have this information before we proceed with any consideration of ratification of any agreements that have been entered into by the United States in connection with this expansion of NATO. 
It is, I think, one of the strange coincidences of history that NATO was entered into--and I will present the documentation on this later--with the firm assurance by the then Secretary of State Dean Atchison to the Senate that would be no obligation at all for the deployment of forces to Europe by virtue of the North Atlantic Treaty that was entered into by the United States at the very beginning of this organization, the NATO organization. 
I want to be right upfront about it, that this information may convince Members to go one way or the other concerning the matters that will be presented to us later. But I don't know of anyone who could object to asking for this information for the use of the Congress, and particularly for the use of those of us who have the duty to find and allocate the money to maintain our national defense forces to assure the capability to defend this country. 
I am pleased that my friend from Hawaii has cosponsored this amendment in that spirit. This is just seeking information. It will in no way inhibit the administration--either the Department of Defense or the President--in their current course. But I do, as I said, still maintain reservations about that course because of what I perceive to be the costs of that course and its impact on our future ability to maintain our own defense. 
Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is not a small amount that is in the bill which is before us. As this amendment points out, there is almost $10 billion in the request of the President for U.S. military expenditures pursuant to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization obligations. I do believe that it is important for us to know to what extent that will be increased by virtue of the cost of action that is proposed due to the enlargement process as far as NATO is concerned.

To date, the Appropriations Committee has reported three bills to the Senate; defense, foreign operations, and energy and water. 
Tomorrow, our committee will report three additional bills; we believe the legislative branch; Treasury, general Government; and Commerce, State, Justice. 
On Thursday, the committee will report the Transportation, Agriculture, military construction, and HUD-VA and NASA bills. That is our hope. 
In all, if we can do that, the committee will have reported 12 of the 13 bills prior to the August recess. The District of Columbia bill will await action by the Governmental Affairs Committee on the administration's plan to change the Federal payment program for the District of Columbia. 
I state at the outset that this schedule is possible because of the bipartisan approach that Senator Robert Byrd and I have developed as we have worked together not only now but over the years and the cooperation between our staffs on all these bills. 
I urge the Senate to maintain that bipartisan approach to this appropriations process. We have sought and the leader has pledged to assist in obtaining floor time to move these bills to conference this month. 
We will not be able to meet our October 1 deadline to complete action on these spending bills unless we move them expeditiously here on the floor and get them to a conference committee prior to the time we leave in August so that all of our and the staff work related to the conferences may be completed during that period and our staffs also have time to take some needed leave then, too. 
This bill was reported by the Appropriations Committee to the Senate by a unanimous vote of 28 to 0. That again reflects the bipartisan approach that my colleague and friend, Senator Inouye of Hawaii, and I have tried to maintain with regard to this subcommittee. 
This bill is within the 602(b) allocation for the Defense Subcommittee. It provides $247 billion in spending authority for 1998. That is an increase of $3.25 billion over the President's request and $3.1 billion over the 1997 appropriations, but it is consistent with the allocation under the budget agreement which was reached with the President. 
The 602(b) allocation for the Defense Subcommittee is $1.1 billion below that provided to the House subcommittee. Consistent with the budget agreement, our Appropriations Committee allocated a larger share of the defense 050 function for defense nuclear energy programs. That is under the energy and water bill chaired by the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici]. Those items are funded in the energy and water development bill that the Senate will consider immediately after this bill. 
At the request of Senator Inouye and myself, the Subcommittee on Defense Appropriations recommended a balanced bill to the full committee, and we believe that it addresses key funding needs for personnel, readiness, and modernization at the Department of Defense. 
This bill and our report have been available to all Senators since Friday morning of last week. I will not describe the bill in detail but will touch on a few of the key items. 
Our bill fully funds the authorized end strength for the military personnel for 1998, including the 2.8-percent pay raise. We have added $380 million for real property maintenance, with $100 million set aside for refurbishing Army barracks. 
We have increased funding for the request for environmental restoration, particularly at formerly used defense sites. And $1.9 billion is provided for overseas contingency operations in Southwest Asia and Bosnia, and $261 million is added to correct a second consecutive failure by the Department of Defense to adequately fund military health care programs. We have adequately funded it to the extent that we have money to do so. 
We have added $437 million to the budget request to meet the minimum spending needs of the Army National Guard. I want to take just a moment, Mr. President, to thank all of my colleagues who joined with Senator Bond, Senator Ford, Senator Inouye, and myself to sponsor legislation last week to elevate the rank and status of the Chief of the National Guard. 
The adoption of that legislation as an amendment to S. 936, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1998, will help ensure that the National Guard's needs will be met during the formulation of the Department's budget and not solely by the intervention of Congress.

Mr. STEVENS. Senator Inouye and I have listened closely to the priorities identified by the service chiefs in reviewing the modernization accounts. And $3.8 billion has been provided over the budget request to address aviation, shipbuilding, munitions, and support equipment needs in the procurement accounts. 
Our bill includes an additional $616 million for research and development and includes an increase of $474 million for national missile defense and $175 million for additional breast cancer research. 
The bill includes nearly $700 million for counterdrug missions, and includes funds for the Gulf States initiative, and authority for the National Guard to spend an additional $50 million for counterdrug missions during fiscal year 1998. 
Consistent with the President's request, the bill provides $300 million for support of the defense missions undertaken by the Coast Guard. 
The bill before the Senate reflects 11 hearings undertaken by this subcommittee since February, reviewing all aspects of our defense program. Additionally, many priorities identified in this bill reflect visits by Members to defense bases here at home and abroad. 
This year we have taken three committee delegations overseas to evaluate how this money should be spent. In January we visited Israel, Egypt, Jordan, the Gaza, Kuwait, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Hungary, Italy, and Bosnia. 
In March, we met with senior Russian military leaders in Khabarosvk, Sakalin, and Vladivostok and held talks with senior officials of the North Korean Government in Pyongyang. We also visited South Korea prior to that visit. 
Last month, we went to Brussels and met with the Secretary-General of NATO and senior United States commanders to better understand the situation in Bosnia and the potential costs to the United States taxpayer of NATO expansion. 
Through these experiences, many of us have drawn a strong impression that we are spending too much overseas, Mr. President, with too little oversight by Congress of commitments made by our regional U.S. commanders whom we call the CINC's. 
Senator Inouye and I have discussed these concerns at length with the Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen. In response to our efforts, DOD is taking steps to reduce forces in Southwest Asia and in the vicinity of Bosnia. Secretary Cohen informed us just prior to the markup of this bill in the full committee that the Department will reduce overseas Joint Chiefs of Staff exercises in 1998 and will reduce the size of joint and unified headquarters overseas. 
As a result of these consultations, the committee adopted modest reductions to the budget for programs in these areas. We are indebted to Secretary Cohen for his cooperation with us. I will say I think this bill reflects the relationship he has developed not only with Senator Inouye and myself but with all members of the Defense Subcommittee. 
Beyond these operations, the committee has also pressed for greater financial oversight of the regional CINC operation. The Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Joe Ralston, has led this effort to increase financial limits and visibility on the deployment decisions that are made by the CINC's. 
Mr. President, it is my judgment that no military officer has the unilateral right to commit U.S. forces and taxpayer dollars overseas without the approval of the Secretary of Defense, the President of the United States, and the concurrence of Congress, and, specifically, to spend money, it is required there be express appropriations of funds for that purpose. I am talking about increasing deployment overseas of U.S. forces and increasing and expending from taxpayer dollars by CINC operations. 
This committee will not hesitate to reduce the funding available to the Department and severely limit the Department's spending and flexibility unless further progress is made in this area. I want to make certain we have no desire to interfere with the President's role as Commander in Chief, nor do we have difficulty with the role played by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
But military officers in command in the field cannot obligate our Nation to long-term overseas expenditures or deployments--they have been doing so, Mr. President, and that must come to an end. That is what is increasing the defense budget. Decisions made in the field without proper knowledge being transmitted to Congress on the commitments that are being made abroad, long-term commitments--in one instance, we were told it was a 20- to 50-year deployment that construction was being planned on, and not one word had been said to Congress about a deployment of that length. 
Mr. President, there are many other issues in the bill that I could speak about at this time. It is time for me to yield to my distinguished comanager of this bill, my good friend, the senior Senator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this will restore $60 million to the Former Soviet Union Threat Reduction Program. We call it the Nunn-Lugar Program. It will fully fund the program. We had reduced $60 million in accordance with the Senate Armed Services Committee's original reduction. During debate on the floor last week of the Armed Services bill, this item was increased. Since it is the only one that was really a substantial increase, we seek to have this adopted. 
We have no jurisdiction over Department of Energy funds, and we have used different offsets to restore this $60 million, but we seek to have this amendment adopted because it is a major difference between the Armed Services bill and this bill represented by our committee.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to state to the Senate that while we have been told there are some possible amendments, I have not been informed of any Senator's intent, for sure, to offer an amendment. I do want to tell the Senate I intend to move to go to third reading if there are not amendments brought to us and offered for debate. 
We have a very long program for appropriations this week and we hope to finish three, maybe four, maybe even five of the bills this week. If this bill is not going to be the subject of amendments today, we should know that soon. We are obligated to go to debate on the cloture motion at 6 o'clock, but we could, if the Senators would bring their amendments over here prior to that time, finish the debate on significant amendments and vote on them after the consideration of the cloture motion or as soon as the vote on cloture is over, and enable us to move to another appropriation tomorrow. 
It is our hope that Senators will present their amendments now. It is hard to get people to listen, but I hope they will listen because I am going to move to go to third reading if we do not have substantive amendments presented here before that time comes.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the two of us wish to emphasize to the Senate that this bill came out of our committee by unanimous vote. It has been a long time since that happened. But we have personally reviewed the requests from every Member of the Senate presented to our committee and we have done our best to allocate the moneys that were available. Not all of those requests were satisfied, I am sad to state. But under the circumstances, I do not expect substantial disagreement with this bill. But if there is any disagreement, we would like to know it now because we do intend to move forward to other bills, if we can. The energy and water bill is ready to come before the Senate as soon as this one is over. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I await, sometimes with trepidation, the annual report of my good friend from Arizona. I know of no one who spends more time, other than Senator Inouye and I do, than the Senator from Arizona. 
His comments are to the point. We do disagree on some of the issues. But I want the Senate to know once again we are grateful to him for the amount of time he puts into the bill. He has led, through his comments from year to year, changes that we have tried to make in subsequent bills to reflect his guidance. We again will examine this bill as we go to conference to make sure that we have done the best we can to accept his advice and counsel. But I deeply, truly am grateful to him for the time he takes on the bill.

Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, today, I offer this amendment for myself and currently 46 Members of the Senate. This amendment will change the status of the Chief of the National Guard. Our amendment promotes the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to a 4-star general and will include that position as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Now, the Joint Chiefs are the senior leadership within our military. This position for the Guard would rotate between the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard. 
I know this will become controversial with the members of the Armed Services Committee and members of the committee here in the Senate. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous consent Senators Gregg, Roberts, Campbell, McConnell, Faircloth, Boxer, Murray, Craig, Baucus, Hutchison, Daschle, Dorgan, Sessions, Lautenberg, and any other Senator who wishes to become sponsor, be listed as original cosponsors of this amendment.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the basis of this amendment is our belief that members of the National Guard are an essential part of our national security team. They are active participants now in the full spectrum of operations from the very smallest contingencies to the major actions we have been involved in. Theater wars, such as the Persian Gulf, no major military operation can be successful today without the National Guard. 
There are now 474,673 men and women in the National Guard. They are approximately 20 percent of our total Armed Forces and they represent participants from all 50 States and the 4 territories. These guardsmen truly embody our forefather's vision of the American citizen soldier. Guardsmen in uniform come in contact with the members of their community on a daily basis. As part of their community they attend their church, they serve on the PTA, they are actively involved in community and regional and State activities, they have civilian jobs in their communities. But they are citizen soldiers and they report for duty immediately. 
As a matter of fact, in my State, we now have an Air National Guard refueling unit that serves as the refueling unit for the whole Pacific theater. It is a National Guard unit. It is now fulfilling the complete functions of its predecessor, which was an active duty unit. 
Many Americans form their impressions about our people in military, particularly those in uniform, from their contact with members of the Guard. As we continue to downsize the active forces, I believe it is critical we maintain this strong communities-based military presence in every community. That citizen soldier is our link to the future, as far as support of military activities in this country, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, I have served now for many years on the Defense Appropriations Committee. One of my great privileges was to serve with Senator John Stennis who, at that time, was chairman of the Armed Services Committee and chairman of the Appropriations Committee. That can't happen again under our changed rules in the Senate. 
But in those days, we talked very long and often about the National Guard and the way we might integrate the National Guard into the active forces so that they would get, during peacetime, the type of exposure they need to be very proficient and efficient members of our team when we are at war. We pioneered the concept of sending to Europe, to NATO, and to our forces in Europe, guardsmen who actively performed the roles of our military in that theater, even though they were National Guardsmen on temporary duty. That is a few years back now, but that proved to be very cost-effective, Mr. President. At a cost of about 25 percent, we can maintain a person who is able and ready to perform military duties as a guardsman, compared to the active duty force. I am not saying they can ever replace them; that is not the idea. But the purpose of our amendment is to assure that there is recognition now of the role, on a constant basis, of the citizen soldier in the formulation of military policy in this Nation. 
The National Guard is not consulted now on a regular basis on major force structure decisions, or on matters concerning resource allocation and priorities. During the Quadrennial Defense Review, it is my judgment that the National Guard was not fully considered, as far as the deliberations concerning defense strategy, force readiness, and the allocation of funding. There were important decisions made concerning the future of the Guard within the military structure, without the Guard having any participant there. 
I think the Guard represents such a significant portion of our forces that the rank now held by the highest member in the National Guard, a three-star general, should become a four-star general, and that person representing, at times, the Army National Guard, and at other names the Air National Guard, rotating, as I said, should have a seat at the table where the decisions are made that vitally affect the future of the participants in the National Guard. 
Now, these Joint Chiefs--and I have a high regard for them --are the senior military advisers to the President, and they are the decisionmaking body of military strategy, as far as our system is concerned. Within the Department of Defense, they speak for those in uniform. But the National Guard, who constitutes 20 percent of our total military and one-fifth of the people who could be called into any crisis to come forward and participate in the defense of our Nation, are not represented at that table. 
It is my strong view that they should be part of that Joint Chiefs of Staff. The National Guard Bureau has no access to the chain of command directly to that staff, or to the Secretary of Defense, or to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. I believe our amendment would correct that situation. And if it is not corrected, it could impair our future readiness and the survival of the Guard itself. 
Now, I want to state very clearly, I know that Secretary Cohen, who is not only a great Secretary, but he is a personal friend, and General Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are not particularly pleased with this suggestion. Their counsel, I am sure, will come to the Congress with regard to this. But I remember that at the time we suggested that the Guard start performing regular duty functions, the Secretary and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs were opposed to that, too. Yet, when it came to the Persian Gulf, Mr. President, when we had to send our forces there to restrain the forces of Saddam Hussein, the call was answered by almost 75,000 National Guardsmen. Almost, as I understand it, about 25 percent of the thousands and thousands that were on active duty there were National Guardsmen. 
Now, it is high time, I believe, that the Guard forces who were called upon to serve our Nation have their interests fully considered on a day-to-day basis when the decisions are made that affect their future. That is what this amendment is all about. 
I believe this is an amendment that must become law. It will take some time to work it out. I am not saying this will happen overnight. But I do believe it is our role, as members of the Appropriations Committee, to raise this issue. A cost-effective military for this country in the 21st century requires the participation of the National Guard. 
We are constantly faced with decisions to reduce our force structure. The way to increase our force structure is to bring more citizen soldiers into the Department of Defense structure now. We will do that if they realize that we are going to emphasize their participation, we are going to emphasize their role, and we are going to do that by having a member of the Joint Chiefs be a representative of the National Guard of the United States. I consider this to be one of the major changes that must be made in the realignment of our forces and the 
command of our forces in this country. And I am hopeful that others will speak very forcefully on it. I might add, Mr. President, I see that the cochairmen of the National Guard Caucus are here. I am delighted that they support this proposal. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I join the majority leader in supporting the Dorgan amendment. I do so because, in our recent trips overseas, we have found a new military base, a U.S. military base in Kuwait; we have a new one at Prince Sultan in Saudi Arabia; we have been expanding a new one at Aviano, in Italy. The Hungarians believe we are going to continue to maintain their base once they join NATO. 
It will take no Base Closure Commission for the administration to start closing bases overseas. I would rather see them stop building new bases overseas. But, certainly we need a report like this to try and get some idea about what is going on. 
Last, I would say this, almost 40 percent of our military personnel today who are combat personnel are overseas. I do not believe we should have a Base Closure Commission to decide how many bases to close here at home until they return. It is not time to have a new base closure commission.

Mr. STEVENS. Thank you, Mr. President pro tempore. I have a message here from the majority leader. 
For the information of all Senators, this morning, following remarks that I will make, the Senate will resume consideration of the reconciliation bill. At approximately 9:30 a.m. this morning the Senate will proceed to a series of back-to-back rollcall votes on or in relation to a number of amendments which were offered last evening, alternating between each side of the aisle and ending with the final passage of the Balanced Budget Act. Also, by consent, there will be 2 minutes of debate equally divided on each amendment prior to each vote. Therefore, Senators can expect a lengthy series of back-to-back rollcall votes as the Senate disposes of all amendments in order to the budget reconciliation bill. 
Following final passage, the Senate is expected to proceed to consideration of S. 949, the Tax Fairness Act. As previously announced, all Members may expect busy sessions of the Senate the next couple of days as the Senate works to complete action on the budget reconciliation process prior to the Fourth of July recess.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, after a distinguished 40-year career with the U.S. Postal Service and its predecessor the Post Office Department, my good friend Robert J. Opinsky is retiring. 
Bob traveled to Alaska in 1956 for a summer vacation. By the time the vacation was over, Bob was ready to become a full-time Alaskan. 
He began working with the Post Office Department in Anchorage that year in 1956. By 1970, having served in almost every capacity at the Post Office, he was named Anchorage Postmaster. 
When the Anchorage Division was created in 1986, Bob became Division Manager. He was the top Postal Service official in our state, responsible for the delivery and retail operations of all 209 post offices in Alaska. 
There have been tremendous challenges during Bob's career, and he's met them with his characteristic quiet efficiency. 
One example is how he managed to keep the mail flowing after Alaska's 1964 earthquake, which I remind the Senate measured 9.2 on the Richter scale. 
Bob was foreman of delivery and collection at that time. 
He worked around the clock and kept the mail moving, even though much of what we call southcentral Alaska was brought to its knees by the disaster. 
As our population increased after North Slope oil was discovered and production began, Bob led a team which built and updated more than 50 post offices in a hurry to keep up with the growing number of Alaskans. 
In his quiet manner, Bob made sure the task was accomplished quickly and efficiently. 
Bob has also ensured that distinguished postal officials learn about Alaska. 
Hosting several Postmasters General, the entire Postal Service Board of Governors and members of the Postal Rate Commission on their visits to Alaska, Bob has given them a firsthand view of the beauty of our State, and also an awareness of our unique problems. 
I have traveled with Bob to postal functions all over our State: post office dedications, stamp ceremonies, or town meetings to discuss new facilities. 
Everywhere we have gone together, it has been obvious how well-liked and respected Bob Opinsky is. He is an Alaskan's Alaskan, with a real can-do spirit. 
While working his way up the ladder at the Post Office, Bob put himself through college. He worked hard to become the best manager in the Postal Service, and he has succeeded. 
Many awards have come his way over four decades, but perhaps the recognition he most treasures is the Postmaster General Award for Executive Achievement, presented to him in 1991 by Postmaster General Tony Frank. 
Bob is married to a lifelong Alaskan, the former Edith Jordet--Edie to many of our friends. They have raised three great children, William, John, and Celine. 
Bob's Opinsky's kindness is legendary. His knowledge of the Postal Service is absolutely incredible. His gentleness has earned him the special respect of coworkers, neighbors, and friends. His unassuming demeanor masks a true competitor--a man who works to make sure that he and his people are at the top. 
Retirement may mean that Bob's golf game may get a little better, and that he and Edie may have a chance to seek some sunshine during the winter months. 
Best of all for me, Mr. President, Bob is my friend. Retirement won't change that. 
On behalf of all Alaskans, whose lives have been enriched through the great postal services Bob has ensured for them through the years, I commend Bob Opinsky for a job well done, and wish him well as he explores new horizons. 
I thank the Chair and yield back any time I might have.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I want to give a little history of what we are dealing with in this 1997 supplemental appropriations bill. 
In February of this year, we received a request for $2.1 billion from the President to deal with the funding that had been advanced in the Bosnia peacekeeping efforts overseas in a way that would repay the funds to the various accounts in the Department of Defense from which those moneys were taken. That was $2.1 billion, as I said. 
That February budget request also contained mandatory veterans compensation and pensions of $800 million and other requests, mainly a WIC request, women, infants, and children request of $.1 billion. It was $100 million. The total of the budget request in February was $3 billion. There was no disaster attached to that request. 
We received a formal request on March 19 for $2 billion related to the disasters. Again, on April 23, we received a request of $300 million. And on June 9, we received a major request of $2.4 billion. Again, Mr. President, that was June 9. Our total formal budget request that is covered by this bill is $7.7 billion. Some of those amounts we had anticipated in the bill that was presented to the Senate previously, but the formal budget request was received June 9 for more than 25 percent of this bill. 
I have seen and heard people on the television telling us how we should be getting on with our work. As a matter of fact, I think in terms of supplementals, for us to handle supplemental requests from March 19, April 23, and June 9 by today, which is June 12, I think is not tardy. We have had informal OMB reestimates of $400 million since those others were received. We had an informal increase for mandatory veterans compensation and pensions reported to us on June 3, another $200 million. The total Presidential request before the Senate is $8.2 billion. This bill is $8.9 billion. 
The $700 million comes about by the community development block grant, the CDBG moneys, for the disaster of $300 million. We have an SSI provision in this bill, supplemental amount for legal aliens of $200 million. There is an additional $700 
million for the Federal Highway Administration, and other minor adjustments made by congressional amendments amount to $200 million. In other words, the total congressional impact on this bill is $700 million. 
The bill, for the first time in history, is totally offset. This report offsets in the Defense Department $1.9 billion. It offsets, in domestic offsets, $6.1 billion. There is an additional amount of mandatory spending, mainly veterans compensation and pensions, that is covered by the bill and amounts to $900 million. It does not score under the Budget Act. Those are moneys that were already covered under entitlement provisions. 
Mr. President, I made the statement before and I asked unanimous consent that the agreement that applies to this bill is that the statement of the managers that accompanied the conference report for H.R. 1469 would be the legislative history for this bill that is going to be presented to the Senate. 
The reason for that is that I did not want it to be just a statement of one person, myself, to make that legislative history. It is the statement of the Senate now on a unanimous-consent basis that the provisions of the managers' report that accompanied the former conference report, to the extent those provisions are in the bill, are the legislative history for this bill. 
There are three items that have been deleted from the bill: the continuing resolution language, the census language and the language that pertained to Revised Statute 2477, the right-of-way provision. I regret deeply being put in the position where that has to be withdrawn. We do, however, have a commitment from the President of the United States that within 180 days, there will be presented to the Congress a bill proposing a legislative solution to the problems that have beset the West since the announcement of the policy by the Secretary of Interior in January of the change in the historic concept that these rights-of-way were to be determined by State law and the statement of policy from the Department of Interior that says they have to be rights-of-way developed by vehicular traffic. Both of the changes are very oppressive, as far as my State is concerned, and we look forward to receiving the legislation that the President has committed his administration to submit to us on that subject, and I hope the Congress will act on that during this session of Congress. 
But, Mr. President, it is important that everybody understand that other than the three provisions that have been deleted from the bill, the managers' report that accompanied the conference report is the legislative history for this bill. There were conditions and terms set forth in that managers' report that we expect the administration to comply with. They are now listed as being the formal statement of this Senate as a whole on how the conference report is to be interpreted. I think that is only fair. That is what we intended in the event the conference report had been signed by the President. This is the same bill except for those three provisions.

Mr. STEVENS. I come to the Senate floor today to tell the Senate that a very special and dear friend to many of us who serve in the Senate, the Right Honorable Michael Jopling, has now been honored in his country with a life peerage and will join the House of Lords. 
Those of us who know Michael Jopling have known him as a Member of Parliament who has served more than three decades in Britain as a Member of Parliament. He served as a Minister of Agricultural, Fisheries, and Food in the British Government for two 4-year periods between 1979 and 1987. Those of us here in the Senate who know him, know him because of his active participation in the North Atlantic Assembly sessions and particularly in the British-American Interparliamentary Conference meetings which many of us have participated in from time to time. 
He continues to serve, Mr. President, as the Secretary for the Interparliamentary Exchange. Senator Byrd and I will lead a Senate delegation in August to meet with our British counterparts, and for the 10th year in a row it will be Lord Jopling, now, who will meet us. He brings great energy and enthusiasm to the meetings we have held and, really, his participation has been unparalleled. 
As a matter of fact, I am sad to report to the Senate that with his youthful exuberance he got the better of himself recently when he suffered an accident in a Go-Kart race. He broke some ribs and had some damage to his lungs, but he is on the mend now. I understand that he will have full recovery. 
I further bring greetings to the Senate from our friend Senator Heflin. Senator Heflin has written to me about his real joy to see our friend, Michael Jopling, so honored. I am reminded of a speech that Sir Winston Churchill made in the House of Commons on August 20, 1940. He said: 
The British Empire and the United States will have to be somewhat mixed together in some of their affairs for mutual and general advantage. For my own part, looking out upon the future, I do not view the process with any misgivings. 
It is, in fact, the British-American interparliamentary process that has given great effect to those words, and Lord Jopling has been a leader of that effort. He has made a lasting contribution to the great relationship between our two countries. He and his wife Gail have always been gracious hosts, and they really are wonderful goodwill ambassadors for Britain. 
I come to offer my congratulations to Lord Jopling. I think others who know him will want to congratulate him, also. We particularly thank him for years of dedication to his country and to the cause of world peace and understanding. He is a great personal friend. I am delighted to see a friend honored.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use. I state to the Senate that I don't intend to use the whole hour, unless it is necessary to respond to some comments that may come up. It is my hope that we can finish debate on this bill and then turn to the budget resolution. 
The conference report on the defense and emergency disaster supplemental bill will soon be before us. It is not before us yet. In the interest of time, we hope that we can get this matter resolved so that we may vote upon the bill as soon as it is received from the House. 
Mr. President, the conferees completed their work yesterday afternoon and the conference report was filed in the House last night. The final bill keeps faith with the version that passed the Senate last month. It provides needed relief for the victims of disasters in 35 States. The bill also provides $1.8 billion for military operations in Bosnia, Southwest Asia, and foreign deployments. Those amounts replace funds already spent by the administration. Without this funding for the Defense Department, we face a severe reduction in training, readiness, and quality of life for our troops worldwide. 
The bill continues to exceed the levels requested by the President for the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA], the community development block grants, economic development, agriculture, and for the Corps of Engineers. I might say, however, Mr. President, while this bill involves increases of $8 billion, we have offset $8.4 billion. There is no net increase in this bill. We actually have a $400 million net reduction in spending for fiscal year 1997 as a result of this bill. 
Each of our subcommittees have carefully reviewed the amounts proposed by these agencies, and working with the Members from the impacted States, we have arrived at these funding levels. The new budget authority is offset by corresponding rescissions, as I have indicated. Those exceed the total spending. 
Again, let me say, all defense spending is offset by reductions available to the Department of Defense in terms of prior appropriations. Again, consistent with the Senate version of the bill, additional amounts are provided for needed highway programs. Mr. President, there was a request from the administration for some highway money. We added to that. We have reached a compromise now by virtue of the work that was done by Senator Shelby and Senator Lautenberg. That results in an increase for the so-called donor States, compared to the bill that passed the Senate. But I believe it keeps faith with the commitment that we have made to provide more funding to the donee States. We did not rewrite the highway formula. We reached an honest compromise with the House, where the House is dominated primarily by donor States and this Senate has more votes from the donee States. Now, this is a legitimate compromise on the money without rewriting the highway formula. 
The conferees maintained the continuing resolution language; it is unchanged. It was the same version in both the House and Senate bills. It was not before the conference, actually. The levels of the continuing resolution version provide 100 percent of the fiscal year 1997 enacted rate of appropriations in the event a bill is not passed by the end of the fiscal year. This is more generous than most continuing resolutions that have been passed by the Congress in prior years. Typically, past resolutions provided that the money to be available during the period of a continuing resolution was the lower of the two amounts provided by the House or the Senate. This is not that case. This continuing resolution would be 100 percent of the amount that has been available in 1997. 
I might say to the Senate that, after considerable debate, the conferees modified the language on the 2000 census; that is, we modified the provision adopted by the Senate. The conference agreement prohibits the use of sampling and mandates a full enumeration of Americans for the apportionment of the House of Representatives. This is nothing more than maintaining current law, Mr. President, the constitutional requirement for a real census. It does not permit a political polling type of census. 
I think we should state to the Senate that the Appropriations Committee in the House and the Senate each have recognized that this decision will increase the cost of the census for the year 2000. We are prepared to fund that additional cost within the total available under the bipartisan budget agreement, which we will vote on later today. I regret that no Member of the minority has chosen to sign the conference report, but I do understand and respect Senator Byrd's decision. I knew of his objection from the very beginning to the 
continuing resolution provision that is in the bill. But I want to assure Senators that, as far as the appropriations aspects of this bill, it is not a partisan bill. The agreements reached on the appropriations for disaster relief and for the recovery from the disasters were adopted with complete consultation with all Members of each body, regardless of party. 
I hope the President will closely evaluate the total bill before he reaches the decision on a veto. We know that there is a threatened veto. We hope to work with the President to meet the needs of the victims of these disasters and to maintain our national defense, which is our constitutional duty. Vetoing this bill will simply delay further the aid and support that is needed by the citizens of more than 30 States. 
I do want to state, Mr. President, that this is the first bill that I have been privileged to handle as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. I offer my thanks to Chairman Bob Livingston for his courtesy and cooperation in working with Members of the Senate on this bill. It is a very complex bill, Mr. President. At times, this was a very contentious conference. But the House chairman, who was the chairman of the conference, presided over the conference with considerable grace, diligence, and good humor. I do believe that all Members will agree that anyone who wanted to participate in the debate concerning this conference was able to do so. I do urge the adoption of the bill by the Senate today so the bill can reach the President as soon as possible. 
It will be a difficult vote, Mr. President, and I expect a very close vote on whether the bill goes to the President at all. Thank you. 
I reserve the remainder of my time.

Mr. STEVENS. My question to the leader is I hope he realizes this is new law. Never before in the history of the United States have we assisted people who lost cattle during a disaster. So we are making new law. It is not just an appropriation. It is an authorization bill, too. 
I accept what the Senator says. It would be nice to get the bill passed, but I want the Senate to know that we took it upon ourselves to not only appropriate money but to change the law so that disaster aid would be available to people who lost cattle. I understand this is a bad disaster, but there have been many disasters where people have lost cattle before and they received no aid.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I appreciate the kind words that the Democratic leader has made here on the floor. My response to him would be that no President in the history of the United States has closed down the Government like President Clinton did. There are hundreds of thousands of people who were put in a position of being told to stay home, they could not go to work. When they did not go to work, facilities all over this country were closed. People were told they could not get their veterans checks, they could not get any assistance from the Social Security Administration. They were totally closed down. 
Now, to use the first vehicle available to us in the appropriations process to try to prevent that, I do not think is a cynical act. I am sorry that he used that word with regard to this provision. It is a legitimate difference of opinion with the administration and with the minority, but I do not believe we are being cynical in trying to protect the people of the United States from another shutdown, which I foresee is going to happen unless we 
find some way to come to an agreement with this President about the misuse of the Presidential power to shut down the Government when we were not out of money, by the way. We were not out of money. There were funds that could have been used to keep the office open.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, section 6005 of the conference agreement on H.R. 1469 contains a substitute for the original Senate prohibition on the expenditure of funds to advocate certain policies with respect to the recognition, validity, or management of rights of way established pursuant to section 2477 of the Revised Statutes (43 U.S.C. 932), more commonly referred to as R.S. 2477. 
Section 6005 establishes a commission to recommend a long-term solution to the administration and Congress. The commission is bipartisan--6 Republicans and 6 Democrats--plus a retired Federal judge selected by the other 12 to chair the commission. The commission has representatives from the administration, Congress, and the States. 
The commission is cost effective--the only new cost is the salary of the retired judge. All other members are Federal, State, or congressional employees who would serve on the commission within the scope of their existing duties. The Secretary of the Interior is responsible for payment of the chairman's salary and expenses, and for providing, and paying for any necessary staff, office space, and expenses out of existing funds provided for the Department of the Interior. 
Based on concerns raised by the administration, the provision waives the Federal Advisory Committee Act to avoid lengthy procedural delays. However the commission's hearings are open to the public, and a public record is required to be kept of those hearings. In addition, the commission must keep a record of its deliberations. 
The commission is tasked with recommending changes in law to expeditiously resolve outstanding right of way claims under R.S. 2477. Those recommendations are to be made in consultation with the governors of affected States. It is my hope that working together this commission can reach consensus on this difficult issue. 
This commission must make its recommendations by March 1, 1998, and must include with their submission any comments they receive from governors. The Secretary of the Interior must approve or disapprove the recommendations in their entirety by March 31, 1998. If the Secretary approves the commission's recommendations, then a fast track procedure is provided in Congress to ensure those recommendations are considered. If the Secretary does not approve the commission's recommendations, then the fast track procedure is not available. Under the fast track procedure only relevant amendments are allowed in the Senate during floor consideration of the bill, and any message from the House on such a bill. 
The conference agreement leaves intact the permanent prohibition on the issuance of final rules or regulations on R.S. 2477 without express authorization of such rules or regulations by a subsequent act of Congress, and specifically states in section 6005(b)(5)(A) that this provision does not constitute such express authorization. Section 6005 does not repeal or modify any existing law, and takes no position regarding the legitimacy of the R.S. 2477 policy announced by the Secretary of the Interior on January 22, 1997.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have been an occupant of the Chair and listened to many statements now concerning my good friend from South Carolina. So I am not going to repeat some of the matters concerning Senator Thurmond's personal background. I would like to just discuss some of the memories I have of this great Senator. 
It is a matter of coincidence, I guess, but Senator Thurmond came to the Senate by appointment on December 24, 1954. I came to the Senate by appointment on December 24, 1968. I thank the Parliamentarian for assisting me in finding those dates. When I came to the Senate, Senator Thurmond was 22d in seniority. It is an interesting thing that he is now the first in line, and, on our side, I am now the second. 
A great many people have come to the Senate, and left, since the first day that I came to the Senate and joined Senator Thurmond. But it was with great interest that I met him because 
I read a great deal about the Senator from South Carolina prior to coming to the Senate. 
As a matter of history, I was trained to fly gliders in World War II and firmly expected to be deployed to the European theater, when I was reassigned into the China theater, and did not ever get to tow gliders into combat. But I did train to tow them. And I was very interested to find out that Senator Thurmond was one of those who led part of our forces flying a glider into the invasion in June 1944. 
You know, the whole concept of using gliders was to insert troops far beyond the shore defenses out in front. And that is, I think, what I would say about Senator Thurmond: He has always been out in front. 
He has also been a leader by example. There is one thing that young Senators coming into the Senate, whether in the group that I came in 1968 or every new term that brings more Senators, soon learn. If you want to see what a Senator should act like, should be like, you should emulate the Senator from South Carolina. As a matter of fact, my brother, Bob, lives in South Carolina. When he speaks of `my Senator,' he is talking about Senator Thurmond--not me--because Senator Thurmond is a real champion of the people of his State. They know him personally. 
It was my privilege in one election to accompany Senator Thurmond to South Carolina and to go to campaign events with him. I want the Senate to know, if they want to learn how to campaign, that they ought to try that. Because when Senator Thurmond goes into an event--and we went to several on that trip that I made with him to South Carolina--he does not need someone standing beside him to remind him who people are. He loves campaigning. You can tell that he knows his people, and they love him because it is a reunion. Each one of his campaign events are reunions. They are not just something to go to, to try to listen to; they are supporters coming to meet their Senator. There is a great difference, Mr. President. I think we all know that. 
But time passes very quickly in the Senate. It passes quickly for those who are busy. Some people come and leave very quickly because they never really become part of the Senate family. Senator Thurmond has been a leader not only in the Senate, but here on the floor and in the Senate family. 
My daughter, Lily--this is Uncle Strom to her. I think for almost every one of us who have had young children here in the Senate, they have had that same relationship to Senator Thurmond. She literally lights up when she sees Strom because she is meeting a friend. He really vibrates with young people. And I like that as a father. But I also admire it greatly in terms of his qualities and the way he approaches life. 
I was thinking, as I sat there in the chair, about what I would say about Senator Thurmond. My message to the Senate is, here is a man who loves life. There is a real joy to his life. He has had some sadness. But he has had the strength to overcome that. But he really enjoys life. 
I remember when he used to tell me that I ought to work out more, that I ought to get more exercise. I thought I was getting a lot of exercise. But I soon found out that I needed that exercise because every time he grabbed me by the arm, I went away with a bruise. And I had to get a little bit more muscle there so I could be close enough to him so he could talk to me. You watch. He will do that when I finish. He is going to grab me by the arm and let me know there is still strength in that arm. And it is the strength of a strong heart, a heart that really loves our country, and loves the Senate, and that really has dignified the Senate in his years here. 
He has been in some battles. He has been in some battles with me. But I will tell the Senate that no one in the Senate could have a better friend than Strom Thurmond. I am proud to be here today to call him my friend and to acknowledge his great leadership. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask Senators to do something irregular--that is, pick up the bill and look at what this amendment does to the Appropriations Committee. On page 23, you will see on line 9 an increase of $137.8 billion for health. If you look at page 35 where this amendment touches, it has `new budget authority for allowances'--no new budget, no outlays. 
What it means is we would have to go into every other account and pull out money to put it in this one account, an account that is already increased under this budget by $137.8 billion. 
The Senator came to me and asked me if I would be bound by this. I checked with Senator Byrd. We cannot be bound by this. Some of those accounts--by the way, this is an absolute across-the-board cut--cannot take that. 
For those of you in agriculture, agriculture has already been cut. Space and technology has already been cut. We have to go in and cut those further in order to put this money into an account that has already a $137.8 billion increase under this budget. 
I urge you to vote against it, because we do not want to have to go against the sense of the Senate. But we would have to under this because we cannot comply with this. 
I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.

Mr. STEVENS. As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I want to tell the Senate that those of us who are voting against some of these amendments are doing it because there is no money to fund these sense-of-the-Senate resolutions. I say to any of you that want to offer amendments that change this budget, that authorize additional funds--show me the money. Show me where the money is when you offer amendments that change the budget plan agreed to with the President. 
I have discussed this with the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. We will have the obligation to allot money within the budget among 13 subcommittees. A sense-of-the-Senate resolution does not give us any more money but it gives us the problem that you have sent a message to America that there is money in this budget to do something the Senate votes for in a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. 
When the budget resolution, just before, was voted I asked for a chance to come to the floor again, and I ask for you to reserve some time and we will show where a commitment has been made by the Senate to fund items where there is no money. I urge the Senate to wake up. We are voting against these matters not because we are against highways or aid for children who need insurance. We are voting--the Senators from New Mexico and New Jersey have brought us a resolution. We had a budget that has been worked out with the President and we have a chance to vote for a balanced budget. I do not want to be accused of being a tightwad when we allocate the money under 602(b) of the budget act and then we do not cover the sense-of-the-Senate Resolutions. 
Again, if anyone is going to accuse us of being tightwads and not following the sense of the Senate, I tell you, if you vote for one of these things, you show us where the money is and we will allocate it. We will not be misled by these attempts to gain publicity and to gain some credit at home on a bill like this. This is a very serious bill. The two of us are going to have a horrendous job trying to meet our duties even within this budget, so do not give us any more of this funny money. You show me real money and I will allocate it to your function.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we are fortunate when our working associates are knowledgeable, efficient, responsible and willing to go the extra mile. 
But none of those attributes mean much over the long haul until you add loyalty to the mix. 
For half of my life--and two-thirds of hers--Barbara Andrews-Mee has been my boss--as a lawyer, a member of our state legislature and as a U.S. Senator. 
Her talents are many. But, when I've been asked, `What is Barb's best characteristic?' I say, `loyalty.' 
That means more to me than any of the help she's given me and the people of Alaska over more than three decades: work above and beyond the call of duty. 
Through our 36 years of working together, Barb has solved problems for countless Alaskans. 
She's been to hundreds--maybe even thousands--of meetings of civic and community groups to keep her finger on the pulse, to help keep me informed. 
A tireless supporter of our military men and women, she has attended ceremonies on bases and posts, on submarines and on her own ship, the U.S.S. Zephyr, a PC8 coastal patrol craft, which she christened. 
Barb has watched parades and air shows and presentations of colors and speeches of all types, and worked to ensure that military people who serve in Alaska are treated with respect as our neighbors and constituents. 
Barb, can on request, put a file in my hand that is sometimes decades old. She can always locate them. 
She's been the institutional memory for the young Alaskans who come to work with us, fresh out of school. 
And, after they've served on the Senate payroll and move on, they come back to see Barb. 
My grandmother always told me, `Just remember, dynamite comes in small packages.' 
That's Barb. 
She knows when to use her Norwegian stubbornness or her Alaskan toughness to get a job done. 
She also knows how to set me straight, and has done it many times. 
Many a morning Barb has risen long before dawn, or many a dark night, well after others in Anchorage have gone to bed, she has traveled to Elmendorf Air Force Base to greet, in my name, dignitaries whose planes are making a brief stopover. 
She gives our visitors an Alaskan gift package--some smoked salmon, crackers, and candy. And every time afterward, the visitors say, `Remember me to Barb.' 
She's met my planes every hour of the day and night when I come home. 
And she's made sure I made my flights back to Washington, DC, no matter how tight the time frame, possibly testing the speed limits along the way, but always getting me there. 
One year I came home 36 times. She met me every time but one. 
When I got there that night, having left the Senate at 4 p.m., battled traffic and got the 5:30 plane and arrived in Anchorage about 11:30 p.m., there was no one there. 
I waited, then called Barb. `What's up?' I said to my sleepy friend. `What's my schedule?' 
`You aren't here, chief,' Barb said. `I won't tell anyone you're here if you won't tell anyone I'm not there!" 
I went fishing and then went back to DC. 
We've shared much more than a working relationship through the years, Mr. President. Barb's friendship has meant much to me and my family. 
In our worst days, when I lost my wife Ann who was Barb's good friend, Barb did everything possible to ease our pain, despite her own sense of loss. 
Barb's quick with the quip, and usually has a great joke to share when it looks like our spirits are low. 
Along with her job, and her sons, her daughter-in-law, and grandchildren, and her husband, Vince, Barb has another special love. 
It's golf. 
The snow has hardly disappeared from our Alaska golf courses before Barb is on the links. 
With Vince, she packs up her clubs and heads for sunny climes whenever there's an opportunity. 
Like everything else she's worked on, Barb continues to perfect her golf game. 
We may not see her on the L.P.G.A. circuit, but she's going to give those other lady golfers a run for their money. 
Mr. President, it's impossible to sum up 36 years of association in one small tribute. 
Mike Doogan, a columnist for the Anchorage Daily News, in a farewell column about Barb's years with us, quoted her as saying, `It's been a great ride.' 
You bet it has. 
But more than all of her other great attributes, Barb's loyalty has sustained me, comforted me, inspired me, and helped me to overcome tough situations. 
She may not be coming into my Anchorage office every day, anymore. She may be soaking up sunshine at her Arizona getaway, or on a Hawaiian Island or a Florida Key. 
But no matter where Barb is, she knows she can count on me to be her friend for all time. 
There is no way to thank Barb, Mr. President. The words `Thank you' are too small to convey the depth and breadth and length of the gratitude I have for all of the wonderful years Barb Andrews-Mee has shared with me, with my family, and with Alaskans. 
We'll miss our day-to-day contact, but we'll always know we have a loyal friend. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I rise in strong support of S. 476, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America Act of 1997, which I have cosponsored. This important legislation will give seed money to build 1,000 additional Boys and Girls Clubs across America, with special emphasis on establishing clubs in public housing projects and distressed areas. 
In Alaska, and across the Nation, kids are reaping the benefits of Boys and Girls Clubs. They are safe places where kids can go after school to learn and have fun. Boys and Girls Clubs are places where they find role models, and where they can explore their own talents and skills. In 1995 there were 8,000 Alaskans participating in Boys and Girls Clubs; today more than 14,000 young Alaskans are Boys and Girls Club members. In fact many of my staff are alumni of these clubs in Alaska. 
This seed money will insure that more than 1 million more young Americans will have a safe place to grow and learn by the year 2000. This is a model program supplying the construction cost for the clubs and giving youths in depressed communities a chance to succeed. Studies by Columbia University have shown that in areas of public housing where there are Boys and Girls Clubs Juvenile crime has dropped 13 percent. 
I thank Senator Hatch and the other cosponsors of this important legislation for their hard work and dedication. I look forward to seeing more Boys and Girls Clubs across our great Nation.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, when I came to the Senate, I brought with me a little sign I used to keep on my desk as a lawyer. It was the four-way test of the Rotary Clubs of America. It says, `Of the things we think, say, or do, is it the truth? Is it fair to all concerned? Will it build good will and better friendships? Will it be beneficial to all concerned?' 
A little over 10 years ago, I stood on this floor and I had in my hand a flier that had been issued by the Wilderness Society. It had a picture of Mount McKinley National Park and Wonder Lake--that is in the park--on the front of it, with the word `sold' stamped on it. That indicates somehow or other that logging was going on in Mount McKinley National Park near Wonder Lake. 
There is another picture that talked about logging 800-year-old hemlock trees in a rain forest. As a matter of fact, those photographs were of redwood logs on trucks in California, on a California highway, and we identified the highway. To his great credit, the former Senator from Wisconsin, Senator Gaylord Nelson, withdrew that pamphlet and called me and told me he was doing that. 
Last week, after the debate on the supplemental appropriations bill, I came to the office in the morning and I found on my desk an AP story written by Jim Abrams, Associated Press writer. It started with this line: `Legislation making it easier to build roads through Federal parks and wilderness area survived a Senate challenge Wednesday and headed toward a possible showdown with the White House. The measure, pushed by Alaska and Utah Senators, inserted in a crucial bill to provide billions to victims of natural disasters, would give the Federal Government less say in what constitutes a valid right-of-way under a 130-year-old law.' 
Another AP story came to my attention later that day by Mr. H. Josef Hebert of the Associated Press. It goes further in asserting that we have presented to the Senate a bill that would intrude upon national parks and wildlife refugees. Interestingly enough, issued out of the AP office in Salt Lake City, was this article: `White House move opponents claimed could block access to rural byways in Utah and Alaska has been narrowly defeated by the Senate.' 
It goes on to state the issue from the point of view of someone who knows what he is talking about.

Mr. STEVENS. We found later that the information in those articles was based on a statement issued by the National Parks and Conservation Association, which in my day when I was with the Interior Department of the Eisenhower administration was a truthful organization, not just a bunch of flacks for the extreme environmental movement. 
It is very interesting to read this because this is the source of the claims made here on the floor that assert that there would be hundreds of thousands of miles across wildlife refuges, national parks, and other areas in Alaska--as a matter of fact, the figure of over 900,000 miles was used several times. 
Now, Mr. President, nothing is farther from the truth. I am here to ask the people in the Senate and the people who are addressing this issue to come back and face the four-way test. It is not true. The newspapers began repeating over and over again that the provision I authored in this bill that passed the Senate 
would create new roads and make Swiss cheese of our national parks and other protected areas. Those are false reports that are based on I do not know what kind of research. I am here today to set the record straight. 
Mr. President, it is a very simple proposition. Here is a map of Alaska with hypothetical section lines on it. Our State is one-fifth the size of the United States, 586,000 square miles. We became a State, Mr. President, in 1959. In 1969, the whole State was withdrawn from the creation of any rights--no State rights, no native rights, no private rights could be created on Federal lands. At that time, the Federal Government owned almost 90 percent of Alaska land. These hypothetical lines represent section lines, as I said. If the lands were ever surveyed under Revised Statute 2477 as interpreted by my State, it would be possible--possible--for the State to claim the right to build a highway. 
The falsity of the statements that were made concerning my amendment are depicted on this map. We, in 1976, as a Congress, with the President's approval, repealed the old Revised Statute 2477. What that did is give the areas in the West where rights-of-way had been created by use or by surveys, the right to use those rights-of-way across Federal lands and they, in fact, ripened into the highway system of the United States. However, those rights had to be created in most of the United States by 1976. We protected only valid existing rights that were created prior to the repeal of the old Revised Statute 2477. At the time Revised Statute 2477 was enacted, there were a little over 10,000 miles of section line in our State, according to the Bureau of Land Management. They were primarily, Mr. President, represented by the surveys that had been made in the metropolitan areas of our State and the cities, Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau, what not. They were not out in the rural areas, unless the Government on some unknown occasion surveyed the area nearby a mining claim. 
The reason we protected valid existing rights was that so these rural areas of Alaska would have the right to develop access to airports, to rivers, and to one another. That is the reason we are still battling to protect the rights that were created under Revised Statute 2477. But, Mr. President, there are no surveys of the national parks or the wildlife refuges in Alaska. There were none in 1976, except possibly for the area right near a mining claim. To assert that there are 900,000 miles of section line highway potentials in Alaska across national parks is absolutely a lie. It is time that the people who continue to assert that admit it. I hope that the National Parks Association will have the courtesy and the courage that the Wilderness Society did when it withdrew its false statement about our land. 
Section lines are created only by surveys. Surveys of section lines could lead to highways if the State claimed the right when they go across Federal lands. But the basic concept is there are no surveys. There will be no surveys of the lands that remain in Federal ownership. The surveys that are taking place in Alaska are the surveys to take out of Federal ownership the lands that were granted to the State, or to the Native people of Alaska by acts of Congress. 
That is what this chart shows. It shows the land ownership of Alaska in 1992. The blue land is patented to the State. The orange land is land that is awaiting patents that have been selected by the State. The green land is all Federal conservation areas set aside by an act of Congress. They will not be surveyed. They are, in fact, the national parks and wildlife refuges. The pink land that is shown is the land that Congress has returned to our Native people based upon the land claims settlement of 1971. But for anyone to assert that it is possible to create 900,000 miles of roads across parks and withdrawn areas on section lines is just absolutely false. 
Mr. President, we have, as I said, about 10,000 miles of surveyed section lines in Alaska--in an area one-fifth the size of the United States--in 1976. But, again, for Alaska, the rights that are preserved under Federal law are mostly those that occurred when they were created prior to 1969 when the Secretary of the Interior withdrew the whole State. That was done by the Secretary of Interior, Mr. Udall. And it was, in effect, in order to protect the rights of the Alaska Native people until we passed the Land Claims Settlement Act. 
But there is no question about it. None of the lands that these people are talking about--the parks, the wildlife refuges, and the wilderness areas--are surveyed and, therefore, there will be no 900,000 miles of section line rights-of-way. 
It is an interesting thing to see. There are assertions coming even now from the Department of the Interior, based upon these claims, I take it, of the National Parks Association, that there are 160,000 miles of section lines and national parks. There are none, Mr. President if they were never surveyed. You can't have a section line until it is surveyed. You can draw hypothetical lines on a map like they did here. This map was issued by the Department of Natural Resources of our State. It is what we call a protraction. But a protraction doesn't create section lines, and section lines are absolutely required to have a section line right-of-way claimed by the State. 
Mr. President, we did a little research. This might interest the Senate to know that of all the Federal aid highways in the whole United States there are about 900,000 miles today. 
These people in their press releases and in their reports to the American people through the Associated Press claim that this Senator was trying to create in one State in national parks and wildlife refuges and other withdrawn areas the same amount of roads that exist for the whole United States that had Federal aid. By definition, Mr. President, all roads in Alaska are built with Federal aid. They cost a lot of money to build. The roads in Alaska are very expensive. It costs $6 million a mile to build roads in Alaska, and we only build them when we come within the 
scope of the Federal aid highway system. 
We have less than 700,000 people in Alaska. No one I have ever known has ever come to me and said we want almost a million miles in this State; that we want to get more miles of Federal aid roads built in this State on section lines than exist in all the rest of the United States. That is absolutely such a wild claim that I can't find, really, the words to answer it, except that it does disturb me a great deal, as may be obvious and was obvious the other day, I am sure. 
We will not have section lines across Federal lands. By definition, Federal lands had to be unreserved at the time of the establishment of the R.S. 2477 claim. As I indicated, in 1969 all of these lands in our State that were Federal lands were withdrawn. No claim could be made against them. The basic law under which claims could be made was repealed in 1976. But because of the withdrawal of our land, none of the claims we can assert--and there can be private rights-of-way, not section lines right-of-way, but rights of way established by public use asserted by interested private citizens--across Federal lands where they were perfected before there was a withdrawal. 
Mr. President, the great problem that we have in Alaska is this checkerboard land ownership. I urge the Senate to consider this. In our State, we have State lands, Federal lands, Native lands, and private lands in such a checkerboard pattern that literally in order for some of the State lands to be accessed, it is absolutely necessary to go across Federal lands. But we are not trying to access that land by sections lines to go through withdrawn areas that were withdrawn for national parks. There may be some private citizens asserting R.S. 2466 rights there by use. I think that the Department of the Interior is cataloging those now. I know our State is. And we are going to have some disputes over what extent we can have that access. 
But I would ask anyone, look at that map. That is the total road system of Alaska today. There is no access by road to any of those 270 villages. They can only be accessed by air. It is true that in some of these areas we are trying to establish roads between the villages so we can have one airport serving four villages instead of one airport per village. But we are not talking about going through the national parks with section lines. We are not talking about going through areas that were already reserved on section lines, because according to Bureau of Land Management, there are no section lines. 
Mr. President, I don't know how to deal with issues like this and represent my State without coming here and once again urging that the people involved do some basic research. We have now a Federal judge, Judge Sedwick, who years ago wrote an article about the issue of rights-of-way. I want to put it in the Record today, and will read his conclusions. 
Mr. President, this is an issue that is going to perplex our State. Again, Mr. President, we have only been a State since 1959. We were a State only 10 years before the whole thing was withdrawn, and no rights could be created until Congress acted. Congress acted in 1971 in the Alaska Native Claim Settlement Act, and then in 1980 on the Alaska National Interest Conservation Lands Act. After that, the rights of the State and Natives could be perfected. We had to wait until 1980 to proceed to get the lands that were awarded to us by Congress in 1958 and awarded the Native people of our State in 1971. The reason we did was because the withdrawal, as I said, was made by Secretary Udall. All Federal lands were withdrawn. As a consequence, the whole subject of where we can build roads to improve the quality of life of our rural people is a very, very intriguing one, but a difficult one for us. 
We want to have the roads that will help us get better health care, that will get better education for people who live in rural areas, that will get better communications, particularly to try to see if we can't find a way to deal with the delivery of mail and other packages by some sort of road connection. 
This is an unpublished manuscript, but I want to put it in the Record. 
This is Mr. Sedwick. He was then an attorney. John Sedwick was an attorney practicing law, and he was chairman of the Alaska Bar Association's environmental law section. He is a recognized environmental lawyer, a very good lawyer, and a very good judge. This is his summary. I want to read it into the Record:

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am going to make a rather technical statement here now about this amendment, and I hope Senators will listen to it. I will put a chart in the Record and put that chart on everyone's desk. 
Last night I served notice that we are not going to permit this amendment to take the whole time today. We are going to finish this bill today. And as soon as a reasonable amount of debate has taken place, I intend to move to table this amendment. If we are going to finish here tonight in the time that both leaders have urged us to do--it is a matter of courtesy. 
If the Senate will remember, last week at this time we finished a bill in time for our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to attend an annual meeting together. Ours starts tonight--early tomorrow morning really. But we are going to finish this bill tonight. 
This is one of the amendments that could be debated all day. We took over a day when we debated this matter last year. So let me just state this. And I know the Senator from New Mexico wants to add to what I have to say. And I shall urge him to interrupt me at any time he wants to do so, but without my losing my right to the floor. 
I understand the interest of the Senator from the State of Virginia in offering the amendment today to the supplemental. It is a nonemergency transportation title to the supplemental appropriations bill before us. I want to make sure that he and the Senator from Florida and the Senate know how this additional funding became part of the supplemental appropriations bill. 
The matter arises out of a Treasury Department error made in 1994 which was finally corrected last year in recording the gas tax receipts from the States for the fiscal year 1994. The Treasury initially misallocated $1.6 billion to 1995, which should have been credited to 1994. In turn, that created a distribution of obligation limitations to the States for 1997 that was in error. We did not make that error. The Treasury Department made that error. 
When that error was discovered, to the credit of the Senator from New Mexico--the administration originally indicated that they lacked the statutory authority to correct the distribution. Eventually, the administration was persuaded that it did have in fact the authority to make the change but only after the Senate had a very divisive vote on this issue, as the Senate will recall. 
Accordingly, the fiscal year 1998 budget request from the President requests $318 million for 24 States to fulfill the erroneous expectations that were generated by publishing the 1997 obligation limitation allocation to the States. Again, let me say the President wants to fulfill the erroneous expectations based on the Treasury Department error. 
What we did in Appropriations was provide the $318 million requested by the administration. Then we provided the $139 million that the Senator's amendment from the State of Virginia references. This is the additional obligational authority that results from a correction in the 1994 account stemming from the same Treasury error. The additional $139 million in funds go to only 10 States. 
Finally, we provided an additional $475 million to make whole the 29 States whose 1997 apportionment of obligation limitation was below the 1996 apportionment bringing them back up to their 1996 level. 
The chart I placed on every Member's desk from the Highway Administration shows that the only winners from 1996 to 1997, were in fact the so-called donor States. 
What the Senator from Virginia's amendment would do is to 
further increase the obligation limitation for the donor States, and push the 27 States back below their 1996 apportionment level. What the Senator's amendment will do, in part, is validate the error made by the Treasury Department. 
From 1997 to 1998 there is a $1.358 billion increase in the obligation limitation for highway funds. And every single penny of that increase goes to the donor States. Every nondonor State is effectively frozen at their 1996 level by the supplemental approach and would be pushed below that level by the Senator's amendment. 
Some would argue that in a growing program no State should be expected to receive less than it received in the prior year. What the amendment before us now argues, that the $1.358 billion increase for a minority of States is not enough, that other States' programs should shrink so these so-called donor State programs can grow at even faster rates based upon an error that is now admitted by the Treasury Department. 
That is hard for this Senator to understand. And it is impossible for this Senator individually or as chairman of the Appropriations Committee to support. 
In short, we have provided an almost $1 billion increase in the obligation limitation. It is roughly split between donor and nondonor States. It is, in my opinion, a fair and equitable approach based upon the calculations by the Federal Highway Administration, and it is something that I support personally as well as support by virtue of being the chairman of the committee bringing this report before the Senate. 
By comparison, the amendment before us of the Senator from Virginia would have the $139 million for the 10 States paid out, and then the balance of the $933 million go through the formula, an approach which would leave 27 States below their 1996 obligation levels. Now, to bring the 50 States up to their 1996 obligation levels through the formula, it takes a $2.4 billion increase in obligation limitations. 
Now, I have to say, as a Senator that represents the largest State of the Union, my heart is heavy right now about the arguments we had yesterday, and I intend to say more about that today. But my State is the largest State in the Union, and if every State is supposed to get back the specific percentage of taxes, user fees and royalties paid into the highway fund, my State would like to get back all of the Federal taxes and royalties paid by producers of oil from our State. 
This donor-donee-State business leaves us cold. Just think where we would be if every decision made by our Founding Fathers had been held to the test of whether their individual States received the precise percentage of revenue from every source that it paid into the Treasury. There would have been no expansion of the United States. The debate over donor-donee diverts the Congress from the real issue of the highway program. The Eisenhower vision was a national network of highways and then a network of superhighways. People ought to read Eisenhower's book. As a young colonel he tried to take a brigade across the country, as I am sure the occupant of the chair knows, and found he could not get there from here. He had to keep going up and down rivers to find places to go across, and the highways were not connected. Eisenhower's commitment, really, in running for President was to link this country together with a highway system, and he succeeded. 
Now, this vision could never have been achieved on a donor-donee concept. The Federal highway system would not exist if such a concept had been controlling in President Eisenhower's time. People would not be driving through Texas or Virginia unless there were, in fact, highways paid for by revenue collected from other States. 
We need to get back to the idea that the highway system is to tie the country together and to provide the infrastructure that makes America more competitive in international markets. It reduces congestion, it makes trips on our highways more safe, and it provides the necessary investment for transportation infrastructure to foster economic growth in this country. 
Mr. President, in short, the donor-donee theory has the potential to destroy the promise of the national highway system. Further, the philosophy that drive the donor-donee debate will lead many of us to come back and tell Congress, what about the money we paid into the Treasury from which we received no benefit, none at all, those of us who come from the States that produce the oil that provided the feedstocks to make the gasoline that fuels our automobiles? 
Now, we produce 25 percent of that in one State. Twenty-five percent of all the domestic production comes from Alaska. We have never said give us back every dime we paid, that the oil industry pays, into the Treasury on that oil. 
I say to my friend from Virginia I could not be more insistent. Again, I ask the Senators to look at the chart I have provided. The donor-donee theory leads to winners and losers. Our bill leads to equity. It corrects the error of the Treasury Department and it restores the 1996 levels to all States. It does 
so fairly, while at the same time giving the donor States what the President has requested, and more, to both fulfill the erroneous decision of the Treasury Department and to correct the accounting error. 
I want to ask my friend from New Mexico, Mr. President, if he has any corrections to make to the statement I just made.

Mr. STEVENS. I say to the Senator, we made a commitment last night that we would move to table this amendment sometime around 9:30. We were not specific. If we are to get to the other portions of this bill, including the Senators from Texas, from Arizona, the Senator from Nevada, if we are going to get through those long amendments that pertain to items in the bill concerning money and legislation, we are going to have to get some time limit on amendments. I am serving notice as chairman that when I believe we have reached the point of having equitable distribution of comments on this subject, I am going to move to table it, and I am going to do the same thing with other amendments today until we get to the point where some of them will have to have up-or-down votes. 
As far as I am concerned, this is an amendment that seeks unfairness, and I shall seek to table it at the appropriate time. I yield the floor.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we provided $318 million as requested by the administration. The $139 million that the Senator from Virginia references was to correct the basic error. The additional $475 million was to make whole the States in 1997 whose obligation limitation was under the 1996 level to bring it to what it was in 1996. 
So there are two functions to the error. As far as the 1997 levels, the $475 million, it is not involved. That is to bring up their apportionment, bring them back up to the 1996 level. The $475 million makes the 29 States whose obligation limit was below their 1996 appropriation--it brings them up to the 1996 level in 1997.

Mr. STEVENS. That is not so. The $475 million is tied to the $318 million. If we grant the administration's requested $318 million, we must put in the $475 million. The $139 million is to correct totally for the original error. The $318 million asked for by the administration effectively perpetuates the error unless we put in the $475 million to equate the $318 million. It is 2 years. We are correcting the 1996 allocation on the $139 million. We are correcting the 1997 allocation based on $318 million requested by the administration and by the $475 million to provide that no State receive less in 1997 than they did in 1996. The $475 million goes with the $318 million.

Mr. STEVENS. The administration only requested $318 million. It did not request $139 million or $475 million. It requested $318 million. But if we grant the $318 million, we must put in the $475 million, and as long as we do it we must correct the basic error, the $139 million that came from the original error of the Treasury Department, but we will perpetuate the error of the Treasury Department by providing the $318 million unless we provide the $475 million.

<TEXT>
Mr. STEVENS. As the chairman of the Public Works Committee, Senator Chafee, points out in his statement, in July of last year they tried to correct this error from the Treasury Department. 
The Senator from Virginia, if he looks at the chart before the Senate, will see that if we make the changes solely requested by the Senator from Virginia, all donor states would end up with all zero growth from 1996 to 1997. All those zeros in the first column show the inequity of not doing the $475 million. Because the inequity, if we provide $318 million to one part of this package without the $475 million, would create a total inequity as far as all those States that have no growth in their allocation over 1996. I am referring to all those States that have zeros in the first column. If the Senator would look at it, he will see why we felt compelled, if we grant the President's request of $318 million, to provide the $475 million. No one argues about the $139 million even though it was not requested by the administration. I do not think there is an argument about the $139 million. It was a result of the Treasury error. To perpetuate the error is to grant the $318 million the President requested without adding the $475 million.

Senator Thurmond, 4 minutes; Senator Hutchinson, 5 minutes; Senator Warner, 3 minutes; 5 minutes to the Senator from Florida; 5 minutes to Senator Lautenberg; and Senator Bingaman wants 4 minutes. I would like 1 minute to close. 
Do we have those written down? I will repeat it. Five minutes to Senator Hutchinson; 4 minutes to Senator Thurmond; 3 minutes to Senator Warner; 1 minute to Senator Domenici; 5 minutes to Senator Lautenberg; 4 minutes to Senator Bingaman; 5 minutes to Senator Graham; and 1 minute to me as we close:

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia wanted to change the law. The President wanted to change the law with the $318 million. If the Senator wants to delete the $318 million, the $475 million would come out. But the $139 million that the President did not request is the one that is to correct the error. The moneys we have added to what the President requests is to make it fair and to correct the impact of the underlying Treasury error. 
I say again, we have used the 1996 formula. The President's request would be an $318 million addition for a few States based primarily on one category of the 1996 formula. We equalize that 
with what we have done. I do not say we have changed the thrust of the law. We have changed in terms of the formula.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I reject that suggestion. As the Senator knows, the change is required for the $139 million that he is proposing. We are working from a 1996 base, and that is what we are equalizing. 
This is a growing program. Why should some States be less than they were in 1996, while other States grow at such a rate they are far in excess of 1996? 
Again, I have been trying to read what the Senator from Rhode Island, the chairman of the Public Works Committee, said in the statements before the Senate. 
The additional funds provided by the Appropriations Committee hardly give an unfair advantage to 29 States. In fact, the only States that actually receive additional funds in 1997, when compared to 1996, are the so-called donor States that are offering the amendment that is before us today. Mr. President, this is an issue that, in my opinion was resolved after the administration initially fixed its error last December. Unfortunately, the administration has reopened this complicated issue. The Appropriations Committee has developed a fair solution to a difficult problem, and they should be congratulated. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and support the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. 
I yield the remainder of my time. I yield the remainder my time. I move to table the amendment. 
I ask for the yeas and nays.

<TEXT>
Mr. STEVENS. I urge the Parliamentarian to compute it before I finish here because I think Senators ought to know. 
We, I hope, will finish this bill under the original cloture period. 
Senator Byrd, from West Virginia, will be recognized under the agreement we entered into last evening to complete the statements on his amendment to delete the CR provision in the bill. 
After that, Senator Reid's amendment is the pending business. It is our intention to go to Senator Reid's amendment. There is an agreement on that. 
Following that amendment, Senator Gramm, who has a series of amendments, has asked to bring up one of his amendments. And it is my hope that the Chair will recognize him after that. 
I urge Senators to come forward now and tell us what they are going to bring up. If I am correct, the time under cloture expires before 6 p.m. tonight. It is my feeling we should finish in that original period. That will mean that we will have to shorten the time on every amendment that comes up and seek an opportunity to vote, if there is going to be a vote, within a reasonable period of time. 
So, Mr. President, I want to announce, as chairman, once an amendment is called up and a statement is made in support of it, I will seek the floor to table that amendment. But I hope to seek from each Member a reasonable period of time for any Member who wants to speak on the pending amendment. I urge Senators to limit their time so we can finish by 6 o'clock. 
Has the Parliamentarian come close to an estimate?

Then we would proceed, by agreement, I hope, to raise every amendment that a Senator wishes to raise within the time limit that is left under the cloture period.

Again, this is a consistent pattern. I hope the Senate will realize the person who offers an amendment will be allowed to make the statement that he or she wishes to make, and after that time we will seek to limit the time for any further comment on the

I urge the Senator to find some way to get an agreement that we can limit--even if we limit each side to 45 minutes now. There has been almost 2 hours spent on it so far. I think that would be quite fair. 
Is it possible we could get such an agreement to limit each side to 45 minutes and allocate the time on each side, you being in control of one side and I be in controlling on this side?

Mr. President, let me apologize to the Senator from South Dakota. I did commit to the Senator from Minnesota that I would yield to him 6 minutes at this time.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I announce that after this vote is completed, we will announce the schedule for the remainder of the afternoon to the extent we have some agreements already. We do have some very good agreements for the Senate to consider. Following this amendment, it will be my intention to move to the pending amendment, which is the Reid amendment. There will be a process to take that to a very rapid conclusion. We are pleased to announce there is an agreement on the endangered species amendment. 
Mr. President, my one comment at this time would be that Members should keep in mind that we are finishing today, but the House has not acted yet. There will be a procedure so that when the House sends over its bill, we will automatically substitute our bill for that bill and go to conference with the House as soon as possible. But I do want to thank Senators for what they have done so far. We are, I think, moving on schedule. We do have agreements on at least five amendments that are ready to be considered by the Senate, as far as timeframes, for the balance of the amendments. And there is one left to be determined how long that will take. 
At this time I move to table the Byrd amendment. 
Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

Let me state that we will proceed with the ESA amendment, the Reid amendment, now. There is an agreement to dispose of that. Then we will go to the amendment of Senator Gramm of Texas, No. 118. And after that we have several small amendments, about 10 minutes to a side. 
I would predict we will have a vote in about an hour and 10 to 20 minutes. And that will be on the amendment of the Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm]. 
I now ask unanimous consent that when the Senate now takes up the pending business, which is the Reid amendment--that is correct, is it not?

<DOCNO>105-stevens-ak-128-19970508</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regret to say I shall move to table this amendment, and I want to point out the problem we have. 
If we cut 1.9 percent off the original 1997 nondefense appropriations at this time, it will be a 5-percent reduction on the amount that is available for the rest of the year. For agencies such as the Veterans Administration, Department of Education, the Coast Guard and many others, that would be devastating in this final period of this year, the final one-third of this year. 
I do share the concern--I think I have demonstrated that --of balancing the budget. On the other hand, I remember too well one of the greatest earthquakes that has occurred since we started recording earthquakes, the second largest, apparently, in the history of the United States, in my State. We also had a flood that was so large it engulfed almost the whole interior of Alaska, around Fairbanks, for miles. I know what these people are going through. 
Much of the mismatch in this situation comes from the scoring process under the budget; not from how money is spent, but how it is scored. For instance, I have managed the defense bill substantially now over the past years. When we originally get budget authority for defense, it has 100-percent outlays. If we rescind that now, with a quarter of the year left--it will be effective for the last quarter of the year--we get a 25-percent outlay cut. The authority is for a year. If we start spending it the 1st of October, there would be 100 percent. If we can rescind it the 1st of October, and this is what the Senator from New Mexico was saying, if we can rescind it in the budget authority at the beginning of the year and not spend through the whole year, we get 100-percent credit. When we rescind it now and it becomes effective in the last quarter of the year, we get 25 percent. 
This is really a great way to shrink Government. All you have to do is pray for the largest disaster in history and you cut the Government in half. There is no sense being proposed, from the point of view of the disaster victims. It may make theoretical sense. We have cancelled enough budget authority--we deal with budget authority, and the scoring says you only get 25 percent, because if you start spending this money in the beginning, you spend 100 percent; if you have not spent it so far and if you start spending it now, you only get 25 percent. The Senator goes further, though. He carries it into the next year and succeeding years. 
We have done our best to try and mitigate the budgetary impact. For the first time, I cannot remember a disaster bill where we tried our best to mitigate by offsets, but we have. We have offset budget authority. It is not possible at this time of the year to offset enough so that we can get it all accounted for this year. The Senator from Texas says, `Well, then go into next year.' We are already fighting--as a matter of fact, the fight is going on in this very building--over what the budget agreement means in terms of next year and succeeding years in terms of outlays and budget authority. 
I tell the Senate very simply, until we work out a better way to deal with disaster relief--incidentally, I concur with the Senator from New Mexico who said we have done this in this bill. We have money here that anticipates there are going to be more disasters during the balance of this year, and we have put it up and we have offset that money. 
There will be disasters, Mr. President, unfortunately, in the balance of this year. I mentioned the earthquake that we had. The earthquake that started somewhere down in the Tennessee area and came up the valley, came up the fault, was so great in the 1850's that when that earthquake occurred, the bells rang in churches in Boston. If that fault goes at this time in our lifetime, Mr. President, the cost will be so staggering that you cannot imagine the cost, or the cost of a San Francisco earthquake. 
That is what the Senator from New Mexico asked: How large does a disaster have to be before it is an emergency? We will do our best to prepare for emergencies, and if we can work out a different approach on the scoring so it makes more sense from the point of view of the budget, I am perfectly willing to work with anybody to do it. 
We did not appropriate any money unless we thought it was 
absolutely necessary and justified. We had a bipartisan review. We had everyone critique these bills. We had many amendments suggested, a few on this floor this week, but we have not heard many money arguments. 
The Senator from Texas is raising a money argument. We have not had debates about the money because people know the money in this bill has been gone over and over and over, and it is justified. I say we have done our best. We set a new precedent. We set the precedent that even disaster money will be offset to the extent it is possible to find budget authority to do so, and the outlay scoring is a secondary question. That is all we ask for the emergency part that is authorized under the Budget Act. We are authorized to ask for a total emergency waiver of the Budget Act. All we have asked for is a waiver of the scoring impact of outlays, and that will give us the money that we need to proceed to meet these disasters. 
Mr. President, I do believe it is an absolutely essential bill. Again, I point out, though, my last comment, I hope we are not accused, again, of somehow or another delaying the money. There is over $2 billion down there in the executive branch right now that is being obligated. I am told if they obligate everything they can, they will not obligate all that in the balance of the year. There may be a deficit of about $250 million if they do everything they can possibly do between now and the end of September. It will be about $2 billion. 
The Senator is right to think about when the money is going to be spent. It is going to be spent over the years to come. But that is the way you recover from disasters: You put the money up, obligate it, and it, in fact, will be spent over a period of years. Hopefully, those areas will be strong again and they will recover, as our State has recovered from the great earthquake that happened in 1964.

Mr. STEVENS. If the Senators will bear with us, I think we will start a vote at about 20 minutes of 6 o'clock. 
Let me first take care of the housekeeping problem. I ask unanimous consent after the Senate votes on the question of advancing S. 672 to third reading, it be held at the desk, and that when the Senate receives H.R. 1469, the Fiscal Year 1997 Supplemental Appropriations and Rescissions Act from the House, the Senate proceed immediately to its consideration, that the text of S. 627 as amended by the Senate be adopted as a substitute for the House text, that the House bill as amended be read for a third time and passed, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, that the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees, that motions to reconsider the votes on the preceding action be tabled, and that all the above mentioned actions take place without any intervening action or debate. 
Let me explain. That means in a few minutes we will vote on advancing this bill to third reading. That, in effect, will be the final vote by the Senate on this bill. There are people that asked for a final vote. This is the way to do it. The House has not acted on the bill. We have done this before. It has been cleared with both sides. 
I repeat my request for unanimous consent.

Unfortunately, we cannot pass it yet because of the tradition of the Senate awaiting passage by the House of appropriations bills. It is a tradition that we have honored and I seek to honor it again now. 
I thank all of those who have helped us.

We have had 30 years of the Wilderness Act under Revised Statute 2477 and there has been no complaint at all. 
Last fall, we put in the appropriations bill for the Interior Department this section: 
No final rule or regulation of any agency of the Federal Government pertaining to recognition, management, or validity of a right-of-way pursuant to Revised Statute 2477 shall take effect, unless expressly authorized by an act of Congress subsequent to enactment of the date of this act. 
That was agreed to by the administration. The President signed that bill. It came about after negotiation with the President, as a matter of fact. 
Now, by edict, the Secretary of the Interior has determined a new policy will go into effect and he will make property laws for the Federal Government establishing how rights-of-way are created on Federal lands throughout the West. It should not happen.

<TEXT>
Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, the amendment that Senator Hollings has presented is acceptable, and I am pleased to cosponsor it. It is a provision that I put in the bill, or I offered as an amendment to the bill when it was in committee. 
A full count of the population for the purpose of apportioning seats in the House of Representatives is required by the Constitution. Article I calls for an `actual Enumeration * * *' and section 2 of the 14th amendment reads: `Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State * * *'. Title 13 U.S.C. section 195 states: `Except for the determination of population for purposes of apportionment of Representatives in Congress among the several States, the Secretary shall, if he considers it feasible, authorize the use of the statistical method known as `sampling' in carrying out the provisions of this title.' 
When the Secretary of Commerce declined to approve a statistical adjustment to the 1990 census, at least 50 law suits were filed. The Supreme Court upheld the Secretary's decision in one of these cases, Wisconsin versus City of New York. The Court held that the Constitution `vests Congress with virtually unlimited discretion in conducting the `actual Enumeration' * * * Through the Census Act, 13 U.S.C. section 141(a), Congress has delegated its broad authority over the census to the Secretary.' The Court noted that the adjustment being recommended to the Secretary in 1990 differed from other statistical adjustments used in 1970 and 1980 because it `would have been the first time in history that the States' apportionment was based upon counts in other States.' 
If a sample is employed for the 2000 census, endless litigation challenging the constitutionality of using this technique is likely. By directing the Census Bureau today to employ a full count, we are giving the Bureau sufficient time to redirect their efforts before 2000. The additional cost of a full count is estimated to be $400 million. The increase is bound to be less than the Government's cost of defending against lawsuits which will result from using a sample. 
There is also an issue of fairness. The Census Bureau will get a 90-percent count of a census tract and use sampling to determine the remaining 10 percent of the population in that census tract. An estimation does not seem to be a fair way of determining the population. 
The Census Bureau has claimed a full count of the population without sampling will cost an additional $400 million. As soon as this amendment prohibiting the use of sampling appeared, the cost went up to $1 billion. 
I have reviewed the most recent Census Bureau cost sheet, and it seems to me the Census Bureau can do a full count well within the range of $400 to 500 million. Any attempt to claim it will cost a billion dollars is a red herring to deflect attention away from the real issue, and that is the constitutionality of conducting the count by sampling. 
The cost of the census should not be an issue. Under the Constitution, Congress has the duty to direct an `actual Enumeration' of the American public for purposes of apportionment. When carrying out our constitutional responsibilities, cost is immaterial. 
In 2000, The Census Bureau wants to estimate 10 percent of the population of this country. In 2010, the Census Bureau may want to estimate 30 percent of the population. The Census Bureau claims sampling will solve the problem of undercounting. It is difficult for me to accept that an estimation will ensure everyone is counted. 
Concern about not counting all Americans is not a new issue. Then-Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson was in charge of the first U.S. census in 1790, and he was gravely concerned that there had been an undercount. 
The Census Bureau, in an effort to devise new techniques to ensure the most complete count possible, has determined that conducting a sample of nonrespondent citizens on a census tract level is the most effective means of achieving numerical accuracy. Which is more important? Numerical accuracy or distributive accuracy? 
On March 20, 1996, the Supreme Court held that distributive accuracy was more important than numerical accuracy in deciding Wisconsin versus City of New York. In this case, the Court upheld the Secretary of Commerce's decision not to approve statistical adjustment to the 1990 Census. The Census Bureau plans to sample in each census tract across the nation. They plan to estimate who lives in a neighborhood or village based on a sample. 
The Census Bureau claims the language in this bill as reported from committee will require them to send a long form to all households. 
The Census Bureau says sending a long form to one out of every six households is a sample, and thus the language in this bill would require them to send the long form to all homes. The language in this bill was not intended to prohibit the Census Bureau from using the short form. I would have no objection to amending the language to ensure the Census Bureau can continue to use the long and short forms. 
The question arose: what would happen to a census form that was mailed in late, after the Bureau had begun a post-census sampling process? The original answer was that the late response would be discarded because it would interfere with the sample established by the Census Bureau. Since the actual enumeration of citizens has a long and venerable history, this answer was a shocker. 
The Bureau now says that a late response will be counted, even if it came from a household that was not in the followup sample area. They admit this will complicate the estimation process. Obviously the inconvenient appearance of a real person's response does damage to a theoretical sampling construction. 
The Governmental Affairs Committee has held two hearings on the plans for Census 2000, including one exclusively on the legal and statistical propriety of using sampling. There are many troubling questions about the Census Bureau's plan to implement sampling techniques in the next census. 
The problem of undercounting in the cities has been a problem, and the Bureau says sampling will help correct this undercount. But what about the problem of undercounting in rural areas? Does the Census Bureau really know what it doesn't know? We are asking to take the remainder of this year to scrutinize the Census Bureau's plans for the next census, and particularly their plans to use sampling techniques. 
Sampling could well be inaccurate, illegal, or unconstitutional. Congress must decide whether sampling is consistent with the Constitution's requirement that the census should be an `actual Enumeration' of the American public for the purpose of providing a basis for apportioning Congressional representation among the States. 
In the 1990 census, the Bureau made extensive efforts to reduce the undercount of actual persons. It sought out `traditionally undercounted populations' and expanded assistance for non-English-speaking residents. But there was no plan to create hypothetical respondents, although there was an effort to statistically adjust the total. This adjustment was ultimately rejected by the Secretary of Commerce. 
That is the problem now. The sampling would be the basis for an educated guess under the proposal that was presented to us. I am pleased to see the text has been modified so what we are concentrating on is the constitutional requirement to enumerate the population for the next census, and on that basis, I support the amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, we have five amendments that, as soon as Senator Feingold has presented his position on one amendment, we will be able to handle by consent. 
I urge Senators to come to the floor to see if we can work out these amendments. We still have some 26 eligible amendments. When I am able to confer with the Senator from West Virginia, I do want to announce a policy with regard to amendments that the Parliamentarian has indicated are not in order under cloture. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the original amendment would prohibit the expenditure of funds after September 30, 1997. There are no funds in the bill for defense to be spent after September 30, 1997. The amendment of the Senator from Texas would prohibit spending funds after June 30, 1998. No funds in the bill will be expended after June 30, 1998. So the amendments take on an image perspective, from the point of view of this Senator. I am certainly not going to oppose them on that point. But I emphasize that they are just a statement of policy. It amounts to a sense-of-the-Congress position about the expenditure of funds. They would not be a barrier to the expenditure of funds under the circumstances of this bill.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment deals with Delaware and Susquehanna River Basin Commissions. It was offered by Senators Biden, Reid, and Roth. It would direct the Secretary of the Interior to provide compensation to the Federal representative to the Delaware and the Susquehanna River Basin Commissions, without indicating who that individual would be. 
The second-degree amendment makes the Secretary of the Interior, or his designee, the representative. It does not provide for compensation above that otherwise earned by that employee of the Department of the Interior. I trust that both amendments will be before the Senate at the same time. The second one is amendment No. 224.

I want to state to the Senate the amendments that have been filed touch or concern every one of our 13 subcommittees.

I ask the Chair to help us keep order. We would anticipate, for the information of the Senate, with the concurrence of the two leaders, that we would proceed with the D'Amato amendment and then the Bumpers amendment and, if possible, another amendment and have our first series of stacked votes sometime around 12:30 to 1 o'clock. 
We will keep the Senate informed, but I do want the Senate to know we will try to stack votes so that none will occur prior to approximately 12:30 to 1 o'clock.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I hope all Members understand, however, we are entirely in agreement with statements made so far concerning these legal immigrants who will be covered by this procedure. Hopefully, pursuant to the budget agreement, we will continue a policy of caring for people who are here legally now. 
But I hope everyone, including the Immigration Service, is on notice it applies to those who are here now. In the future, I hope that we will enforce the commitment made by those who sponsor legal immigrants to maintain those people that they sponsor in the event they become indigent and cannot support themselves. That is the commitment that we must see carried forward once again in our basic law of protecting immigration. 
Again, it is my desire at this time, Mr. President, to ask the Senate to set aside the D'Amato amendment. This amendment and the Bumpers amendment will be voted upon sometime before 1 o'clock today. That is our hope. There may be further proceedings with regard to the D'Amato amendment. I do not want to jeopardize them. But I do ask unanimous consent that we temporarily set aside the D'Amato amendment at this time so we may proceed with the Bumpers amendment.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have been involved in this issue now for a substantial portion of my life. I was in the Interior Department during the Eisenhower administration, 1955 to 1961. At the end of that period, I was the Solicitor of the Interior Department. During that period, we obtained statehood for Alaska. The whole question of what our rights would be as a State was debated at length, not only in the Congress but in the White House and the old Bureau of the Budget. 
The Revised Statute 2477 was the basis for really the modernization of the West. And when we came to the period of the seventies--and I was here as a Senator--when the proposal was made to repeal R.S. 2477 in 1974, I had a very long debate with Senator Haskell of Colorado at the time, and we subsequently did not pass the bill in that Congress. 
In 1976, when the rights-of-way bill was brought up again, we discussed at length the protections that would assure that the commitment that was being made to the Western States, in general, and Alaska, in particular, would be ironclad. So at my insistence, the 1976 act contained three specific statements. 
The first one is in section 701(a): 
Nothing in this Act, or in any amendment made by this Act, shall be construed as terminating any valid lease, permit, patent, right-of-way, or other land use right or authorization existing on the date of approval of this Act. 
Again in section 701(f): 
Nothing in this Act shall be deemed to repeal any existing law by implication. 
And in section 701(h): 
All actions by the Secretary concerned under this Act shall be subject to valid existing rights. 
Starting in 1993, the Secretary of Interior attempted to ignore all of those guarantees and say that as manager of the Federal lands, he has the inherent right to ignore that law and to issue regulations to change this concept, so that the valid existing rights will be determined by Federal law and not by State laws as they have for 130 years. There has never been, before this administration, any attempt to define the rights-of-way across Federal land by Federal law. They have been determined by the general law of each State, and ours are no exception in Alaska. 
But very clearly, we have three times now spoken here in the Congress to try and stop this move by the Secretary of the Interior and his Department to change this tradition. We did it in the National Highway System Designation Act, we did it in the Interior appropriations bill for 1996, and the Interior appropriations bill for 1997. Now, however, what we are trying to stop is his announcement of a policy which will govern all Federal lands. It is not regulation, it is a statement of policy now. Congress prohibited the use of funds, we prohibited the issuance of regulations, but now he says he is going to announce a policy, a new edict, and that is that there is a Federal law pertaining to rights-of-way and they will define that and it will not be based on State law at all. 
What we are talking about, as my colleague from Alaska has said and the Senators from Utah have said, is the process by which all of the West obtained the rights-of-way that ultimately became the road system of the West. 
In Alaska, because of our situation prior to statehood, the Federal Government built the highways when we were a territory, and it built one main road. It was really built for the aid of the war effort. The Alaska highway came up through Canada, and then came down through Alaska at our eastern border, and came to our major city of Anchorage. It came through Fairbanks and then down into the Anchorage area. That was one main road. Since then, we have built some arterials off that. We had a long time convincing the Congress that we were a State and we ought to have equal treatment under the National Highway Acts. Now we have that. 
Now we come to the period where this administration wants to assert, by virtue of Federal supremacy, a concept that, on over 100 million of acres of land that were reserved by the Congress in 1980--and, incidentally, they were specific in terms of recognizing valid existing rights at that time, too--now this administration wants to say none of these rights under the Revised Statute 2477 shall be recognized on Federal lands in Alaska, period. 
The Federal Government owns more than 68 percent of Alaska's land. As my colleague has pointed out, the State of Alaska is a checkerboard with Native land, Federal land, and State land and very little private land. But the right of access to the private land through the State land and the Native land is of necessity such that rights-of-way across some Federal lands are required if we are to have a road system to serve the State as a whole ultimately. 
This is not a simple question for Alaskans. What it really comes down to is a question of can we trust the Federal Government? We had a long debate here that went on for 3 years. The record is absolutely clear that the Congress, at that time, 
agreed that we had these rights and that they had to be protected if Revised Statute 2477 was to be repealed. I have to say, from 1976 to 1993, there was no question about it. But now, because of the onslaught of a direct mail advertising campaign by extreme environmental groups who have painted us as being the arch devils of management, they claim that we are trying to establish some new rights across Federal lands. By definition, none of the rights that could vest after 1976--they are all prior to 1976, and they were protected by Congress and they were across lands that were not reserved in 1976. 
I think the real problem here is the people who are doing this are unwilling to accept the decisions made by Congress. Every Congress has said we are not going to interfere with valid existing rights. Again, these rights are vital to a State such as ours. I really cannot deal with it without going back over a whole history of what has been done in our State. 
Let me say, our amendment is simple. It continues the same policy the Congress has voted on three times now, and it says this new policy concept of the Department of the Interior--not a regulation, not a rule, both of those were prohibited by past actions, not an order that was also prohibited--but this new concept of a policy, they can't do it in any way. If they want to do it, they can send up a proposal to Congress, let us debate it, and we will see what the law will be for the future, and we will see as a result of what they are doing if there is any compensation due to the people whose rights are condemned by Federal action. This is a way around the whole concept of trying to compensate people for the absolute extinguishment of rights that were created and protected by Congress through past actions. 
Some have suggested that almost a million new miles of roads and claims would be asserted by virtually anybody, anyone. Mr. President, I tire at trying to answer false statements like that. As my colleague has said, we have 18,000 miles of roads in an area one-fifth the size of the United States now. We can only build those roads with highway funds that are available, and at the cost of roads, it is just not possible for us to contemplate a million miles of road. We are not contemplating even doubling what we have now. We are contemplating just some small roads to connect various villages and communities that are near the road system that exists now, and even that will be over a period of years. 
This is a process that we believe that the Congress ought to recognize. We create no new rights-of-way across Federal land. We only recognize those that were in existence before 1976, and we preserve those rights once more on the same basis that they have been available throughout this country for 130 years based upon State law. The courts have asserted, past administrations have asserted--I don't know of anyone, as I said, in the past who has asserted that there was a Federal law that determined how rights-of-way were created across Federal land. 
There is the specific right-of-way concept where people are coming and asking permission to cross Federal land to build pipelines or build transmission lines for various uses of Federal land, and that is what the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Right-of-way Act was all about. 
But we believe that in terms of what we are doing now, I am told--I don't know if Senator Murkowski mentioned this--we asked the Department of Natural Resources of Alaska to tell us what rights-of-way might be capable of being asserted. There were 1,900 originally reviewed, and 700 were found to be on State land. Of the remaining 1,200, about 560 appeared to qualify as potential rights-of-way. The State deferred 400 of those because they crossed Federal withdrawals. That is to be looked at at a later time, and we are now proceeding with very few of them. I have been told that so far, we have used about 10 of these rights-of-way in the time that we have been a State, which is now almost 40 years. Mr. President, you don't use them until the highway system gets to the point where you can use them to extend it on out. So Congress protected those rights-of-way for the future so that when the highway system starts to expand, it will be possible to get to those communities. 
My last comment to the Senate will be this. My colleague and I labor here for land that is so far away that we are closer to Tokyo than we are to Washington, DC. We spend a great deal of our time trying to convince the Congress to keep the commitments that were made to us as we sought and fought for statehood because we wanted to be partners in the Union. 
Now it seems that people from other States are doing everything they can to turn us back into a federally dominated territory. That is why we are here on the floor. We wanted to be a State to protect our rights. That is our No. 1 duty, to see to it that the commitments made to our State are kept by the Federal Government. And it is very hard to do right now. It is very hard to do when there are people in the administration who want to just be those who dictate to our State. 
I cannot emphasize this enough to the Senate, this is not a new subject. We have done in this bill what we did three times before. We have acted to prevent the Secretary of the Interior continuing on this course of trying to change the law that guarantees the protection of valid existing rights under Revised Statute 2477. 
Mr. President, I mentioned my own background on this subject. But I have to say, one of the reasons that I am concerned about it is because, as a young lawyer in the Interior Department, I remember some of the fights that existed in the 17 Western States that had public lands before we became a State. This same battle took place before, but in different ways, where agencies of the Federal Government just tried to block the use of lands. But no one ever thought of creating a Federal rights system and taking unto themselves the power to determine what rights existed prior to that time. 
That is what the Department is trying to do now. They are trying to say, `Wait a minute. We're the managers of this land. All this land is still under our domination and, therefore, we're going to tell you how you cross this land.' 
The Department of the Interior has done something--I used to tell our people in the Interior Department when I was there: `We do not own this land, you and I. We are the stewards of this land. It's owned by the people of the United States.' But if you hear these people talk now in the Department of the Interior, it is their land. They own it. 
I have to tell you, Mr. President, it will be a cool day in Hades when Alaskans will allow them to do that. I hope that the Senate will stand by us in this battle, which is just a continuation of battles we have fought here on many other issues to protect our rights as a State. 
These rights ultimately will be used by the State of Alaska to build public highways. We do not have a county system. Our population base is small. We have a borough system, but basically the roads in Alaska are built by the State. So in our State the rights are basically protected by the State and the State nominates those areas where it wants to proceed to utilize the rights-of-way that were created prior to 1976. 
I do think, Mr. President, that if there is anything that I would like to leave with the Senate, it is that at some time or other every Senator is going to have to come out here and say, `In the days gone by, a compromise was reached regarding an issue in my State, and the decision was made and put into law.' 
All I want you to do is recognize an act of a prior Congress in committing the United States to a course of action that must be followed now if States rights are to mean anything. This is a basic States rights issue to me, to have the ability to provide the expansion of the transportation system to meet the growing needs of people in a frontier area. If the Senator's amendment is adopted, the Secretary of the Interior will be free to issue an edict that future rights in Alaska will be determined by the Secretary of the Interior. 
What does that do? It returns us back to 1958, to the territorial days. We would not be a State. No State is dominated by a Cabinet officer. We were as a territory. We had an Office of Territories in the Department of the Interior when I was at the Department of the Interior. And Alaska was one of the desks in the Office of Territories. That person carried all of the decisions of the Secretary of the Interior with regard to Alaska. As a matter of fact, Alaska used to call him the `Great White Father.' Well, there is not a Great White Father for Alaska now. There are 100 Senators here and 435 people over there who have something to do with making decisions regarding what happens to the rights of the people of the State of Alaska. 
I urge the Senate to stand by us and maintain the course, that we will live by the law and not by edicts of changing personnel in changing administrations as the years go by.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as I have already reviewed in some detail, section 2477 of the Revised Statutes, R.S. 2477, granted rights-of-way for the construction of public highways across unreserved Federal lands. 
Congress passed this law in 1866 and the provision was later recodified at section 932 of title 43 of the United States Code. 
By permitting travel across Federal lands, R.S. 2477 facilitated the settlement of the West. The rights-of-way granted pursuant to R.S. 2477 remain land access routes for rural residents. 
R.S. 2477 was repealed in 1976 by section 706 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act [FLPMA]. Again, I point out to my colleagues, section 701(a) of FLPMA expressly states that `Nothing in this Act * * * shall be construed as terminating any valid lease, permit, patent, right-of-way, or other land use right or authorization existing on the date of approval of this Act.' 
Further, section 701(f) says that nothing in FLPMA `shall be deemed to repeal any existing law by implication.' And section 701(h) specifically states that `All actions by the Secretary concerned under this Act shall be subject to valid existing rights.' 
Three times in the same act Congress made it clear that nothing in FLPMA gave the Secretary of the Interior the power to terminate valid existing rights. We meant it then and we mean it now. The Secretary is ignoring the law and all existing precedents with his proposed policy that effectively terminates valid existing rights under R.S. 2477, which for over 120 years have been determined under State law. 
Regulations in place in 1976 provided that the validity of the right-of-way should be determined by State law. Likewise, Federal courts have found State property laws control assertions of an R.S. 2477 right-of-way. 
In Alaska, which we still call the Last Frontier, R.S. 2477 rights of way are still 
being used by miners, trappers, and others traveling across specific tracts of unreserved public land. 
The Interior Department in the 1980's saw the need for the Federal Government to recognize these trails for what they were--public access routes. Interior adopted a policy in 1988 which for the most part kept Alaskans out of court. 
Elsewhere, Federal courts were being asked to quiet title on lands with an R.S. 2477 right of way, and these courts looked to State law to decide if there had been construction of a highway. 
In August 1994, Interior published new proposed regulations which would have established Federal definitions for key terms in R.S. 2477. According to Interior, where there was a conflict between the Federal definitions and State law, under the proposed regulations the Federal rules would prevail. 
This approach would have redefined existing property rights. It would also have the incongruous result of having some R.S. 2477 rights of way quiet title actions adjudicated under State law and others under Federal law. 
Soon after Interior proposed these new rules, resolutions were introduced in the House and Senate urging the Secretary to withdraw them. The comment period was subsequently extended through August 1995. 
In late 1995, Congress placed a 1-year moratorium on any rulemaking regarding R.S. 2477 rights of way. The fiscal year 1996 Interior appropriations law, enacted in 1996, also included a similar moratorium. 
Congress acted a second time in 1996. Section 108 of the General Provisions of the fiscal year 1997 Interior appropriations law permanently requires congressional authorization of any rules and regulations developed by agencies to address the recognition, validity, and management of R.S. 2477 rights of way. 
This measure, agreed to by Congress last fall, was not vetoed, nor was there ever a threat of veto that I was made aware of. 
However, in January 1997, the Secretary sought to evade this law by issuing `policy guidance' which provides a process for recognizing R.S. 2477 claims only `where there is a demonstrated, compelling, and immediate need.' This process is similar to that in the disputed regulations which Congress has prohibited by law since 1995. Issuance of this policy circumvents the legal requirement to have congressional approval of agency rulemaking concerning R.S. 2477 rights-of-way. 
Section 310 of the supplemental appropriations bill, S. 672, prohibits the use of funds appropriated for fiscal year 1997 and thereafter `to promulgate or implement any rule, regulation, policy, statement or directive' issued after October 1, 1993, regarding the rights-of-way Congress granted by R.S. 2477. The October 1, 1993, date makes it clear that Interior cannot do by policy what it by law cannot do by regulation. Under section 310, Interior can continue to implement Federal policy with respect to R.S. 2477, but only those policies and regulations previously agreed to prior to the attempted change that Congress has repeatedly rejected. 
Section 310 is needed to enforce the requirement that Congress first authorize any rules regarding R.S. 2477 rights-of-way. Allowing the January 1997 policy to remain in place vitiates the Administrative Procedures Act and the express directives of the Congress, which were approved by the President. 
Section 310 will not, as some suggest, open up Alaska's wilderness areas and parks to almost a million new miles of roads upon the assertion of claims by `virtually anyone.' 
First, as I have said, section 310 only tightens the standing mandate that agencies obtain specific authorization from Congress, which includes our elected representatives of public lands States, before issuing rules that would effectively deny valid, existing property rights under R.S. 2477 in those States. 
In short, this provision creates no new rights-of-way across Federal land which were not in existence before 1976. It merely preserves rights-of-way which were 
established at least 20 years ago, but still have not been recognized by the Interior Department. 
R.S. 2477 rights of way are not exempted from environmental, health and safety, and other laws to protect the public. 
Second, with respect to all existing rights of way, I am assured by the Governor of Alaska that our State will not be paved over. The Alaska Department of Natural Resources completed a study recently to identify the list of rights of ways my State might assert as public highways under R.S. 2477. 
Some 1,900 were initially reviewed, but 700 were found to be on State land and not subject to this Federal law. 
Of the remaining 1,200, only 558 appear to qualify as R.S. 2477 rights of way. 
So far the State of Alaska has filed only one quiet title action. 
The State of Alaska also advises me that it will not file rights of way across section lines, unless of course there is a preexisting trail that otherwise constitutes an R.S. 2477 right of way. 
Asserting rights of way across section lines alone would be a fruitless exercise. Mere geography tells us that we don't need roads across mountain tops. 
Cost is another reason. I'm advised that it costs $6 million to build 1 mile of road in my State. 
I proposed section 310's funding restrictions in good faith, with the confidence of having stood on this floor over 20 years ago debating the legislation that ultimately became FLPMA. 
On July 8, 1974, the Senate debated S. 424, the bill that the Senate passed in the 93d Congress and was reintroduced in the 94th Congress as S. 507. S. 507 was the bill that ultimately became FLPMA. 
In July 1974, I was assured by Senator Haskell, chairman of the relevant subcommittee within Interior and Insular Affairs, that our young State would have the same chance as other Western States to develop a road system based on the pattern of use its settlers established and the laws the State enacted. 
Senator Haskell told this Chamber it was the intent of Congress that all existing R.S. 2477 rights-of-way would be determined according to the law of the State the right-of-way was in. In fact Senator Haskell cited a specific North Dakota case, Koleon versus Pilot Mound Township, as the basis for the committee's understanding of the law. That case said an R.S. 2477 right-of-way is established `if there is use sufficient to establish a highway under [the] laws of the state.' I refer my colleagues to the Congressional Record of July 8, 1974, page S22284. 
Today, I am proposing that we uphold the intent of the Congress of 20 years ago and the intent of the 104th Congress as well. 
Last fall Congress agreed to a provision in the fiscal year 1997 appropriations law requiring agencies to seek congressional authorization of R.S. 2477 rulemaking. Section 310 of the supplemental asks nothing new, it merely prevents Interior from doing by agency policy what Congress prohibited it from doing by formal rulemaking. 
I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment so that Interior understands it cannot circumvent the will of Congress through sleight of hand.

I will state, though, that the suggestion made by Senator McCain was a good one. When we get to conference, if we do with this provision, I intend to find some way to accommodate his suggestion that we ask the Secretary to come forward with a proposal to be debated that might set the policy for future utilization of these rights-of-way throughout the West. We will pursue that in conference. 
But there will be no other amendment, my friend.

Mr. STEVENS. That is initiation of a highway. You move a few rocks, you cut down the right-of-way, you eliminate--it does not say `weed'--the brush, and you start to build a highway. The question before Hodel at the time was, what is the initiation of highway, not what is a right-of-way? 
I say to my friend that highways today came from wagon trails. In my State, some of our highways came from dog sled trails, from the trails that were cut by people who did use horses in those days, or by people who use snowshoes when they were delivering mail on their backs with packs. Some of them were developed in the 1920's, 1930's, 1940's, 1950's, 1960's, until 1976. They are today, but we have not had the money or capability to extend the highways because there are other problems of getting to those areas before we turn them into highways. They are not different from the roads that lead to Arkansas or, as I remember my youth, the slow train through Arkansas. That is a highway now. Maybe they leave Arkansas now rather than go in as they did in those days, but what I am telling you is we are asking for nothing more than what was the process of modernization throughout the West. It was by foot, by wagon, by horse trail. Then when there were vehicles, there were vehicles. 
But in our State, we have areas where vehicles have not yet been on the ground. A substantial part of our State cannot be reached by road. You know that. It can only be reached by air. We still have the process of extending those roads out into those areas so we can have surface transportation. 
You cannot turn R.S. 2477 into a right-of-way over which a vehicle has gone and protect our rights.

Mr. STEVENS. What the Secretary is doing now concerns taking action under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act, and section 701(h) of the law is specific `All actions by the Secretary concerned * * * shall be subject to valid existing rights.' By what power does he redefine now what was a valid existing right in 1976? He wasn't Secretary in 1976. What happens to the women who are out there in those small villages and cities today? They have to be flown into town to go to the hospital. It is going to take a few miles to get the roads to them. And we are going to get the roads to them, as long as we have the right to build the roads. We have the ability to deliver mail by road rather than by air. The Senator from Arkansas and others have been telling us, `Stop that subsidy for Alaska.' And for their mail, it costs $100 million more a year to deliver mail in Alaska because it all goes by air rather than similar places in the southern 48 because there it goes by road. 
By what right does this Secretary of the Interior determine what was a valid existing right in 1976?

Mr. STEVENS. I am glad the Senator asked that question of me. 
If you want to look at what happened, Secretary Hodel approved in 1988 a series of proposals that came to him from the Bureau of Land Management, the Park Service, and the Fish and Wildlife Service within his Department. He did not write that. He approved the work of a series of bureaus in his Department. It was not what this Secretary is doing. This Secretary is coming along as the Secretary and issuing an edict to change all of that. This, in 1988, was the work of long-term public servants who had great 
experience in managing. 
As a matter of fact, if you want to look at the 1993 report to Congress on R.S. 2477 by the Department of the Interior--I have it right here--you will see that there was consultation with the Governors, there was consultation with the State directors in Utah and Alaska, the areas where there was a substantial amount of R.S. 2477 claims. 
One of the things that I might add to this, my friend, is our Governor, who is a member of the party of the Senator from Arkansas, sent word to the current Secretary of the Interior that he was disturbed because he was not consulted before this was done. In the prior time, when the tables were turned and there was a Democratic Governor in the State of Alaska, Secretary Hodel did consult with him. He consulted with him. They had memos from the State. They had memos from Utah. They had memos from the BLM, Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, from throughout the West. That is what Hodel approved.

Mr. STEVENS. Hodel approved a series of papers that were presented by those agencies, and said--his statement is a one-page statement, which the Senator has been reading. So the words that the Senator was reading were not Hodel's words. The Secretary's approval is on a memorandum from the Assistant Secretary for Fish and Wildlife, Assistant Secretary for Minerals and Management, the BLM, and it is an approval of the policy statement concerning R.S. 2477. Hodel did not develop that policy. The Department developed it. All the agencies developed it in consultation with the States involved, and with the State offices of the various portions of this Department. 
So the Senator is overlooking that.

Mr. STEVENS. Hodel did not consult with these Senators because the management of the Congress was under the party of the Senator from Arkansas at that time. If there was any complaint about what Hodel did, that should be in the Record. At the time, the Congress did not object to what Hodel did because it was the process that came through consultation with Western States, Western Governors, with the agency's State offices throughout the West and was sent up to him by the Assistant Secretaries for Fish and Wildlife and the Bureau of Land Management up to the Secretary for approval. That is not what is happening now.

And I would be surprised if it was only 3,000. But those people aren't the Governors of the Western States. They aren't the Senators that represent Western States. And they are not the people within the BLM and others who are professionals in this field. This is coming at us now as edict on high. This is supremacy of the Federal Government. I have to tell you. I have dedicated my life against that. I think the Senator should remember that. We have been out here before saying you can't make laws from the executive branch. It must come through Congress.

Mr. STEVENS. I want to remind the Senate now, and I will do so later just prior to the vote, in this year's Interior appropriations bill, signed by the President last fall, after serious negotiation with the administration, conducted by the previous chairman of this Appropriations Committee, at my request this section was put in that bill, section 108: 
No final rule or regulation of any agency of the Federal Government pertaining to the recognition, management or validity of a right-of-way, pursuant to Revised Statute 2477, 43 U.S. Code 932, shall take effect unless expressly authorized by an act of Congress subsequent to the date of enactment of this act. 
Now, that was the compromise last year as we began this fiscal year. We believe it is an emergency when we return to Washington to find that the Secretary of the Interior has issued a policy, a statement, edict, fiat, whatever you want to call it, but he has in effect changed the law, in his opinion, purported to change the law in a way that he believes is not covered by that very strong statement: 
No final rule or regulation of any agency of the Federal Government pertaining to the recognition, management or validity of a right-of-way, pursuant to Revised Statute 2477. . . shall take effect unless expressly authorized by an act of Congress subsequent to the date of enactment of this act. 
That is this Congress. We have very clearly said, and the President of the United States agreed, that any change regarding the validity of rights-of-way shall be authorized by an act of Congress, and yet if we do not take this action that is in this bill that policy statement will guide all members of the Interior Department with regard to approval of the applications of Western States for rights-of-way under the law, a law that was agreed to in 1976 and expressly reserved all existing rights-of-way. 
I think it is a very clear issue, notwithstanding all of the flak that is out there in these direct mail pieces that are stimulating every newspaper from here to Washington State. It is just too bad that editors have not learned how to read because if they would read what the law is, I do not see how they can come to the conclusions that they do in some of the editorials I have read today. I hope the Members of the Senate are not swayed by those editorials because they certainly are not based upon the law or the facts of the situation. 
Mr. President, I will suggest the absence of a quorum awaiting my friend. We do have some matters that we can take care of. I might state for the information of the Senate that we have an indication from the Parliamentarian that only 33 of the 109 amendments that were filed are proper under cloture. Members should consult, if they wish to do so, the staff of either side to find out the situation with regard to their amendment. Senator Byrd and I have agreed that if we can we would like to cooperate with Members on matters that are true emergencies, particularly for those people who are from the disaster States, and there are 33 of those, Mr. President. But we are compelled to rely upon the actions of the Parliamentarian under the rule unless we can find some way to accommodate the changes that would be necessary to validate the amendments involved. So I urge Members of the Senate to determine whether the amendments they have filed prior to cloture are now valid after cloture. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have to oppose the amendment of the Senator from Arizona. 
With regard to the funds for the Paramount Theater, for instance, in Kentucky, these are funds that were already made available for a parking garage there in the same area, and those funds are being reprogrammed to another project that is involved in the same area which is a historic landmark. 
We have another funding request here concerning the VA hospital. These funds were appropriated in 1997 for this project, but unfortunately the authorizing language was left out of the Veterans Housing Act. What we are doing is going through the act again and reappropriating it with authorizing legislation. That is a technicality, really. 
We do have the money, and there are highway funds allocated, in addition to those already allocated in Utah, that will be allocated for the planning and engineering design of projects for the Olympics. These are the Winter Olympics for 2002, a very historic thing to have Olympics in our country. Just as every country, we have to have special parking lots, special entrances, security involved in roads, streets, and highways in connection with the Winter Olympics. That is a noble use of funds for those projects. Of course, the highways and roads and parking lots are usable afterward. I do not argue about that. There is no question about the need for getting going now to allocate those funds for those highway projects that do meet the criteria of past allocations. 
We have a whole series of other problems that the Senator mentioned. I only say that some of them may be small disasters, such as the salmon problem which the Senator has mentioned. Others are items that we put in the bill because of the timeliness of the construction that is required. 
I will probably be making comments further tomorrow on other matters of the bill to try to explain some of these items. There are items here in several departments, and the Senator has pointed them out, that are not disaster related. That is why this is an emergency and supplemental appropriations bill. These amendments go to the supplemental portion, normal supplemental allocation of funds for items to be completed this year. These are moneys to be used in the remainder of fiscal year 1997. 
I am sad to say I do oppose the amendment of the Senator. I understand what he is doing. For the Senator's benefit, I hope he understands what I am saying. Senator McCain has become the chairman's large image on the wall, and I have to tell everyone that has an amendment that is presented to our committee in connection with supplementals or even annual bills, `You better be sure we have the justification to get these by the Senator from Arizona because he is our watchdog.' We need watchdogs and we appreciate them, but I have to say I will be glad to tell the Senator sometime about the 1,000 amendments we did not approve. We had more than 1,000, I might add, suggested to our committee. These are the ones that survived. 
I defend what we have done, and under the circumstances, it would be my intent to table when the Senator is finished with his remarks.

Mr. STEVENS. I cannot announce there will be no more votes, but it is not our intention to call upon amendments that would require votes tonight. We do expect to start very early in the morning and have a vote at approximately 10 o'clock in the morning on one amendment and then a period of debate on Senator Byrd's amendment to strike the continuing resolution proposal in the supplemental emergency bill. We will have a vote on that. It is our intention to finish this bill tomorrow evening. 
I might say to Senators who have amendments, I urge them to come and present their amendments and try to work out, to the extent we can, time agreements on obtaining time tomorrow. It will be very much in short supply, Mr. President. We are going to move to go to third reading at or around 6 o'clock. I say that again: We are going to move to go to third reading at or around 6 o'clock if that is parliamentarily possible at that time. I think it will be.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, later this morning, the Senate is going to vote, as I said, as near to 10 o'clock as possible. I regret that this step is necessary. I didn't think it would be necessary to have cloture. Senator Byrd and I have spent 2 days trying to resolve difficulties on the bill regarding amendments. As I said, 109 first-degree amendments are pending with regard to this bill. We simply cannot wait to move on the legislation. It does have millions of dollars for assistance to victims of the disasters. Those disasters, Mr. President, occurred in 33 States. 
The bill provides $1.8 billion to the Department of Defense for overseas contingency operations. This is for money that has already been spent on activities in Bosnia and Southwest Asia, and it replaces the funds that are critical to operating and maintenance accounts and personnel accounts to assure regular training and quality-of-life programs for the Department of Defense personnel through the remainder of 1997. 
Let me make that clear. The money has been spent, but it was spent from very critical accounts under the power of the Presidency. We need to reprogram moneys into those accounts in massive amounts to assure that in the last quarter of this year, there is regular training and maintenance of our readiness. 
Now, last night, we commenced a bipartisan review of all the amendments presented by 2:30. We hope we can work out or accept many of those. I urge any Member who is serious about the appropriations and has an amendment to this bill that is germane, to come to the floor so we can clear as many of the amendments as possible. It is my intention, after consulting with Senator Byrd, to take a very strict view to amendments in a post-cloture environment. I think that is what the Senate will want to do--consider germane amendments and move forward to this bill. Nongermane legislative amendments will be subject to a ruling by the Chair, and that will be taken up after cloture. But as I said, this is an emergency, although the funds--like the Department of Defense funds, money is being spent on the disaster now from other accounts available to the executive branch, so we must replace that money and make further money available. 
We have placed the money to keep the Government going, where the money has been borrowed for a short period of time, under the procedures available for disasters. We must make these moneys available. This is a 500-year flood, Mr. President. This is one of the most severe disasters we have had since the Johnstown flood. If we are successful here, I think we can proceed very quickly. 
The distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee has concluded the budget agreement. He will manage the budget presentation following the action on this bill. That is my understanding. We hope that we will be able to get that budget agreement through the Senate and then be able to proceed on the 1998 appropriations bills. So I ask Members to defer nonemergency matters until we bring up those bills. 
Now that we have a budget agreement, we are certain we will be moving regular appropriations bills very quickly. Many of the amendments presented here to this bill are amendments that would be germane to the regular appropriations bills for the various agencies. But they are not germane to this bill. So I hope that there is a strict ruling by the Chair on the germaneness of these amendments that have been filed. 
Now, we have worked several days to try and bring about compromises in several areas, such as the amendment pertaining to the continuing resolution concept that is in the bill, the census and endangered species. I hope that we can effect a compromise on each of those issues. If not, let's have the vote. We waited all afternoon yesterday to take up these issues. As the Chair knows, we were finally forced to recess last night so that we could get the control factor that will come from the cloture process. 
As I said, I didn't think it would be necessary. As a matter of fact, I told the floor staff I didn't think we should even file that cloture motion. They thought we should, and I am glad we did. They were right and I was wrong. 
Senator Byrd and I are going to work out the shortest time agreement possible on any amendments today. We expect to have many votes. I believe that we will begin to call up amendments from the eligible list as soon as the Chair rules on the amendments under cloture. As a matter of fact, we are available to take up amendments before 10 o'clock if anybody wants to come over and try to work one out before that time. 
I have taken the bulk of my time, Mr. President. Let me, again, thank Senator Byrd for his cooperation. We have moved numerous amendments in a bipartisan fashion already. Later today, Senators Conrad and Dorgan have asked us to meet with the mayor of Grand Forks, and we will do that. We are going to see some television footage. I saw some, as a matter of fact, on the news, but we intend to promise the mayor that we are going to finish this bill and get it to the President as soon as possible. 
I am happy to yield the remainder of the time to Senator Byrd, if he wishes time at this time.

Mr. STEVENS. Thank you. 
Mr. President, I want to raise the issue of a provision that is in the bill concerning section 2477 of the Revised Statutes--43 United States Code 932. 
Some groups have been alleging in the press that the provision in the supplemental bill before us regarding rights-of-way under section 2477 of the Revised Statutes is going to result in roads across our national parks and wilderness. That is simply not true. These false allegations are being made in order to scare our constituents and to convince Members to oppose our provision. 
Rights-of-way under Revised Statute 2477 were granted by statute from 1866 to 1976, when the provision was repealed. At the time of the repeal, all existing rights-of-way were specifically protected. 
Rights-of-way under R.S. 2477 are granted across Federal lands not reserved for public uses. 
When Congress sets aside land for a park or wilderness, that land is reserved for that purpose. Once the park or wilderness is created, no new right-of-way can be created under Revised Statute 2477. 
This means that only rights-of-way that were created prior to the reservation of the land for a park or wilderness are valid under R.S. 2477. 
To create a right-of-way under R.S. 2477, there must either have been public use of a right-of-way or an affirmative act of a State indicating that it accepted the grant and intends to use it for a public highway. 
Most of this Nation's most famous parks were created during the 110 years that Revised Statute 2477 was available. Yellowstone was created in 1872. 
Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and Sequoia were created in 1890. The Grand Canyon was set aside in 1908. 
Denali, then known as Mount McKinley, was created in Alaska in 1917. Katmai in Alaska was established in 1918, and Glacier Bay National Park was created in 1925. 
Zion National Park in Utah was created in 1919, with Bryce Canyon following in 1923, and the Arches National Park in 1929. 
Throughout the 50 or more years of each of these parks' existence, a Revised Statute 2477 right-of-way could have been asserted, even before the provision was repealed. Yet, these parks have not been paved by public highways. 
Congress began creating wilderness areas in 1964--12 years before Revised Statute 2477 was repealed. Section 5 of the Wilderness Act specifically preserves existing private rights. 
It has been 20 years since Revised Statute 2477 was repealed 
and over 30 years since the creation of many major wilderness areas. During the 30 years of the policy of wilderness the same practice that the provision in the supplemental seeks to continue was in effect. 
Yet, during those 30 years, we have not seen any of our wilderness areas covered with roads under Revised Statute 2477. 
In Alaska, where 60 percent of the wilderness areas exist, we have already dealt with the issue. The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act has numerous provisions that specifically deal with access to wilderness areas. Nothing in this provision changes the law regarding rights-of-way in Alaska. 
On the contrary, the provision seeks to keep the pre-existing policy and specifically denies the Secretary of the Interior the right to unilaterally change the policy contrary to what Congress has said many times and what the courts have said many times. As a matter of fact, Congress has spoken three times in the past 2 years on this and stated that the Secretary cannot change the existing law and policy by regulation or by edict. 
The people who claim this provision will lead to roads across wilderness areas and parks already created by Congress are just plain wrong. 
What is at issue here are areas that are not yet wilderness or that have been recently added by Executive action to our parks and monuments. 
Mr. President, every time Congress has addressed that subject, it has protected valid existing rights, even in the creation of national parks and wildlife refuges. 
Wilderness areas by definition don't have any roads. The environmental groups and the Department of the Interior are seeking to cut off valid rights-of-way in certain areas of the West so that those areas may be proclaimed wilderness. 
I hope that the Senate understands this. If the Secretary of the Interior and these groups are allowed to prevail, then areas that do have existing valid rights-of-way, which should by law be given some consideration and may ineligible to become wilderness areas, could be created as additional wilderness and national park areas by Executive order or secretarial edict. 
If they can keep the R.S. 2477 right-of-way from being recognized under State law, as they have been created for the past 130 years, then those areas would be roadless and eligible for wilderness designation by Congress. 
That is the issue here. There are valid, existing rights-of-way across some of these areas. They have been used for decades by the public in the West. Those areas are not capable of being established as wilderness areas. But that is not for us to decide here. 
All this provision does is maintain the status quo. If there are valid existing rights under R.S. 2477, they had to be created more than 20 years ago, before 1976. 
The provision simply prevents the Secretary of the Interior from prejudging the issue in the ongoing review of which remaining Federal areas should be wilderness. This only preserves rights-of-way that already exist. It does not create new rights or new roads. 
I hope that the Senate will seriously consider the issue that is coming before us today regarding Revised Statute 2477. Our intent is merely to keep the policy that has existed in the past and which has been protected by every act of Congress that I know of. The valid existing rights were protected. Those rights have been defined as far as rights-of-way under State law for 130 years. 
This Secretary of the Interior now wants to have them decided under Federal law that his regulations would establish. That is contrary to the policy of Congress. It is contrary to the decisions of the courts of the United States, and it should not be done by secretarial edict. 
As I said, we have acted in the National Highway System Designation Act of 1995, in the 1996 Interior appropriations bill and in the 1997 Interior appropriations bill to prevent those 
regulations from being issued. Now the Secretary wishes to announce a policy. That policy is that in the future the validity of the rights will be determined by Federal law. That is contrary to a whole series of court decisions and contrary to the acts of Congress that specifically recognize valid existing rights under State law. 
Mr. President, I hope that this is going to be a short day. But I want to tell the Senate that it is our intention, as Senator Byrd has announced, to enforce the cloture motion. I call again on the Senate to vote for cloture. Give the managers of this bill the control that comes from the cloture process, and we will assure this bill passes to provide money to those in the disaster areas. The bill affects disasters in 33 States, Mr. President. We will give this bill to the conference and to the President as quickly as possible. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is an amendment that we hope will bring about an awareness of Government officials of Uruguay of a very sad situation with regard to the fishing assets from Washington State and Alaska that were entered into in a joint venture with a seafood company in Uruguay. 
What happened was that the assets of the Americans were seized after they were in Uruguay territory, and the joint venture that was supposed to be forthcoming was dissolved by actions of the Uruguay citizens. 
I offer this amendment sort of in frustration, trying to see if we can work out with the Uruguay Embassy here and officials in the State Department at Montevideo a resolution of this problem. 
I hope that it has the salutary effect of calling the attention of the Uruguay Government to a very unsatisfactory development with regard to our business relationships. 
I urge adoption of the amendment.

But I do want to say that, as a result of the amendment of the Senator from South Carolina, there have been a series of pharmaceutical groups that contacted us concerning the inequities of the long delay in the processing of Federal permits for the pharmaceuticals in this country. I believe this is a matter that should be taken care of in the legislative proposal, but, if it is not, we will address it further this year in the Appropriations Committee.

Mr. STEVENS. I am informed that 110 amendments have been filed to this bill. We have assigned task forces from the staffs of the various subcommittees to review those amendments. 
Mr. President, we will notify Members if we find amendments we would object to. But I ask all Members to notify us when they would like to call up their amendments. It is the leadership's hope that this bill will be finished by tomorrow evening. Obviously, with 110 amendments, it is going to be a long night. But I would appreciate it if we could have some idea of when those amendments would be called up. I am hopeful they will be called up soon.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, it would be my position that, if the Senator would delete the references to specific States, we would have no objection to the amendment. It is my understanding that the money is available and this would earmark $45 million for assistance under section 2604(g) of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act. But there are other disaster areas that are covered by this bill. We see no reason why there should not be similar assistance in those areas. 
There are some disasters from 1996 and some from the spring of 1997 covered by this bill. They are all within the assistance for fiscal year 1997. Being limited to the assistance that is in this bill for 1997, we would have no objection if it is not earmarked to specific States. 
I don't know the extent of assistance that would be available outside of the three States mentioned, but I do believe there are circumstances that would warrant them because of the type of flooding that took place in the fall of 1996.

Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield further, Mr. President? 
The Senator's amendment mandates the Secretary to make this available from the moneys that the Senator has mentioned. The Secretary has current authority to do it. It is discretionary. The effect of his amendment is to mandate that, of the moneys that are there, at least $45 million shall be available immediately for the disaster victims. I believe that the fund itself is for general population assistance for LIHEAP projects. If the Senator will take out the reference to the specific States, what it means is that the $45 million is reserved for the purposes he seeks and, if there is additional money in there, for others. But we think this reserving money ought to be for victims of all disasters covered by the bill.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, as Senator Wellstone has indicated, the effect of this amendment will be to dedicate a portion of the moneys that are available to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make LIHEAP-type assistance available to victims of flooding and other natural disasters covered by the bill. It is moneys that are there and could be made available. This mandates making it available. 
We believe under the circumstances that that is a proper thing to do. For this side, I am willing to accept the amendment. 
Mr. President, I ask Senator Byrd if he is willing to accept the amendment.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I regret that we can't seem to get much going here. The administration now has the Endangered Species Act amendment under review, the amendment pertaining to the sense of the Senate is under review, and the amendment pertaining to S. 2477 is under review. I would like to find out what is going on down there in that three-ring circus so we might get this bill going. I understand the Senator wants an hour and a half, but we will have a cloture motion tomorrow, apparently. It will be this Senator's recommendation, if we can't get this bill going, let's go out and then come back tomorrow and vote cloture. I was told I am trying to hold up this bill. I was told that last week. We have been on the floor here for 2 days. I am perfectly willing to go ahead with amendments--amendments even to strike provisions we put in the bill. We are not holding up this bill. 
If we need a cloture motion to limit all debate, then I say the Senate should vote cloture tomorrow and do that. I am not addressing this to my good friend from Nevada. I understand what he is doing. There is a substantial possibility that it may be worked out with the administration. But I am not sure the administration has the urgency we seem to want to have for this bill. Mr. President, my recommendation to the leader is that if we don't get going here this afternoon, let's go out at 5 o'clock and come back tomorrow and get cloture. Then I know amendments will be voted on in orderly sequence. If we don't get cloture, we will understand, and the people from the disaster area will understand who wants the bill and who doesn't. I am very disturbed about this delay, as a matter of fact.

We just adopted his amendment by a voice vote because he was so cooperative in working out the terms of that amendment. I am sure we can go forward with his presentation now. But, clearly, without regard to the two of us on the floor now, the delays are taking place off the floor. I think it is time that we get the word out that we are just not going to sit around all day waiting for people to come to the floor. We still have the prerogative of going to third reading and cutting off all amendments.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have another amendment. It is a technical correction to the 1997 Veterans Administration and Housing and Urban Development appropriations bill as it relates to EPA State and tribal assistance grant account. 
The language in this amendment ensures that should the EPA be required to take over a State environmental program grant, funds otherwise provided to the State would be available to EPA for administering the program. 
This language represents no change in policy or procedure, and is deemed by the committee to be a technical amendment to existing law. It is an amendment presented in behalf of the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Bond.

I am humbled to be here with my good friend from West Virginia, the distinguished former majority leader, minority leader, chairman of our Appropriations Committee, and now the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee. I can think of no one I have studied under longer than Senator Byrd. It is a privilege to be here to present this bill with him today. 
Our committee reported this bill on Wednesday, and the report has been available since last Thursday for Members. Many of our colleagues will comment later on the terrible events which precipitated this disaster relief bill. They represent the States involved, and I will leave it to them to comment on the specific situations in their own States. 
Our committee worked to target spending in this bill to the agencies and accounts that are responding to these crises now. The $5.5 billion provided for emergency relief exceeds the President's request by $2.5 billion. Some of these funds will not be spent this fiscal year. We sought to use the best estimates we could, but in many cases it will be weeks or months until a final assessment of damages can be made in these disaster areas. 
As has been widely reported, there are some controversial measures in this bill. I do thank all my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for their cooperation during the markup last week. One clear conclusion we reached was that not all the funds in this bill will be directed to the most recent disasters. We have witnessed a steady increase in the Presidential disaster recommendations, which have radically increased disaster relief costs. In addition, the President has waived the matching requirement on many of the programs involved, adding to the Federal costs for these disasters. We cannot and will not try to solve this problem on this bill, but it is something I believe must be addressed by Congress. There ought to be a clear understanding and a clear yardstick for disasters, regardless of the area involved. 
All new spending in this bill is offset by corresponding rescissions or budget authority or canceling spending authority. This is sort of complicated. For budget scoring purposes, the disaster-related spending will be treated as an emergency. Those outlays will not count against this year's budget limits. 
Part of this difference relates to how CBO scores appropriations bills. The Congressional Budget Office has a unique approach. When we appropriated funds for military personnel in September, the Congressional Budget Office scored those outlays--the money would actually be spent under the authorizations that were previously given by Congress--they were scored at 98 percent. Yet, when we rescind those same funds in this bill, the Congressional Budget Office process credits the committee with only 25 percent of the outlays as savings to offset the money spent. It is the same dollar, but we only get a portion of the credit. The moneys have already been spent; that is the problem. The bias of the CBO process makes offsetting outlays a daunting task this late in the fiscal year. 
Our committee did not recommend general cuts against agencies to offset these disaster funds, and I urged Members not to propose reductions against the operating accounts of agencies. The disaster relief funds proposed in the bill are not targeted or earmarked for any region of the country. Again, I ask our colleagues to follow the suggestions the Appropriations Committee made and hold to this practice during the consideration of this bill. The needs of all persons and communities impacted by these crises are real and pressing. Mr. President, some of these disasters occurred last year, some this year. I do not believe we should--and I will oppose attempts to--tie the funds of agencies responsible for providing relief to the impacted regions. There is still much unknown about these disasters, as I said before. I do not believe we should second-guess, nor should we micromanage from Congress, relief efforts at this stage. Once more precise recovery plans are developed, we will have an opportunity in the fiscal year 1998 bills, which will be presented later this year, to address some additional specific needs. 
The bill also includes $1.8 billion for defense contingency operations. Earlier this year, I went with a delegation of Senators to Bosnia and to Southwest Asia to review United States military operations there. We returned disturbed by the lack of concern about the costs of the operations by our regional commanders. My staff and I have been working since January with the comptroller at the Department of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff to establish procedures and controls to help control and monitor spending for overseas deployments. This committee report before the Senate reduced the funds requested for overseas operations by $100 million. Already, to his great credit, Secretary Cohen has reduced unneeded units in both Bosnia and southwest Asia, and I believe more savings will be achieved during this fiscal year. 
In the case of unforeseen emergencies, our bill includes an additional $100 million in reprogramming authority for the Department of Defense. In the past, the administration has increased spending on these overseas operations without any consultation with Congress. 
The commanders in the field discussed with the Senators I was with and myself, in January, in Bosnia, in Kuwait, in Saudi Arabia, and in connection with the Bosnia operation in both Hungary and Italy, commitments of 20 to 30 years for procurement for these overseas deployments. They did so without the slightest concern or hesitation about the costs involved. I believe that is a process that should stop. Spending on contingencies does not mean giving military commanders a blank check to commit us to expenditures far into the years to come for deployments which have never been approved by Congress. 
In fiscal year 1998, we will take specific steps to ensure fiscal concerns are addressed on all peacekeeping operations. The Department of Defense now refers to missions such as Bosnia and Southwest Asia as, `operations other than war.' Unfortunately, some spending practices of the Department, and particularly the regional commanders, assume wartime needs and are driven by wartime needs. 
I want to assure the Senate and the Department that our committee will tirelessly work to ensure that any of our forces deployed in the field have everything they need to fight and win and maintain their safety in any conflict. Their deployment, however, cannot be without the participation of Congress. Ultimately we are called upon to pay the bill for such deployments. 
We have had some disagreements with regard to this bill. I do not think there has been any question, however, that all concerned wanted to report this bill to the Senate as quickly as possible to meet the needs that I have spoken about. I hope the bill marks the commencement of a long and fruitful partnership among all members of the Appropriations Committee serving during this Congress. I do believe that this bill can be completed by tomorrow evening, or Wednesday at the latest. It will, of course, be our practice to await the passage of the bill in the House before we take final action on this bill. And I do hope all Senators will help us work toward the goal of being prepared to send the bill to conference as soon as the House has sent us their appropriations bill for these disasters. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is our understanding that this amendment that Senator Grams has presented to us continues the precedent that was established by his legislation when he was a Member of the other body in 1993. 
We have examined the proposed amendment and have been informed that the Banking Committee of the Senate is in agreement with it. Under the circumstances, I know of no opposition to the amendment on this side of the aisle, and we are prepared to accept it. I do note the Senator has asked for the yeas and nays, but perhaps we can dispose of it today if it is possible.

It was our hope that we will get some of these presented this afternoon and debated at our leisure and voted on tomorrow. I hoped that we might have votes today, but that is not possible. 
I urge Members to let us know if they intend to bring any amendments to the floor this afternoon. There are a series that have been suggested that, I believe, could be worked out and would be acceptable to the managers of the bill on both sides. We hope that we can find some business to accomplish this afternoon on this bill. It is a very important bill, one that should not be delayed if it is possible to move forward. 
I urge Members to contact us if they intend to offer amendments today. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there are times when I listen to the remarks of another Senator that I realize the statement being made is most significant. That was my feeling recently as I sat next to the junior Senator from Massachusetts. Senator John Kerry spoke to the national meeting of AIPAC--The America-Israel Political Action Committee--here in Washington, DC. This was a bipartisan meeting of AIPAC members from throughout our Nation. 
In a strong worded presentation, Senator Kerry made an appeal for the United States to be a true friend of Israel. I, particularly, agreed with my friend as he forcefully said: 
As a democracy, Israel has both the burden and the glory of a vigorous public square. We as Americans must be the truest and best kind of ally--both forthright enough to say what we think--and steadfast enough to stay the course during the hard passages as well as the easy ones. 
Herzl's famous words--`If you will it, it is no dream'--signify the promise and the greatest power of Israel--and the hope, after half a century, that a fair and secure peace is finally within reach. For our part, we must leave here more committed than ever to support Israel in the exacting, essential, and sometimes tense search for that dream. I think its fair to say that the ashes of Holocaust victims were scattered on the wind. 
But that wind also carries on it their prayers and purpose--above mountains and sea, across hundreds or thousands of miles, so that the pain of history is redeemed in the land of Israel. It is a sacred place--for them, for their people who live there, and for all the world. So let us now resolve again that the day will never come for Israel when the redemption is put at risk--when any of us would ever have to repeat Schindler's cry and say: We could have done more. 
Mr. President, the days seem to be disappearing when a Senator compliments another Senator who sits on the other side of this aisle by making the Senate aware of a significant accomplishment of a colleague. For myself, I would like to restore that tradition.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that would authorize the minting of silver $1 coins and gold $5 coins in commemoration of the bicentennial of the Library of Congress. The year 2000 will mark this important event for the Congress and the Nation. Over the past two centuries, the U.S. Congress has built its library into America's library and the greatest repository of recorded knowledge and creativity in the history of the World. 
Proceeds from the coin will help the library support bicentennial programs, educational outreach, and other activities including programs with schools and libraries across the Nation. 
The Library of Congress' bicentennial merits a U.S. commemorative coin. The library is an institution that has an enduring effect on the Nation's culture and history. As vice chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library, I am pleased to offer this legislation and I welcome and encourage my colleagues to join as cosponsors.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have been involved with the chemical weapons debate and negotiations for a convention like this since its beginning. During the Reagan administration, at the suggestion of Ambassador John Tower, former Senator John Tower, I spent a month in Geneva during an August recess auditing the beginnings of the negotiations that led up to this Chemical Weapons Convention. John Tower even loaned me his home in Geneva to live in during that period. He and I agreed that negotiating a satisfactory chemical weapons treaty was an objective that had to be achieved, because we shared the feeling that the world was becoming a very dangerous place to live in because of chemical and biological warfare developments. We felt the United States needed to show leadership in reducing some of the dangers whenever possible. 
This convention before the Senate could be improved. The START treaties could have been improved. However, under those 
treaties, the United States and Russia will significantly reduce their numbers of nuclear warheads and reduce the risk of nuclear war. The Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty could have been improved. Yet, today we no longer have Russian and NATO forces bristling with tanks, cannons, and fighter aircraft facing each other across the border in numbers that reminded many of Armageddon. 
The Chemical Weapons Convention does move the world toward a goal of bringing order and accountability to the production and transportation of weapons of mass destruction. This is a convention that has required the negotiating concurrence of 74 countries. I will never forget sitting around those rooms in Geneva while we waited for the representatives of the various countries to state their positions. 
To require this convention to be perfect asks the impossible. To expect it to be an effective tool in controlling chemical weapons is reasonable. This convention does provide an inspection regime that will allow our inspectors to monitor potential chemical weapons production and transportation more effectively than without the convention. And protections are built into the convention so that U.S. companies producing chemicals are not going to have their manufacturing processes compromised, and, obviously, we do not amend the Constitution of the United States by approving this convention. 
For me, this convention enhances the security of our forces deployed abroad, as well as throughout our whole Nation. The Joint Chiefs of Staff support the Chemical Weapons Convention. Generals Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf support the convention. Former Secretary of State Jim Baker and former National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft support this convention. Former CIA Directors, Jim Woolsey, Stansfield Turner, and John Deutch, support this convention. I could go on and on with the list, Mr. President. 
But, to me, it is not the former or present officials that should have an impact on this Senate. It is the men and women in uniform. They are in harm's way. They know now that many of their predecessors who served us in the Persian Gulf war, men and women there in uniform, were exposed to some type of a chemical weapon in Iraq. It is for them that I speak, because I think, universally, they are now worried about what this Congress is going to do, or not do, in trying to find some process of protecting them against chemical and biological warfare. 
In its essence, I believe that the United States has a responsibility for world leadership. This leadership is more graphically demonstrated in this legislative body than anywhere I know, because passage of the resolution of ratification will show our leadership in the effort to contain chemical weapons, just as Senate support for START I showed the United States' commitment to nuclear weapons reduction. 
I encourage the Senate to vote in favor of this resolution of ratification and support the Chemical Weapons Convention as it was presented to us.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, it is not an easy position for me to be opposed to friends with whom I normally stand shoulder to shoulder. But I believe we must be motivated by what we believe is in the best interest of the country as a whole. I believe if we took a poll of men and women in uniform today, they would say that the No. 1 threat they fear is chemical and biological warfare. I say that we must lead the world in addressing the consequences of production and use of these weapons of mass destruction, just as we led the world in dealing with the consequences of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Voting for the Chemical Weapons Convention resolution of ratification will make the world a safer place. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I believe we need to have this balanced budget amendment adopted by the Senate. As I see what is happening now in terms of the controllable expenditures of the United States, I see that next year we will spend about as much money for interest on the national debt as we will to maintain our defenses. 
There is pressure on us across the whole spectrum for control of expenses. We need a Coast Guard. We need the National Park Service. We need the FBI. Think of all of the controllable expenses in the departments that we fund. Every year we have to say cut more, cut more. Why? Because the interest continues to mount on the national debt, until we get it in balance. 
So, if for no other reason than that, I believe the Senate should pass this amendment so that we can get a handle on the interest we must pay on the national debt. It continues to go up because the deficit continues to go up. That must be controlled, Madam President. I am proud to join my friend, Judiciary Chairman Hatch of Utah, in supporting this amendment. 
Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I bring to the Senate the United States Olympic Checkoff Act. This bill would provide significant--and needed--new funding for our Nation's amateur athletic movement. This will present a way for Americans to show support for the United States Olympic Committee, the USOC, and for our amateur athletes. Simply by checking a box on their tax returns, American taxpayers could designate a dollar from their refunds to go to the USOC, or they could enclose a contribution to the USOC when they mail their tax forms. This concept is similar to the existing Presidential checkoff. It is different though, in that this deduction for the Olympic Committee would come from the taxpayers' own money, their refunds or their contributions, and not from the money destined for the Federal Treasury. 
The Amateur Sports Act of 1978 made the USOC the central coordinating body for amateur sports in the United States. The responsibilities of the act, that is the responsibilities given by the act to the USOC, include training and selecting athletes to represent the United States at international competitions and, equally important, encouraging athletic activities for all amateur athletes in the United States through grassroots sports opportunities. 
What the Amateur Sports Act does not do is authorize Federal funding of the USOC. In almost every other nation in the world, Olympic and amateur sports receive substantial government funding. That is not true in our country. The USOC's primary means of raising money to support U.S. athletes and to carry out the purposes of the act is through charging sponsors a fee to use the words `Olympics' or `Olympiad,' and to display the Olympic symbol of five interlocking rings. Sponsors' fees do not come close to providing the funds necessary to train our growing legions of athletes. Our athletes at the grassroots level are not getting a fair chance to be competitive with their counterparts from nations that provide funding from government sources. 
My bill would create a new trust fund in the Treasury called the United States Olympic Trust Fund. The amounts voluntarily contributed by Americans would be deposited into the trust fund. At least once quarterly, the Secretary of Treasury would distribute the amounts in the trust fund to the USOC, after deducting reasonable administrative costs. 
I look forward to working with the Senate Finance Committee and all of the Senate and the House to achieve enactment of this valuable legislation in this Congress. I hope this bill will be welcomed by all Americans who believe in the importance of our country's athletic programs.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have a second bill pertaining to amateur sports I would like to present to the Senate today. This will create a recurring Olympic Commemorative Coins Program in the United States to provide valuable souvenirs to amateur sports enthusiasts, and a new source of revenue to the United States Olympic Committee, the USOC. These are sort of companion bills. The second bill would require the Secretary of the Treasury to consult with the USOC and the Citizens Commemorative Coin Advisory Committee on the design of a $1 silver coin which would commemorate each summer and winter Olympic games held outside the United States. Only 500,000 of such coins would be minted. 
Under the bill, a new commemorative coin would be issued every 2 years. The summer and winter Olympics are now staggered, so that, as we all know, now there is an Olympic games every 2 years. 
Each coin would carry a surcharge of $10 and that money would be transferred by the Secretary of the Treasury to the USOC. The Secretary of Treasury would be required to include in the sale price of each coin an additional amount to pay for the costs of the program. If the coins sell as they have in the past, and these have been very successful programs in the past, the USOC could receive a total of about $5 million for each Olympic games, in other words every 2 years. This would go a long way toward supporting our amateur athletes and carrying out our responsibilities of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978. In years when the Olympics are held inside the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury would be required to develop an expanded multicoin program to commemorate our Olympic Games. This program, designed by the Secretary, with the USOC and the Coins Committee, could provide 4 or 5 different gold, silver or other coins in numbers larger than the 500,000 for the games that are held outside the United States. These would be of special interest to travelers who would come to the United States for the Olympic games. 
My bill also provides discretion with respect to the surcharge in each coin. This would make it possible for U.S. athletes and the USOC to receive an even greater benefit from each coin. In the first 2 months after the new Olympic Coins Program begins, the Secretary of Treasury would be prohibited from issuing other commemorative coins. In other words, we would like to have one period, every 2 years, of 2 months in which the USOC's coins, the Olympic coins, would be the only coins available. 
The Amateur Sports Act made the USOC, as I said before, the central coordinating body for amateur sports in the United States. It does give the USOC the duty to not only select and train athletes to represent the United States at international competitions, but to encourage athletic activities through a grassroots sports program. 
I believe that the USOC carries out the Amateur Sports Act well, in view of the fact it does not receive support from Federal appropriations. As I said before, the act does not authorize such appropriations. 
I repeat, Mr. President, unless we find a source of revenue for the USOC, we are going to have a situation where it cannot carry out the responsibilities that were given it by Congress in 1978. 
Last year, the Senate Commerce Committee began a review of the Amateur Sports Act. During our first two hearings, we determined additional revenues are needed to provide greater grassroots sports opportunities in our country. 
Toward this end, the bill I am introducing would require at least 25 percent of the revenues received by the USOC under the coins program would be used solely for promoting grassroots sports opportunities, and it would require USOC to use at least 25 percent of the revenues to promote and encourage physical fitness and public participation in amateur athletic activities; to assist organizations and persons concerned with sports in the development of special amateur athletic programs for amateurs in our country; and it would also foster the development of amateur athletic facilities for use by amateur athletes, as well as assist in making existing amateur athletic facilities available and to modernize them, Mr. President, which is necessary for their use by amateur athletes now in this country. 
I look forward on this bill to working with the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I believe this bill will be sent to that committee. It is important legislation to be enacted in this Congress.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Alaska lost one of its greatest 20th century pioneers this month, when Robert B. Atwood died on January 10. 
Many today remember him as the man who edited and published Alaska's largest newspaper, the Anchorage Times, for more than 50 years. 
But some of my best memories are of the hours and days and weeks we spent together in the 1950's, when he was chairman of the Alaska Statehood Committee and I was assistant to the Secretary of the Interior Fred Seaton as Alaskans sought Statehood. 
Bob Atwood was a leader in that fight. He crystallized the support of our Nation's press to put the 49th star on our flag. It was his understanding and knowledge of the news media, and his friendships among editors and publishers across our Nation that brought the press on board, to champion the cause for bringing Alaska into the union. Not too many years later, he was responsible for newspapers across our Nation understanding the importance of building our great Alaska pipeline. 
Bob Atwood was more than a great publisher, more than the successful chairman of the Statehood Committee. He was a cultural renaissance man, who did much behind the scenes to promote the arts and education in Alaska. 
Bob loved new technology, and brought his newspaper into the computer age long before most of the Nation's largest dailies were on line. He was the first one on the staff of the Anchorage Times to learn how to use the new computers, while his staff struggled with the transition from typewriters to the electronic age. 
His knowledge of history, and of the many serious- and humorous-stories about Alaska and Alaskans who shaped my State's history, was extraordinary. Bob was generous in sharing those stories with organizations and groups who asked him to speak or to attend their meetings. 
Above all, Bob Atwood understood the importance of a strong military presence in Alaska, the crossroads of the world, and he helped to make the Nation aware of our strategic global position. 
He was a tireless supporter of our service men and women, and remained friends with many of them long after their tours of duty in Alaska were over. For 40 years Bob served on the military's civilian advisory boards in Alaska, and was president since 1976 of the Alaskan Command Civilian Advisory Board. He assured that in Alaska there was--and still is--a partnership between our military stationed in our State and Alaskans. 
Immediately after the 1964 earthquake, he told me he wanted to buy land and build a house close to the area most damaged by the earthquake, to show his confidence in the future of Alaska. He built that house and opened it up time and again to men and women from our State and hundreds of others he had met during his travels in our country and all over the world. 
My friend Bob was quietly generous to a number of causes which were never publicized. In addition, he was proud of those which bear his name, to which he donated millions of dollars, including the Atwood chair in journalism at the University of Alaska, the Atwood Center at Alaska Pacific University, and the Evangeline Atwood Theater at Anchorage's performing arts center. His generosity touched the lives of thousands of Alaskans, though they may never have known it. 
Bob Atwood had the manners of an old-fashioned gentleman, the curiosity and sense of fun of a youngster, and writing and editing talents that could only be achieved through graceful maturity and a great understanding and love of words. 
In helping to make life better for all Alaskans, Bob Atwood made history. He was indeed a great man, who helped to make our great land even greater. He was also a dear, good and loyal friend. I will miss him. Our sympathy goes out to his daughter Elaine and his grandsons and granddaughter, to whom he was devoted. 
As a visitor comes into my office, there is a photo of Bob Atwood and me with our snowmachines in the broad fields near Alyeska, the ski resort in my home town, Girdwood, AK. I cherish those days when I spent time there with Bob, with Evangeline and Elaine Atwood. 
Bob was a true Alaskan--a real pioneer. 
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, our Nation lost one of the genuine heroes of World War II, a man who went on to a distinguished second career in Alaska, when Maj. Gen. Conrad F. `Nick' Necrason died this last month. 
He was the recipient of the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit, and the Distinguished Flying Cross. He also received our State of Alaska's highest military award, the Legion of Merit. 
He began his career at West Point. After his 1936 graduation, he went on to flying school, earning his wings in the Army Air Corps the next year. 
When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, General Necrason was flying to Pearl Harbor as part of a bomber squadron. He loved to tell the story of how he had to land on a golf course during the battle--the attack of the Japanese on Hawaii. 
During World War II, General Necrason flew 360 air combat hours, and was recognized for developing low-level bombing techniques. He flew a whole variety of aircraft, most notably P-38 fighters and B-17 bombers. In 1943, he was wounded in action over Burma. 
A few years later, he flew bombers during the Korean conflict. 
General Necrason came to Alaska at an exciting time, just as statehood dawned, and was commander of the Alaskan Air Command at Elmendorf Air Force Base from 1958 to 1961. 
After retirement in 1965, he became Alaska's Adjutant General and commander of the National Guard, serving from 1967 through 1972, and again from 1974 to 1982. 
During those years, he effected a successful restructuring of the Alaska Army National Guard and the Alaska Air National Guard. 
He brought the great workhorses of the air, C-130's, into service in Alaska, expanded our Eskimo scout contingent by establishing training programs for women, and led the guard in helping Alaska and Alaskans through floods and other natural disasters. 
While many describe him as a soldier's soldier, Nick Necrason was equally as well-liked and at home in the civilian community. 
He was known for his skill at bridge and at poker, and with his wife, Myrle, who survives him, as a gracious host, welcoming people from all parts of our State and our world to their home. 
General Necrason's heroism during combat, his distinguished peacetime career, and his contributions to Alaska will not be forgotten. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife Myrle, daughters Ginger and Sandy, and his grandchildren. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I salute an outstanding military officer, Lt. Gen. Samuel E. Ebbesen, U.S. Army. General Ebbesen is retiring this month with more than 35 years of dedicated service to our country, culminating in assignments as Commanding General, Second United States Army, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Military Personnel Policy. 
In his most recent position, he was responsible for the establishment of all policies concerning military personnel matters including accessions and retention programs; compensation and benefits; and the classification, assignment and career development for the 1.4 million service members of the Department of Defense. His accomplishments were many, resulting in improved quality of life for our service members and the enhanced readiness of our Armed Forces. 
General Ebbesen, a native of St. Croix, VI, was commissioned in 1961 through the Reserve Officer Training Corps [ROTC]. He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science from City College of New York and a Masters degree in public administration from Auburn University. His military schooling includes the Infantry Officer Basic and Advanced Courses, U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, and the Air War College. 
During his distinguished career, General Ebbesen served in numerous leadership and key staff positions throughout the Army. He served as the commanding general, 6th Infantry Division, Light, Fort Wainwright, AK, as the deputy commander, Alaska Command [ALCOM] and as the assistant division commander, 6th Infantry Division, Light. After the division relocated--north of the range--in Alaska, General Ebbesen was instrumental in successfully integrating the 6th Infantry Division--Light--into the Fairbanks community. He fostered strong community relationships which endure today. Under General Ebbesen's tenure, the 6th Infantry Division achieved safety records which were unsurpassed in the United States Army at that time. This record was achieved in spite of adverse and difficult climatic conditions. He ensured that the 6th Infantry Division were pivotal players in the U.S. Pacific Command's Expanded Relations Program throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Further, General Ebbesen significantly improved quality of life for those soldiers and their families stationed throughout Alaska. 
Additionally, General Ebbesen served as the Deputy Chief, Legislative Liaison, Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison, United States Army, Washington, DC; Chief of Staff, I Corps, Fort Lewis, WA; commander, 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, Air Assault, Fort Campbell, KY; Deputy Chief, Plans and Operations Division, and later Executive Officer, Office of the Chief, Legislative Liaison, Office of the Secretary of the Army, Washington, DC; and Commander, 2d Battalion, 32 Infantry, 7th Infantry Division; Executive Officer, 2d Brigade, 7th Infantry Division; and G3, 7th Infantry Division, Fort Ord, CA. 
General Ebbesen's military awards and decorations include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit--with 3 Oak Leaf Clusters, Bronze Star Medal with `V' Device--with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters, Meritorious Service Medal--with Oak Leaf Cluster, Air Medal and Army Commendation Medal--with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters. His combat assignment and training resulted in the award of the Combat Infantry Badge. Expert Infantry Badge, Parachutist Badge, and Air Assault Badge. He is authorized to wear the Army General Staff Identification Badge and the Office of the Secretary of Defense Identification Badge. 
Mr. President, I ask you and our colleagues to join me in saluting General Ebbesen for his distinguished service to this great Nation and to the great State of Alaska, as well as his superb leadership of the men and women of our Armed Forces. It is with great pride that I congratulate him upon his retirement and wish him the very best.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I hope we will agree to vote as quickly as possible, but I do want to say that I welcome this nomination. Madeleine Albright at the United Nations as our Ambassador helped to make the world realize how important it is we conserve the oceans. She assisted in many ways with those of us who are trying to really protect the oceans. I welcome her coming to the Department of State now where I think she can carry on the same fight and help us really deal with the overwhelming problem of assuring that the oceans of the world continue to produce the food that mankind needs.

Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, during the 104th Congress, Senators Breaux, Chafee, Moseley-Braun, Murkowski, Thurmond, Simpson and I introduced legislation (S. 1420) to implement the `Panama Declaration,' an agreement under which twelve nations would comply with a new regime to reduce dolphin mortality and conserve marine resources in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean (ETP). Our bill was approved by voice vote in the Senate Commerce Committee, and its companion (H.R. 2823) was passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives. 
Because of our focus in the second session of the 104th Congress on reauthorizing the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, we were not able to turn to the International Dolphin Conservation Program Act until the closing weeks, and opponents of the measure were able to prevent its passage simply by objecting on the Senate floor. We believe the bill would have passed in the Senate by a large majority if they had not objected. 
I am pleased today to be joined by Senators Breaux, Thurmond, and Murkowski in reintroducing the bill. On September 30, 1996, Majority Leader Lott committed to us that he will do everything he can to provide time on the Senate floor if it is necessary to pass this important measure. 
The Panama Declaration would cap dolphin mortality in the ETP at 5,000 dolphin per year and set a goal of eventually eliminating dolphin mortality altogether in that area. Only twenty years ago, hundreds of thousands of dolphin were being killed each year in the ETP. The Declaration presents the opportunity to lock in a maximum of 5,000 dolphin mortalities per year and strengthen other conservation measures, including measures relating to fishery observers, bycatch reduction, and the protection of specific stocks of dolphins in the ETP. 
The dolphin mortality cap and new conservation measures under the Panama Declaration will only take effect if specific changes are made to U.S. law. The two key changes are: (1) a change to allow tuna caught in compliance with the Panama 
Declaration (including through the encirclement of dolphins) to be imported into the United States; and (2) a change so that `dolphin Safe' in the U.S. will mean tuna caught in a set in which no dolphin mortality occurred (rather than through non-encirclement). Our bill would make these changes and allow the new regime under the Panama Declaration to go forward. If the U.S. does not make the changes, other nations will move forward without adequate conservation measures and significant increases in dolphin mortality may occur. 
Our legislation would guarantee U.S. consumers that no dolphin were killed during the harvest of tuna that is labeled as `dolphin safe.' Under existing law, dolphins may have been killed, but as long as the tuna was not harvested by intentionally encircling dolphins, it can be labeled as `dolphin safe.' To avoid consumer confusion and increase confidence in the `dolphin safe' label, other labels with respect to marine mammals will not be allowed. Only ETP tuna caught without killing any dolphins would be labeled as `dolphin safe.' 
The Administration helped negotiate the Panama Declaration, and the President and Vice President strongly support our legislation to implement it. The bill is also supported by the U.S. tuna boat owners, mainstream environmental groups such as Greenpeace, the Center for Marine Conservation, the Environmental Defense Fund, the National Wildlife Federation, and the World Wildlife Fund, the American Sportfishing Association, the National Fisherman's Union, Seafarers International, and United Industrial Workers, the 12 nations who signed the Panama Declaration (Belize, Columbia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, France, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, Spain, Vanuatu, and Venezuela), and the editorial boards of a number of the major U.S. newspapers.

Mr. STEVENS. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Alaska Wetlands Conservation Act, a bill to conform wetlands protection to the unique conditions found throughout Alaska. 
My State contains more wetlands than all other States combined. Since 1780 we have developed less than 1/10 of one percent of those wetlands. According to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, about 170.2 million acres of wetlands existed in Alaska in the 1780's and about 170 million acres exist today. That represents a negligible loss rate over a period of 217 years. Furthermore almost ninety percent of our wetlands are publicly owned, protected by strict land use designations that guarantee these wetlands will remain intact permanently. 
We Alaskans have substantially conserved our wetlands. Unfortunately Federal policies established to protect and restore wetlands in the southern forty-eight States do not recognize our unique circumstances nor do these policies provide an appropriate level of flexibility in managing the roughly one percent of land available for private or commercial development in Alaska. 
My bill continues to require Alaskans who apply for discharge permits under section 404 of the Clean Water Act to avoid or minimize adverse impacts on wetlands, but it would eliminate requirements to mitigate for unavoidable impacts. It also removes the burden for an applicant to prove that no alternative sites are available. Most of Alaska's communities are surrounded by literally millions of acres of wetland. These areas are made unaccessible under the law for mitigation purposes since they are already protected. In Alaska, mitigation makes no sense except to extort compensatory concessions from applicants which would otherwise not be justified. 
The threat of mitigation sends a chilling message to potential investors by artificially raising the costs of doing business in Alaska. In turn, this contributes to unemployment and weakening the economic self sufficiency of our far flung communities. In the long run, the current program wastes taxpayer money in an ill advised attempt to protect abundant wetlands that are already more than adequately protected in Alaska. The resources at risk in Alaska are not our wetlands, they are our people. 
The blind application of legislation written to protect wetlands elsewhere inhibits reasonable growth by our Native villages and local governments. In effect, the section 404 program has a life threatening choke hold on Native Alaskans. It is difficult to place a stake in the ground in Alaska without impacting a wetland, let alone to build critical infrastructure. Compounding the problem, we have recently seen the Administration begin to phase out nationwide permits. This makes it increasingly difficult to address the huge task facing our local and State officials in providing safe drinking water, sanitation systems, electric power and other critical services to far flung Alaskan communities. Without this bill, the Federal wetlands bureaucracy simply lacks the authority to apply common sense. 
Mr. President, many rural Alaskans are trapped living under third world conditions by well-meaning outsiders and bureaucrats narrowly focused on environmental protection. Unfortunately for Alaska, in this case the problem is larger than protecting our over abundance of wetlands. Wetlands policies conflict with other laws which were passed to promote the economic self sufficiency of Alaskans. My bill would require approval of permit applications with reasonable safeguards for `economic base lands' meaning those lands conveyed under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act or Alaska Statehood Act, both acts intended to provide the means for Alaskans to achieve economic self sufficiency. 
The Alaska Wetlands Conservation Act is a common sense approach to Alaska's circumstances. It maintains flexibility to protect wetlands without hurting people. With respect to existing activities related to airport safety, logging, mining, ice pads and roads, and snow removal or storage, the bill prevents Alaskans from having to obtain section 404 permits to continue those activities. The bill would also require the Army Corps of Engineers to approve general wetlands permits with reasonable safeguards for specific categories of activities if the general permit is requested by the State of Alaska. 
There has been negligible benefit to the environment in Alaska as a result of the expansive wetlands regulations issued by bureaucrats inside the beltway. On the other hand, the harm caused by overzealous Federal wetlands police is documented in many examples of bureaucratic delay, expense and irrational decision making. Ask the Mayor of Juneau how the Federal Government handled that city's application for a general permit. It is a national disgrace simply because laws intended to protect scarce wetlands elsewhere were strictly applied in an area of abundance. This bill restores rational decision making authority to those closest to the wetlands situation of Alaska. I encourage my colleagues in the Senate and the House to act expeditiously on my proposed remedy.
