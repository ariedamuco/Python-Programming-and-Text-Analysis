   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to respond very briefly on behalf of this Senator, and I think I speak for the entire body when I say thank you to Senator SPENCE ABRAHAM from Michigan for his contributions, his leadership, his effectiveness. 
   My grandfather Hagel used to occasionally pay the highest compliment to an individual when he would say: He is a good man. 
   Well, SPENCE ABRAHAM is a good man. He will go on to do other very significant things with his life, with his talent, with his leadership. We will all be well served. It will impact the future of his children and our children, just as his service in the Senate has made this a better institution and a stronger Nation. 
   I have been privileged to serve with SPENCE ABRAHAM, be his seatmate here on the Senate floor, and become a good friend. Of that friendship and that service, I am proud. I thank Senator ABRAHAM. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this morning to reflect on the service of our 11 colleagues who will be completing their Senate service in the next few days. Hugh Sidey, one of the great journalists and political observers of our time, who covered eight Presidents and became well acquainted with those Presidents, once said that ``politics, after all is said and done, is the business of belief and enthusiasm. Hope energizes, doubt destroys. Hopelessness is not our heritage.'' So said Mr. Sidey. Aside from the fact that he has Nebraska roots, which I suspect reflects some element of his good judgment, he is right. 
   As we reflect on the service of these 11 individuals who will be leaving this institution, the one common denominator that anchored the 11 was commitment to something bigger than themselves: service to this country. The 11 individuals reflect our society, as does this body, from the States they represented, to their backgrounds, to their commitments. That, too, represented what may be this country's greatest strength and that is its diversity. 
   As TOM DASCHLE mentioned last night at the Supreme Court dinner, in the history of this institution, only 1,853 men and women have ever served  here. Now, we will increase that number on January 3. But the 11 colleagues and friends who leave this institution are among those 1,853 individuals who have served and are now serving. 
   I think it is worthy to bring some note to these 11 individuals. They have been honored and recognized throughout this year, and very appropriately so, individually by many Members of this body, but I wish, in the few minutes I have, to maybe tie some more general themes together about why these 11 men have been so important together to this body. 
   We begin by asking the question: Who are these 11 bold, different, distinguished citizens? 
   Well, first, they are from all parts of the country. They are of different religions. They are fathers, husbands, brothers, uncles, and grandfathers. Scattered among these 11, of course, are Republicans and Democrats, maybe liberals, maybe some conservatives, and maybe some moderates. 
   As we look further, we find the veterans--World War II veterans, Vietnam war veterans. One among them is my friend and colleague from Nebraska, Senator BOB KERREY, who holds the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
   We have war heroes and veterans among these 11. We have former Governors, former attorneys general, ambassadors, businessmen, journalists, lawyers, and bankers--all representing the fiber of this country, all representing the different universes of this country that tie us together as a nation. Surely among the 11 is one of the preeminent public servants of our time, Senator MOYNIHAN from New York. 
   At a time when the world peers in the large window of the front room of American politics--in some cases they may be bewildered by what they are seeing in this country, that we can't seem to elect a President--it is even more important that we spend some time reflecting on these 11 individuals because, as we know, this country will produce a President. That President will govern. That President will be effective. And the institution of the U.S. Senate will be very much a part of assisting that President in governing this country, which has immense consequences for the world. 
   If there is a question about unsteadiness in this country or our institutions, again we need only reference the 11 Senators who will be leaving this body because there was nothing unsteady about these 11 individuals. They were anchored to a Constitution that has been the roadmap for this great country for over 200 years, and that has ensured the liberties, the privileges, and the rights that these 11 individuals fought for, debated over, and made stronger. 
   These 11 Senators brought unique experience and perspectives. They applied those in their own ways and in their own individual styles, which again has added to the richness of the culture of this institution and reflects the richness and the culture of this country. Every new Senator we bring on and every Senator who leaves has had a part in stitching the fabric--and continues to stitch the fabric--of this country. 
   At a time when we question the institutional structures, the procedures and the processes, we must not forget that it is the individual that has made this country what it is. De Tocqueville wrote about it in the mid-19th century. When he observed America and wrote at that point the most authoritative document on America, he said the most amazing thing about America was the magic of America. He said it was the individual. It was individual commitment. It was freedom. That was the magic of America. 
   Arnold Toynbee, who probably wrote the most definitive book on the civilization of mankind as he documented the 21 civilizations of the world, wrote that each civilization begins with a challenge and a response. 
   Surely, as we reflect on these 11 Senators, each of their lives is a remarkable story. Each has been, as Toynbee wrote in his study of history, a challenge and response. That is what representative government is about. But it cannot function without the individual commitment of people such as these 11 distinguished Americans who leave this body. 
   Yes, they helped chart a course for this country. And, yes, they helped fulfill the destiny of this country. Yes, they understood exactly what Hugh Sidey said--that hopelessness is not our heritage. They understood that as well as any 11 people in the history of this country. 
   But they did something equally remarkable in that they inspired others. 
   I suspect, as you go across those 11 States represented by these 11 Senators, and go into schools and talk to teachers and young men and women who watched PAT MOYNIHAN, BOB KERREY, FRANK LAUTENBERG, and CONNIE MACK, they would have a story. They would have some dynamic to their personal lives that somehow would be tied back to leadership and the inspiration of one of these 11 Senators. In the end, that is our highest obligation in public service. In the end, that is the most important thing we can do. 
   Not just for the RECORD but because it is important that we hear the list of these names, I would like to read the list of these 11 Senators: 
   Senator SPENCE ABRAHAM from Michigan; 
   Senator JOHN ASHCROFT from Missouri; 
   Senator RICHARD BRYAN from Nevada; 
   Senator SLADE GORTON from Washington; 
   Senator ROD GRAMS from Minnesota; 
   Senator BOB KERREY from Nebraska; 
   Senator FRANK LAUTENBERG from New Jersey; 
   Senator CONNIE MACK from Florida; 
   Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN from New York; 
   Senator CHUCK ROBB from Virginia; 
   And Senator BILL ROTH from Delaware. 
   They have accomplished, each in their own way but, more importantly, together as part of this institution, a remarkable number of things in their careers. Many will go on and do other things. All will stay active. All will stay committed to this country. 
   What they have done, for which we all are grateful and for which America is grateful, deserves immense recognition; that is, they leave this great institution stronger and better because of their service. Therefore, they leave America stronger and better because of their service. 
   Mr. President, thank you for allowing me some time to talk about our colleagues whom all of us will miss. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, as you know, current law requires that for a military retiree to receive his VA disability compensation he must waive an equal part of his retirement pay. This issue is frequently referred to as ``concurrent receipt,'' because it would involve the simultaneous receipt of two types of benefits. 
   The service connected disabled military retiree is the only person that is forced to pay for their own disability compensation. A worker in private industry is not forced to pay for his own disability. Likewise, local, State and federal civil servants, appointed and elected officials are not forced to pay for their own disability compensation. 
   For several years I have worked closely with military retirees and veterans organizations to change the law to permit receipt of all deserved benefits. This is a step that this Congress must take. It is unfair that a person who serves his or her country and has a service-connected disability can't draw both benefits. 
   Legislation to fix concurrent receipt has been introduced during the past several Congresses. Last year, thanks in great part to the efforts of the Chairman and the Ranking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the Senate took a first step towards fixing this problem by authorizing a concurrent receipt provision for severely disabled military retirees. The existing concurrent receipt restrictions, however, remain in effect. 
   This year, the Senate again made an effort to solve the concurrent receipt problem. During debate on the Department of Defense Authorization bill, the Senate included an amendment to completely repeal concurrent receipt laws. This would allow all veterans to receive their full disability compensation along with their retired pay. When the conference report to the Defense Authorization bill reached desk of the conferees, however, they were faced with an insurmountable financial problem. 
   The Defense Authorization conference report that is being considered today contains crucial provisions that will enable the government to fulfill its first priority: to provide a strong national defense. In addition, the Act contains significant and necessary increases in overall defense spending, especially directed at improving morale and retention. One of the most important of these provisions is an amendment, fulfilling a broken promise, which will give the same health care benefits to military retirees as those available to active duty service members. Therefore, I will support the Defense Authorization bill. 
   However, I want to take this opportunity to declare my intentions and to call upon my colleagues for their support. As part of the annual budget process next year, I will work with my colleague from Nevada, Mr. REID, who has dedicated a great deal of time to this effort, to include budget cap room for concurrent receipt. 
   I want to remind my colleagues, the service connected disabled military retiree is the only person who is forced to pay for his own disability compensation. It is simply unfair that a person who serves his or her country and has a service-connected disability can't draw both his VA and disability benefits concurrently. 
   This is a situation that must be fixed and I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that our servicemembers, active duty and retired, receive the full benefits that they deserve.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, few individuals ever touch the lives of people like the late Mike McKevitt did. Former Congressman and Assistant U.S. Attorney General James D. ``Mike'' McKevitt passed away last week here in Washington, DC. He was a remarkable man, a selfless public servant, and a loyal friend. He was always working on behalf of others to make the world better. 
   His positive attitude, personal warmth and absolute sense of fair play were most unique in a far too often cynical, and mean-spirited town called Washington, DC. For 30 years, he rose above the pettiness, nonsense and nastiness that often dominates the environment of the world's most powerful city. He made it more fun to be here. He made it all seem more noble than most of it is. 
   We will all miss Mike McKevitt. We are all better because of him. Our prayers and thoughts go out to his wonderful wife Judy and his daughters and grandchildren.

    Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to amend title XII of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961. Title XII describes the relationship between American universities and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), with respect to USAID's international agriculture development programs. I am pleased to be joined in introducing this bill by my distinguished colleague from Delaware, Senator BIDEN. 
   This bill revitalizes the relationship between our universities, their public and private partners, and USAID. It reflects the fact that agriculture development work has changed dramatically in the past few years. For example, universities have long been important partners in the United States' efforts to promote agricultural development and decrease world hunger, but universities are no longer ivory towers. They now work with a variety of public and private partners to carry out agriculture-related assistance projects. This bill authorizes universities to utilize such partners when carrying out projects for USAID. 
   The bill also reflects the fact that agriculture development work increasingly focuses on income generation, rather than simply on household subsistence production. In addition to helping farmers grow enough to feed their immediate families, foreign agricultural assistance should also help farmers market and sell their products, and maximize their household income. This bill recognizes this new focus on income generation as a goal of American foreign agricultural assistance programs. 
   Lastly, the bill reflects the fact that sustainable development has increased in importance. Environmental and natural resource issues should be considered as part of the big picture in agriculture development.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, the one driving factor in the advancement of mankind has been energy. Fire, oil for heat and lamps, water mills, coal, electricity, refined oil, hydro power, nuclear power. Advancements in energy have fueled the great advancements of civilization. 
   Today, energy touches every facet of our lives. It heats, cools, powers, and lights our homes, our places of business, our schools, and our hospitals. It fuels our modes of transportation whether on road, rail, sea, or air. It powers up our computers, the Internet and the information superhighway. It goes into the production of food, medicine, clothing, and every consumer product ranging from household appliances to health and beauty products. It allows the stock markets to open each morning around the world. It powers the transactions of commerce and business. It fuels the planes, ships, tanks, submarines, and weapons that protect America. 
   Energy is the great connector. It fuels the productive capacity of the world. It affects world stability. 
   Energy is serious business. America must have a national energy policy that ensures we have reliable, stable, and affordable sources of energy. This cannot be neglected. To do so leaves our Nation vulnerable on all fronts. 
   Energy policy ties together America's economy, standard of living, national security, and our geopolitical strategic interests around the world--and our future. 
   Perhaps the area where energy has the most immediate and visible effect is on the pocketbooks of individual Americans and the economic growth of our Nation. 
   Oil prices have more than tripled in less than 2 years, to nearly $37 a barrel this week--the highest price since the buildup to the Persian Gulf war in November of 1990. The President of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, OPEC, said last Friday that the price of oil may temporarily hit $40 a barrel this winter. I suspect we might see $50 a barrel in the next few months. 
   American consumers have felt this most immediately at the gas pimp. 
   This winter, consumers are likely to feel an even stronger bite when they heat their homes. Natural gas and home heating oil prices are also on the rise. The prices for natural gas, which is used to heat 58 million homes, have doubled since the beginning of the year. Customers of heating oil, including more than one-third of the homeowners in the Northeastern part of the United States may pay more than $2 a gallon--or twice the current price--to heat their homes this winter. 
   As energy prices rise this winter, Americans will again be reminded of the lessons we learned in the 1970s about the volatility of energy prices and the impact on our economy. The forecasts are not optimistic. Said Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Center for Global Energy Studies, ``I think the only thing we can do is pray for a very warm winter.'' Praying for a warm winter is not an energy policy. 
   The concern over natural gas prices is so great that on Wednesday, several of our Nation's Governors met in Columbus, Ohio, to discuss the ``natural gas crisis.'' 
   And it is not just gasoline, natural gas and heating oil prices that are affected by the current energy predicament. It is all energy. Over the past 12 months, costs paid by consumers for all forms of energy have increased by 13 percent. 
   High energy costs ripple through the economy. They drive up inflation. Then deflation. The Consumer Price Index has risen 3.4 percent in the last year, with energy price increases responsible for nearly one-quarter of that increase. 
   It also saps the strength of our economy. Energy fuels economic growth. ``Oil shocks'' send a shock through the economy, increasing prices for everything that uses energy. It is a draining force on our society and economy. When consumers are forced to spend more on energy, they spend less on other items. 
   Higher energy prices increase the cost of doing business, of moving goods, of manufacturing, and of farming. 
   We are seeing the beginning of the consequences of higher fuel costs in Europe. Protests virtually shut down Great Britain last week, at one point more than 90 percent of their petrol stations were dry. These protests blocked transportation and caused disruption in medical services, postal delivery, education, and food supply. As a matter of fact, for the first time since the years after World War II, Great  Britain had to ration food. Great Britain, one of the great powers of our time had to ration food at the supermarkets last week, and they introduced a policy of one loaf of bread per customer. The British Chambers of Commerce estimated that the protests cost Britain's economy $351 million per day. These protests erupted throughout Europe. In almost every country in Europe there were protests. 
   High energy prices will dramatically affect the United States, Europe, Japan, and other industrialized nations. But these industrialized nations' economies are better prepared to cushion the heavy blow than the recovering economies in Asia, developing countries, and emerging market economies. These nations, including South Korea and Taiwan, still depend on such heavy industries as steel production for their economic growth. Studies have shown that if oil prices do not fall quickly, these economies could lose at least 2 percent of their gross national product this year. 
   One of Europe's central bankers has predicted that the current spike in oil prices could cut a full percentage point off the GDP growth expected around the world during the next 12 months. This is an awesome number when you step back and understand what that means. And what that means is catastrophe. The President of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, echoed these fears in an interview in the International Herald Tribune. He predicted a $10 shift in oil prices could decrease global economic growth by at least one-half of a percentage point. 
   In the United States, a slowdown in economic growth due to higher energy prices will have a negative impact on our Federal budget. The assumptions for projected Federal budget surpluses over the next 10 years do not take into account what would happen if high energy prices or energy shortages stalled our economy. 
   Where then would be our proposals to finance new prescription drug plans for Medicare recipients, provide more funding for education, grapple with the restructuring of our entitlement programs, and much-needed funds to improve our Nation's military? Where then would the money come from? The money needed to fund these areas of the Federal budget and pay down our national debt would have gone up in smoke--literally. 
   Other countries would be affected in the same way. High energy prices affect nations the same way they affect individual households--the more money spent on energy, the less there is available for other priorities. 
   But this has broader implications than budgetary issues. Increasing energy prices will affect efforts to improve the environment. In recent years, we have made great strides in working with developing nations to help them use responsible measures to grow their economies. But they will do what they must do to survive. If their national self-interests are at stake, they will clear cut forests to grow food, and they will not consider environmental measures. They will draw natural resources from wherever they can get them. They will abandon efforts to upgrade to cleaner technologies and stay with their dirty smokestacks and other energy-producing methods that damage the environment, if energy costs go too high. 
   The price of oil also has broad national security implications, as you know so well. These broad national security implications to the United States are there because we are so reliant on foreign sources for our supply of crude oil. 
   During 1973, at the peak of the energy crisis, we relied on foreign sources of oil for 35 percent of our domestic supply. Since that time, we have become more--not less--dependent on foreign oil. Today, we import almost 60 percent of the oil used in the United States. The Department of Energy estimates that we will at least be 65-percent reliant on foreign oil by 2020. 
   The response to the current high oil prices by the Clinton administration has been to try and cajole oil-exporting nations to increase production in an effort to lower prices. U.S. Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson has said, regarding the pressure on OPEC nations: ``Our quiet diplomacy is working.'' I ask, what diplomacy? 
   Crude oil is at a record high. We import more oil than we did during the energy crisis in the 1970s, spending more than $300 million a day. Petroleum accounts for one-third of the U.S. total trade deficit. 
   Who are we kidding? This has bigger implications than high gas prices. In February 1995, President Clinton issued the following statement:  
   ......the nation's growing reliance on imports of crude oil and refined petroleum products threatens the nation's security because they increase U.S. vulnerability to oil supply interruptions.......I concur with the Department's recommendation that the Administration continue its present efforts to improve U.S. energy security.  
   Yet through the Clinton-Gore administration policies, this administration has discouraged, and in many cases blocked, American oil and gas producers from increasing domestic production. Since that time, we have increased our use of oil and turned more and more to foreign countries to supply the oil we use. We import 1.5 million barrels of oil more per day than we did 5 years ago. That is an increase of nearly 22 percent in the last 5 years. Therefore, it should not be surprising that President Clinton issued a nearly identical ruling on March 24 of this year, stating again that oil imports threaten U.S. national security. 
   High energy prices also impact the security of other nations and threaten global stability. Energy fuels the productive capacity of national economies. The adverse effect of high energy prices can cause instability in emerging 
   democracies and in market economies, which then can quickly erupt into regional turmoil, conflict, and war, devastating all prospects for growth, prosperity, and for eliminating hunger and poverty. 
   The contributing factors to the current high oil prices demonstrate the geopolitical consequences of energy, and the leverage granted to oil-exporting nations. Prices have increased for oil and natural gas because supply has not kept pace with demand. From 1994 to 1999, global oil consumption grew by almost 10 percent, while production rose only at about 7 percent. 
   Do we have a supply problem? Of course we have a supply problem. When demand stretches supply to the breaking point, the result is rationing. What a dangerous, dangerous development--the rationing of energy. 
   When the price of oil fell dramatically a few years ago, drilling companies cut back on their exploration of both oil and natural gas. They reduced their spending. There was a drastic decline in global drilling during 1998, 1999, and early this year. Astonishingly, there are only about 40 percent as many drilling rigs working today as there were in the early 1980s. Even OPEC nations must constantly drill to offset depletion. Low levels of drilling reflect a capital shortage, and the result is that oil production has been falling continuously in the United States; it is stable or falling in the North Sea; it is falling in most of Latin America; and it is not growing hardly anywhere else in the world. Capital not invested in energy production a few years ago is now reflected in lower supplies and product. 
   During this time, global demand for oil has increased, fueled by a strong U.S. economy--which we all applaud, which we all take advantage of, and which we based projected surpluses on--economic growth in Europe, and a stronger than expected economic recovery in Asia, which are all responsible for this demand. 
   The economic growth of developing nations is a very energy-intensive exercise, we must know. China and India show oil demand growing at nearly 8 percent a year on a sustained basis. This increased demand, coupled with low supplies, has pushed oil reserves near their limits worldwide. Inventories are at low levels. In most industrialized nations, it will take many years to correct the imbalance between supply and demand. 
   In addition to current inventories, the oil industry normally has another cushion to use to meet increased demand. This is called ``spare capacity'' or unused wells that can be called on to produce additional supplies when necessary. 
   Turning on these spigots can help correct the imbalance between supply and demand. However, except for the days of the gulf war, the world's spare capacity is at its lowest point since the days leading up to the 1973 energy crisis--less than 3 million barrels per day.  Therefore, the world oil market is very tight and very vulnerable to supply disruptions and price fluctuations. A further tightening of the market could lead to the kind of energy rationing we saw in the 1970s. 
   The situation is even worse in the natural gas market, especially for North America. 
   But correcting imbalances of supply and demand in oil markets is very different from traditional economic models. Oil does not move on a free market. The demand is 
   given--individuals and nations do not have a choice about whether they need energy or not, and oil is still the greatest source of global energy in the world today. Its production is concentrated in the hands of a few who have the ability to control the flow of oil into the market and, thereby, the price of this commodity. This makes oil a political commodity. 
   Our reliance on foreign oil leaves the U.S. vulnerable to the whims of foreign oil cartels. If something happened to threaten this supply, we could not turn on the spigots here in the United States overnight. 
   A tight oil market gives additional leverage to individual oil-exporting nations. Half of the world's spare production capacity today now is in Saudi Arabia. Iraq, interestingly enough--Iraq, whom we bombed almost daily--is the fastest growing source of U.S. oil imports. We import about 750,000 barrels of oil a day from Iraq. 
   What if Saddam Hussein were to decide to bully the market by turning off its tap, which currently pumps 2.3 million barrels a day on to the global market? 
   On Monday, he warned that OPEC nations were bowing to pressures from--in his words--``superpowers'' in agreeing to increase production in an attempt to lower prices. He said, ``The superpowers will fasten their grip on oil producing countries.'' This is a very dangerous development. 
   Our allies, of course, would be even more vulnerable to threats from oil-producing nations because Europe and Japan are even more dependent than the U.S. on foreign oil. 
   How did we, the United States, get ourselves into this precarious position? 
   How did we get here? We have bumbled into it because we were not paying attention. Every administration in the last 25 years must share some responsibility for where we are today. But in particular, this administration, the Clinton-Gore administration, has drifted through the last 8 years without an energy policy, content to sit back and enjoy a good economy--of course, to take credit for that economy--but unwilling to prepare our Nation for the challenges ahead and make the tough choices and hard decisions necessary for energy independence. 
   The lack of a Federal energy policy for the last 8 years has worked to decrease U.S. oil production, making American consumers more vulnerable to the volatility of prices set by oil cartels such as OPEC. The wild swings in price over the last 2 years have hurt U.S. oil and gas producers and shut down many drilling wells because of instability in the markets, loss of investment capital, loss of qualified employees, and elimination of the petroleum infrastructure. 
   The lack of an overall policy has made U.S. producers more susceptible to the manipulation of prices by cartels such as OPEC. In testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in March, Denise Bode, an Oklahoma corporation commissioner, discussed the impact of OPEC's manipulation on oil markets:  
   Whatever OPEC's motivation, the impact on American petroleum production is that each time this happens, they make the domestic oil and gas production industry in America a little less predictable, driving away capital, qualified oil field employees and scrapping petroleum infrastructure.......  
   The policies of this administration have actually served to discourage and at some point completely block or shut off 
   domestic oil and natural gas production. While oil consumption in the United States has risen by 14 percent since 1992, over the last 8 years U.S. crude oil production has dropped by 17 percent. The number of American jobs in exploring and producing oil and gas has declined by 27 percent. The number of working oil rigs has declined by 77 percent. This administration has failed to encourage viable energy alternatives. They pursue policies promoted by environmentalists with no comprehension or acknowledgment of the consequences of these policies and what these consequences are for real Americans, for our economy, our Nation, and our future. 
   This administration has blocked exploration in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge which could contain 16 billion barrels of domestic crude oil. In 1995, President Clinton vetoed legislation to allow any exploration in Alaska. In 1998, President Clinton closed most of the Federal Outer Continental Shelf to any exploration until the year 2012. 
   Vice President Gore has vowed to prohibit any future exploration for oil and natural gas on the Outer Continental Shelf. Increased Government regulations over the last 8 years have affected investment in our energy industry. Thirty-six oil refineries have been closed in the last 8 years, and no major oil refinery has been built in the last 25 years. This is in part due to the requirements of the Clean Air Act that make it difficult to build or upgrade any refineries. 
   EPA regulation has placed more and more and more burdens on fewer and fewer oil refineries by forcing them to produce reformulated gasoline for different markets. Use of hydroelectric power has been sharply declining due to the onerous regulatory burdens on the industry. This administration does not consider water to be a renewable resource--that is the definition by this administration of ``water''--and has even advocated taking down current valuable hydroelectric dams in the Pacific Northwest that supply power. 
   Nuclear energy has not been promoted as a clean energy alternative by this administration. No new plants are scheduled to begin operating. This administration has steadfastly opposed and recently vetoed legislation that would ensure timely construction of a desperately needed Federal storage facility for spent nuclear fuel. In addition, virtually all nuclear operating licenses are up for renewal by 2015. Yet the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has indicated it expects no more than 85 of the 103 units will file renewals. That means we will be taking out of current service, at a minimum, 18 nuclear powerplants in the next few years. Where in the world are we going to recover that capacity? Where will that capacity come from? We don't talk about that. 
   Furthermore, this administration, while professing a desire to increase natural gas as a source of energy, works constantly against efforts to increase the availability of domestic natural gas. The National Petroleum Council has identified a critical barrier to increasing supplies of natural gas: Access to over 200 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves is either off limits or is being severely restricted on multiple-use lands and the Outer Continental Shelf. 
   This administration says, well, use natural gas but just don't drill for it. This administration's budget clearly demonstrates where its energy priorities are. This year's Department of Energy budget, submitted by this administration, has $1.2 billion for climate change activities, but yet it has 
   only $92 million for oil, gas, and energy research and development--a clear statement on where they are with their priorities. An energy policy that emphasizes only some energy sources and priorities without regard for their negative impacts on energy markets threatens the sustainability of this economy, the welfare of our people, the stability of the world, and the future of this country. 
   What can we do to address this problem? Can we address this problem? Of course, we can address this problem. Both the next President and the Congress must pursue a comprehensive energy policy that decreases our reliance on foreign oil by increasing the safe, environmentally sound production of our domestic oil and gas resources and by developing a more diversified supply of energy sources. 
   The answer is not, as Vice President Gore recommended yesterday, to tap into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. These 570 million barrels were set aside to deal with severe disruptions in oil supply caused by war or other national emergencies. 
   The strategic reserve was not created to make up for 8 years of inattention from the Clinton-Gore administration  or to make up for the detrimental impact their policies have had on domestic production. The Vice President himself acknowledged in February this statement when he said it would be a ``bad idea''--his words --to tap into the strategic reserve. And so has the President's Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Summers; as has the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Greenspan. 
   Furthermore, opening up the strategic reserve will not do anything to address the shortage of home heating oil. Why? The strategic reserve consists of crude oil. It would need to be refined into heating oil, and our refineries are already running at full capacity. If we still had the 36 refineries that were shut down over the last 8 years of this administration, then we might be able to refine that extra oil from the strategic reserve, but it does nothing to help our current situation. It is bad policy, shortsighted policy. 
   In addition to augmenting domestic oil production, the United States must explore other future energy options that will reduce other foreign oil dependency. Our Nation's future is directly connected to energy capacity. If we fail this great challenge, our children and history will judge us harshly and we will leave the world more dangerous than we found it. That is not our heritage. That is not our destiny. It will require bold, forceful, intelligent new leadership. That is America's heritage. That is America's destiny. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I would like to make a brief statement about a man who in every way embodied the spirit and reality of an American patriot. Seldom does one have an opportunity to bump into someone during life's journey who has affected events of our time. Such a man was retired Marine Corps Colonel Bill Corson who passed away in July. 
   His passing reminds us all of our own mortality and destiny and how important it is to live our lives with honor and dignity. That is how Bill Corson lived his. It was a privilege to know him. I will miss his wise counsel and friendship. 
   I first met Bill in 1981 when I was serving as the Deputy Administrator of the Veterans Administration. He was a man who was deeply and unselfishly devoted to his country. Bill left college and enlisted in the Marine Corps during World War II. He served in Korea and Vietnam. His decorations included the Navy Commendation Medal with Combat ``V.'' He spent most of his career on special assignment with the CIA, the White House, the Marine Corps, and the State Department. Bill went on to teach at the U.S. Naval Academy and write several books on national security issues. 
   Bill was relentless in the pursuit of meeting the challenges faced by the country he loved so much. He was a man of immense integrity, a man of knowledge, a man of ability, a man of compassion, a man of faith, who always gave his country his best. And America is stronger today because of this remarkable man. 
   He was a friend of mine, and I extend heartfelt condolences to his wife Judy and his family.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, first, before we get on to today's schedule, I wish to commend my friend, the guest Chaplain, this morning. Father Damian is extended best wishes and thanks from this body. Father Damian and I share a few things in common. One is we graduated from the same high school just a few years apart--actually, Mr. President, many years apart. Father Damian had the unenviable task of trying to redefine the standards that my brothers and I debased at St. Bonaventure High School and Scotus High School in Columbus, NE--not an easy task but one that he achieved with great dignity and success. 
   We are very proud of Father Damian for many reasons. He is pastor of two Catholic parishes in Omaha--St. Agnes and Our Lady of Guadalupe in south Omaha. 
   Mr. President, you know a little bit about ethnic areas, coming from Colorado. Father Damian has done as much to bring the Hispanic community of Nebraska--indeed, middle America--together as any one individual I have known in the last few years, and he has done it with remarkable ability, with common sense and truth. People respect him not just because he wears the Lord's uniform but because he has done it the right way; he brings respect and dignity to all whom he touches; he conveys that as he deals with people. We are very proud of what he has been able to accomplish in our community and across the Midwest, aside from being nationally recognized for his achievements with many recognitions and honors. We are very proud to have him among us this morning. 
   And again, on a personal note, it is wonderful to see Father Damian after making the trek to Washington. Under the able tutelage of our resident Chaplain, Dr. Lloyd Ogilvie, I know he has learned much this morning.

   Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Senator. As a matter of fact, as the Senator knows, there was a little reception and party for my distinguished senior colleague, Senator KERREY of Nebraska, last night. Father Damian was able to participate and extend his long arm of justice and spiritual guidance over that gathering, even in the midst of some bandits who attended. The real coup de grace of last night's event was the distinguished senior Senator from New York toasting our colleague, Senator KERREY--an old Navy toast. I observed that I never believed that serving in the Navy was a particular virtue, but nonetheless he was toasted with the Senator's eloquent remarks. 
   I thank the Senator.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today the Senate will resume debate on the China PNTR legislation. Under the order, the time until 10 a.m. will be equally divided for closing remarks on the Byrd amendment regarding subsidies. Therefore, the first vote of the day will occur at 10 a.m. I understand there may be a possibility that Senator BYRD will request a voice vote rather than a rollcall vote. But depending on that request, following the vote, debate will resume on the Thompson amendment No. 4132. The Senate will recess for the weekly party conferences from 12:30 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. At 2:15, Senator HELMS will be recognized to offer an amendment which will be debated at that time. Further amendments are anticipated; therefore, Senators can expect votes throughout the day and into the evening. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this morning to urge my colleagues to oppose the Thompson amendment. 
   First, this is not a debate about whether national security or trade is the highest responsibility and priority of our Government. Of course, America's national security takes precedence over all other priorities. It is not helpful when we in this Chamber hear references to putting ``trade dollars and business interests ahead of national security.'' There is not one Member in this body who does not put America's national security interests ahead of all other interests, including trade interests. The national security interests of this country come first for all of us. 
   That is not the issue. We need to understand very clearly the underlying bill granting China permanent normal trade relations. In granting PNTR to China, we allow our businesses and farmers the opportunity to take advantage of all the far reaching market-opening concessions China made to the United States when it signed the bilateral trade agreement with America last November. PNTR does not change or does not enhance China's access to America's markets. China has had access to our markets for years. It changes America's access to China's markets, which we have not had. There are no American trade concessions to China in PNTR. Our markets have long been open to China. 
   Voting down PNTR means throwing away what the Chinese have finally agreed to do--give to our businesses and farmers a fair shot at their markets. We must be perfectly clear on this point as we continue this debate on PNTR. That is the issue. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose the Thompson amendment, not because I think Senator THOMPSON is wrong about proliferation; quite the opposite. The proliferation of missile technology and weapons of mass destruction clearly represents one of the most serious threats to the security of the United States. It is precisely because it is such a serious problem, with real implications for all Americans--by the way, implications for the world--that it needs to be treated seriously and responsibly. 
   Tacking this amendment to PNTR without any consideration in any committee of jurisdiction, without one hearing from proliferation experts,  without understanding the national security, geopolitical, and economic consequences for America, would be irresponsible. 
   Every Senator in this body agrees with Senator THOMPSON about the importance of stemming the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction technology. I strongly disagree with his approach. His amendment would be bad for American nonproliferation efforts, bad for America's economic and trade interests, and bad for American national security. Proliferation is a global problem with implications for the security of the United States and all of our allies and friends across the world. 
   We cannot deal effectively with proliferation on a unilateral basis. That approach will be ineffective and will only diminish our ability to influence the proliferator. We must have the help of our allies and our friends. It is folly to believe that unilateral sanctions by one nation will stop any nation from its proliferation activities, if that is the intent. It isn't that simple. History has shown clearly that 
   unilateral sanctions are unworkable tools of foreign policy. They end up injuring the interests of the sanctioning nation. The only time a unilateral sanction may be effective is when it covers a unique American product or technology for which there is no foreign availability. Most of all, the items and technologies covered by the Thompson amendment do not fit this category. If we prohibit the sale of these items and technologies without ensuring that our allies and friends are on board, we simply diminish our influence over the target country. At the heart of the debate is how best to influence the behavior of proliferating nations. 
   Unilateral sanctions will not encourage more responsible behavior on the part of China or any other country. This amendment might terminate a number of assistance programs that are clearly in America's interests to continue. For example, one of the sanctions in the Thompson amendment calls for a cutoff in Export-Import Bank financing for exports to the target country. Now, Export-Import Bank financing is designed to assist American exporters in their efforts to compete in foreign markets for business. It does not and has never been designed to assist foreigners. Cutting off Export-Import Bank financing hurts American exports. It is hard to imagine how this could have a positive effect on the target country's proliferation behavior. 
   The American people are going to elect a new American President in 2 short months. Proliferation will be a major issue for the new President. The new President and his team must come up with a comprehensive strategy for dealing with it. It is not in the best interests of our national security to handicap our new President by tying his hands with the provisions in this amendment. 
   I believe that China's entry into the WTO, the World Trade Organization, and our granting of PNTR to China, is of enormous strategic importance to the United States. It is not only a matter of trade. It is not only about leveling the playing field for American businesses and farmers who have never had a fair shot at China's markets. At its core, it is about helping to set China on the road to becoming a responsible member of the global community. It is about taking advantage of an unprecedented opportunity to help the Chinese people gain more control over their own destinies. 
   We have heard, over the last few days, about human rights, religious rights, freedoms. All encompass this dynamic. Do we believe that we influence the behavior of a totalitarian nation to be better to its people and give its people more opportunities and enhance their lives, give them more control over their own destinies, by walking away from such a relationship? I do not think so. It has never been proven to be the case in history, and I do not think it will be proven to be the case this time. 
   WTO membership does not permit the Chinese Government to exercise the kind of control over people's lives as it has over the past 50 years. Membership in the WTO requires the Chinese Government to undertake painful economic and legal reforms and to open its markets, open its society. Is this perfect? Of course not. Are there flaws? Of course there are. Are there imperfections? Of course there are. Will there be problems implementing it? Of course there will be. All of these things are in America's strategic interest, however. We need to support China's accession to the WTO and grant them PNTR. 
   But if we attach this amendment, then we will not pass PNTR this year. As my friend from Iowa so succinctly put it: It will go down. And in whose best interest is that? Let us not forget that trade and prosperity encourage and enhance freedom, peace, and stability in the world. 
   This amendment would also have a negative impact on our ability to gather intelligence on proliferators. The amendment requires the President to report to the Congress the names of every suspected proliferator in an unclassified report. Although this amendment urges the President to do this in a way that protects sensitive intelligence sources, it is unclear, of course, how that will happen. How will sources be protected if Congress follows the expedited voting procedures in this amendment for overturning a Presidential determination that sanctions should not be imposed for national security reasons? How will we debate the correctness of the President's decision without talking about the intelligence information that led to the President's decision in the first place? It is impossible. Do we believe that by exposing our intelligence sources, by telling the world what we suspect or know, we can have a positive effect on proliferation? 
   We invest millions and millions of dollars and engage in multiyear projects to gain intelligence on proliferation activities around the world. We should not jeopardize that effort by having the President issue an unclassified report to Congress that lays out exactly what we know and how we were able to determine what we know. 
   The amendment also seeks to involve our capital markets in foreign policy issues. I do not think--and this is as kindly as I can say it--that this is a wise course of action under any circumstances. America is stronger because the world regards 
   our markets, our capital markets, our financial markets, as the most trustworthy, honest, stable, and most fairly regulated in the world. In no place in our present system are America's capital markets used as a device of foreign policy. This would be dangerously irresponsible and unprecedented, and this would be done without one congressional hearing to examine the consequences of such action. 
   America is the preeminent capital market in the world, but that position is under constant challenge. International investors can move their money, issue their stocks, access capital anywhere in the world, with the click of a mouse. Why would we want to inject new political redtape and risks and uncertainty into a system that hangs on such a precarious balance? For what? Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has been quoted on numerous occasions in the last few days on this issue. I remind my colleagues what Chairman Greenspan said about the Thompson proposal:  
   So a most fundamental concern about this particular amendment is, it doesn't have any capacity of which I am aware to work. And by being put in effect, the only thing that strikes me as a reasonable expectation is it can harm us more than it would harm others.  
   This amendment would cast a long shadow of doubt over the American financial market system. This is not in the best interests of America. 
   I oppose this amendment because it has never received any consideration in any committee of jurisdiction. We have not heard from proliferation experts as to how this amendment would affect our national security. Proliferation is too serious, much too serious to deal with it in this manner. How much time have all our colleagues had to understand this, to develop an appreciation for the consequences of this action? How much time have we put into this? We know there have been four versions. The first I believe that any of us had a chance to look at this was yesterday. That is not responsible legislation. 
   I oppose this amendment because it employs unilateral sanctions which history has proven are an ineffective way to achieve foreign policy goals. The amendment would tie the hands of the next President before he has had a chance to develop a comprehensive  global nonproliferation policy. It would jeopardize intelligence sources and would cut off programs that are designed to benefit American exporters such as the Export-Import Bank. None of this makes any sense. These consequences would be very harmful to America's interests. I oppose this amendment because it injects foreign policy considerations into our financial regulatory and market systems. This would start us down a very dangerous and unprecedented path that would ultimately weaken our markets and consequently weaken this country. 
   The underlying bill, PNTR, is of strategic significance to the United States. Passage of this bill, coupled with China's entering into the WTO, will help set China on the path toward economic and political reform, which is clearly in our national interest. It is clearly in the interests of the world. If we attach the Thompson amendment or any amendment to PNTR, we effectively kill PNTR this year and maybe for some time to come. 
   For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, all amendments to PNTR, and strongly support PNTR. 
   I yield the floor. 
   I believe we have a unanimous consent agreement?

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in strong support of my colleague from Missouri, Mr. BOND. 
   The Bond provision of the fiscal year 2001 Energy and Water Appropriations bill would prohibit the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from implementing the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service plan to increase spring time releases of water from Missouri River dams to simulate the natural ``rise'' and ``fall'' in the Missouri River. This could be potentially devastating to Nebraska's farmers and ranchers and those whose livelihood depends on the Missouri River because the ``rise'' increases flood risk, and the ``fall'' interferes with barge traffic. 
   This ``spring rise'' that increases flood risks down the Missouri and the Mississippi is particularly irresponsible when you take into account that over the last two years, FEMA has spent $32.6 million in flood disaster for the Missouri River. 
   During the flood of 1993, the largest in recorded history, flood costs ranged between $12 and $16 billion. More importantly, main stem Missouri River Dams--the very ones Fish and Wildlife want to change--prevented $4 billion in damages. 
   If the amendment to strike the Bond provision from the Energy and Water Appropriations bill is successful, and this ``fall'' occurs, then there is a real potential that water levels are reduced to a point where barge traffic can't get through. Barge traffic is necessary to the farmer. It brings fertilizer up in the spring and brings the harvest to market in the fall. Senator BOND's amendment will ensure that water levels are kept at a navigable level. 
   This provision is not new to the Energy and Water Appropriations bill. It has been included in four previous appropriations measures that were signed into law by President Clinton. Now, President Clinton is threatening to veto this bill if it contains the Bond provision. 
   I urge my colleagues to keep the Bond provision in this appropriations bill and keep the Missouri River at a reasonable and steady level.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, in response to my friend and colleague, the  Senator from Minnesota, on his first amendment regarding religious persecution, my opposition to his amendment is not because I believe there is religious freedom in China. Clearly, there is not. I believe every one of the Members of this body understands that as well. It is my opinion that if we adopt this amendment, it will have the opposite effect desired by its sponsors. 
   The issue is: How do we best influence the behavior of China on human rights? I believe if we kill permanent normal trade relations with China, it will not be in the best interest of human rights in China. 
   I share my colleague's concern, as do each of our colleagues in this body, about the repression of citizens' rights in China. Again, the question is, How do we best influence that behavior? How do we best deal with it? 
   I believe, as well intentioned as this amendment is, that it is misguided and that it will kill, if adopted, this bill. If this amendment is adopted, effectively it will kill permanent normal trade relations this year and have an influence, I suspect, on this bill into next year. 
   As my colleague has pointed out, if any amendment is attached to permanent normal trade relations, then it will go back to the House for another vote, we will have a conference. Then I believe because of time, if for no other reason, we will have no permanent normal trade relations with China. 
   One of the most dynamic challenges of our time is America's relationship with China. This challenge represents opportunity and uncertainty for both nations. How the U.S.-China relationship unfolds will have immense consequences for the world and human rights. It is my opinion that it is in the best interests of America, China, and the world that America engage this relationship in every way on every field. 
   Trade surely is a common denominator for the future of the world. We must encourage China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, and we should grant China PNTR. We must do this certainly, obviously, with a very clear eye to the understanding of the limitations, the challenges, and the realities of this relationship with China. We have an opportunity to move this relationship along a track with positive growth, potential possibilities, and for a future that is far brighter than the future that now exists in China. History will judge us harshly if we squander this opportunity. 
   China is currently positioned to be admitted to the WTO, the 135-member international organization that works to break down trade barriers and foster free and fair trade among member countries. Once it becomes a member of the WTO, China must implement far-reaching domestic economic reforms, eliminate trade barriers, and strengthen its laws governing domestic business practices, environmental practices, and, yes, human rights is part of that. Human rights is part of that dynamic. 
   These changes will set China on the road toward becoming a responsible member of the international community. This is clearly in our national interest, it is clearly in the interest of the world, and it is clearly in the interest of human rights in China. 
   This debate is not only about trade. Far from it. It is much more than trade. For China's future, it must implement the reforms that WTO membership requires, yes, if its economy is to continue to grow and hundreds of millions of Chinese are to be lifted out of abject poverty and hunger. 
   As nations prosper, the world becomes more peaceful and free. When there is freedom, peace, and prosperity, there is less conflict, less poverty, less hunger, and, yes, less war. That is in the interest of all peoples. 
   I believe China's membership in the WTO will have a positive influence on human rights in China. Like people everywhere, the Chinese people want more control over their personal lives, more freedom, more rights. They want more control over their own destinies. People who are poor have little power. 
   Membership in the WTO will, in the long run, increase the prosperity of the Chinese people. The reforms required by WTO membership will strengthen China's economy which will create jobs and boost standards of living, as it does elsewhere in the world, and bring more personal freedom. This is critical if the Chinese people are to lift themselves out of poverty and begin to gain more control over their own destinies. 
   That is a major reason why Taiwan supports China's accession to the WTO. Martin Lee, leader of Hong Kong's democratic party and outspoken critic of China's Government, also supports China's membership in the WTO, as does, in fact, the Dalai Lama, as do many of China's most prominent human rights activists. 
   On May 23 of this year, the House of Representatives voted to grant China PNTR status. The Senate should do the same. If Congress grants China PNTR, American businesses and agricultural producers will be able to compete in every segment of the Chinese market. 
   If Congress fails to pass the Chinese PNTR legislation, we will lock ourselves out of the world's largest and fastest growing market, while our European and Japanese competitors rush in to fill the vacuum. That makes no sense. What sense does that make? How are we influencing the behavior of the Chinese Government? How are we improving human relations and religious freedoms in China when we walk away from China? 
   One of the main benefits of China's membership in the WTO will be the mandatory reduction of its tariffs on agricultural products, as well as all goods and services. These changes, combined with PNTR for China, will enable America's agricultural producers to tap further and deeper into this huge potential market. Agricultural producers, manufacturers, and service providers will be free to select partners, marketers, buyers, and distributors in China, instead of being forced to go through state-owned trading companies or middlemen. 
   The Chinese will also have to eliminate export subsidies for their agricultural and other products as well as import barriers such as quarantine and sanitary standards that are not based on sound science. And if the Chinese do not comply with their commitments under the agreement, the United States can petition the WTO to force them to do so. There will be strong economic and political incentives in place to encourage Chinese compliance. 
   Our markets have long been open to China. Now it is their turn to open their markets to us. We have signed a bilateral trade agreement with China that effectively levels the playing field for the first time ever. But if we do not grant PNTR to China, then all the hard-won concessions in our trade agreement will not apply to the United States; however, they will apply to all other WTO members who do grant PNTR to China. That would represent a tremendous loss and mindless disservice to American businesses, farmers, and workers. And, yes, I say again, what effect would this have on improving rights and improving the Chinese behavior toward those rights and toward their own people? 
   It is important to the world and to the Chinese people that China become integrated in the global trading system. China's economy will open more quickly to foreign exports and investments, increasing the interaction of the people of China with the rest of the world and increasing their standard of living and potential for more freedom. 
   These developments will have a positive effect on all human rights in China, provide growth opportunities to American businesses and farmers and workers, and help stabilize a very important region of the world. 
   This issue has serious geopolitical and, surely, national security interests attached to it for both America and the world, as well as trade and economic interests. They are all interconnected. We must be wise enough to understand this interwoven dynamic and act on it. When nations are trading with each other, they are rarely sending their armies against each other. These are common denominator self-interests for all nations, for all peoples. 
   China's membership in the WTO and Congress' granting of PNTR are clearly in the best interests of, yes, America, and I believe in the best interests of China, the people of China, and the world. I strongly encourage my colleagues to vote for this bill and oppose all amendments to it. 
   I add one last point. It is not a matter, I say to the good Senator from Minnesota, of this body or of this Nation or of our people looking the other way when it comes to human rights violations in China. We are not looking the other way. We are finding a course  that some of us believe is the correct course to influence the behavior of China. It is for that reason that I shall support this bill and oppose all amendments. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today we have moved a step closer to implementing comprehensive campaign finance reform. With the help of Senator MITCH MCCONNELL, Chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, the Open and Accountable Campaign Financing Act of 2000 will soon be placed on the Senate Calendar, ready for debate by the full Senate. 
   I introduced the Open and Accountable Campaign Financing Act of 2000 along with Senators BOB KERREY, SPENCE ABRAHAM, MIKE DEWINE, SLADE GORTON, MARY LANDRIEU, CRAIG THOMAS, JOHN BREAUX, KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, and GORDON SMITH as a bi-partisan approach to campaign finance reform because we felt it was a common sense, relevant and realistic approach. We offered it as a bipartisan compromise to break the deadlock on campaign finance reform and to bring forth a vehicle that could address the main holes in the net of our current system. 
   The purpose of our legislation is to place more control and responsibility  for the conduct of campaigns directly in the hands of the candidates. Our legislation is not the solution for all of the problems now facing us, but I believe it is a good solid beginning to accomplish meaningful campaign finance reform. 
   After a series of hearings in the Senate Rules Committee this spring on campaign finance reform, we will now be able to put a bill on the Senate Calendar that has bipartisan support. If we are to accomplish comprehensive reform this year, bipartisan support is essential and our bill has that support. 
   While I was very pleased with the recent vote in Congress to require disclosure for the `527' organizations, that bill is not a substitute for more comprehensive campaign finance reform. It is a solution for a small problem. We need to continue to fight for campaign finance reform that is broader and more comprehensive. 
   I am hopeful that the full Senate will be able to debate comprehensive campaign finance reform legislation, including the Open and Accountable Campaign Financing Act of 2000, this year. We have an opportunity to achieve something reasonable and responsible this year. 
   Again, I would like to thank Senator MCCONNELL for holding hearings in the Rules Committee on campaign finance reform and helping move the process along. I look forward to working with him and all Senators interested in advancing campaign finance reform.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, on June 12, the administration's National Assessment Coordinating Office, established under the authority of the Office of the President, released the first National Assessment on Climate Change. This report entitled ``Climate Change Impacts on the United States,'' is a political document. It is not a mainstream science document. It has not been peer-reviewed. 
   The National Assessment attempts to predict in detail climate changes region-by-region within the United States over 100 years. Yes, region by region for 100 years. The charade of this effort is criticized by the Environmental Protection Agency's web page. This morning I checked the EPA's web page for its comments on computer climate model. It states:  
   Virtually all published estimates of how climate could change in the United States are the result of computer models........These complicated models.......are still not accurate enough to provide reliable forecasts on how the climate may change; and the several models often yield contradictory results.......Scientists are unable to say whether particular regions will receive more or less rainfall; and for many regions they are unable to even state whether a wetter or drier climate is more likely.  
   This is from this morning's web page. 
   The National Assessment does not highlight the large amount of uncertainty in long-term climate forecasting. It was released in draft form even though two of the five sectoral studies are incomplete and still out in draft form for comment. The regional studies--which the EPA itself has warned are impossible to honestly conclude--are also incomplete. One might suspect that the priority was placed on releasing the report for a political time-table rather than for a scientific time-table. 
   It uses two foreign computer models: The Canadian Centre model and Britain's ``Hadley Centre'' model. These are considered among the most extreme of all climate models available. 
   As mentioned in an opinion piece Wednesday, June 14 in the New York Times entitled ``Warming Earth, Heated Rhetoric'' by Gregg Easterbrook, senior editor of The New Republic:   
   One [model] predicts a catastrophic drought that kills off all trees in the American Southeast; the other forecasts increased rainfall and forest expansion in the Southeast.  
   One of the country's most respected climate scientists, Dr. John Christy of the University of Alabama in Huntsville has also been critical. Dr. Christy is the country's premier specialist on satellite measurements of atmospheric temperatures. 
   In a June 9 Associated Press story, Dr. Christy commented on a pre-release version of the National Assessment he had obtained. He stated,  
   I read the Executive Summary and the following sections through page 9--``Looking at America's Climate.'' I stopped at that point thinking, ``This must be some kind of joke.'' It seemed to me that this document was written by a committee of Greenpeace, Ted Turner, AL GORE and Stephen King. 
   I saw no attempt at scientific objectivity. This document is an evangelistic statement about a coming apocalypse, not a scientific statement about the evolution of a complicated system with significant uncertainties. As it is, the document will be easily dismissed by anyone with access to information about the uncertainties of the issue.  
   The National Assessment declares that there is a direct connection between increased global temperatures and increases in man-made greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide. While there are many disagreements in the scientific community, there is a consensus that it is impossible to make that connection. 
   Has the world been warming? Yes, the world has been warming for 11,000 years, since the end of the last major ice age. In the last 100 years, global temperatures have increased by about one degree. 
   Is this warming due to man-made greenhouse gas emissions? Let me quote from Dr. Marsh, a researcher at the Argonne National Laboratory, New York Times, Sept. 8, 1999:  
   Carbon dioxide is a minor greenhouse gas that contributes only about 3% of the greenhouse effect, and man-made sources represent some 3% to 4% of carbon dioxide emissions, the rest being from natural sources. 
   The major greenhouse gas is water vapor. ..... if all the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere were to vanish magically, it would lead to a one degree centigrade decrease in global temperatures.  
   These are the comments of a researcher at a U.S. Government national laboratory. 
   Even the possible current moderate warming is not well understood. Ground temperatures have risen slightly in the past two decades. But more accurate--and truly global--satellite temperature measurements have shown no warming in the 20 years those measurements have been available. In fact, they have shown a slight cooling. 
   Is there fluctuation in the climate? Of course. Ice cores sampling has shown wide fluctuations in the global climate long before the emergency of man, much less the industrial age. Are current fluctuations man made? The simple answer is that we do not know. 
   What do we know and what do we need to do to do more? We need more scientific research, honest scientific research. We need more technological development. We need to involve both the private and public sectors in working on this issue. 
   Senator MURKOWSKI, Senator CRAIG, Senator BYRD, and I have all introduced legislation that would do exactly that. But most of all, we need to restore a bipartisan, commonsense, science-based, market-driven approach to this important issue. We do not need more precooked political nonsense, political tracts, masquerading as unbiased science. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to wish the United States Army happy birthday. It was 225 years ago today, in 1775, that the Continental Army of the United States was formed. That Continental Army of the United States has had a rich, important impact on our country. 
   Millions of men and women over the last 225 years have served in the senior branch of services of our military forces of the U.S. Army. The Army is interwoven into the culture of America. Those who have had the great privilege of serving in this country in the U.S. Army understand that. It may have been a little difficult during basic training for some, but as we progressed through basic training and became Army men and women, formed, shaped, and molded from raw recruiting into something that America could be proud of, and we could be proud of ourselves, that touch, that impact, that molding, that shape, has defined our country, has defined our culture, and has, in fact, defined the world. The U.S. Army has had an incredible effect on our country and the world for the better. 
   ``Duty, honor, country'' is the motto of the U.S. Army. It is America. It is who we are. Not one generation of Americans who have served in the U.S. Army have gone untouched by not only what America is about but what the Army is about. It is a shaping and molding that has touched lives in ways that are hard to explain, just as the Army has touched our national life and made the world more secure, more prosperous, and a better world for all mankind. 
   On this 225th birthday of the U.S. Army, as an old infantry-man who served in the U.S. Army, I say happy birthday to the veterans of this country. We recognize and acknowledge and pay tribute to those generations who have served before some of us had the opportunity to serve a newer Army. 
   It is the Army that has laid the foundation for our services today and for a stronger America. To that, we say, again, happy birthday and thank you, in the great rich tradition of the U.S. Army. 
   Mr. President, we say ``hoo-ha.''

   Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair.  
   Mr. President, I rise today to support the McCain-Levin amendment. Kosovo is complicated. It is frustrating, dangerous, and fragile. 
   But I believe Kosovo and the Balkans are very clearly in the legitimate sphere of American security. As I listened to the debate last night and this morning--good, committed, informed debate--I believe we are not debating the congressional constitutional responsibility or authority in foreign policy. I don't think that is the issue. It seems to me that the issue which, in my opinion, comes down two ways, is: Is this action a wise and correct action at this time? Two, what are the consequences of this action? 
   Make no mistake, there will be consequences. We are always confronted with imperfect choices. Conflict, peacekeeping, war, how you deal with these problems always represents an imprecise business. We don't know the answers. We don't know the outcomes. We don't know all the dangers and complications. These don't come in tidy little boxes, or wrapped up in easy-to-figure-out little equations. There are many unknowns. That is one of the reasons why it is very unwise and very dangerous to set arbitrary deadlines. They never work. 
   Now, we have heard a lot this morning and last night about what our European allies have not done. Well, in the fairness of this debate, I think we should again remind those listening that, currently, America's ground troops in Kosovo represent less than 15 percent. Less than 15 percent of all ground troops in Kosovo are American. That means 85 percent of the ground troops are European--including, by the way, the Russians. 
   I think something else that is relevant to this debate is the fact that we have been there in Kosovo in this capacity, a peacekeeping responsibility, for less than 1 year. If we want to take this to the logical conclusion of lack of congressional authority as to when, where, how, and how long we are going to commit our peacekeeping forces, then I suggest that we go back and have a good debate on Korea, and on Japan, and on Europe. 
   We did have a debate on Kosovo last year, and we had a rather significant vote on moving forward in supporting the President's military action. Now, it stands to some reason that if we made that investment and we had that vote and the American public was tuned in, informed, educated, and their representatives were representing them in this body, they had some sense of where we were going with this. Are we going to walk away from what we achieved and have been achieving? It is messy, yes; uncertain, yes; fragile, yes; complicated, yes; but that is a very relevant point to this debate. Then what is connected to that question is, what happens next? 
   Does anybody in this Chamber believe that the Byrd-Warner amendment, planning to plan to withdraw, is a policy? Withdrawal is not a policy. Why are we doing it now--less than 6 months before America elects a new President? We all of a sudden are quite agitated and excited about Kosovo. We have had some time to deal with this. So we will ask our new President to take office in a matter of months, at the same time forming a new national policy team, new security, foreign policy, working with new leaders, the Congress, the nuances and relationships that are all part of that, and imposed upon him, encumbering him, is this arbitrary deadline and this plan to withdraw. I don't think that is responsible. We leave this new President little latitude, little flexibility. 
   What about the magnitude and seriousness of this debate? If this is so important, why has it not been brought before the Foreign Relations Committee? Certainly, the Foreign Relations 
   Committee of the Senate should have some responsibility in this debate. We have not had 1 minute of debate on this. This came up in an Appropriations Committee meeting, with no formal notice, and boom. This is responsible policymaking? I don't think so. This is not a thoughtful approach to something this serious. 
   We need to listen to those who have responsibility for our troops on the ground. General Clark and others have had the interest of our young men and women as their main responsibility. What do they say about this? They have said it is irresponsible, with dangerous consequences. A heavy, dark cloud of dangerous uncertainty hangs over this debate. What are the other consequences? Yes, there will be a vacuum. But there are connecting rods as well here. Does anybody doubt, if we would pass this, that this would not have an effect on Milosevic and others like him, and their interpretation, and their waiting game, and all that they would do to wait us out? Of course not. 
   Let's get real. Let's get real in this body. This isn't theory. Does anybody doubt that this would not have a responsible consequence to our relationship with our NATO allies, at the very time we are trying to convince our NATO allies to go with us on a national missile defense system--and we will need that concurrence and cooperation with our NATO allies if we are going to, in fact, go forward with a ground-based national missile defense system because we will need some radar sites. Does this have an effect on that? Of course. Does it have an effect on our new relationship with the President of Russia? Of course it does. Does it have an effect on how the Chinese and the Taiwanese see America's commitment to its allies? Of course it does. These are big issues out here, Mr. President. We better understand the bigger picture. There will certainly be consequences in the Balkans. Do we think if we do leave, we plan to leave the Balkans better than we found it? I don't think so. 
   America's word means something. America's commitment means something. I believe stability in Europe, stability in the Balkans is in the interest of America. There is legitimate debate on the other side, maybe, but I think it is in our interest. America has always represented hope, a better life, a better world. We have made the world better. Yes, we can debate all of our military conflicts, involvements, and engagements since World War II--Vietnam, Korea, Kuwait. Have we made mistakes? Yes, we have. But, generally, is the world better off, more peaceful, more prosperous, with more hope today because of America? Of course it is. 
   There is one other thing we tend to forget: As the leader of the world, we will always be asked and be required to carry a heavier burden than any other nation. We may not like that; it may be unfair, but it is a fact. One of the reasons America is the greatest Nation on earth, in the history of man, is because we have had the unique ability to control our own destiny. How have we done that? We have done it because we were engaged; we were vigilant; we were strong. We anchored our country and our beliefs on principles, trusts, and values. Others have responded to that. 
   These are all part of the dynamics of this debate. 
   I do not want my 9-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son to inherit a world where America does not lead, if for no other reason, the next great power in the world may not be as benevolent or judicious as America has been with its power over the last 200 years. All of these dynamics are part of this equation. This body must be very serious in understanding that. 
   Let Americans speak in November. Let our people speak. Elect a new President. That new President will begin a new, productive, positive relationship with the Congress. We can together work on a foreign policy that makes sense in a timely, effective way. That is the answer. That is a wiser course of action. That is a more responsible course of action than voting for the Byrd-Warner amendment. 
   I might say before I end that it is because of Chairman WARNER's efforts and leadership. That has been recounted last night and today. The Europeans have in fact stepped up each day, each month, to more and more responsibility to their obligations. And I thank the chairman for that. Rarely do I disagree with him, but in this case I do. 
   I strongly encourage my colleagues to support the Levin amendment. 
   I yield the floor. Thank you.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, first, let me acknowledge the leadership of my colleagues from Georgia and Kansas for bringing attention and focus to an area that does not often get appropriate focus. It is about international affairs--the connecting rods to our lives in a world now that is, in fact, globally connected. 
   That global community is underpinned by a global economy. There is not a dynamic of the world today, not an action taken nor a consequence of that action, that does not affect America, that does not affect our future. I am grateful that Senators CLELAND and ROBERTS have taken the time and the leadership to focus on an area of such importance to our country.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. Kagan is a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He echoes what Senators ROBERTS and CLELAND have talked about; that is, the vital interests of our country in world affairs. He suggests that America's two Presidential candidates this year, Governor Bush and Vice President GORE, focus attention in the remaining months of this Presidential campaign on international issues. He lays out a number of areas in the world that are of vital consequence and concern to not only those particular regions but to the United States. 
   The point is, others are coming to the same conclusions and realizations as our friends from Georgia and Kansas: that international relations is the completeness of all of our policies--trade, national security, economy, geopolitics. It is, in fact, a complete policy. 
   We are living in a most unique time in history, a time when everything is possible. We live in a time when we can do more good for mankind than ever in the history of the world. Why is that? It deserves some perspective and some review. 
   Over the last 50 years, it has been the multilateral organizations of the world, beginning with the visionary and foresighted leadership of Harry Truman after World War II and a Republican Congress, working jointly to develop and implement multilateral policies and organizations such as the United Nations, such as what was born at Breton Woods, the IMF, the World Bank, trade organizations, multilateral peace, financial organizations--all are imperfect, all are flawed. But in the real world, as most of us understand, the choice is seldom between all good, the easy choice, and all bad. Normally our foreign policy and every dynamic of that foreign policy, be it foreign aid, be it national security interests, be it geopolitical interests, falls somewhere between all good and all bad. It is a difficult position to have to work our way through. 
   With this weekend's upcoming annual meetings for the IMF and the World Bank and the number of guests who will be coming to Washington--I suspect not exactly to celebrate the IMF and the World Bank and the World Trade Organization and other multilateral organizations--it is important that we bring some perspective to the question that fits very well into the larger question Senators ROBERTS and CLELAND have asked; that is, is the world better off with a World Trade Organization, with a world trade regime, its focus being to open up markets, break down barriers, allow all nations to prosper? And how do they prosper? They prosper through free trade. Underpinning the free trade is individual liberty, individual freedom, emerging democracies, emerging markets. 
   We could scrap the World Trade Organization, 135 nations, and go back to a time, pre-World War II, that essentially resulted in two world wars, where there would be no trading regime. Those countries that are now locked in poverty have to go it on their own. That is too bad. We can scrap the World Trade Organization. While we are at it, have the IMF and the World Bank added to any prosperity in the world? Have they made mistakes? Yes. 
   Let's examine some of the underlying and most critical and realistic dynamics of instability in the world. We do know that when there is instability, there is no prosperity and there is no peace. What causes instability? 
   Let's examine what it is that causes instability. When you 
   have nations trapped in the cycle of hopelessness and the perpetuation of that cycle because of no hope, no future, poverty, hunger, pestilence, what do we think is going to happen? History is rather complete in instructing us on this point: conflict and war. When there is conflict and war, is there an opportunity to advance the causes of mankind? No. Why is that? Let's start with no trading. There are no markets. Do we really believe we can influence the behavior of nations with no contact, no engagement, no trade? I don't think so. 
   As many of our guests who are arriving now in Washington, who will parade up and down the streets, burning the effigies of our President and the Congress and the World Trade Organization and the IMF and the World Bank--and I believe sincerely their motives are pure; that they wish to pull up out of abject poverty the more than 1.5 billion people in the world today, which is a worthy, noble cause--I think the record over the last 50 years is rather complete in how that has been done to help other nations over the last 50 years do that a little differently  than tearing down the multilateral institutions that have added to prosperity and a better life and a hope for mankind. 
   I will share with this body a couple of facts from the 1999 Freedom House survey. Most of us know of the organization called Freedom House. It issued its first report in 1978. This is what Freedom House issued on December 21, 1999: 85 countries out of 192 nations today are considered free. That represents 44 percent of the countries in the world today. That is the second largest number of free countries in the history of man. That represents 2.34 billion people living in free countries with individual liberties, 40 percent of all the people in the world. Fifty-nine countries are partly free, 31 percent of the countries. That represents 1.5 billion people living in partly free countries, 25 percent of the world's population. 
   What are the real numbers? Seventy-five percent of the countries, largest in the history of mankind, are living in either free or partly free countries. Forty-eight countries not free. That represents 25 percent of the population of the world. 
   What does that mean? Let's go back and examine about 100 years ago where the world was. At the turn of the century, no country on Earth, including the United States, had universal suffrage. Less than 100 years ago, the United States did not allow women to vote, and there were other human rights violations we accepted in this country. My point is, the United States must be rather careful not to moralize and preach to the rest of the world. Yes, we anchor who we are on the foundation of our democracy and equal rights, but it even took America 250 years to get as far as we have come. 
   So we should, if nothing else, at least be mindful of that as we dictate to other countries. Now, as we examine a number of the points that have been made this morning and will be made throughout the next few months about foreign policy, it is important for us to have some appreciation and lend some perspective to not only the tremendous progress that has been made in the world today, and the hope we have for tomorrow, and the ability and the opportunities we have to make the world better--and it is fundamentally about productive capacity, individual freedoms, trade, free markets, private investment, rule of law, rights, contract law, all that America represents, all that three-fourths of the world countries and population represent. It is solutions, creative solutions, for which we are looking. 
   Creative solutions will come as a result of imaginative and bold leadership. As I have said often when I have been challenged about America's role in the world and is America burdening itself with too much of a role--incidentally, what should our role be? That is a legitimate debate. But I have said this: America has made its mistakes. But think of it in this context. If America decides that its burden is too heavy, whether that be in the area of contributions to the United Nations, to NATO, wherever we are around the world, as an investment, we believe in markets, in freedom, in opportunity, in less war, less conflict, a future for our children, for whatever reason, if we believe we are too far extended--and that is a legitimate question--and we will have an ongoing dynamic debate on the issue and we should remind ourselves of this--the next great nation on earth--and there will be a next great nation if America chooses to recede back into the cold, gray darkness of mediocrity--that next great, powerful nation may not be quite as judicious and benevolent with its power as America has been with our power. That is not the world that I wish my 7-year-old and 9-year-old children to inherit. 
   If there is an additional burden--and there is--for America to carry on to be the world's leader, for me, it is not only worthy of the objective to continue to help all nations and raise all nations' opportunities, but realistically, geopolitically, it is the only answer for the kind of world that we want not just for our children but for all children of the world. 
   So rather than tear down organizations and tear down trade regimes and tear down organizations that are focused on making the world better, we should ask our friends who are coming to Washington this week to give us creative solutions and be part of those creative solutions. 
   Mr. President, I am grateful for an opportunity to share some thoughts and hopefully make a contribution to what my friend from Georgia and my friend from Kansas have been about today and earlier in our session. This will continue throughout this year because through this education and this information and this exchange of thoughts and ideas we will fundamentally broaden and deepen the foundation of who we are as a free nation and not be afraid of this debate in front of the world. It is the debate, the borderless challenges of our time--terrorism, weapons of mass destruction, the scourge of our time, illegal drugs--that must be confronted and dealt with as a body of all nations, all peoples. Understanding and dealing with these fundamental challenges and issues are in the common denominator, mutual self-interest of all peoples. 
   Again, I am grateful for their leadership. I yield the floor.

    Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Nebraska, Senator BOB KERREY, to submit a resolution expressing Congress' support for a national moment of remembrance, to be observed on Memorial Day each year, in order to appropriately honor American patriots lost in pursuit of peace and liberty around the world. 
   Should Congress pass this resolution, ``Taps'' will be played at 3 pm (Eastern Standard Time) on Memorial Day each year, in honor of those who have sacrificed their lives for their country. In other words, this resolution seeks to put the ``memorial'' back into Memorial Day. 
   It is my hope that this moment of remembrance will bring all Americans together in a spirit of respect, patriotism and gratitude. Our intention is to help restore the recognition our veterans deserve for the sacrifices they have made on behalf of our great Nation. 
   No Greater Love, a nonprofit organization which assists the families of Americans who died in service to their country or in terrorist acts, has helped support this resolution as part of their ``Proud to Remember'' campaign. We are all grateful for their efforts.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak I support of the joint resolution, introduced by my distinguished colleague from Utah, Senator ORRIN HATCH, proposing an amendment to the Constitution authorizing Congress to prohibit physical desecration of the American flag. 
   From the birth of our nation, the flag has represented all that is good and decent about our country. On countless occasions, on battlefields across the world, the Stars and Stripes led young Americans into battle. For those who paid the ultimate price for our nation, the flag blanketed their journey and graced their final resting place. 
   Mr. President, the Flag is not just a piece of cloth. It is a symbol so sacred to our nation that we teach our children not to let it touch the ground. It flies over our schools, our churches and synagogues, our courts, our seats of government, and homes across America. It unites all Americans regardless of race, creed or color. The flag is not just a symbol of America, it is America. 
   Those who oppose this constitutional amendment say it impinges on freedom of speech and violates our Constitution. As a veteran who was wounded twice in Vietnam protecting the principles of freedoms that Americans hold sacred, I am a strong supporter of the first amendment. However, I believe this is a hollow argument. There are many limits placed on ``free speech,'' including limiting yelling ``fire'' in a crowded theater. Other freedoms of speech and expression are limited by our slander and libel laws. 
   In 1989 and 1990 the Supreme Court struck down flag protection laws by  narrow votes. The Court has an obligation to protect and preserve our fundamental rights as citizens. But the American people understand the difference between freedom of speech and ``anything goes.'' 
   When citizens disagree with our national policy, there are a number of options available to them other than destroying the American Flag to make their point. Let them protest, let them write to their newspaper, let them organize, let them march, let them shout to the rooftops--but we should not let them burn the flag. Too many have died defending the flag for us to allow it be used in any way that does not honor their sacrifice. 
   Mr. President, in a day where too often we lament what has gone wrong with America, it's time to make a stand for decency, for honor and for pride in our nation. I urge my colleagues to support the flag amendment. Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise in support of S..2251, the Risk Management for the 21st Century Act regarding crop insurance reform, I am an original co-sponsor of this important legislation and I thank my colleagues Senators BOB KERREY and PAT ROBERTS for their leadership on this issue. 
   Crop insurance reform has been a major, bipartisan legislative effort for farm state Senators. Reforming crop insurance is vital to America's agricultural producers and to the rural economies in all of our ag-producing states. We need to pass this legislation today. 
   The need for crop insurance reform has been a common denominator in my conversations with all of Nebraska's agricultural producers and agribusinesses, as I am sure it has for my colleagues as they have spoken with ag-producers across the country. 
   Every commodity organization and farm group that I've spoken with has urged Congress to reform and improve America's crop insurance programs. 
   Why is crop insurance important? By increasing and expanding private crop insurance coverage, ag producers can make long-term market decisions without being devastated by short-term economic downturns. 
   If we can assist in making crop insurance--an important risk management tool--more affordable and expansive, we will help producers weather the bad times.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I add my thanks to the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee and the ranking member, Mr. MOYNIHAN. And I tag on to what my friend and colleague, Senator ROBB, said regarding the loss to this body and to America as we find Senators MOYNIHAN and KERREY serving their last year in the Senate. In a narrow, parochial sense, Mr. KERREY's impending retirement makes me the new senior Senator from Nebraska. However, I would have gladly put that aside for the interest of our senior Senator from Nebraska staying on, as well as Mr. MOYNIHAN, who adds the kind of enlightenment, enhancement, and leadership to an issue that is so critical to this country and to our future. 
   With that, I, too, rise in support of H.R. 5, the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act of 2000. I am also a cosponsor of the Senate companion bill, S. 2074, the Social Security Earnings Test Elimination Act. 
   I think it is appropriate this afternoon to acknowledge our friend and colleague, Senator MCCAIN, who has recently rejoined the Senate after his odyssey throughout America over the  last few months. Senator MCCAIN was an early sponsor of repealing the Social Security earnings test and fought hard and provided essential leadership early on. I acknowledge Mr. MCCAIN's early leadership on this issue. 
   We have heard today how this legislation will repeal the Social Security earnings test, which is a disincentive for seniors to work by reducing seniors' Social Security benefits according to the amount of income they earn. We know this legislation will allow seniors between the ages of 65 and 70 to go back to work or continue to work and not worry about being penalized for their productivity or losing their Social Security benefits. 
   As America moves into the new century, it will need more workers in the workforce, not less. Productive capacity is the engine that drives economic growth. That means we must have skilled workers and managers and experienced workers and managers. The passage of this bill helps America with this great challenge. It will help America retain this vital resource of skilled and experienced workers and managers. 
   However, this legislation will not fix Social Security. It will not fix our long-term workforce challenge. The solvency of Social Security is one of the great challenges facing America today. We must reform Social Security or it will not be there for future generations. We know the figures. 
   In 1999, there were 35 million Americans, 13 percent of total population, 65 years of age or older. By the year 2030, there will be 70 million Americans, 20 percent of the total population, who will be 65 years of age or older. In 2010, the first group of the 76 million baby boomers will become eligible for Social Security benefits. And in 2030, the number of workers paying into Social Security per beneficiary, as Senator KERREY has acknowledged, will drop to 2 from the present 3.3. 
   With this increasing number of beneficiaries and a smaller workforce contributing to the Social Security system, if Congress does not enact reform, Social Security benefit payments will begin to exceed the taxes collected in the year 2014. My colleagues who have spoken before me on the floor this afternoon have pointed out in rather significant clarity the consequences of that. 
   I don't have all the answers to what we must do, but I am sure of one thing--this Congress needs to act sooner rather 
    than later. We must reform Social Security and improve it for future generations.

   Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair. 
   We know there is an anticipated projection of a $2.3 trillion surplus in Social Security trust funds over the next 10 years. But we do know that if, in fact, we are to reform Social Security, whatever projected surplus occurs must remain in Social Security. Second, we must reform Social Security in a way that starts to develop personal wealth. Personal retirement accounts would harness the power of private markets and compounding interest, providing a much higher rate of return on each individual's investment. This also gives ownership to each individual, meaning choices and more responsibility for their own economic future. 
   The changes we make to Social Security should not affect current or soon-to-be beneficiaries. We can create a system that still provides a safety net for those who are most vulnerable in society but offers younger workers the opportunity to create wealth and save for their futures. 
   Finally, the Social Security system we now have affects all Americans. It will continue to affect all Americans. The decisions we make today will profoundly affect the lives of all Americans. We must not squander the time we now have to deal with the solvency of Social Security. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the passage of this relevant, important, and timely legislation. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

    Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I strongly support Alan Greenspan's nomination to a fourth term as Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. While Congress and the President continue to claim credit for our strong economy and projected budget surpluses, one person truly deserves the nation's gratitude for this unprecedented economic expansion--that is Alan Greenspan. His tenure has been a spectacular success. 
   Chairman Greenspan's decisions regarding monetary policy have helped lead us to low unemployment, low interest rates and the longest period of sustained economic growth in the nation's history. Given his remarkable record, it is easy to forget that circumstances have not always been this good for him. Chairman Greenspan has also been tested by periods of adversity during his tenure at the Federal Reserve. Immediately following the October 1987 crash on Wall Street, Chairman Greenspan worked with money center banks to ensure that the brokerage firms continued to have the liquidity necessary to calm both markets and investors. Even in times of adversity, his was a steady hand. 
   Last year, during debate on the financial modernization legislation, Chairman Greenspan served as a crucial advisor to the Members of the Conference Committee. He added indispensable expertise to enacting legislation  that will help maintain the competitiveness of our financial services industry in a global economy while ensuring the safety and soundness of our financial markets. 
   Unfortunately, I will not be present for the full Senate vote on the Chairman's nomination. I have the responsibility of leading a bipartisan congressional delegation to Wehrkunde, the annual world security conference in Munich, Germany and to Moscow, where we are to meet with acting Russian President Vladimir Putin. 
   I voted for Chairman Greenspan's nomination during the Banking Committee's markup and would vote for his renomination before the full Senate had I been present. I urge all my colleagues to do the same.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, this morning the Senate will consider numerous legislative items that have been cleared for action. Following consideration of those bills, the Senate will resume debate on the final appropriations conference report. Cloture was filed on the conference report yesterday, and it is still hoped that those Senators objecting to an agreement to change the time of the cloture vote to occur at a reasonable hour during today's session will reconsider. However, if no agreement is made, the cloture vote will occur at 1:01 a.m., Saturday morning. Senators may also expect a vote on final passage to occur a few hours after the cloture vote. In addition, the Senate could consider the work incentives conference report prior to adjournment. 
   Mr. President, I thank you. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. 
   I rise this morning in strong support of the conference report to accompany S. 900. This landmark legislation before the Senate today is especially important for the future, not only of our financial institutions' competitiveness and our consumer-based economy but for many reasons. 
   I begin my remarks this morning by commending the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Senator GRAMM, for his leadership and extraordinary efforts to complete this legislation, as well as our distinguished ranking member, Senator SARBANES from Maryland. Both they and their staffs and all who worked so hard in accomplishing this rather remarkable feat deserve our thanks. 
   I also recognize, as did my friend and colleague, the distinguished Senator from South Dakota, the House leadership involved in this effort, as well as our current distinguished Secretary of Treasury, Secretary Summers, and the former Secretary of the Treasury, Bob Rubin, for their leadership. 
   This is truly a historic occasion. In 1933, the United States was mired in the Great Depression. The stock market had collapsed. Populist segments of society blamed that collapse on commercial banks' involvement in securities underwriting. Responding to this sentiment, Senator Carter Glass of Virginia helped push through legislation that created artificial barriers between banking and securities underwriting. Later, amendments included a separation of banking and insurance activities. 
   One year later, in 1934, Senator Glass realized he had gone too far and tried to repeal parts of the Glass-Steagall Act, his own bill. Since 1934, many attempts have been made in Congress to repeal Glass-Steagall. For a variety of reasons, these attempts have failed. 
   This Congress is about to send the President a bill that accomplishes what we have failed to achieve over many years. However, it should be noted that we have also built on these many years of efforts. 
   I am proud to have served on the conference committee for this legislation. This legislation will benefit consumers in two significant ways. First, it will lead to lower costs and higher savings for consumers by allowing competition among banks, securities firms, and insurance companies. 
   In 1995, the Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated that if financial modernization were to reduce costs to consumers by only 1 percent, that would represent a savings of $3 billion a year to consumers. That is real money to real people. 
   These savings would come from increased competition which, among others things, would provide incentives for firms to reduce fees. 
   Second, this competition will strengthen our financial services firms which are integral to the health of the national and international economy. 
   As is true with manufactured goods and commodities, exports of financial services have become increasingly important to the growth of our Nation's economy. This month, the U.S. and its 
   trading partners will meet in Seattle to begin a new round of WTO negotiations. The financial services sector will again be a major topic of discussion during these talks. In fact, our Trade Representative, Ambassador Barshefsky, appeared before the Senate Banking Committee this week and talked in some detail about the financial services sector being top on the agenda for these WTO talks. 
   It is important that Congress help tear down barriers to competition within our own domestic financial markets as we work with our allies and other nations to lower trade barriers in the international financial markets. 
   I will now briefly address how this bill will affect small community banks. 
   Earlier this year, Senator BAYH and I introduced legislation to modernize the Federal Home Loan Bank System. The major provisions of that legislation were included in this financial modernization conference report. These provisions will strengthen local community banks that are vital to the economic growth and viability of America's communities. 
   The Federal Home Loan Bank provisions will ensure that in an era of banking megamergers, smaller banks are able to compete effectively and continue to serve their customers' needs. 
   Community banks are finding that, for a variety of reasons, their funding sources are shrinking. This makes it more difficult to fund the loan demands of their communities. During the 1980s in my State of Nebraska, and especially in the case of the Presiding Officer's State of Kansas, all across America many community banks and thrifts closed. As local credit dried up, local economies stagnated. Small businesses, our greatest engines of job growth and innovation, were the first to feel the crunch. 
   The Federal Home Loan Bank provisions in this legislation will strengthen community banks to help avoid a repeat of the 1980s. By broadening access to the Federal Home Loan Bank System, we will help ensure the viability of the community bank and thrift. 
   This legislation will help keep credit flowing to small businesses, farmers, and potential homeowners, and help our local communities prosper as we enter the 21st century. This is especially important to my State of Nebraska where many rural communities depend upon the local bank or thrift for their credit needs. 
   The conferees worked hard to craft legislation that responds to the needs of all financial institutions, including small financial institutions. 
   Another topic important to average Americans is financial privacy--how customers control the flow of their private financial information. 
   For the first time, this bill sets up a framework for protecting the privacy of customers' financial information. Customers will be able to prohibit the sharing of their financial information with outside parties. Financial institutions would be required to disclose their privacy policies to their customers on a timely basis. If customers do not believe adequate protections exist at their institution, they can take their business elsewhere. 
   Some wanted stronger privacy protections. In my opinion, to have gone further at this time may well have invited the law of unintended consequences. I believe some of the privacy protections that were proposed and rejected during the 
   conference would have been detrimental, not helpful, to financial institutions and their customers. Some of these limitations would have led to fewer products and services being offered to customers. 
   I want to highlight a particular concern. The legislation contains a prohibition on the sharing of customer account numbers or credit card numbers with third parties for the purposes of marketing. This language could be a disadvantage to small banks and insurance agencies that partner with third parties to market new products to customers. 
   Equally important, a customer should have the option to decide whether this information can be or should be shared. This legislation should not take away that choice. 
   The report language clarifies that when regulations are written to implement S. 900, they may exempt the sharing of encrypted credit card numbers and account numbers only where the financial institution has received express permission from the customer. 
   As vice chairman of the Banking Committee's Financial Institution Subcommittee, I intend to conduct oversight during the rulemaking process implementing this legislation. 
   The regulators should exercise this exemption authority. The conferees did not intend to hurt legitimate business practices that safeguard customer information. 
   I end by again expressing my strong support for this conference report. This  legislation, a well-balanced approach to financial services modernization, is long overdue. It does not pick winners and losers. It provides important consumer protections while expanding the choices available to consumers. 
   The conferees worked hard to craft a bill that will guide our financial services industries into the next century. This is a bill of which we can be proud, and I again congratulate Chairman GRAMM, Senator SARBANES, and all who provided leadership and hard work to accomplish this rather significant effort. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the financial modernization conference report. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today I join several of my colleagues in introducing the ``Open and Accountable Campaign Financing Act of 2000.'' This bill increases disclosure requirements on campaign contributions and political broadcast advertisements. It also caps ``soft money'' contributions to political party committees at $60,000 and adjusts individual contribution limits for inflation. I am pleased that the following Senators have joined me today in offering this bill: SPENCER ABRAHAM (R-MI), MIKE DEWINE (R-OH), SLADE GORTON (R-WA), BOB KERREY (D-NE), MARY LANDRIEU (D-LA) and CRAIG THOMAS (R-WY). 
   Changing the way federal campaigns are financed is inevitable, the American people will demand it. At some point, the Senate will have a full and open debate on how best to reform our campaign finance system. I was disappointed that floor procedures prevented us from doing so last week, because several of us had intended to offer amendments to the McCain-Feingold legislation. 
   My colleagues and I introduce this bill today as a bipartisan alternative in what has been a very polarized debate. If we are ever to move forward on this issue, we will need to look at a variety of ways to reform the campaign finance system. This bill is a combination of ideas offered by myself and a number of my colleagues. Several specific provisions in this bill have widespread support by both Republicans and Democrats, and, I believe, can form a base from which consensus can build. 
   Confidence in our political system is the essence of representative government. This begins with an open and accountable campaign financing system. We need to rise above partisan, ideological and personal rivalries, and find common ground on campaign finance reform. 
   There are several elements that must be part of any reform of our campaign finance system. One of the most important is increased disclosure for all who participate in the political process. We should not fear an educated and informed body politic. If individuals and organizations are going to participate in the election process, their participation must be revealed to the public. 
   To provide for fuller disclosure, this bill increases the financial reporting requirements for candidates and political parties. This legislation also takes the rules on broadcast ads that apply to candidates and extends them to all political broadcast ads. Under current federal regulations, when a candidate buys a political ad, the broadcaster is required to place information on the ad in a file that is open to the public. This includes a record of the times the spots are scheduled to air, the overall amount of time purchased and at what rates, and the names of the officers of the organization placing the ad. Under current federal regulations, when an interest group places a political ad with a broadcaster, it does not have to meet all of these requirements. This bill requires that interest-group ads related to any federal candidate or issue go into the broadcaster's public file. There would be no added burden on the broadcaster. The broadcaster would simply use the same form already used for candidate and party ads. Let me make clear one thing the bill does not do. It does not require organizations to identify individual donors or provide membership lists. It preserves a reasonable balance between the public's right to know which groups are attempting to influence an election, and the privacy rights of individual donors. 
   In addition to disclosure, we need to look at soft money contributions to national party committees. Most constitutional experts say that an outright ban on soft money would be unconstitutional. But this unaccountable, unlimited flood of soft money cascading over America's politics must be stopped. We need to find a middle ground between the extremes of banning soft money and leaving it unrestricted. This bill limits soft money contributions to national party committees to $60,000. This is not a ban on financial support of parties. It is a return to the original intent of the campaign finance reforms of the 1970s, which worked well until they were exploited and abused. 
   We also need to increase the ability of individuals to participate in the most accountable method of campaign financing. This bill adjusts and indexes contributions to inflation and indexes them for further years. For an individual, contribution limits would increase from $1,000 to $3,000 per candidate, per election. I've heard the argument that raising these limits would give the wealthy too much influence and access. If we cap or eliminate soft money and do not adjust the hard-money limits, we will chase more money into the black hole of third-party ads, where the public cannot  view the flow of money. I want to bring more of that money into the sunlight where the American people have access to who is giving money and how much. 
   We have a great opportunity to restore some of the confidence the American people have lost in their political system. Improving our system that selects America's leaders--who formulate and implement the policies that govern our Nation--is a worthy challenge.

   Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair. 
   I wish to follow behind the distinguished minority leader, Senator DASCHLE, in his remarks about a great loss for the Senate and for our country; that is, the loss of the senior Senator from Rhode Island, JOHN CHAFEE. We have all lost a friend. We have lost a man of immense dignity, a man of immense courage. 
   I have had the privilege of serving in this body for almost 3 years. One of the individuals with whom I became acquainted early was Senator CHAFEE. As our friendship developed, he and I would talk about his service in World War II in the South Pacific, where it happens that my father served at the same time, same places, Guadalcanal, Philippines, Solomon Islands, Australia. My father served in the Army Air Force; JOHN CHAFEE served as a marine. CHAFEE never penalized my father for less service, being in the Army Air Force. If my father were alive today, he would be very proud of the friendship I established with JOHN CHAFEE. In fact, my father died when I was 16 years old. My father was just a day younger than JOHN CHAFEE. 
   We don't often have an opportunity to get to know our colleagues in intimate ways, in ways that show the younger Senators what has developed this amazing Senator, a Senator's Senator, but as you spend time with your colleagues, you appreciate how they were molded, how they were shaped, and why they had, in the case of JOHN CHAFEE, such an immense capacity to serve--as has been noted this afternoon, the illustrious career of this magnificent individual. 
   Let me share for a moment a couple of personal stories. When Senator CHAFEE and I were in Kyoto, Japan, in December of 1997, we were on the opposite sides of that issue. He used to say to me: HAGEL, you're a bright boy. One of these days you will understand what I am trying to teach you about the environment. 
   So after 4 days at Kyoto, I said to Senator CHAFEE: Why don't I take you to China. Senator CHAFEE had been to China a number of times, as I had been. So we went to China for 5 days, and I took him deep inside China where he had never been. We spent some time at fertilizer plants. On one occasion we were out in the field with a farmer in China, and he took a picture of me. Then he had a picture taken of both of us around a two-wheeled garden tiller. He had that picture framed when we came back to the United States, and he inscribed it and sent it to my office. It still hangs in my conference room. It says: To my friend, CHUCK HAGEL, just another typical day out on the Nebraska prairie with a Nebraska tractor. Signed, your friend, JOHN CHAFEE. 
   I am very proud of that picture, which will hang, as long as I am in the Senate, in my conference room. And whenever I leave this great institution, I will take that photo with me. I think he was always a little amazed that I was able to get us in to see the Premier of China during that trip. He asked me that night, after we were having dinner, how I did that. I said I used his name. He was quite astonished that his name would have that much appeal to the Chinese but actually the Chinese knew all about Senator CHAFEE. 
   It is rare that an individual leaves an institution so much better than he found it, as JOHN CHAFEE leaves the Senate; 
   it is rare that an individual leaves the world so much better than he found it, as did JOHN CHAFEE. We shall miss him for his counsel, his wit, his friendship, but we will probably miss him most because he always elevated the debate. He did it with eloquence, elegance, and dignity. 
   As an old army sergeant, I sign off to a Secretary of the Navy, and I do so with great pride and great humility, knowing that we are all better off because JOHN CHAFEE touched us. We salute you, Secretary CHAFEE. 
   Madam President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I join the chorus of voices calling for the Old Executive Office Building to be renamed in honor of Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
   President Eisenhower had a direct connection to the building. He worked there as an aide to Gen. Douglas MacArthur, and as Army Chief of Operations. As President, he saved the building from demolition. 
   But of course the reasons for commemorating President Eisenhower in this way are far more profound than his historical connection to the building. 
   At the close of this century, America is the world's lone superpower--due in large part to the leadership of President Eisenhower from 1953-60, the years when the course to our current position of supremacy was being charted. 
   A world power structure going back several centuries was shattered by World War II. America had made a grave mistake after World War I by retreating into isolationism. Fortunately, after the Second World War, the United States recognized its responsibility to assume leadership of the free world in the global confrontation with communism. The man most responsible for solidifying America's postwar position was Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
   Eisenhower, former supreme allied commander in World War II and then supreme commander of the new North Atlantic Treaty Organization, understood perhaps better than any man of his time how the world was interconnected--and how America's destiny was intertwined with the destinies of its friends and enemies throughout the world. He was not afraid to lead in foreign policy. 
   Nor was he afraid to lead in domestic policy, especially in race relations. We think of the 1960s as the decade of civil rights, but it was President Eisenhower who ordered the complete desegregation of the Armed Forces. It was President Eisenhower who sent Federal troops to Little Rock, Arkansas, to guarantee compliance with a court order for school desegregation. 
   Naming the Old Executive Office Building for Dwight D. Eisenhower is a fitting way to honor the many ways he contributed to the building of the greatest nation the world has ever seen.

   Mr. HAGEL. Madam President, I rise in support of campaign finance reform. I first commend my colleagues, Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD, for their tireless efforts in keeping campaign finance reform alive and forcing the Senate to deal with its responsibilities. 
   The debate about campaign finance reform is one we need to have. All of us who have the high privilege to hold office have a responsibility to bring open and accountable government to the American people. This begins with an open and accountable campaign financing system. The American people must have confidence in such a system. Confidence in our political system is the essence of representative government. Our challenge has been to reform the excesses of the system while preserving the first amendment rights of all Americans to express themselves and engage in the political process. 
   In recent years, this challenge has caused Congress to shrink from serious attempts at campaign finance reform. We are better than that. America deserves more than a vacuous sleepwalk through this debate. 
   The Supreme Court has said Government can regulate how campaign finances are regulated as long as, No. 1, regulations are kept to a reasonable minimum, and, No. 2, they are designed to prevent corruption or the appearance of corruption. The appearance of corruption is a significant part of this debate. 
   My colleagues are not a bunch of campaign finance bandits or thugs, but in a democracy where citizens freely choose their leaders, perception does matter because perception is directly connected to confidence. Voters lose faith in the integrity of the political system when they lose confidence in the system. As they become demoralized and detached, citizens lower their expectations and standards for public officeholders. That produces a problem that goes beyond any remedy we can offer here on the floor of the Senate. 
   No amount of legislation can prevent scoundrels from exploiting campaign finance laws or any laws. We need to rise above partisan, ideological, personal rivalries and find common ground on campaign finance reform, elevate the debate, and enact relevant reforms. 
   For me, disclosure is the core of campaign finance reform. The overriding purpose of the campaign finance reforms enacted in the 1970s was to increase transparency and accountability in the political system. Disclosure rules for all who participate in the political process need to be a part of whatever reform package we produce. The public needs to see who is writing the checks, and for how much. The voter needs to be aware of the flow of campaign dollars. We should not fear an educated and informed body politic. All elected officials have an obligation to be part of that educational process. 
   In recent years, interest groups have come crashing into races in the home stretch, pouring huge amounts of money into radio and TV ads. All of us know stories of outside groups launching a late blitz of ads, moving poll numbers in the final weeks or days of a campaign, and then disappearing without the public knowing who they were and how much they spent for or against the candidate. 
   It is time to end this type of political stealth raid on campaigns. If individuals and organizations are going to participate in the electoral process--and they should; we encourage all individuals and organizations to participate--then the extent of their participation should be revealed to the public. As long as the voter can see where the money is coming from, and where it is going, our system will retain its integrity. I trust the American people to elevate this debate and evaluate the flow of money in campaigns. 
   In addition to the disclosure, we need to look at soft money contributions to national party committees. I appreciate the legitimate free speech and constitutional concerns in this area. Our purpose here is not to anticipate or resolve every hypothetical constitutional challenge. Our job here is to make policy. If complications or honest differences of interpretation and opinion result, that is why we have a judicial system. 
   What I do know is this. The unaccountable status quo on soft money  needs to be changed. Most constitutional experts say an outright ban on soft money probably is unconstitutional. Every court decision rendered so far on this issue has come down against an outright ban on soft money. But this unaccountable, unlimited flood of soft money cascading over America's politics should be checked. We have constitutional limits on individual contributions--so-called hard money. Why then should it be so outrageous to examine limits on soft money? What are we afraid of? 
   We need to find a middle ground between the extremes of banning soft money and leaving it unlimited, a middle ground where compromise is possible. We should also raise limits on donations of hard money by individuals and political action committees. This can be done by indexing individual contributions to inflation. 
   Raising the limits would have beneficial effects. Individual contributors would have an impact comparable to what Congress intended when reforms were first enacted in the 1970s. There would be more focus on individual participation in campaign financing. More campaign money would be under the direct control of candidates, making them more accountable for the spending and the conduct of their campaigns. Remember, this is hard money, accountable money. 
   These are the general principles behind the amendment I wanted to talk about today. But before getting to the specifics of this amendment, I have to say a word about the current process. We need campaign finance reform, but we are not going to get it through the predicament in which we find ourselves today--limited opportunities for debate, no opportunities for additional amendments, and no votes on those amendments. 
   My colleagues, Senators ABRAHAM, DEWINE, GORTON, and THOMAS, and I had planned to offer amendments to McCain-Feingold today. Now we are left only with the opportunity to talk about the amendments we would have offered if we had been given a chance to do so. 
   The amendments my colleagues and I intended to offer contained several significant changes in current campaign finance law. I will focus on the ones my colleagues and I believe are most important. Our amendment, first, would limit to $60,000 a year the total amount of soft money the national party committees combined could receive from an individual, PAC, corporation, or union. 
   A donor could give all $60,000 to one committee or spread the $60,000 over several committees. But the aggregate soft money donation could not exceed $60,000 per year. The limit would be indexed for inflation in future years. All union and corporate donations still would be treated as soft money to be used only for party-building activities. Union and corporate donations would not be treated as hard money for use in express advocacy or transfers to Federal candidates. 
   This is not a ban on financial support of parties. It is a return to the original intent of the campaign finance reforms of the 1970s, which worked until they were exploited and abused by, I might add, both parties. Nor is this a ban on political speech. There would remain many options. Donors who wanted to give more money for political speech could contribute to third party organizations. 
   I appreciate the legitimate free speech and constitutional concerns many of my colleagues and I have about these kinds of caps. This amendment offers a compromise that addresses the constitutional concerns while moving forward with reform legislation. 
   If the cap were challenged in court within 30 days after taking effect, the cap would be suspended until the conclusion of the court challenge. It is time now to adjust and index hard money contributions to inflation. For an individual, contribution limits would increase, for example, from $1,000 to $3,000 per candidate per election--and so it would go, for PACs and all committees. In future years, all limits would be indexed for inflation. 
   I have heard the argument that raising the hard money limits would give the wealthy too much influence and access. If 
   we cap soft money and do not adjust the hard money limits, we will chase more money into the black hole of third party ads, where the public cannot view the flow of money. I want to bring more of that money into the sunlight, into the daylight, where the American people have access to who is giving money and how much. They can decide for themselves if a candidate has been ``bought'' by anyone. 
   Financial disclosure is the core of any campaign finance reform. This amendment would take the rules on broadcast ads that apply now to candidates and extend them to all political broadcast ads. 
   Under current Federal regulations, when a candidate places a political ad with a broadcaster, the broadcaster is required to keep a file on the ad that is open to any member of the public who wants to see it. In that file is a record of the following: The time the spots are scheduled to air, the overall amount of time purchased, and the rates at which the ads were purchased. This information must be recorded immediately and made available for public inspection. 
   Under current Federal regulations, when an interest group places a political ad with a broadcaster, it does not have to meet the same requirements. The public cannot find out: Who bought the ad, when the ad will run, how much time was purchased, and how much was paid for the ad. It is closed from public view. 
   This amendment would require that interest group ads relating to any Federal candidate or issue also must go into the broadcaster's public file. For those types of ads, the broadcaster would be required to record the same information it does for ads by candidates and parties, including the amount spent on the ad. 
   As with candidates and party ads, the information on these political ads would be recorded immediately and made available for public inspection. There would be no added burden on the broadcaster. The broadcaster would simply use the same form already used for candidate and party ads. 
   Full disclosure should apply to a political ad by an interest group just as it does for a political committee or candidate because the objectives, after all, of all the ads are the same. 
   Let me make clear one thing this amendment does not do. It does not require unions, corporations, or any organization to identify individual donors or provide membership lists. This amendment preserves a reasonable balance between the public's right to know which groups are attempting to influence an election and the privacy rights of individual donors to an interest group. 
   In conclusion, we have before us a unique opportunity to accomplish something relevant, reasonable, and meaningful. We have an opportunity to restore some of the confidence the American people have lost in their political system. 
   All of us in this noble profession of politics have a responsibility to set high standards in American politics. Improving our system that selects American leaders--who formulate and implement Government policy that frames the governance of our Nation--is a worthy challenge. We can elevate the process and make it better--more open and more accountable--which leads to a more informed public through a more relevant public debate, leading to a more accountable Government. Let us not squander this opportunity or debase our responsibility. 
   Before I yield the floor, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Michigan be allowed to follow me.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished senior Senator from Mississippi who has managed this Agriculture appropriations bill through the high winds and difficult seas over the last few weeks. Some of that was acknowledged this morning. We started out dealing with agriculture, and we have now been dealing with the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and other important things. I am grateful for his patience, leadership, and diligence to get to this point. 
   This is a very important conference report we take up today. I rise to support the Agriculture appropriations conference report. 
   As has been noted on the floor of the Senate this morning that American agriculture is in trouble. Our American agricultural producers are struggling. I think it is worthy that we examine briefly what has caused this difficulty. 
   Good weather over the last 3 years has led to worldwide record grain yields, which has created a large oversupply and significantly reduced grain prices. Other important causes for these difficult times facing our agricultural producers are: The 2-year Asian economic crisis which has spread throughout the world; the high value of the American dollar versus other currencies; export subsidies and unfair trade practices by our foreign competitors; the lack of meaningful trade and sanctions reform; the lack of real tax and regulatory reform; and, for the last 5 years, the lack of fast-track trade authority for the President. All of these and more are directly responsible for the current situation in American agriculture. 
   I might add, they have nothing to do with our current farm policy, which is known as Freedom to Farm. What I have just registered, what I have just cited--those unpredictables, those uncontrollables--would be here regardless of America's farm policy. It is important to point that out because I have heard some suggest it is America's Freedom to Farm policy that this Congress enacted and this President signed in 1996 that is at the root of this disastrous agricultural situation in which we find ourselves. In fact, it is not. 
   This $69.3 billion bill will assist agricultural producers by providing, among other things, short-term assistance. It includes an $8.7 billion emergency package, and it is important we work our way through this so the American people understand what is included in this package: 
   There is $5.5 billion in agricultural market transition assistance payments that are paid directly to our agricultural producers, to the farmers and the ranchers. This equates to a 100-percent increase from the producers' 1999 payment and puts the money directly in the hands of our producers and certainly does it much faster than supplemental loan deficiency payments. 
   There is $1.2 billion for disaster relief; $475 million in direct payments to soybean and minor oilseed producers; $325 million in livestock feeder assistance; $325 million for livestock producers; $200 million is in the form of assistance to producers due to drought or other natural disasters; $400 million to assist producers in purchasing additional insurance for crops coming up that they will plant early next year for fiscal year 2000; and mandatory price reporting to assist livestock producers in their marketing decisions. 
   While the Agriculture appropriations conference report and emergency assistance package are important and they are very helpful in the short term, we need to look at the long-term solutions: How do we fix this for the long term so we don't keep coming back to Congress year after year after year for more supplemental appropriations? That is what we must stay focused on. We find those long-term solutions in opening up more opportunities for our farmers and our ranchers to sell the products. 
   Our producers need more open markets. While we need to adjust parts of  Freedom to Farm and we need to do that to make it work better, the basic underlying principle of Freedom to Farm should be preserved. And the basic underlying principle of Freedom to Farm is plant to the market, let the market decide. 
   In order to become more efficient and to produce for a growing market, we must give the producers the flexibility to grow what they want when they want: Grow for the market, not what the Government dictates or what the Government manipulates. 
   We need to adjust transition payments to make them more useful in times when cash flows are tight, when they are needed, not just arbitrary: Another supplemental appropriation. Payment levels may need to be adjusted annually, that is the way it is, to take into account such things as the value of the U.S. dollar, export opportunities, natural disasters, actual production levels, and other factors. 
   Loan deficiency payments have proven a useful tool for farmers, but we need to build into that more flexibility so producers can quickly respond to changes in the market. 
   The Crop Insurance Program is critical to the future of our ag producers. The Crop Insurance Program needs to be expanded and reformed so producers can be more self-reliant during economic downturns. We need to focus on private-sector solutions rather than public-sector solutions. 
   The United States needs a relevant and a vital trade policy that addresses the challenges of the 21st century. We need WTO accession for China, trade and sanctions reform, and more international food assistance programs. WTO negotiations also need to address unfair manipulation and other trade barriers that hurt America's farmers and ranchers. We are currently working our way through the beef hormone issue. The WTO has consistently come down in favor of the American producer, yet we still find the Europeans throw up artificial trade barriers. These are big issues, important issues. Trade must be a constant. It must be elevated to a priority in the next administration. The next President must put trade on the agenda, and he must lead toward accomplishment of that agenda. 
   As my friend, the distinguished Senator from Illinois, noted earlier, I, too, am disappointed this conference report does not contain the Ashcroft-Hagel-Dodd sanctions reform language, which passed this body, as noted by the distinguished Senator from Illinois, 70 to 28--70 votes in favor of lifting unilateral sanctions on food and medicine. I am confident we can move forward on this legislation. We will come back to it when it soon comes, again, to the Senate floor for consideration. The Ashcroft-Hagel-Dodd bill would exempt food and medicine from unilateral sanctions and embargoes. It is supported by the American Farm Bureau and the entire American agricultural community. 
   This reform also strengthens the ties among peoples and nations and demonstrates the goodness and the humanitarianism of the American people. It sends a very strong, clear message to our customers and our competitors around the world that our agricultural producers will be consistent and reliable suppliers of quality products. The American agricultural producer can compete with anyone in the world. Passing sanctions reform legislation will open up new markets, and it will allow our agricultural producers to compete in markets around the globe. I am hopeful we will move forward on comprehensive sanctions and trade reform legislation early next year. This must be a priority. It should be a priority. It is a priority, and it is a bipartisan priority. 
   As Senator DURBIN mentioned earlier, if you look at those 70 Senators who voted in favor of lifting sanctions on food and medicine, they represented the majority of both the Republican 
   and the Democratic Parties in this body. That is a very clear message that this is a bipartisan issue. We should capture the essence of that bipartisanship and let that lead us next year as we should, and we will, make considerable progress in trade and sanctions reform. 
   Regulations continue to add to the cost of production to farmers and ranchers. Regulatory reform is critical. We need to look at all the regulations currently on the books and make sure they are based on sound science and, lo and behold, common sense. 
   We need to look at tax reform. In 1996 when the Congress passed and the President signed Freedom to Farm, two promises were made by Congress to our agricultural producers: We would comprehensively deal with the important dynamics of tax reform and regulatory reform. We have failed to do so. We have failed to address comprehensive tax reform and regulatory reform, aside from what we have discussed, not dealing with sanctions and trade reform either. We need to look at tax reform. For example, farm and ranch risk management accounts, FARRM accounts, reduction in capital gains rates, elimination of estate taxes, income averaging, and other constructive actions are all measures that take us, move us, get us to where we want to be. 
   This conference report includes an important new provision we have not seen in past Agriculture appropriations bills, the mandatory price reporting provision. This is important for livestock producers. It allows for market transparency, it levels the playing field, and ensures fairness. We also need to look hard at other issues like industry concentration and meat labeling to ensure that markets remain free, fair, and competitive. 
   While we deal with short-term crises, we also need to work consistently, diligently on the long-term improvements focused on trade, and sanctions, and taxes, and regulatory reform, and agricultural policy. 
   This is important legislation we debate today and will vote on this afternoon. It provides much needed assistance at a very critical time in the agricultural community. I hope we will pass this conference report today and the President will sign it, so we can get our farmers and ranchers the assistance they need. Then this body can move on to do the important business of our Nation and the important business of our agricultural community, connected to the total of who we are, as a nation and as a global leader, and that is paying attention to the issues of trade and foreign policy, sanctions reform, and all that is connected to the future for our country and the world as we enter this next millennium. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, what is the objective of a comprehensive test ban treaty? What is the objective of what we are about? The objective is to stop nuclear proliferation. The objective is to make the world safer for mankind. Unfortunately, this noble effort now must be rescued from partisan politics. We are trapped in a political swamp as we attempt to compress a very important debate on a very important issue. 
   A few minutes ago, there was an exchange about timing. We only have a few hours to debate. My goodness, is that any way to responsibly deal with what may, in fact, be the most critical and important vote any of us in this Chamber will ever make? It is not. We cannot have a serious debate about nuclear proliferation when artificial timelines prevent that important debate. Unfortunately, the political environment has captured this issue. 
   Aside from all the technical debate that will go on, as has begun this morning, and rightfully so, about this treaty, this treaty is symbolic. It represents 50 years of America's leadership throughout the world in dealing with our allies and, yes, our adversaries, in trying to curb nuclear proliferation.  
   Much has been said this morning by my distinguished colleagues about our allies, Great Britain and France. They moved forward in good faith last year and ratified this treaty. Consequently, they are dismantling their nuclear testing facilities. What do we say to them if we defeat this treaty? What do we say to the rest of the world, and what is that symbol, what is the message we project? 
   We are far better off to take the time necessary to work our way through the critical questions and issues. This debate needs to be taken down many layers, many levels in the questions that are relevant. We have forced hearings this week in three committees. The committee on which I serve, Foreign Relations, had more than 6 hours of hearings yesterday. They were informative and important. There is a great amount of doubt and question and concern about the governance language in this treaty: Who governs the implementation of this treaty, who is in charge, aside from all the technical questions. We could take days on the provisions for site inspections alone, and we should. 
   What are the consequences of us pulling out of this treaty? I hear from a number of my friends: If it is a bad treaty, we sign it and go ahead, and if the President of the United States says in the supreme national security interests of America we will pull out of the treaty--my goodness, do we think it is that easy to arbitrarily pull out of a treaty we led for over 50 years under the leadership of President Eisenhower, that was further anchored by the actions of President Kennedy with the first ban on nuclear testing in 1963? Do we think the political environment would be such that we could just arbitrarily pull out when we wanted? Do we not understand the consequences of that? 
   What about side agreements? We learned yesterday, for example, in the Foreign Relations Committee hearings that there are side agreements. That does not mean it is bad, but what are those side agreements? How do they affect us? What is the management? What is the governance? Who makes the deal? Do those side agreements have force behind them? What happens in 10 years when there are new governments? 
   My colleagues understand and share with me the same 
   fundamental responsibility to this country, and that is, America's security is paramount; nothing else is more important. That is our premier responsibility as Senators as we debate this issue. The fundamental principle we must follow is not to jeopardize the security of our people and our country.

   Mr. HAGEL. I suspect his contribution would not be relevant to the debate. The very serious fact is, we will have a new administration. 
   Is this treaty, essentially born 50 years ago from Eisenhower forward, relevant to the challenges of today? 
   Is it relevant to the new challenges of this next new century, the new challenges that this new administration, this new President will have to deal with? Are we boxing in this new administration? Shouldn't this new administration coming in, in January 2001, have an opportunity to review arms control, look at what those needs are, what is relevant? 
   The world has changed. It has changed in 10 years. The world used to be rather simple when we took this issue up 50 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago: Two superpowers, the Soviets, the Americans; they were the ones with the nukes. Therefore, we created a structure, a protocol, a treaty that dealt with that. That has changed. 
   I strongly urge the President of the United States, as I did the other night--telling him directly, and my leader and the Democratic leader, and all of my colleagues--to not allow us to get into a box we cannot get out of and take a vote on Tuesday. It is irresponsible. It will surely go down. There will be consequences for that vote. It is the wrong thing to do for America. It is not responsible governance. 
   What do we do? Why not continue to hold hearings on this very important issue, take this down to as many levels as we need, get the answers? Maybe we have to restructure; I don't know. But the way it is now, we are not prepared to vote. Why not inform the American public? Why not allow the American public to understand what we are doing? Why not allow all of our Senators to understand a little bit more than we do now about this issue? 
   The tough questions must be asked, the consequences played out. We must not allow ourselves to get trapped again in a timeline. 
   I heard this morning, Why not take a vote right after the election next year? That is interesting. Why not float it out? Why not do this up or down? But why force an artificial timeline? If the political environment is not right to have an honest, open, legitimate debate, it is not right. That is a fact of life. But do not rush something that is going to have dire consequences for the future of the world to satisfy some political dynamic or someone's interest in driving a timeline or driving a political determination. That is irresponsible. 
   Regrettably, I must say to my colleagues, if that vote is held on Tuesday, I will have to vote against this treaty. That will be regrettable because I would like to have more time to ask more questions, to understand what we are doing, because I, as do all my colleagues, take this responsibility very seriously. I say again, this vote, if it does come Tuesday or next year or in 2001, may in fact be the most critical vote any of us ever cast. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HAGEL. That is correct, I say to the Senator. I think it is a wise course of action. I so informed the President the other night at the White House. I so informed my colleagues. I again say, as I did, if I have to vote Tuesday, I will vote against it. That will be regrettable because I believe arms control, the focused management of nuclear proliferation, is a responsibility this country has had. 
   We have taken the lead position on that for 50 years. I am proud of that. You are proud of that. To box ourselves in, surely knowing the impending defeat, I think would be a catastrophe for our leadership in the world.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I take the floor of the Senate tonight to address the same issue that my colleague from Missouri, Senator ASHCROFT, has talked about for the last 30 minutes, and the distinguished senior Senator from Kansas has addressed; that is, the Agriculture appropriations bill. It seems to be rather conflicted. I suspect most people in this country believe in the democratic process. I suspect most people in this country believe the will of the majority and the protection of the minority is rather relevant to our democracy. But we have come upon a fascinating example of that not being the case in this Agriculture appropriations bill. 
   Senator ASHCROFT laid it out rather clearly, as did Senator BROWNBACK. This is not a particularly complicated situation. What we have is the will of  the majority in the Senate, expressed by a vote of 70 to 28. That is a rather significant majority. As a matter of fact, that is a majority large enough to override a Presidential veto. The will of 70 Senators to support an amendment that obviously 70 Senators thought was important enough to come out and debate and register their vote and their will on, representing the constituencies of 70 Senators, said it rather plainly: We want the Ashcroft-Hagel-Dodd amendment in the Agriculture appropriations bill. 
   So we went to conference with the House. Guess what. The House conferees not only agreed that the Ashcroft-Hagel-Dodd amendment lifting sanctions for medicine and food against countries where we have unilateral, arbitrary economic sanctions was a good idea, they actually strengthened the language. The House conferees actually made the Ashcroft-Hagel-Dodd language stronger. 
   We progress along up until the leadership enters the picture. I might add so there is no mistake about this--and I will try to speak clearly--it was the Republican leadership in the Senate and House that said: No, a few of us do not care for that. So we are going to do something that rarely ever happens, and that is we are going to stop that, you see, because technically we have a process, we are the leaders, and we can strip that out of the appropriations bill. No matter, of course, that 70 U.S. Senators said, ``No, we want that in,'' and the House conferees said, ``No, we want that in; we think it is in the best interests of the U.S. foreign policy and American agriculture.'' Disregard that. That does not count. 
   So what we have is an interesting spectacle of the leadership of intimidation and the intimidation of leadership--not a pretty sight, not a democratic process. We occasionally question why America is beyond concern with the process, with the leadership, with politics. We wonder why. This is a very vivid, clear example of why. 
   We are going through this little mating dance again around here on the budget. I call it a charade. It is a charade. I have even called it dishonest. Some of my colleagues said: Senator HAGEL, we do not use that terminology in the Senate. I said: I am sorry, but where I am from, some of the stuff that goes on around here that we think is policy, or we define or defend as a technical adjustment, it is just plain dishonest if you are going to live within the caps. If you are going to spend more than what the caps tell you that we agreed to do, then let's be honest about it. 
   The same thing with this conference committee. There are those among us in the media, across this land, who say we should reform our political process, we should reform Congress. They have a point. But it all starts here. It all starts here. If we cannot be held accountable and responsible enough to work the will of the majority to do the right thing, to be honest, and be open, and be responsible with our governance, with our leadership, with our legislative process, then to what can the American people look? What can they trust? What confidence can they have in their system? 
   This Republic is not going to crumble tomorrow, and it will not crumble next year because of the shenanigans we pull around here. But we will pay a high price one of these days in one of these generations when we continue to define down our expectations and our standards and let a few people, a cabal of a few people take advantage of the system. 
   I am very proud. It is my understanding at this moment that there were two Republican Senators who refused to sign the conference report today on the Agriculture appropriations bill. To them I say thank you. Not only have you done the right thing, but you have shown America and some of us in this body that we, in fact, can do the right thing, and that we are not going to be intimidated by the leadership, by a small cabal of people in charge who hold responsibility. 
   There are consequences to this. There are consequences in our foreign policy and in our agricultural policy because they are all connected. But the consequences will come more directly in the breakdown of confidence and trust in this institution. As that erodes, as that continues to erode, and a few select people in this body play it their way and refuse to open the process, then there will be reform. And if the American people have to keep turning over Congresses to get to leadership--and we all have to take responsibility in this Chamber because we elect the leadership--and if we have to continue to turn over leadership, we will do that to ensure, if nothing else, that we can openly, honestly debate the important, relevant issues for this country that affect the world and affect everybody in this Nation. 
   When those decisions are made and when the will of 70 Senators is abrogated, is hijacked, it is time for some major reform in this body, and I will be one of the leaders to help do that. 
   In conclusion, this should serve as a very clear example of a lot of the nonsense that permeates this process. This is not just about the American farmer or the American rancher. This is far bigger than American agricultural policy and foreign policy and national security and all the interconnects. This is about whether we can trust the process. More basically, why do we even have authorizing committees in this body if the appropriations process is going to make policy because they have the money? Then the leadership, even a smaller group, decides what they want to take out of those decisions, so they pick and choose, and the rest of us, essentially, are superfluous to the process. Why don't we just have 10 Senators? Why not take a couple committee chairmen, the leadership, and the rest of us go home; they can make the decisions. 
   We are walking our way through an early Halloween. We are walking our way through a charade, and we should call it that. And, yes, it is dishonest. I think there are enough of us in this body who are going to say it straight and call it the way we see it. 
   I hope we will come to our senses before we cross a line from which we cannot come back and allow this hijacking of democratic governance, this hijacking of democratic justice to set an even lower standard than what we have been doing this year with the budgets and the constant back and forth of let's not do anything; let's just go home; let's just get out; let's just do enough to get to the next day; let's not take on the real, relevant issues of America; let's not deal with health care; let's not deal with a lot of things. 
   The right way to do this is to come out and debate it, whether it is campaign finance reform or whatever the issue is, debate it, open it up. If you lose, you lose; if you win, you win. That is what America wants. That is what they will demand, and that is what ultimately they will receive. 
   I am sorry I had to take the floor, as did my colleagues tonight, to talk about this. This is not a proud moment for me. It is not a proud moment for this institution. But if there is anything we have in this Nation that must be cherished and nourished and formed and shaped and protected and defended at all costs, it is the institution. It is the process and the institution that allows this self-governance and the freedom to stand on the floor of the Senate, stand anywhere in this Nation and express ourselves, the minority knowing they will be protected and the majority knowing they can count on a fair shake in that process. 
   That ultimately, as we define the process down, is the most important dynamic of who we are as a people and why this Republic has survived for over 200 years. When we discount that, when we discount that currency, when we abridge that responsibility, then we turn our backs on everyone who has sacrificed for the freedom that allows us to do this. We are a better country than that. We are a better people than that. We will rise to the occasion to turn this around and hold on to the one currency that counts in all of our lives, and that is trust. When we debase that trust, we debase the very currency of who we are. 
   I will always throw my confidence, the completeness of who I am and what I represent, behind the good common sense of the American people, and the faith I have in the American people will always dictate the outcome of these kinds of exercises, as it was written, as it was stated, and as it was the vision of the great men who formed this country and wrote this Constitution. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I wish to thank my distinguished colleague and friend from Ohio for his leadership on the ``Carousel Retaliation Act.''  
   I am a free trader, but I am also a fair trader. Trade is our economic future. It is especially so in agriculture. Trade is our strongest engine of economic growth. 
   I, as have many of my colleagues, have fought for legislative reform on unilateral sanctions policies that hurt our trade, trade reform, fast-track authority for the President, and other trade-related legislation. 
   Free trade is a two-way street. Unfortunately, throughout the world the instinct for protectionism still remains strong. If trading partners take advantage of us, we can't simply remain passive and permit American exporters--especially farmers and ranchers--to continue to take a beating in foreign markets. 
   Trade is a two-way street. Free, fair, and open trade is a two-way street. Access to markets improves all people's standard of living. Some of our trading partners believe this. Some people talk about it, and some people actually do something about it. Unfortunately, many of our trading partners' rhetoric is stronger than their actions. That is why I am an original cosponsor of this bill. 
   As you heard from my colleague, Senator DEWINE, this bill would require the U.S. Trade Representative to periodically review a retaliation list of foreign products from countries that fail to comply with the World Trade Organization rulings or do not reduce trade barriers against the United States. Different products would be rotated on and off the list every few months until the offending countries made the right changes in trade policy. 
   That is what we as a community of nations of civilized people decided to do when we formed the World Trade Organization. That is what the World Trade Organization is about--to sort through disputes in trade. If we cannot rely on the World Trade Organization to make tough decisions, settle those disputes, and then enforce the WTO rulings, then what good is the organization? 
   If the members of the World Trade Organization find some rulings against their own self-interest and not in compliance with what they think is right, or if they believe they must pick and choose which WTO rulings they will enforce and live with, then we don't have much of an open, fair, and free trade organization that today is known as the World Trade Organization. It is a myth and it is a charade unless we all comply with the WTO rulings and enforce the rulings. That is the only way it will work. 
   The policy of targeted tariffs is prompted, quite honestly, by the European Union's ban on American beef. There is no scientific evidence to support the European Union's contention that using growth-enhancing hormones in cattle poses any health threat to humans. There is no scientific evidence at all. 
   But yet, even though we have won case after case in the World Trade Organization, the European Union continues to walk through this charade of artificial tariffs and barriers. The hormone argument is a very flimsy excuse, at best, for straight out, raw protectionism. The WTO's recent position vindicating their position was essentially a slap on the wrist for the EU, and still the EU is trying to delay compliance with even this token penalty. 
   If the EU keeps playing games with the United States in the hormone-enhancing beef issue, this policy of targeted tariffs will provide us with a flexible, effective way to respond. No one wants to take this kind of action. But each one of us in this body represents hard-working constituents who seek to improve their communities, enhance the growth of their families, give the world opportunities, and playing by the rules. That is what we are talking about here--playing by the rules straight out, to be honest. 
   Again, I don't look forward to working on this bill to implement it if, in the interest of open, fair, and free trade, we must resort to this kind of activity. American farmers and ranchers are hurting partly because of weak export markets. It is not because they are not producing quality products. We produce quality products. But it is because of politics and protectionism. 
   I strongly support this bill. I am proud to be an original cosponsor. I am sorry we have to take this measure, but it is necessary. And the world must understand that the United States will do whatever it takes to support our producers and to assure, as best we can, that the world improves all people's lives, all people's standard of living, hope, opportunity, and economic growth if we continue to make progress with free, open, fair trade.

   Mr. HAGEL. I join my friend, the senior Senator from Nebraska, in supporting a federal appropriation for the Mari Sandoz Cultural Center. 
   Nebraska has produced a number of this nation's most significant writers. The John Neihardt Center in Bancroft and the Willa Cather Center in Red Cloud commemorate two of Nebraska's most famous literary figures. A facility dedicated to Mari Sandoz would be an appropriate addition on to the state's literary heritage. 
   Following Mari Sandoz's death, Chadron State College came into possession of her writing and personal artifacts. The College developed the idea of the cultural center as the best way to preserve her legacy. Plans for the center include museum display areas for American Indians and Sandoz family artifacts, rooms for meetings and workshops on Sandoz' work, archives for Sandoz' manuscripts, and an herbarium that will complement the descriptions of regional flora central to Sandoz' literature. The center would be a perfect tribute to one of Nebraska's finest writers.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the nomination of Richard Holbrooke to be this country's Ambassador to the U.N. I was thinking the other day when we were engaged in the Foreign Relation Committee's fourth hearing on Mr. Holbrooke --four hearings on Mr. Holbrooke. We looked rather closely and thoroughly at his policies, his background, his professional and personal life. He did not come up short in all of those areas. But I was thinking, I don't know if there has been an individual who has been more probed and investigated for this very important position than Mr. Holbrooke. 
   I have believed for a long time that the President of the United States deserves his team. As he nominates his team for the Senate to pass judgment on, give advice and consent, as constitutionally is our responsibility, if that individual possesses the high moral quality and qualifications, and the high professional standings, qualifications, and experience, then the President needs his team. 
   I echo much of what has been said this morning about how important it is that we get our Representative of the United Nations. Now, we have differences of opinion in philosophy and policy, and I appreciate that. Every Senator has his or her own position, as it should be. But I will say this as my last comment about Mr. Holbrooke. I hope and I believe he will make every effort to bring some bipartisanship to foreign policy. It seems to me that we have allowed bipartisanship in foreign policy and national security affairs to erode and come undone to the point where it is dangerous. 
   I believe both sides are responsible. I think the President hasn't reached out enough, and I think we in the Congress have made foreign policy and national security affairs a more brittle, raw political dynamic. If we don't come back together, as bipartisanship needs to be sewn back together in these very important issues for the future of our country and stability of the world, we will pay a high price. I hope that Mr. Holbrooke will lead that effort. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, first I add my thanks and appreciation to the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, for the leadership he has provided in getting a very fair, responsible, realistic, reasonable tax cut this far. It has been a rather remarkable achievement. It is the right thing for America. 
   I rise to state my strong support for this bill. We have heard a lot of talk about standards of fairness, is this right, does it help everyone. That is a good question, an appropriate question. 
   I ask these questions: What can be more fair than an across-the-board reduction in marginal tax rates? Everyone who pays Federal income tax benefits. 
   Let's put some perspective on this. This tax cut bill is focused on those who pay taxes. It might be a revelation for some, but actually it is true and we acknowledge that right from the beginning. This is about tax relief for those who pay Federal income taxes. 
   Another relevant question is: What is more fair than ensuring people do not pay more in taxes just because they are married? Was it fair that we penalized married couples? No. This tax bill addresses that issue, and we do something about it. In fact, we make it fair. 
   Are only rich people married? I don't think so. I think a lot of middle-class people are married. I think a lot of people at the bottom of the economic structure who pay Federal income taxes are married. Surely, they will benefit from this tax bill. 
   Another question: What is more fair than making sure farmers--we have been talking about farmers all week--and small businesspeople, the engine of economic growth in America, don't have to sell their farms or their businesses in order to pass them on to their children so they, in fact, can keep farming? 
   That is fair. Are there people in the middle-class economic structure of America who so fit? I think so. 
   Another question: What is more fair than making sure self-employed individuals have the same opportunities as big corporations when it comes to deducting the cost of health insurance? I think that is rather fair. 
   What about this: What is more fundamentally fair than giving back to the American people their money when they are paying too much in taxes, say, over $3 trillion more in taxes projected over the next 10 years? 
   This bill does that. It does it fairly; it does it reasonably; it does it realistically; and it does it responsibly. 
   We have heard in this Chamber over the last few minutes some of my colleagues talk about Social Security. My goodness, all responsible legislators, all responsible Americans would not dare take Social Security surpluses and use those for tax cuts. We are not talking about that. If the American public gets a sense that there is just a hint of demagoguery in this, they might be right and they actually might be on to something because the fact is, this plan does not do that. 
   All Social Security surpluses are laid aside. We do not cut Medicare. We do not cut into spending. We provide for the adequate national defense requirements and, in fact, increase national defense spending over the next 10 years, veterans' benefits, and education benefits. That is where every 75 cents of this $1 overpayment goes. The other 25 cents goes back to the taxpayer. 
   This is not theory or some abstract debate. You either favor tax cuts or you do not. We can all dance around this and we can confuse each other and say: It's not fair and it's not reasonable. 
   In the end, this place is about decisionmaking, hard choices. It is about hard choices, and you either agree that we should cut taxes or you do not. That is what we are going to vote on today. There are two clear choices: Give the American people a tax cut or keep the money in Washington where it surely will be spent.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader I wish to announce that today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 10:30 a.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of the pending disaster relief amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations Act. It is hoped that the Senate will be able to dispose of those amendments today at a reasonable hour. As a reminder, the Senate will recess today from 12:30 to 2:15 so that the weekly party conferences can meet. As a further reminder, a cloture motion on the dairy compact amendment was filed on Monday. Therefore, under the provisions of rule XXII, that cloture vote will take place 1 hour after the Senate convenes tomorrow, unless an agreement is made by the two leaders. 
   Prior to the August recess, it is the intention of the leader to complete action on the Agriculture appropriations bill, the Interior appropriations bill, and it is also hoped that the conference report to the tax reconciliation bill will be available for consideration. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, over the weekend in Nebraska, I met with a number of agricultural producers about the current prices in American agriculture. Over the last 3 weeks, my staff and I have spoken to over 100 agricultural producers in the State of Nebraska--hog producers, cattle producers, grain producers; and then the second rim, the outer rim representing the agricultural community--bankers, implement dealers, automobile dealers. All had a consistent theme as to what we must do to direct our attention and our effort to dealing with this crisis in America. 
   As we begin debate today on the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture appropriations bill and on the emergency appropriation for agriculture, we should keep in mind some important dynamics about American agriculture. Leaders of both parties in the Senate committed last week to including in the fiscal year 2000 Agriculture appropriations bill an emergency funding measure to provide the short-term assistance needed for our agricultural producers, and that assistance should include increasing the market transition payments--I am confident we will see legislation to do that--lifting the caps on loan deficiency payments, and additional funding for crop insurance. I know that part of Freedom to Farm in 1996 was the commitment to America's agricultural producers to, in fact, reform crop insurance. We are on our way in that area, but we have not yet arrived at that reform. 
   Crop insurance is a very key dynamic to the future of American agriculture. The emergency appropriations bill should include relief for livestock producers, and I am confident we will see that in both of the bills that will be presented today, plus other emergency measures. 
   As we address this immediate crisis, we must continue to work on the long-term priorities. The perspective is  clear. We have an immediate problem, and we will address that immediate problem. But let us not lose sight of the long-term priorities for American agriculture. 
   To do that we must focus on the demand side of the equation. When I talk about the demand side of the equation, I am talking about trade. I am talking about trade policies that encourage market development and the opening of new markets for our producers. We must continue to work for trade and sanctions reform--another critical component of the 1996 farm bill. I regret to say that Congress and the President have not done a very good job in the area of trade and sanctions reform. We are working on it, but we are a long way from being where we should be. 
   For example, it is estimated that current unilateral sanctions cost the U.S. economy more than $20 billion each year. Who do we penalize? Who do we hurt? We hurt ourselves. We must stop using agricultural policy as a foreign policy weapon. Instead, we must extend a strong message to our customers and competitors around the world that U.S. agricultural producers are consistent and reliable suppliers of quality and plentiful agricultural products. 
   We need fast track authority for the President in order to reach trade agreements that will open more markets to our agricultural goods and allow our producers to compete on a level playing field. 
   Today we stand in a situation that is unprecedented in the last 25 years. This President of the United States has been without fast track negotiating authority since 1994. Obviously, there has been a lack of focus on priority on this issue. Every day the President does not have the authority to negotiate trade treaties and arrangements and deals, the European Union is doing it; the South American trade organization Mercosur is doing it; others are doing it. We are not. Do we not understand that we will pay a very significant price, a high price, for being moved out of those markets because we have not placed trade as a high priority? Fast track authority is certainly a very clear example. 
   We must work to break down protectionist barriers in the next round of the World Trade Organization negotiations being held this fall in Seattle and strongly oppose the European Union's delay on lifting the ban on hormone-enhanced beef. 
   We should work with China to encourage its entrance into the WTO. Do we really not understand that it is surely in the best interests of America, stability in the world, and new markets for all American products to have China in the World Trade Organization, not cutting corners but complying with all the necessary criteria to be a member of the WTO? It is in our best interests to continue to bring China into responsible organizations where China has more responsibility and accountability and opens a market of 1.3 billion people. We need more focus in that effort. 
   The President must make trade a top priority. He must make trade a top priority and then lead. It is not good enough to say our trade ambassador will negotiate. The President sets the agenda; the President sets the priority. Presidents lead. The next President of the United States is going to be consumed with an immense series of challenges. The Congress needs to place a higher priority on working in these challenges. 
   We must fulfill our commitment to American agriculture for tax and regulatory reform. Our national tax policy should encourage long-term investment in production agriculture that helps our current producers stay in business. 
   We must reduce Government regulation and cut taxes. There are a number of things we can do, that we promised we would do in 1996: 
   Eliminate the estate tax. Our family farmers should not have to sell the family farm to pay taxes in order to keep the farm going. That cuts right to the core for our future and for the next generation of farmers; 
   Provide capital gains tax relief on the sale of the farmland by our producers, expanding on the exclusion given to homeowners in 1997. Eventually, we should abolish capital gains taxes. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, affirmed his view on that before the Senate Banking Committee; 
   Create tax-deferred farm and ranch risk management accounts to help ease fluctuations in income, thereby giving our producers another management tool; 
   Ensure that farmers and ranchers receive the full benefits of the permanent income-averaging provisions and not lose them because of the alternative minimum tax; 
   Obviously, we must eliminate the marriage penalty and provide 100 percent deductibility for health insurance premiums. 
   These are real; these connect; they are relevant. They will help American agriculture; they will help our country. 
   We must ease the regulatory burdens on our agricultural producers. The USDA, the EPA, and other regulatory agencies hit farmers with dozens of different regulations that tie up their land, they tie up their time, they tie up their capital, and reduce their efficiency and reduce their profits. To what end? What is the cost-benefit ratio? 
   Let's take a real-life example. Two of our biggest competitors, Brazil and Argentina, have been gaining in their share of the world's commodity trade, especially in corn and wheat. The Brazilians and the Argentines are able to make a profit on these crops at prices lower than production costs in the United States. 
   Why? There are many reasons we can measure. I will state a couple. The Brazilians and Argentines pay much lower taxes than our American agricultural producers pay. Second, they have fewer Government regulations to contend with. Their Government does not place added burdens on them, not only as producers but as marketers. Their Government actually helps. Their Government doesn't stand in the way. We need to do the same thing. 
   In 1996, we got the Federal Government out of the farmers' fields. Now we need to get the Federal Government off the farmers' backs. 
   In the short term, we must swiftly conclude action on an agricultural appropriations bill that will provide emergency relief to our commodity and our livestock producers. Over the long term, it is good public policy, domestically and internationally, to provide for abundant and inexpensive food. We can support that policy by adopting prudent Government policies, Government policies such as trade policies that encourage market development, policies which create international financial stability. 
   Here is a very clear example of how the globe connects, how all 6 billion people in the world connect. Stability is the base from which we work to help develop emerging democracies, market economies, opening new opportunities and new markets. All of our policies are connected--national defense, foreign policy, trade policy--and ``ground'' all of our other policies with an anchor of stability so that the people of the world will have the hope that they must have to have a better world and a better life. It gives all people of the world an opportunity to build bridges to each other. 
   We need tax policies which encourage long-term investments in production agriculture to help sustain our current producers. These are the most important ways we can help our farmers and our consumers, our taxpayers, and our international trade partners. 
   In the short term, we need to share the risks--yes, share the risks--that from time to time will adversely impact farming, such as has been the case for the last 2 years. We cannot sustain a long-term policy of providing abundant and inexpensive food without occasionally producing more than the market will absorb in the short term. We cannot control the weather or international markets. We need to factor in those realities of farming and not act shocked every time this happens. 
   Most agricultural producers I have spoken to, not just in the last month but in the last 4 years, 5 years, 10 years, do not believe that the United States should retreat to the 1980 set-aside, higher price support policies which they believe only extended and deepened problems of the 1980s and certainly would extend and deepen the current crisis. I agree. 
   To support production agriculture and sustain the producer base which  has contributed so much to our economic stability and prosperity, we need to provide short-term support to our agricultural producers now. 
   Congress needs to pass a realistic and a responsible emergency agriculture bill. The Congress must act this week. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, last week, 20 of my colleagues of both parties joined me in introducing the Regulatory Openness and Fairness Act, a bill to amend the Food Quality Protection Act to ensure that the EPA used sound science in its evaluation of pesticide uses. This legislation is particularly relevant given yesterday's announcement by the EPA that they will ban two important pesticides. 
   Let me begin by saying that a safe food supply is, of course, in everyone's best interests. We all want to ensure that our children and American consumers continue to have access to abundant, safe agricultural products. It is in the best interests of consumers and agricultural producers that decisions on pesticide uses are based on sound scientific analysis--sound scientific analysis. That was the intent of the law which passed, with strong bipartisan support, 3 years ago. In 1996, Congress passed the Food Quality Protection Act to ensure the safety of our Nation's food supply. It passed with the overwhelming support of the agricultural industry and was seen as a much-needed modernization of laws governing all pesticide use. 
   As written and signed by the President, the FQPA requires the EPA to reassess all of the Nation's pesticides, using more data, taking more factors into account, and allowing greater margins of safety. The FQPA also requires that these standards be based on hard data and sound science, not arbitrary assumptions or computer models. 
   Under the FQPA, next week the EPA faces its first deadline for announcing its evaluation of some 3,000 uses of pesticides. As EPA prepares for its deadline, it has not fully used the sound scientific analysis called for in the 1996 FQPA bill. Instead, the EPA has relied on theoretical computer models and worst case scenarios in many of these cases. The EPA frequently prefers this approach, partly as a result of not having the resources or the time to focus. But this is not what Congress intended in 1996. We did not intend for farmers to lose the use of safe and effective pesticides. We did not intend for public health officials dealing with pest control issues to lose the products that help them protect the public. 
   The bill my colleagues and I have introduced, the Regulatory Openness and Fairness Act, makes sure that EPA follows what was the intent of Congress 3 years ago. It will lessen the chance that safe and effective pesticides would be removed from the market without scientific justification; it provides a clear and predictable regulatory process based on scientific data; it streamlines the process for evaluating new pesticides; and it provides Congress with facts on how the act, as applied by the EPA, affects agriculture exports. 
   We cannot forget that crop protection allows our farmers to produce the grains, the fruits, and the vegetables that feed not just our Nation but the world. Unnecessary regulations have a dampening effect on the engine that has fueled America's economic growth. That engine is called productivity. If the FQPA is not implemented fully and fairly, based on sound science, we will unnecessarily place our agricultural producers at a very great competitive disadvantage in world markets. Production prices will increase, productivity will decrease, and consequently our farmers will see their exports decline. This is hardly the time to be placing extra, unnecessary burdens on America's farmers. 
   This bill is good for both consumers and agricultural producers. Consumers will continue to have safe, affordable, and abundant agricultural goods and farmers will continue to have the tools they need to produce safe, quality food products and to compete in the world market. 
   In Nebraska, we call that common sense. I am proud to join my 20 colleagues in a strong bipartisan effort to introduce the Regulatory Fairness and Openness Act. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, I rise to strongly support this amendment. I am a cosponsor. As Senator ASHCROFT noted, it is the blending of Senator ASHCROFT's bill and my bill that produced this amendment. 
   This amendment establishes a basic principle: Food and medicine are the most fundamental of human needs and should not be included in unilateral sanctions. 
   The rate of change in today's world is unprecedented in history. Trade, and particularly trade in food and medicine, is the common denominator that ties together the nations of the world. American exports of food and medicine act to build bridges around the world. It strengthens ties between people and demonstrates the innate goodness and humanitarianism of the American people. 
   This amendment recognizes that there could be reasons to restrict food and medicine exports and recognizes that, in fact, sometimes unilateral sanctions are in the best interests of this Nation's security. We do not take that ability away from the President of the United States. That is not what this amendment does. We all recognize that there are times when unilateral sanctions should, in fact, be in the arsenal of our foreign policy tools, but it also recognizes that the Congress should have a role in that decision. 
   This amendment recognizes that there are circumstances where export controls may be necessary, such as in times of war, if it is a dual-use item controlled by the Commerce Department, or if the product could be used in the manufacture of chemical or biological weapons. That is not the debate here. That is not the debate. 
   But we have had a long and sad history in understanding what unilateral sanctions do to those who impose them. We don't isolate Cuba. We don't isolate China. We don't isolate any nation other than our own interests when we say: We will not sell you our grain, our medicines. 
   Do we really believe that in the world we live in today a nation cannot get wheat from Australia, from Canada, or cannot get soybeans from Brazil? The fact is that the world is dynamic. It has always been dynamic. The challenges change. The solutions to those challenges, the answers to those challenges, must be dynamic as well. 
   We need to send a strong message to our customers and our competitors around the world that our agricultural producers are going to be consistent and reliable suppliers of quality and plentiful agricultural products. 
   I heard the discussion on the floor of the Senate today about this amendment--talking about, well, my goodness, are we trying to fix the problems of farmers with this amendment with sanctions reform? No. No, we are not. 
   But I think it is important we understand that this is connected. This is linked. Trade reform and sanctions reform were, in fact, part of the commitment that this Congress made to our agricultural community in 1996. 
   We need to lead. We need to be creative. We need to be relevant. We need to connect the challenges with the policy. USDA, for example, reports that the value of agricultural exports this year will drop to $49 billion. That is a reduction from $60 billion just 3 years ago. American agriculture is already suffering from depressed prices and reduced global markets, as we have heard very clearly today, making sanctions reform even more important. Again, let's not blur the lines of this debate. 
   I noted as well the debate today on the floor regarding the Iranian piece of sanctions reform. 
   Let's not forget that when America broke diplomatic relations with Iran, Iran was the largest importer of American wheat in the world. I think, as has been noted, Iran this year will import almost $3 billion worth of wheat. Are we talking about just the commercial interests and the agricultural interests of America and national security interests be damned? No, we are not talking about that. 
   This amendment gives the President the power, when he thinks it is in our national security interests or in our national interests as he defines those through his policy, to impose unilateral sanctions. However, he does it with the Congress as a partner; the Congress has a say when we use unilateral sanctions. 
   This is not just about doing what is right for the American farmer and rancher, the agricultural producer. This amendment also makes good humanitarian and foreign policy sense. Our amendment will say to the hungry and oppressed of the world that the United States will not make their suffering worse by restricting access to food and medicine. 
   I have heard the arguments; I understand the arguments. I don't believe I live in a fairyland about where the food goes, where the medicine goes. We understand there always is that issue when we export food, sell food, give food to dictators, to tyrants. We understand realistically where some of that may be placed. 
   To arbitrarily shut off to the people, the oppressed masses of the world, food, medicine, and opportunities is not smart foreign policy. It is not smart foreign policy. It will make it harder for an oppressive government, the tyrants and dictators, to blame the United States for humanitarian plights of their own people. In today's world, unilateral trade sanctions primarily isolate those who impose them. 
   For those reasons and many others that Members will hear in comments made yet this afternoon on the floor of the Senate, I strongly encourage my colleagues to take a hard look at what we are doing, what we are trying to do, to make some progress toward bringing a unilateral sanctions policy into a world that is relevant with the borderless challenges of our time. I believe we do protect the national interests of this country, that we sacrifice none of the national interests on behalf of American agriculture. In fact, this amendment accomplishes both. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, thank you. 
   I first want to add my thanks to the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, for the leadership he has brought to the floor on such an important issue on a very substantive vehicle that we are using now to really make some decisions on behalf of the American public. 
   I have heard this morning that this is an issue about priorities. Surely it is. This is about priorities. This will further be about priorities as we debate this issue throughout the day, and actually throughout this year and into next year, because the priorities are about whose money it is. It is not my money. It is not Senator GRAMM's money. It is not President Clinton's money. It is the taxpayers' money. We tend to allow that to slip aside here when we are engaged in this theoretical debate. 
   Second, we all have to appreciate that we live in the mythical kingdom around here. The political kingdom says that all the clouds and all the  goodness will reside here in the knowledge and the fountain of wisdom coming forth from Washington. We are seeing a great dynamic of that given when we are trying to take the people's money and then tell them how we will spend it and give it back to them because we are benevolent Senators; we are benevolent representatives of the people; we can figure it out better. 
   If there is a sense of arrogance in this, I think you are right if you sense that, that the Congress is going to decide who gets what; we are going to make that decision. So we are going to target all of these pieces of the pie because we can decide better for the American people how they should spend their money, if we decide to give them back some of their money. 
   I have also heard some interesting conversations this morning about projections. As a matter of fact, I used to have a real job, and in that real job I was a businessman. I had to deal with projections because I had to put together budgets. Those budgets had to direct research and development. Those budgets had to direct investment, capital, and what we were doing for the long term. Yes, they are imperfect. Ten-year budgets are slippery, and they are dangerous. But the fact is, we must base a budget upon something. That budget must be based upon a relevant series of assumptions. So that is a given, and we have to deal with that. 
   After we get through that, then we have to make some tough decisions. That is what we are going through today. I believe this bill that we have brought to the floor this morning does that. I think it does it first in a very responsible way. It does it in a way that allows 75 cents of every surplus dollar to go back into debt reduction projects--Social Security, Medicare, important Government programs such as defense. The first real obligation of responsibility of the Federal Government is national security--veterans programs, education, medical research, and health care. That money is there. 
   We are talking about a $3 trillion budget surplus--both on the budget and off the budget, meaning in Social Security and out of Social Security--$3 trillion over the next 10 years. I don't know if that is going to materialize, but one of the things we know is that we have to make some tough decisions based upon what we know and what we project. This bill does it very responsibly. It does it in a way that addresses those needs of our Republic and what we have committed to the American public. 
   My goodness, to say that giving 25 percent of that back to the American public in a tax cut is somehow irresponsible is well beyond my calculations. 
   Senator MACK was on the floor yesterday. I want to repeat a couple of points he made. One, he said, for example, how can a $4 billion net tax cut for fiscal year 2000 overstimulate demands in a trillion-dollar economy? Of course, as of now, this bill phases in those tax cuts over a series of 10 years. 
   Senator MACK said yesterday, and as my colleague again reminded us, he asked rhetorically, ``Would a $39 billion tax cut in the year 2002 overheat the economy when this is only .004 percent of the total projected GDP?'' 
   I think you get the message. 
   We are engaged once again in this mythical kingdom of fantasy. The fact is, this money is the taxpayers' money. The fact is, this is a responsible direction of those resources that surely, if they are allowed to stay here in Washington, will be spent. 
   The President has given us ample opportunity to look over that very generous menu he has presented to us with all of his new spending. 
   Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment. 
   I yield my time.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I associate myself with the remarks of my friend and colleague, the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. I oppose this motion to discharge S.J. Res. 28 from the Finance Committee. I oppose this for both procedural and substantive reasons. 
   Under the Constitution, the House of Representatives must initiate all tax, trade, and revenue measures. The Senate has always deferred to the House to take first action on Jackson-Vanik waivers because they are tax-and-trade measures. 
   On July 1, the House Ways and Means Committee voted out the House version of this resolution with a negative recommendation. The House will soon take up that resolution. I expect the full House to repeat its vote of last year and defeat that resolution. 
   Last year, the House defeated 260 to 163 a resolution to disapprove the  President's Jackson-Vanik waiver for Vietnam. If the House should pass either the China or Vietnam resolution, the Senate would then take up that resolution. The motions to discharge the Finance Committee of these two resolutions are inappropriate and premature. 
   The comments made by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, in my opinion, capture the essence of this issue. Vietnam is still an authoritarian government. Much progress yet needs to be made. But it is the opinion of many of us that the best way to encourage that progress and to lead that progress is to engage. That means open not just dialog, but opportunities. History has been rather clear that commerce is the one bridge, the one vehicle that has done the most over the hundreds and thousands of years of human history to accomplish these issues we still must deal with--human rights issues, immigration issues and, certainly, as the Senator from Massachusetts opened his speech, the MIA issue. 
   There is not a Senator in this body, certainly none of us who served in Vietnam, who does not take that as a serious responsibility. I think this approach is a mistaken approach but well-intended. I salute my friend and colleague from New Hampshire for his efforts, but I believe it is taking us down the wrong path. 
   I am proud to stand with Ambassador Pete Peterson and the other five Vietnam veterans in the Senate to support the Jackson-Vanik waiver for Vietnam. The other Senate Vietnam veterans are: Senators MCCAIN, JOHN KERRY, BOB KERREY, ROBB, and CLELAND. 
   Is Vietnam a Jeffersonian Democracy and a full market economy? Of course not. But Vietnam has made progress. We should nurture that progress, not turn back the clock. 
   It is ironic that we would undermine our modest trade relationship with Vietnam at this time. Ambassador Barshefsky is in the final stages of negotiating a trade agreement that would substantially open Vietnam's market. We should support her efforts to open Vietnam's markets and promote economic reform. 
   The Jackson-Vanik waiver for Vietnam primarily benefits Americans, not Vietnamese. It allows the U.S. Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation to support American exports and jobs. 
   This is not about normal trading relations or expanding access to the U.S. market. We not yet provide NTR status to Vietnam, although Vietnam provides NTR status to the United States. 
   We can only have normal trading relations with Vietnam if we conclude an agreement that would increase U.S. access to the Vietnamese market. That would be the time to debate whether it serves our Nation's interest to have normal trade relations with Vietnam. 
   The Jackson-Vanik amendment was all about trying to apply leverage on the Soviet Union in the 1970s to increase Jewish emigration. The Soviet Union no longer exists. But it was written into permanent law to affect all ``non-market economies,'' including Vietnam. 
   Is Vietnam perfect? No, far from it. But look how far Vietnam has come and U.S.-Vietnam relations have come in five short years: 
   Before 1994, the U.S. and Vietnam had no political or economic relations; 
   In January 1994, JOHN MCCAIN and JOHN KERRY offered an amendment calling for and end to the U.S. economic embargo on Vietnam; 
   In February 1994, President Clinton followed the lead of the Senate and ended the U.S. trade embargo; 
   In July 1995, the President granted diplomatic recognition to Vietnam; 
   In April 1997, the Senate confirmed our first Ambassador to Vietnam, Pete Peterson; and 
   In March 1998, the President waived the Jackson-Vanik law and permitted our trade promotion agencies to operate in Vietnam. This has always been the first step to full compliance with the law, the negotiation of a trade agreement, and the establishment of normal trading relations. 
   The Senator from New Hampshire honestly believes that turning back the clock of the last five years is a better policy than engagement. I respect the Senator's views, but believe that his position is simply wrong. 
   I will not engage in the debate on whether emigration from Vietnam is totally free. Vietnam itself is not totally free. Far from it. But there has been tremendous improvement. 
   In fiscal year 1998, 9,742 Vietnamese were granted immigrant visas to the United States under the ``Orderly Departure Program.'' The State Department expects that number to rise to 25,000 this year and 30,000 next year. 
   In the last 15 years, 500,000 Vietnamese have immigrated to the United States, and very few refugees remain to be processed. As a result of the first Jackson-Vanik waiver granted last year, Vietnam's cooperation on immigration matters has intensified. 
   The State Department expects that processing will be completed for all special caseloads, including the Orderly Departure Program [ODP] and the Resettlement Opportunity for Vietnamese Returnees [ROVR] programs. 
   Again, we must consider how to encourage Vietnam to do even more to open up its society, its economy and its political system. Do we encourage openness through isolation? No, we spread American values through economic, cultural and political contact between our two peoples. 
   I urge defeat of this motion, and I yield back the remainder of my time. I thank the Chair.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I echo what my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has said. 
   It is not wise policy nor responsible governance for the greatest power on earth to hold captive one of the most important and responsible positions in this government, a position that has an effect and consequence to all of our allies as well as our adversaries. It is a constitutional mandate for this body to act with responsibility, aside from dispatch, and to move on this. I personally think holds are irresponsible. I understand the tradition of this body. I am new to this body, but I would go so far as to say, if you wish to hold someone, have the courage to take a stand on the floor of the Senate. Come before the American public and say why that hold is to be put on and why it is so important to hold captive such a critical position for this country, for our allies, for the representation of American values and standards across the world. 
   To put in jeopardy our men and women in uniform who defend this Nation, as the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee has so directly stated, is irresponsible. I support strongly what the senior Senator from Virginia is saying. This body  should have the courage to bring this nomination up and vote straight up or down. Let every Member be recorded. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, there is no issue more important to the American people than ensuring quality health care for themselves and their families. We all agree on that. It is the great common denominator in our society. 
   All of us in this debate, my Democratic colleagues and my Republican colleagues, want to help the people we serve. We want every citizen to have access to good, affordable health care. As a member of the Republican Health Care Task Force, I am very proud of the bill the Republicans have brought to the floor, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus. 
   I think it is important that we focus on the completeness of what this bill is about, what it would do. This bill would increase the quality of health care, the accessibility of health care, and the affordability of health care for millions of Americans. Our bill protects 48 million Americans whose health care plans are not now covered by existing State regulations. Specifically, it provides the following: 
   Guaranteed access to emergency room care; health plans would be required to use the prudent layperson standard for providing in-network and out-of-network emergency care. 
   No. 2, guaranteed access to the doctor of your choice. Under our bill, these health plans must provide point-of-service and continuity-of-care options that allow persons to see physicians outside of their health care network. 
   No. 3, access to medication. Health plans would be required to provide access to noncovered drugs in cases where they are medically necessary and appropriate. 
   No. 4, our plan provides access to specialists, and no gag clauses that restrict doctors from discussing treatment options with their patients. Health plans would be required to ensure that patients have access to covered specialty care within the network or, if necessary, through contractual arrangements with specialists outside  the network. If the plan requires authorization by a primary care provider, then the plan must have a defined referral and authorization process. Moreover, under our bill providers are given the unfettered right to discuss all treatment options with their patients. 
   No. 5, guaranteed access to an OB/GYN specialist. Health care plans would be required to allow direct access to obstetricians/gynecologists and pediatricians without the need for referral or the plan's prior authorization. 
   No. 6, timely appeals by patients who believe they were improperly denied coverage. This is a key part of our bill. Our bill would allow timely review of a patient's claim by medical experts not affiliated with the plan. In emergencies, the review would be within 72 hours. The decision of the outside review panel would be binding. This way, a sick or hurting patient gets the matter resolved now, quickly, rather than languishing in court proceedings for years in a typical lawsuit. 
   No. 7, it guarantees consumers access to plan information. Our bill requires all group health plans to provide consumer information about what is covered, what is not covered, how much they will have to pay in deductibles and in coinsurance, and how to appeal adverse coverage decisions. 
   No. 8, it protects patients from being discriminated against on the basis of genetic information. This is a very big part of why our bill is better. The Democrats do not cover this. Our bill expressly prohibits all health care plans and health insurers from collecting or using predictive genetic 
   information about a patient or their family to deny insurance coverage or set premiums. The Democrats' bill has no such prohibition. 
   No. 9, changes in the Tax Code to make health care coverage more affordable and increase the number of people with health insurance. Isn't that what we are about--bringing more people on our health rolls; making quality, accessible health care affordable? If we want to help increase access to health care, one thing we could do is change the Tax Code. The self-employed ought to be able to deduct 100 percent of premiums for themselves and their families. Our Patients' Bill of Rights Plus does exactly this. 
   Our bill would give all Americans the opportunity to open a medical savings account, an MSA, to save for their health care needs. Many Americans work for employers who do not now offer health insurance, and they must pay for it out of their own pockets. An MSA would be a tremendous benefit for these individuals and would greatly expand the number of individuals with coverage for their health care needs. According to the General Accounting Office, nearly one-third of the participants in the MSA pilot program authorized by Congress a couple of years ago had been uninsured before utilizing these tax-free accounts. 
   It is also time to enact full tax deductibility for premiums that cover long-term care. The average annual cost of caring for a person in a nursing home is $50,000. Stories, of course, are legion of people exhausting their access and resorting to Medicaid to pay for nursing care. We address this issue in our bill. 
   What does the Republican bill not do? There are several important things that the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights does not do. Let's start with liability. The Republican bill achieves the proper balance between legal rights and affordability. Our bill would preserve one of the most important rights patients already possess, and that is the right to file a class action injunction to get coverage. The class action is one of the strongest protections of patient rights under ERISA. 
   You cannot sue your way to better health care. Let me say it again. You cannot sue your way to better health care. Rare are the patients who can afford a legal challenge against a big, well-financed insurance company. Mr. President, 22 States including Nebraska, my State, have already refused to expand liability and open up the opportunity for countless, endless lawsuits. 
   The Democrat bill would make employers liable for medical malpractice. That is an incredible thing. Their bill would make the employer liable for medical malpractice. Patients could sue the employer. I cannot think of a more certain way to drive up both the cost of health insurance and the number of uninsured. Small businesses are especially vulnerable. One huge claim could wipe them out completely. It is no surprise that in a verified recent poll of small businesses across this country, 57 percent of small businesses said they would drop their health coverage rather than expose themselves to ruin under the provisions of the Democrat health proposal. 
   The scope? Our bill does not unnecessarily duplicate State regulations, which adds more Federal Government mandates and increases costs. We do not need more Federal mandates. We do not need more Government mandates. We need more options for the patients and better health care. Our bill targets the 48 million Americans who have self-funded insurance policies. Democrats, including Vice President GORE in a recent CNN interview, and Senators, my friends on the other side of the aisle, have accused the Republican Senators of ignoring the roughly 100 million Americans insured in other ways. 
   If the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights is so good, my friend Senator KENNEDY asks, then why doesn't the GOP offer it to everybody? The answer is quite simple: Not everybody needs what we are offering. State laws and insurance regulations protect the rights of patients in all other plans but not necessarily in self-funded plans. We protect the people who need the protection. The Democrats duplicate the plans and protections already available under State laws. 
   Cost: Our focus should be on providing access to quality, affordable health care for more Americans. We heard a lot on the floor in the last few days about quality and access, but we have heard very little about affordability, who can afford health care, especially from those on the other side of the aisle who want to talk about this. Pricing people out of health insurance systems is no way to improve access. 
   The rate increases that would hit individuals would also hit employers. Dramatic hikes in health care costs cost employees their jobs, and what are we doing for America when we throw people out of work? 
   Back when I had a real job--and I did have a real job once; I was a small business owner--I remember poring over numerous health insurance plans to determine which were the best, which could I afford for my employees. I have yet to meet a small business owner who does not want to give their employees health insurance. 
   In conclusion, as I said at the outset of my remarks, there is no issue more important to more Americans than ensuring quality health care for themselves and their families, but in an effort to improve health care, it makes no sense to drive up costs and leave millions of Americans without health insurance. 
   I look forward to the passage of the Republican bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus, and as one of the architects, one of the Senators who helped write it, I am very proud of it. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the McCain-Levin amendment. The arguments that have been made this morning and this afternoon, I believe, speak rather clearly and directly to why this amendment is worthy of our colleagues' support today. 
   I also wish to express my strong support for S. 1059, the fiscal year 2000 Department of Defense authorization bill being debated here on the floor of the Senate. 
   The first responsibility of our Government is to provide for a strong national defense to protect America's security interests. The primary responsibility of elected officials is to provide the leadership and the wisdom to ensure it is used in the best interests of the American people. 
   The percent of the gross domestic product we spend today on defense is lower than what it was just prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. At the end of the cold war, there was excited talk about the peace dividend that would come, of course, from the decline in East-West conflict as a result of the implosion of the Soviet Union and the reduction in defense spending that, of course, would logically follow. 
   There was also talk about a new global order. Some suggested that war might be obsolete, thanks to the breakout of democracy around the globe. This all sounded hauntingly familiar to the end of World War I and other periods in the history of the world. But there is a peace dividend. That dividend is the new freedoms and opportunities that have resulted from the peace and stability America and her allies won over the last 50 years. 
   If we step back for a moment and review Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, we understand in some rather direct terms what our stand and our allies' stand in those three areas of the world meant 
   to stability, to commitment, to using our forces in a positive way that, in fact, stood for what was right in the world. 
   I am a veteran of Vietnam. I served in Vietnam in 1968, and I have heard many times of the stories written and the debate about whether it was a wasted effort in Vietnam. I have responded this way: If America had not taken a stand in Vietnam, aside from how we executed and prosecuted the war--if we had not taken a stand in Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf, does anyone doubt that the face of Asia, the face of the Middle East would be different than it is today? Of course it would be. Would it be more in the interest of freedom and stability and democracy and market economies than it is today? I don't think so. 
   So, you see, it is not only having the ability to protect our interests and preserve freedom and democracy, but the will and the leadership to make that commitment is just as important. There are new challenges and new responsibilities today that we face, as the new dynamic world always provides, as we move into the next millennium. 
   During the cold war, we confronted one adversary on several fronts. Today, we confront several adversaries on several fronts. One of the concerns that we must be very vigilant about over the next few years is not placing America's interests in the world in a position to be blackmailed by nations who would threaten those interests by threatening to use a weapon of mass destruction and for us, essentially, not only to be militarily incapable of responding to that blackmail and not having the leadership and the will to say we are not going to do that, that isn't going to happen. Actions have consequences. Inactions have consequences. 
   America and her allies have done very well over the last 50 years to help  stabilize a very unstable world. Partly, that has been the result of our word meaning something, our commitment meaning something. But if we don't have the military assets and the resources to be able to call upon that capacity to stop tyranny and war and instability, then in fact we place America in a terrible position and we threaten America's security through the possibility of blackmail. 
   We must harbor our national defense resources wisely, of course. But when we do use them, we must follow the principles of the Powell doctrine: Overwhelming force deployed decisively in the pursuit of clear objectives. 
   Rebuilding our military will not be cheap. America needs to understand that. This bill heads us in the right direction, but much more is going to be required. We must not and we cannot build our military based on budget caps or spending goals. Military spending must be based on the threats and challenges we face in the world today. We must protect our interests and help maintain global stability to ensure our long-term growth and prosperity. 
   The defense budget must flow from our national security interests, not the other way around. The budget cannot drive our national security interests. Our national security interests must drive the budget. If we must find other means to take those resources and put them in our national security budget, then we must do that. That will require prioritizing our budget, our resources. It will prioritize what we as Americans believe our role in the world to be. 
   Every year, the nondefense nondiscretionary budget grows. You have heard the numbers in the last 2 days around here. For 
   the last 14 years, our defense budget has grown smaller. We have cut our defense budget over the last 14 years. Every year, these other needs crowd out other spending priorities. Nondiscretionary entitlement programs are important, but they do us little good if the military is cut back to the point that our interests are threatened around the world: oil supplies are cut off, sealanes are blocked, citizens and corporations abroad are threatened, and our economy declines. 
   We must look for savings in the DOD budget, of course, push for greater reforms, seek greater efficiencies, and tailor our military for future challenges. But we also must be willing to spend as much as we need to protect our interests in this very uncertain, dangerous world. Having a strong, capable military is only half of the challenge. We must also have strong, capable political leadership. That leadership must have the respect of the world, so that the world knows that that leadership of ours can connect the military capability that we employ; knowing when and where to use our military. Strong leadership, anchored by clear principles, beliefs, vision, and policy, has always had its own deterrent power. 
   Dictators fear strong leaders because they know strong leaders will act--despite public opinion polls, focus groups, short-term political gains, or leverage. Leaders understand that actions have consequences, and that inaction has consequences. 
   Last week, King Abdullah from Jordan was here and spoke rather clearly and plainly to this issue regarding NATO's involvement in Kosovo. These are difficult times, but so have they always been. The real debate that will consume the American electorate next year, and the Presidential politics and this body next year, will be simply: What is America's role in the world? What leadership do we care to continue? We must recognize that if another country is to replace America as the world's leader, that new world leader may not be as benevolent as America has been in this century. 
   I don't want that kind of a world to be inherited by my 6-year-old and 8-year-old. Richard Haas' new book, ``Reluctant Sheriff: The U.S. After the Cold War,'' lays it out clearly. That question about the role of America in the next century is a legitimate question. There should be a relevant debate, with the relevant questions asked: What burdens do we want to carry into the next century? Is it worth taking a disproportionate share of the world's burdens, which we have always had? I believe it is. 
   Henry Kissinger's piece in this week's Newsweek magazine, ``New World Disorder,'' speaks to this issue. Unexpected events happen in the world daily. For example, last Sunday, a Chinese intelligence ship was sunk in the South China Sea. Supposedly, the Philippine Navy sunk it in an area that is contested. That is how fast flashpoints can bring world powers into conflict. 
   We need to commit ourselves now to rebuilding the U.S. military, reasserting ourselves on the world stage, and accepting the burdens that come with leadership. 
   Can we imagine Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, or Ronald Reagan whining about the burdens of leadership, whining about, well, I don't know what the polls show or the focus groups show. Can we imagine those leaders governing and doing what they thought was in the best interest of our Nation and the world based on the political whims and winds of the time? I don't think so. 
   America must continue to serve as the rock to which other democracies around the world can anchor. We must also continue to serve as the beacon of freedom and justice for other nations and other peoples. America has always inspired hope around the world, but we cannot lead the world without a strong national defense. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this morning to join my colleague and friend, the distinguished junior Senator from North Carolina, Senator EDWARDS, in introducing the Fragile X Breakthrough Act of 1999. 
   Although many of you may not have heard of Fragile X, it is the leading cause of inherited mental retardation. It affects tens of thousands of children in this country every year. Fragile X is caused by a defective gene that fails to product specific protein necessary for proper brain function. Those afflicted with this condition often suffer mild to severe mental retardation, anxiety, seizures, and a variety of learning disorders. Most children with Fragile X will require a lifetime of specialized care at a cost of over $2 million each. 
   For those afflicted and their families--like John and Megan Massey from Scottsbluff, Nebraska, whose two sons Jack and Jacob suffer from this disease--it is a frustrating, life-crippling, and heart-wrenching condition. But there is hope. In 1991, medical researchers were able to identify the specific gene that fails to produce the necessary protein and is responsible for Fragile X. Since then, researchers have been able to develop a synthetic version of this protein, and are now working on a way to deliver it to the brain's flawed cells. 
   Congress has an unprecedented opportunity to play a key role in solving the mystery of this disease, and encouraging the development of a treatment and eventual cure. The Fragile X Breakthrough Act is a practical, pro-active, and cost-effective vehicle by which Congress can accomplish these goals. 
   The National Institute of Child and Human Development (NICHD) is required by law to establish research centers in order to conduct clinical and scientific research aimed at helping infants and children. In accordance with that charge, the Fragile X Breakthrough Act authorizes $10 million for the NICHD, to make grants or enter into contracts with public or private entities to develop and operate three Fragile X research centers. It also provides $2 million for a program that encourages physicians to conduct Fragile X research, by offering to repay a portion of their educational loans. These proposals closely follow the recommendations that emerged from an international scientific conference held by the NICHD and the Fragile X Foundation (FRAXA) in December of 1998. 
   We are closing in on one of the principal genetic causes of mental retardation. Let's give the NICHD the authority and funding to accelerate Fragile X research, so that the final, critical breakthroughs can be made. Let's give these children the chance to lead normal, productive lives. If not for Jacob and Jack Massey, then for those children who will inevitably follow.

   Mr. HAGEL. I thank the Chair, and I thank my friend and colleague from Utah for some additional time. 
   I rise today to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the creation of the modern American Foreign Service. 
   We have all traveled abroad. I have visited over 60 countries over the years. As many Americans, I have seen firsthand the dedication of professional Foreign Service officers in some of the most difficult and dangerous working environments in the world. 
   There is no longer any clear division between domestic and international issues. Transportation, trade, telecommunications, technology, and the Internet have changed all that. 
   As our Nation grew, it became more globally engaged. Over the last 200 years, year after year, America has become an international community. In 1860, we had only 33 diplomatic missions around the world. But we had 253 consular posts abroad, primarily involved in supporting our Nation's dramatic economic growth and trade expansion. As America's role in the world grew, we took on more responsibility. America's diplomacy needed to draw from the broad strength of our democratic society. And that, too, grew. 
   The solution was the Rogers Act of 1924. This act created America's first professional competitive Foreign Service. It merged the small, elite diplomatic corps with the more broadly based consular services. The Rogers Act established a merit-based exam system to recruit the best our growing Nation had to offer without regard to family ties or political favors. 
   America's diplomats are unsung heroes. Americans 
   understand and appreciate the sacrifices of duty, honor, and country we ask every day from our military around the world. However, not enough Americans know about the sacrifices we also ask every day from our American Foreign Service officers around the world. Just like our military, they serve our national interests abroad in an increasingly uncertain and dangerous world. 
   Our military's purpose is to fight and win wars. The purpose of our diplomats is to prevent wars. This makes recognition for their work more difficult. This is a little like listening for the dog that doesn't bark. But our Foreign Service officers do much more than prevent wars and resolve crises. They negotiate agreements to expand trade and open up foreign markets. They protect Americans abroad who find themselves in trouble and many more important responsibilities. They explain American policies to often hostile nations. They help negotiate arms control agreements to stem the dangerous proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
   The work of the Foreign Service is relevant. It is very relevant to the daily lives of every American. Their many successes are often unheralded. We take them for granted. The Foreign Service has endured the same underfunding and poor working conditions as has our military services. In the last decade, the Foreign Service has experienced similar recruitment and retention problems, as has the military. 
   Since 1992, the Foreign Service has declined 11 percent, even while we have asked the Foreign Service to open up new missions in Central Asia and Eastern Europe and increase staffing in China. This has led to sharp staff reductions elsewhere in the world. 
   In my travels, as I am sure in your travels, Mr. President, and all of our colleagues' travels, we have also seen how run down and dangerous many of our embassies around the world have become. This has a real impact on our national interest. This is as dangerous as what we have been doing to our military. It is like asking the Air Force to permanently maintain an increased flight tempo with aging aircraft and a severe shortage of pilots. This all has serious consequences to our country. Few appreciate how dangerous it has become for our diplomats who defend America's interests the world. 
   Since World War II, more ambassadors have been killed in the line of duty than generals and admirals. The Secretary of State has commemorated 186 American diplomats who have died under ``heroic or inspirational circumstances.'' 
   Finally, in today's global community, we have a greater need for an active, energetic, and visionary foreign policy and those who carry out that foreign policy than ever before.  
   Today, we all commemorate the 75th anniversary of the creation of the modern American Foreign Service, and we are stronger and better for it.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, to my friend and distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from North Carolina, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I offer my sympathy, my condolences. I have expressed those sentiments to Senator HELMS in writing and face-to-face. 
   I have heard the eloquence of many of my colleagues here this morning, expressing themselves about how they feel about a very special American. The only weakness that has been presented here is that most of them have been Navy. Having been an Army sergeant in Vietnam in 1968, I, too, have some sense of appreciation for a Navy admiral. Of course, when I was in Vietnam as an Army sergeant, I didn't know any admirals, but I got to know this admiral rather well. 
   I wish to share a quick story that the Senator from North Carolina may not know about Bud Nance. Two weeks after I was elected to the Senate from Nebraska in 1996, I received a call from Admiral Nance. It had gotten around back here that I was interested in serving on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee. Admiral Nance first congratulated me on my victory and then said the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee would be willing to even take an Army veteran--if it came to that--but wanted me to know that he was at my disposal to help me and assist me in any way with the staff that I was assembling, whether I joined the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or not. 
   We had a long talk--as I recall about 45 minutes--about our country, about service to our country, military, foreign relations. After that 45-minute conversation, I walked out of my office in Omaha and said to the person who is now my chief of staff: I am going to seek a seat on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee if for no other reason than Bud Nance. 
   Bud Nance and I talked about that occasionally, and that relationship built. For me, it was a very important part of my service on the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee and in this body. 
   I recall 4 months into my first year in the Senate at a hearing Senator HELMS was presiding over--and I know this will come as a surprise to some Members on the floor--one of our colleagues had an awful lot to say that day and was not inhibited by time or bashful about how much he wished to contribute on this particular subject. As one of our colleagues went on and on and on, Admiral Nance leaned forward and said, ``Senator,'' and I turned and I said, ``Yes, Admiral Nance.'' He said, ``I want you to observe something.'' He smiled and winked and looked down and then said, ``Senator, remember, you need not be eternal to be immortal.'' 
   I don't think that was an original, but it was at that time effective and framed the issue in rather simple Bud Nance eloquence that the Senator has come to know for so many years. 
   Of course we will all miss him; not only for what he represented--and maybe, more than anything, what he represented was a role model. Each of us who has the privilege of serving our country should always understand that the greatest responsibility we have is to be as good a role model as we possibly can. For his staff, as you know so well, Mr. Chairman, you who loved this man, who adored this man--not because he was a friendly man, but he guided them and he helped them; he was tough when he needed to be tough--for all those staff members who served with Admiral Nance, I wish to say thank you on their behalf, since they do not have the privilege of being on the floor of the Senate this morning, acknowledging his service. And on behalf of this Army veteran, very junior Senator, I wish to thank Admiral Nance. For you, Bud Nance, wherever you are: We will miss you, Admiral. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in recognizing Senator BIDEN for his 10,000th vote in the United States Senate. 
   I am proud to serve with Senator BIDEN on the Foreign Relations Committee, where he is the ranking Democrat Member. Senator BIDEN has set many records in the Senate. I would like to squelch the rumor, however, that he sets a record every time he speaks. 
   I am just in my third year as a United States Senator. Senator BIDEN is in his 27th year in the Senate. But in the time Senator BIDEN and I have served together on the Foreign Relations Committee, I have gained great respect for his wisdom and deep understanding of international issues. Senator BIDEN understands that there is no such thing as a Republican foreign policy or a Democrat foreign policy. There is only an American foreign policy. He has worked closely with Presidents in both parties. And he reaches out across the aisle to work as well with our Chairman, Senator HELMS, as he does with his junior colleagues. 
   Last year, Senator BIDEN was a leader in the historic expansion of NATO to include three former Warsaw Pact nations. This Congress he joined with Senator MCCAIN in sponsoring a resolution authorizing the use of all necessary force to win the war in Kosovo. Through his leadership, Senator BIDEN displays the kind of courage that earns him respect from all of his colleagues, even when they disagree. 
   I am proud to call JOE BIDEN my friend and colleague. America is proud to call him a United States Senator.

   Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 900, the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999. As a member of the Senate Banking Committee, I am proud to have played a small role in writing this bill. 
   America's financial services companies operate under a regulatory regime that dates back to the Great Depression. Our banks, insurance, and securities firms are bound by artificial barriers that do not recognize the current realities of the global marketplace. The reality is this: That the line separating these industries have been blurred by the evolution of new financial products and technology. 
   Securities firms, insurance companies, and banks already affiliate with one another, because the marketplace demands it. However, these affiliations cannot lead to full and fair competition or the full potential benefits for consumers because of the Glass-Steagall Act and its legal barriers. 
   Clearly, it is time for Congress to modernize U.S. financial service regulations and introduce full and open competition across the banking securities and insurance industries. S. 900 would accomplish that. 
   Passage of this bill will benefit consumers in two basic ways: First, allowing competition among banks, securities firms, and insurance companies will lead to lower costs and higher savings for consumers. Second, this competition will strengthen our financial service firms that are integral to the health of the American economy. 
   A 1995 Bureau of Economic Analysis report estimated that increased competition in the financial services industry would save consumers nearly $3 billion a year. I realize, Mr. President, that $3 billion may not seem to be a large figure around here, but in places such as Scottsbluff, NE, and other towns in my State that is real money. 
   If we don't modernize our laws governing the delivery of financial services, then we will put our companies and our industries at a severe disadvantage in the global arena. 
   Today, the United States is the world leader in financial services. We must not jeopardize this position through congressional inaction. Just as exports of manufactured goods and commodities have become increasingly important to the growth of our Nation's economy, so are our exports of financial services very important to our economy's growth. 
   Our global position was strengthened by the conclusion of a historic financial services side agreement to the Uruguay Round of GATT. It is ironic that the United States pushed hard for this agreement to reduce barriers to competition abroad while our domestic market continues to operate under a 1930s regulatory regime. It is time to tear down barriers to competition in our domestic markets and ensure that our industries are able to continue to compete at home and abroad. 
   The members of the Senate Banking Committee took a hard look at this important issue surrounding financial 
   modernization. S. 900 balances the sense of urgency surrounding passage of financial services reform legislation with the need to ensure that the legislation responds to future marketplace dynamics and not just to today's realities and political pressures. 
   Is this legislation perfect? No, it is not perfect. There are far too many competing and important interests involved in this legislation. And perfection means different things to different people. But this bill does achieve a very workable and relevant and realistic balance between the politics of financial modernization and sound public policy. 
   Some of my colleagues have alleged that this bill is only going to help large financial institutions and will not help small banks. This is not true. S. 900 includes some very important changes, for example, to the Federal home loan bank system. These changes are very important to small banks everywhere across this country, not just in the rural States, such as my State of Nebraska, but in urban communities and large cities as well. 
   The Federal home loan bank provisions in S. 900 will strengthen local community banks that are vital to the economic growth and viability of all communities. They will ensure that in an era of banking megamergers, smaller banks are able to compete effectively and continue to serve their customers' lending needs. 
   These provisions are supported by all of the major banking trade organizations. There are many specific dynamics to improving the marketplace and the ability for the small institutions to compete. Many of my colleagues this afternoon have detailed those changes rather well. 
   It is important, Mr. President, to modernize our financial service laws to ensure that our companies can compete in this new global marketplace. As barriers to trade come down, our financial service firms must be prepared to take advantage of new global opportunities. 
   Congress can help them prepare by giving them the flexibility they so desperately need. S. 900 provides this flexibility. I urge my colleagues to support its speedy passage. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, thank you. I wish to strongly endorse and support the McCain-Biden resolution. Mr. President, I'm an original cosponsor. I have listened this afternoon to my colleagues, who have all made significant contributions to this issue. 
   There are many complicating currents coursing through this very complicated issue. There are no good answers. But surely one of the answers is not to not deal with this issue. We cannot escape our responsibility in this body to debate this issue. We should have had this debate weeks ago. 
   There are very significant consequences attached to what we're  doing. We've heard some of those stated directly and very well from our colleagues this afternoon. First, let's be clear on the making of war. It is not risk-free. It is not antiseptic. It is not without uncertainty. 
   One not need read an awful lot of history to understand that. General Eisenhower's comments and what he wrote and put in his pocket hours before the D-Day invasion in case D-Day failed. And he wrote out in longhand a paragraph that said essentially, I take full responsibility for the failure. So you see, as we look back even 50 years ago, we understand that war is uncertain. 
   But we also understand there are things worth going to war for, and there are things worth dying for. Questions raised today will be continued to be raised about national interests of our country: Should we be at war? All fair questions. Legitimate questions. But first we need to talk about it, debate it, and ask the serious questions. 
   I've heard today, I've heard over the weeks all the reasons for failure, all the complications, all the problems. Yet I hear at the same time over here, well, we have to stop the slaughter and the ethnic cleansing. If we could just come together. But sometimes we just can't come together. Sometimes there is no more talk. When people are being slaughtered at a rather considerable rate, and genocide is occurring, and ethnic cleansing is occurring, and people are being driven from their homes and their countries at an unprecedented rate, and the other side that we're trying to deal with continues to lie and cheat and kill--then we must face reality. What do we do now? The geopolitical consequences, the humanitarian consequences involved in this are great. They are deep. And they are serious. 
   I've heard some conversation today about this resolution taking the Congress out of play. This doesn't take the Congress out of play. The power of the purse still resides in the Congress of the United States. And no President surely would go forward unilaterally, arbitrarily, without confiding in, without reaching out to, without wanting the support of the Congress, and the American people. Why would you do that? And certainly not this President. 
   I don't disagree with many of my colleagues, what they've said today--the Senator from West Virginia, Senator BYRD, Senator HUTCHINSON from Arkansas, Senator WELLSTONE from Minnesota,--about how this war initially was conducted. How irresponsible it was to take off the table certain of our military's abilities to wage this war. So what does that do? Well, I think it's rather 
   obvious what it's done. It's allowed this tyrant, this butcher, Milosevic, to go completely unimpeded and slaughter people and drive people out of Kosovo--without any pressure on him other than withstanding the air war. And that's been antiseptic and that's been timid. So there's no question the conduct of this war from the beginning has been questionable. 
   There will be much time to debate the miscalculations and the mistakes and the problems. But the fact is we are in the middle of this. Our actions will have consequences. There are other Milosevics out there. 
   If the word of this Nation, if the word of America--the most powerful nation on Earth, the most powerful nation for good--cannot be trusted, and NATO--the most effective peacekeeping organization in the history of man--if the word of that organization cannot be trusted, then what kind of a world are we going to be dealing with as we now move into this dangerous new century? 
   We should think through this very carefully. All the problems that surround this. We are forcing the President to lead. That's what this resolution's about. This resolution is not about abdicating our responsibility in the Congress. Although some I suspect wish it be the case. 
   We're asking the United States Senate to take a stand. What does this country come to--to ask a United States Senator to stand up and take some responsibility for the Nation being at war? 
   This resolution is about getting the Congress involved in it. This resolution is about forcing the President to take some leadership and responsibility. 
   Now, we're not going to pass this resolution. Senator MCCAIN and I and others know the reality of that. But if we can make it a little uncomfortable for some people around here to have to deal with an uncomfortable issue, then that's worth it. I've never asked one of my colleagues to support this resolution, nor has Senator MCCAIN, nor has Senator BIDEN, or any of the other cosponsors. But we have asked them to take a look and debate it, and take a position and take a stand. 
   There are consequences to our actions, and there are consequences to our inactions. If we do not see this through the right way, we will leave the world more dangerous than it is today. 
   I happen to believe that the Balkans are in the national security interest of this country for many reasons, aside from the humanitarian dynamics of this. 
   Do we really believe that the greatest, most noble, most free nation on earth can stand aside and watch this butchering and act like it's not there? 
   History has surely taught us that when you defer the tough decisions, when you let the butchers continue and the tyrants and dictators continue, it gets worse. And it has gotten worse with Milosevic. For ten years we've dealt with him. Four wars he's started. He's lied and cheated and slaughtered all through those ten years. Don't we have some responsibility to deal with this, as imperfect as all the options are? 
   Again I go back to my first point. As my friend, the sponsor of this resolution, John MCCAIN, said earlier--and said it very well--we must understand something very clearly. Whatever you think of this President, this President is out of office in a year and a half. But the Presidency remains. The vitalness of this Presidency, this Executive branch that a new leader will inherit, must remain strong and must be able to deal with an international crisis. So we must be very careful not to take advantage of this weakened President. 
   And if that would ever happen--ladies and gentlemen, the world will not be safer and it will not be better. When you weaken the United States of America, you weaken all of freedom everywhere. 
   So it is, Mr. President, for those reasons that I will support this resolution. I think it is in the best interest of our country, and I yield the floor.

    Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator DODD in introducing the Sanctions Rationalization Act. This bill would grant broad authority to the President to waive unilateral sanctions that no longer make sense and that he determines harm U.S. national interests. 
   Sanctions must remain a policy tool. But sanctions are only effective when they are multilateral. 
   This bill will complete the package of three sanctions reform bills that have been introduced this Congress. Senator DODD and I are sponsors or cosponsors of each of these three bills. 
   The first of these three sanctions reform bills is S. 757, the Sanctions Policy Reform Act. This legislation, introduced by Senator LUGAR would establish a sensible process for the enactment of future unilateral economic sanctions by either the President or the Congress. Among its safeguards, the Lugar bill would require a cost/benefit analysis and would require a study on the likelihood that the proposed sanctions would achieve their policy goals. It would also sunset all unilateral sanctions after two years unless reauthorized by Congress. The Lugar bill does not undo any existing sanctions, with one exception. It would make permanent the President's ability to waive the Glenn amendment for U.S. national security reasons. The Glenn amendment as originally drafted puts permanent unilateral sanctions on any country that tests a nuclear device. 
   I introduced the second bill, which is S. 327, the Food and Medicine Sanctions Relief Act. Senator DODD is the lead cosponsor on that bill. Food and medicine are basic humanitarian needs. As a matter of policy, food and medicine should not be included in unilateral sanctions. The President made a good first step in addressing this issue yesterday when he removed most, but not all, food and humanitarian goods from sanctions on Iran, Sudan and Libya. He did not lift restrictions on financing for agricultural sales, nor did he lift food and medicine sanctions on several other nations. He could not take these two additional steps because he is restricted from doing so by other legislation. My bill, S. 327, would enable him to adopt a comprehensive policy of exempting food and medicine from unilateral sanctions. 
   The bill Senator DODD and I are introducing today would also grant the President much broader authority to protect U.S. interests by waiving unilateral sanctions. 
   The Sanctions Rationalization Act allows the President, with Congressional review, to ``delay, suspend or terminate'' any unilateral economic sanction if he determines that it ``does not serve U.S. national interests.'' A Presidential waiver under the Act cannot go into effect for 30 days. This gives the Congress ample time to consider the Presidential action. The bill establishes expedited procedures to ensure that Congress would have a chance to disapprove the Presidential waiver if the action is unwise. 
   Finally, the legislation restricts the use of this Presidential waiver authority in specific cases. The President  cannot waive sanctions that are multilateral rather than unilateral. He is also restricted from waiving sanctions based on health or safety concerns, treaty obligations, and specific trade laws enacted to remedy unfair trade practices or market disruptions. 
   As a nation, we are letting unilateral sanctions isolate ourselves. Let me demonstrate why:

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I join the senior Senator from Montana, Senator BAUCUS, in introducing the Federally Impacted School Improvement Act. This bipartisan legislation is designed to renew and enhance the partnership between the federal government and schools located on or around Indian reservations and military bases. 
   For almost fifty years Congress has provided financial assistance to school districts impacted by a federal presence. Up until 1994, Congress also provided funding to help these communities defray the cost of building and repairing their schools. 
   The loss of this particular revenue over the last five years, combined with the continued under-funding for almost 15 years of the impact aid program in general, has left school districts that serve military and Indian children scrambling to finance their routine costs. As a result, many of these schools now have buildings that are antiquated, overcrowded and compromise the health and safety of their students. 
   The Federally Impacted School Improvement Act takes a step toward correcting this situation by providing matching grants that impacted schools can use to address their most pressing modernization needs. This Act authorizes a federal appropriation of $50 million for each of the next five fiscal years for impact aid school construction and repair. 
   Forty-five percent of the funds appropriated under the bill go to Indian lands. Another forty-five percent is dedicated to military schools. The final ten percent will be reserved for emergency situations. 
   In order to make limited federal funds go farther, our bill calls for local communities to contribute their share to this effort. Schools and communities will have to match the federal grants  on all but the 10% appropriated for emergencies. This is done to ensure that all--or at least more--impacted schools will have the opportunity to use these new grants to improve their facilities. 
   The federal government cannot and should not be all things to all people. However, Congress has a responsibility to ensure that highly impacted school districts, such as Bellevue and Santee, Nebraska, are not shortchanged. 
   The hardships faced by our military personnel, their families and individuals living on Indian reservations are well known. Their children deserve no less than the best educational facilities. 
   The Federally Impacted School Improvement Act helps to meet our commitment to schools and children impacted by a federal presence. It makes good use of our limited federal resources. It embodies what we should be doing more of--building partnerships between local communities, taxpayers and government in order to strengthen our schools. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I also request unanimous consent that the bill and a letter sent to me by the Northern Nebraska Native American Consortium be placed in the RECORD.

   Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank as well Senator MURKOWSKI. 
   Mr. President, I rise this morning to join my colleague and friend, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and the senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator BYRD, and other colleagues in introducing the Energy and Climate Policy Act of 1999. We offer this legislation because we believe it is time that Congress take a new, bipartisan approach to dealing with the issue of global climate change. 
   This legislation turns the debate away from unachievable, U.N.-mandated, arbitrary, short-term targets and timetables as dictated by the Kyoto protocol toward a long-term strategy that focuses on sound science, increased research and development, incentives for voluntary action, and public-private technological initiatives that are market driven and technology based. 
   Twenty-first century technologies, American ingenuity, and public-private cooperation--not U.N.-mandated energy rationing--should be, in fact, the focus of climate change efforts in the Congress. I hope Members on both sides of the aisle will join this effort. 
   Mr. President, this has never been a debate about who is for or against the environment. This has never been a partisan issue. I have not met one Member of the Senate--Republican or Democrat--who wants to leave their children a dirty and uninhabitable environment. We all agree that we have a responsibility to protect our environment. What this debate should be about is bringing some common sense--common sense--to this issue. 
   This bill that we are introducing today--the Energy and Climate Policy Act--brings some common sense to the issue of climate change. 
   Senator MURKOWSKI laid out a number of the more specific parts of our bill--accountability for one. We put this responsibility in the Department of Energy where there is someone ``in charge.'' 
   Presently we have accountability for global climate change spread throughout the Government. It is in the White House. It is in the EPA. It is in the Departments of Commerce, Agriculture, Interior, and Energy. All of these organizations have their tentacles wrapped around this issue. So with this, we will focus on accountability, responsibility. Let's get the job done. 
   Second, this bill moves the current focus of climate change policy away from short-term, draconian energy rationing and cost increases mandated by the United Nations Kyoto protocol toward a long-term domestic commitment to research and development. As Senator MURKOWSKI pointed out, it adds significant Government funding in a private-public enterprise over the next 10 years. It focuses on real science, sound science. 
   Third, this bill continues Congress' commitment to supporting voluntary energy efforts to reduce, sequester, or avoid manmade greenhouse gas emissions. It does so by strengthening current law--not by creating new international, bureaucratic, governmental regimes in which we will all be accountable. 
   In short, among other things this bill does, we look at the entire picture--the consequences of our actions. That means including activities that naturally lower the levels of greenhouse gas emissions. 
   This bill also addresses the issue of whether such voluntary efforts are ``real and verifiable''--Who enforces these kinds of mandates?--the role of agriculture, the role of industry, business, labor, and long-term standard of living consequences: How competitive are our products in the world markets?--market driven, technology based. We build on what is already the foundation of this great, free land and this great, free market economy. 
   This bill also allows all of our enterprises in this country to plan for the future and build commitments into outyear planning and investment decisions. Kyoto doesn't talk about that. Who finances these efforts? 
   This is the best way to deal with the issue of climate change: a long-term commitment based on American ingenuity, exports, scientific certainty, 21st century technology, and market principles. 
   By doing these things we can walk away from the disastrous path that this administration and the Kyoto protocol would lead us and focus our efforts instead on a positive, bipartisan, achievable commonsense approach. 
   I hope my colleagues will take a look at what we are introducing today. It is a bipartisan bill. It does make sense. I look forward to working with the Presiding Officer and others this year and into next year in crafting something that is achievable and workable and good for this country.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to recall a towering public servant, Senator Roman L. Hruska, who spent 22 years of his life in this body and who died yesterday at Omaha, NE, at the age of 94. Senator Hruska served with my friend, the distinguished Senator from South Carolina. 
   In a day when some might question the morality of public service, the civility of public service, the genuineness of public service, and the goodness of public service, they did not know Senator Roman Hruska. Senator Hruska was one of 11 children, born in David City, NE, 94 years ago. His father had emigrated from Czechoslovakia, and moved his family to Omaha where he felt they would have a better opportunity to get an education and a better opportunity for a better life. 
   Senator Hruska's father was a teacher. Senator Hruska went on through public schools in Nebraska, attended a number of graduate schools, the University of Chicago, and obtained his law degree in Nebraska. He started a law practice in south Omaha. 
   When there became a vacancy on the Douglas County board of commissioners in Omaha, NE, his fellow citizens came to him and said, ``Will you serve for one term?'' That one term began in 1944. 
   A year later, he became chairman of the Douglas County board of commissioners, and until 1952 he served the Greater Omaha area and the State of Nebraska with great distinction. 
   In 1952, a House seat opened up. It was the seat of Howard Buffett. Mr. President, that name ``Buffett'' may ring a bell. Howard Buffett was the father of Warren Buffett. Howard Buffett decided not to run for reelection. 
   Again, Roman Hruska's friends and colleagues said, ``Will you run for Congress?'' Roman Hruska said, ``Well, I will do that for a short period of time.'' Roman Hruska was overwhelmingly elected to the Congress in 1952. Two years later, the Senate seat opened and, again, the same people asked Roman Hruska to serve. He ran for the Senate in 1954 and never looked back. He retired from the Senate in 1976. 
   I recall my first exposure to Senator Hruska as a young chief of staff to Congressman John Y. McCollister in the early 1970s. I would come to the Senate once or twice a week to get a delegation letter signed by Senator Hruska and then Senator Curtis. Senator Hruska would see me occasionally standing outside a hearing room and would never fail to accord me not only some recognition, which as we know around here does not 
   always happen with junior staffers, but he was beyond gracious. He always had time for young people, always had time to talk a little bit about what we thought and what was on our minds. 
   I really came to cherish those times when I had an opportunity to come over and see Senator Hruska. Senator Hruska was often in meetings, I say to Senator HOLLINGS, with some of Senator HOLLINGS' favorite colleagues, such as Senator Goldwater, Senator Eastland, Senator Long. 
   As a young staffer, I would be invited in to the outer ring of those distinguished United States Senators and would stand and watch and listen. Senator Hruska would never fail to introduce me to his colleagues and make me feel not only welcome but a part of Government, a part of what he was doing. 
   The dignity that Senator Hruska brought to his service is something well remembered by not just those of us who were privileged to have some relationship but all who served with Senator Hruska. He made this body a better body. He made America stronger. He believed in things. 
   Senator Hruska did not believe in governance by way of calibration of the polls. You knew where Senator Hruska was and why. He was always a gentleman--always a gentleman. He would debate the issues straight up. He won most of the time; he lost his share. But the relationships that Senator Hruska developed and the respect that underpinned his service is rather uncommon. We are all better for it. America is stronger for it. Nebraska loses a very wise counselor. America loses a great public servant. 
   When I ran for the Senate in 1996, one of the first people I went to see was Senator Hruska. The advice he gave me was consistent with his service and his life. He said, ``Chuck, I would not feel competent to judge or give you counsel on the issues of our day, but I will tell you this: Play it straight, say it straight, respect your colleagues and respect yourself, but most important, respect the institution of the U.S. Congress and always understand the high privilege it is to be part of that great body.'' 
   He was much too modest to go beyond what he gave me as good, solid advice on issues, but I can tell you that on the big issues over the last 3 years, not only I, but many of my colleagues, have constantly gone back to Roman Hruska and asked for his judgment and his thoughts. 
   He will be greatly missed. I say to Senator HOLLINGS, I will leave these remarks on behalf of your former colleague and friend and my friend, Senator Roman Hruska, by referring to Senator Hruska the way your former colleague, Everett Dirksen, once referred to Roman Hruska, and that is: A salute to the noblest Roman of them all--Roman Hruska.

   Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished Senator from Connecticut. 
   Mr. President, I join with my colleagues this morning in introducing this joint resolution because it is the right thing to do, it is the responsible thing to do. 
   Our military efforts and our political will must be consistent with and commensurate with our military and political objectives. That is the essence of what this debate is about. 
   I happen to believe that the Balkans are in the national security interests of this country for many reasons: Our relationship with NATO, the stability of Central and Eastern Europe; the next ring out is the stability of the Baltics, central Asia, Turkey. So in my mind it is rather clear that we do have a national security interest here. 
   What this resolution is about is cutting through the fog of who is to blame, the miscalculation, mistakes up/down. That must be set aside. What we need to remember is that we are engaged in a war. We must stay focused on this commitment and have the resolution and the will to achieve the purpose which we began a month ago. 
   Wars--political, military calculations are imperfect. If we believe--and I do; I believe our 18 NATO allies do believe --that this is the right thing to do, then we must commit ourselves to achieving this most important objective. That means the American people must first understand what our national security interests are, the Congress must lead with the President, and we must be unified to accomplish this goal. 
   Surely, one of the lessons of Vietnam was that not only are long, confusing wars not sustainable in democracies, but we also learned, as Colin Powell laid out very clearly the last time that we dispatched our military might, that the doctrine of military force is very simple: Maximum amount of power, minimum amount of time. 
   Time is not on our side here, Mr. President. Time is not on our side. The longer this goes without a resolution, the more difficult it will become and the more likely it will be that the resolution, the outcome, will be some kind of a half-baked deal that will resolve nothing; so as we began this noble effort, we will end with no nobility and no achievement as to making the world better and more stable and more secure. 
   This is not a Republican/Democrat issue. It is far beyond that. I think that is well represented by the bipartisanship of this resolution. There is another consequence that flows from what we are now engaged in, and that is how we will respond to future security challenges. And just as important as that link is how others around the world will measure our response, measure our will, measure our commitment to doing the right thing. 
   History has taught us very clearly that when you defer the tough decisions, things do not get better; they get worse. And the more you try and appease the Milosevics of the world, things get worse, more people die, more commitment must be made later. That is surely a lesson of history. 
   The time is now past whether we are committed to do this or not. That debate was a month ago. What we must do now is come together in a unified effort to win this, to achieve our political and military goals, stop the slaughter, stop the butchery, allow the people of Kosovo to go back into their homes, maintain the stability of that part of the world, and allow for a political resolution to develop--not one that we dictate, not one that NATO dictates, but the people of the Balkans. 
   My colleagues this morning have referred to the outer rings of consequences here, the outer rings of instability. I believe that if this effort is not successful, not only are you destabilizing Central and Eastern Europe, you are taking away the opportunities those nations of Central and Eastern Europe have now, and the former republics of the Socialist Soviet Republic, for a chance to develop a democracy and individual liberties and a free market system, because you have destabilized the area for no other reason than you have brought a million refugees, displaced persons, into that part of the world where those nations and the infrastructures of those nations cannot possibly deal with that and, hence, destabilizing the very infrastructure we are trying to help. 
   There are so many, many consequences that are attached to this one effort. I hope this resolution makes very clear, on a bipartisan basis, what we, as a Nation, as a member of NATO, as a member of the civilized world have at stake here and why it is important that we win this war. And I call it a war because it is a war. 
   I hope that the President of the United States will provide the kind of leadership that this Nation is going to need to connect the national security interests not just at the immediate time in that part of the world, but for our long-term national security interests not just in that part of the world, but all parts of the world. The President must lead. If the President wishes to come to the Congress and ask for a declaration of war, that should be entertained and debated and carefully considered. 
   The time for nibbling around the edges here is gone. And we not only do a great disservice to the men and women that we asked to fight this war, but to our democracy and all of the civilized world if we do not do the right thing. History will judge us harshly, as it should, if we allow this to continue, what is going on in the Balkans today, and do not stop it.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 2 p.m., with Senators permitted to speak up to 10 minutes each. Following morning business, the Senate may consider any legislative or executive items cleared for action. The leader has announced that there will be no rollcall votes during today's session. So any votes ordered today will be postponed to occur on Tuesday at a time to be determined by the two leaders. It is hoped that the conferees on the budget resolution will be able to complete their work early this week so the Senate may begin consideration of the budget conference report and have a final vote by Thursday.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to address my thoughts on the situation in Kosovo. This is a very complicated and dangerous issue. There are no good alternatives, there are no good options, there are no good solutions. I have listened with great interest and great respect to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, on both sides of the issue. Their perspectives have been important, they have been enlightening. The threads of who we are as human beings--in America's case, as leaders of the world, as leaders of NATO--are intertwined in this very complicated morass that we call the Kosovo issue. 
   With that said, I don't believe America can stand by and not be part of a unified NATO response to the continued slaughter in the Balkans. I say that mainly for three reasons. 
   First, the very real potential for this crisis widening and deepening is immediate and there will be consequences. If this goes unchecked and unstopped there is the real risk of pulling in other nations into an already very dangerous and complicated situation. I believe if this goes unchecked and unstopped we run the very real risk of the southern flank of NATO coming unhinged. We are on the border now of Macedonia, Macedonia being on the border of Greece. 
   Second, the humanitarian disaster that would result if NATO stood by and did nothing would be immense. The consequences of that humanitarian disaster would move up into Western Europe; nations will take issue and sides against one another in Europe. This would have consequences in the Muslim world. The humanitarian element of this, as much as the geopolitical strategic elements involved in this equation, are real. There would be tens of thousands of refugees pouring into nations all over Western Europe. This would further exaggerate the ethnic and the religious tensions that exist today. 
   The third reason I believe that the United States cannot stand aside and not be part of any NATO activity to stop the butchery in Kosovo is because if the United States is the only NATO member who refuses to deal with this problem--all other NATO members are committed to deal with this problem--  if we are the only NATO member not part of this effort, it surely will be the beginning of the unraveling of NATO. If NATO does not deal with this crisis in the middle of Europe, then what is the purpose of NATO? What is the relevancy of NATO? 
   I have heard the questions, arguments, the debate, the issues raised about NATO being a defensive organization, the very legitimate questions regarding acts of war, invading sovereign nations. These are all important and relevant questions. However, I think there is a more relevant question: What do we use the forces of good for, the forces that represent the best of mankind, if we are going to be held captive to a definition that was written 50 years ago? 
   Every individual, every organization, every effort in life must be relevant to the challenge at hand. The consequences of the United States not being part of NATO in this particular effort would be disastrous. America and NATO's credibility are 
   on the line here. I suggest to some of my colleagues who are engaged in this debate, where were they last fall? Where were they when Ambassador Holbrooke reached an agreement with President Milosevic in October? At that time, the United States and all nations in NATO gave their commitment that there would be a NATO military response if Milosevic did not comply with the agreement that he made on behalf of NATO with Ambassador Holbrooke. 
   Part of the debate we are having now--if not all of it--should have been done last fall. To come in now after the administration and our NATO partners are trying to bring together some peaceful resolution using the leverage of NATO firepower and the leverage of military intervention, for the Congress now to come in and undermine that is not the right way to have the Congress participate in its constitutional responsibility to help form foreign policy. 
   However, the President of the United States must take the lead here. I, too, have been disappointed in the President not coming forward to explain, to educate, on this issue. If the President feels this is relevant and important to America's interests, the President must come forward and explain that to the American people. He has thus far not done that. I understand that may be done today or tomorrow. I talked to Secretary Albright Sunday night and encouraged Secretary Albright, as I have others, to encourage the President to do that. Only the President can lead. Only the President can make the case as to why this is important for our country and explain the consequences of the United States doing nothing. The President must come before the Nation and explain why this military intervention in Kosovo is relevant and important, and why the very significant risk of life is worth it, why the significant risk of life is worth it. 
   I also want to point out that I have heard an awful lot of debate and conversation that we, the United States, would take on Milosevic. It is not just the United States. It is our 15--actually 18--other partners in NATO. I might add, too, that the Europeans have stepped into this with rather direct action and a call for arms in using and committing their ground troops and other military assets. So it is not the United States against Milosevic. It is NATO; it is the forces of good. We must not be confused by that difference. 
   The President has to explain all of this to the American public. Yes, there are great uncertainties and great risks at stake. But to do nothing would create a far worse risk for Europe, the United States, NATO, and I believe all over the world, because the United States' commitment and work and credibility is being watched very carefully by Saddam Hussein, the North Koreans, and others who would wish the United States and our allies ill. Actions have consequences. Nonactions have consequences. 
   Mr. President, history will judge us harshly if we do not take action to stop this rolling genocide. As complicated as 
   this is, I hope that as we debate this through today, my colleagues will support the President on his course of action. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to support S. 257, the National Missile Defense Act, and to thank my friend and colleague, the distinguished senior Senator from Mississippi, for his continued leadership on this issue--not today, not last year, but over a sustained period of time--to help educate America as to why this issue is so important to our future. I thank the cosponsor of this bill, Senator INOUYE from Hawaii, who has joined over the years with Senator COCHRAN in leading the debate and, hopefully, moving this body to a decisive action today on passing the National Missile Defense Act. 
   Mr. President, the security of the American people is the first and most important responsibility of the National Government. One of the primary threats facing our national security in the 21st century is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and advanced, sophisticated missile technology. 
   Surveys show that many Americans think our Armed Forces can shoot down any missile fired at the United States today. As the debate has pointed out over the last few days, that, in fact, is not the case; it is a myth. We don't have a missile defense system today, we won't have a missile defense system tomorrow, and we won't have a missile defense system next year. Yet the nations who are developing their own weapons of mass destruction are not waiting. Last year, two new countries entered the nuclear club, India and Pakistan. Other nations whose motives are less than friendly toward the United States and our allies are aggressively pursuing these weapons and the ability to launch, the ability to deliver, a nuclear weapon. 
   As technology spreads throughout the world, the threat increases not only from rogue states but also from terrorist organizations. For years, America was assured by our intelligence agencies that the ability to strike the U.S. mainland by any rogue state was years away and that we would easily have enough time to develop a new missile defense system before that possibility would occur. 
   Last July, a bipartisan commission headed by the distinguished former Secretary of Defense, former Chief of Staff to the President, former Member of the House of Representatives, Don Rumsfeld, sounded an alarm: All was not quiet on the ballistic missile front. The Rumsfeld Commission examined the emerging and current ballistic missile threat to the United States. As  Secretary Rumsfeld testified last October before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee:  
   We concluded unanimously that we are now in an environment of little or no warning.  
   The Rumsfeld Commission report contains several alarming conclusions. 
   One, Russia and China continue to pose threats. Both possess intercontinental ballistic missile capability of reaching the United States mainland. We must be prepared for the possibility of an accidental launch--an accidental launch. In addition, and even more deadly in terms of the threat it poses, both Russia and China have emerged as major suppliers of technology to a number of rogue nations and other countries. 
   Two, the Rumsfeld Commission found that North Korea and Iran could each pose a threat to the United States within 5 years of a decision to do so. 
   Three, Iraq was estimated to be certainly within 10 years 
   of posing a threat. Whether we have been effective at limiting this development with our airstrikes is unknown in Iraq because Iraq is now able to continue its work without the oversight of UNSCOM inspectors. These nations are not isolated; they work together. As Secretary Rumsfeld stated with regard to North Korea:  
   They are very, very active marketing ballistic missile technologies.  
   Iran alone received technology assistance from Russia, China, and North Korea, which gives it a wider array of options. 
   And perhaps one of most striking comments made by Secretary Rumsfeld in his testimony in October was one that rang true with plain, straightforward common sense. Again I quote Secretary Rumsfeld:  
   We have concluded that there will be surprises [deadly surprises]. It is a big world, it is a complicated world, and deception and denial are extensive. The surprise to me is not that there are and will be surprises, but that we are surprised that there are surprises.  
   The Rumsfeld Commission report was greeted with some skepticism by the intelligence community. Then on October 31 of last year, the myth that technology was years away was shattered when North Korea launched a Taepo Dong I missile, a three-stage rocket, over Japan and into the Pacific. This is a missile that, with upgrades, could have delivered a small payload, a nuclear payload, to Hawaii or Alaska. We know that the North Koreans are in the advanced stage of developing a Taepo Dong I intercontinental missile with the capability of delivering a nuclear payload to the American interior. 
   Finally, last month the CIA reversed itself saying the threat was real, imminent, and very dangerous. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, CIA Director George Tenet stated:  
   I can hardly overstate my concern about North Korea. In nearly all respects, the situation there has become more volatile and more unpredictable.  
   Why has it taken us this long to wake up to the threats facing our Nation? How many more intelligence reports and missile test firings do we need? 
   Vast oceans in time protected America at the beginning of World War II. Oceans in time will not protect America today. Time has run out. 
   I was very pleased to see news reports this morning, Mr. President, that President Clinton has dropped his threat now to veto this bill. However, the administration continues to raise concerns about whether a national missile defense system fits within the framework of the 1972 ABM Treaty with the old Soviet Union--the imploded Soviet Union, a country that no longer exists. 
   Much has been made by the opponents of this bill on how Russia would perceive our development of a national missile defense. I visited Russia in December. I spent 10 days in Russia and met with leaders throughout Russia. I was in Siberia. I asked about this question. This question is about the relevancy of our national interest, as all questions of national security are about the relevancy of our national interest, as Russia's questions are about their national interest. The Foreign Relations Committee will hold a hearing on the ABM Treaty in April, and a continued set of hearings on into May, leading up to the June 1 deadline by which Chairman HELMS has asked the administration to submit the ABM Treaty amendments. 
   It is completely inconsistent for the administration to raise concerns about building a national missile defense system under this current 1972 treaty and then not submit the ABM Treaty amendments to the Senate. This administration has yet to send amendments to the ABM Treaty, nor has it given any indication that it will. The President should submit amendments and allow the Senate to debate this issue. We need to determine whether this 1972 treaty is still relevant to America's security in the 21st century. The security of our people cannot be held hostage to an outdated treaty with a country that no longer exists. The most fundamental responsibility of this Government, of each of us who have the privilege to serve in this body, is to assure the freedom and security of this Nation; to do less not only abrogates our responsibility, but makes us less than worthy of serving the people of this country. 
   As Secretary Rumsfeld stated:  
   The new reality makes threats such as terrorism, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles more attractive to dictators. They are cheaper than armies and air forces and navies. They are attainable. And ballistic missiles have the advantage of being able to arrive at their destination undefended.  
   We need an effective missile defense system, and we need to get at it now. 
   I conclude with what President Reagan said in 1983. He said:  
   If history teaches anything, it teaches simple-minded appeasement or wishful thinking about our adversaries is folly--it means the betrayal of our past, the squandering of our future, and the squandering of our freedom.  
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the National Missile Defense Act, S. 257. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from North Carolina for helping organize this recognition of our friend and colleague, my senior Senator from the State of Nebraska, BOB KERREY. 
   In 1979, on the cover of a Newsweek magazine, with a glorious picture of Teddy Roosevelt riding to the charge, the headline blared out, ``Where Have Our Heroes Gone?'' 
   Mr. President, that was in 1979, at a time when many Americans were questioning the very foundation and base of our Government and our society. They were reaching out for inspiration and courage and asking the Newsweek 1979 question, ``Where have our heroes gone?'' 
   There are heroes all around us. One in our midst is the man whom we recognize this morning, BOB KERREY. BOB KERREY is a hero for many reasons. Anyone who has been awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor, our Nation's highest award for valor and bravery, is a hero. But the mark of a hero is what happens after that recognition. What has BOB KERREY done with his life since that time 30 years ago when he, in a selfless, valorous way, led his men and put his men, his duty, his country and his mission above himself? What has happened to this man since? 
   Well, as he tells the story, in a rather self-effacing way--that is how we Nebraskans are, humble, self-effacing--the only flaw I can find in KERREY is that he was not Army. But other than that defect, he has conducted himself rather well. 
   The mark of a hero is what one has taken in life--the good, 
   the bad, and all that is in between, and how they have applied that to make the world better, and what they have done to improve the lives of others. That begins with some belief--belief in oneself, belief in one's country, belief in others, belief that in fact God has given us all strengths, resources and weaknesses. As BOB KERREY has often said, there were so many who surrounded him after those days in Vietnam--in the hospital, in rehabilitation--who helped him put his life back together. That is what inspired him. He rose inspired as well. He rose and reinspired, and reinspired, and reinspired. They lead and they never stop and they never stop. That is the story, to me, that is most magnificent about BOB KERREY. 
   It is appropriate that we recognize one of our own on the floor of the Senate today. I am particularly proud because I come from the State where BOB KERREY was grounded with foundations, with values, with standards, with expectations; and so I know how he has inspired our State. Our colleagues know how he has inspired this body and the people around him, and they know of the lives of the people that he has touched. 
   For all of those reasons, and more, Mr. President, I am proud to take a moment to share in recognizing the goodness and, yes, the heroism of our friend and our colleague, BOB KERREY. To you, good friend, I salute you. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal Home Loan Bank System Modernization Act of 1999. I am joined in this effort by my distinguished colleagues Senators BAYH, LOTT, BENNETT, GRAMS, KERREY, JOHNSON, DEWINE, CONRAD, INHOFE, MURKOWSKI, BROWNBACK, BRYAN, ROBERTS, and BURNS. While we've made a few improvements, this is essentially the same legislation I introduced during the 105th Congress. 
   The bill has the formal support of the American Bankers Association, the Independent Bankers Association of America, America's Community Bankers, the Council of Federal Home Loan Banks, and the National Association of Home Builders. Equally important, we have the support of the regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Board. 
   The bill's main objective is to strengthen local community banks that are vital to the economic growth and viability of our communities. The Federal Home Loan Bank System Modernization Act of 1999 would ensure that, in an era of banking megamergers, smaller banks are able to compete effectively and continue to serve their customers' lending needs. 
   Community banks are finding that, for a variety of reasons, their funding sources are shrinking. This makes it more difficult to fund the loan demands in their communities. During the 1980s in my state of Nebraska--as in much of America--many community banks and thrifts closed. As local credit dried up, local economies stagnated. Small businesses, our greatest engines for job growth, were the first to feel the crunch. 
   The Federal Home Loan Bank System Modernization Act of 1999 strengthens community banks in order to avoid a repeat of the 1980s. By ensuring the viability of the community bank and thrift, our bill will keep credit flowing to small businesses, farmers, and potential homeowners--and help our local communities to thrive as we enter the 21st Century. 
   There is plenty of evidence that small banks are facing growing deposit pressures. This problem has two causes: First, banks and thrifts are competing for deposits with brokerage firms and mutual funds--and local institutions are losing. That means that deposits that used to go to local institutions and were used for local lending are now going to major financial institutions outside the community. 
   Second, we have an aging population in many rural communities. When a farmer dies, his inheritance goes to his children--who often have left the community. That means money flows out of the community--out of local financial institutions--and is no longer available for local economic development. 
   These two factors mean less deposits in local banks. That means less local capital available for local loans. Less economic development. Less opportunity. And this problem won't fix itself--most of these local institutions are too small to go to the capital markets on their own. 
   This is where the Federal Home Loan Banks can make a real difference. The Home Loan Banks can be a critical source of liquidity for community banks and thrifts. I tend to focus on rural America because that is where I come from--but liquidity problems can be equally serious in urban areas. The Federal Home Loan Banks are an important tool for providing credit to consumers no matter where they live. 
   A related problem our bill addresses is government subsidized competition with the private sector. Commercial banks compete with credit unions that pay no taxes and, therefore, have a lower cost of funding. The same can be said of the Farm Credit System. Its connection to the federal government gives it a funding advantage over commercial banks. The purpose of this legislation is not to drive the Farm Credit Banks or credit unions out of business--they play a vital role in our country. The purpose is to allow the  Federal Home Loan Banks to help level the playing field for commercial banks and thrifts that must compete with these entities. 
   I want to provide you with a real world example: the case of Commercial State Bank in Wausa, Nebraska. Commercial has served northeast Nebraska as an agricultural and business lender for more than 70 years. 
   Now, with a growing economy in the region, the bank is growing as well. In the small community of 600 people, deposits can't keep pace with the growing demand for loans--and that means the bank's liquidity is declining. With less liquidity, there just isn't as much money available for lending as the community demands. 
   This bill would help banks like Commercial and communities like Wausa. As Doug Johnson, president of Commercial State Bank, wrote to me about this legislation:  
   If banks like Commercial State Bank were able to access the Federal Home Loan Bank, our customers would be better able to be serviced with a consistent and competitive source of funding. Denying credit to qualified borrowers is not productive for Nebraska or the Midwest. Unfortunately, those borrowers may miss the opportunities available to them at this time to improve their economic prosperity.  
   Mr. President, that's what this bill is all about--helping communities to better secure their economic futures. 
   The Federal Home Loan Bank system was established in 1932, primarily to provide a source of credit to savings and loan institutions for home lending. Now, a majority of the members in the FHLB system are commercial banks. We should update this system to recognize this change in its membership. 
   Not since 1989 has significant Federal Home Loan Bank legislation become law. The system is working well, but I believe Congress can make it better. It's time for Congress to act. 
   This legislation has five main components: 
   First, our legislation would ease membership requirements for smaller community banks and thrifts that are vital sources of credit in their local communities. It would allow the FHLB System to be more easily accessed as an important source of liquidity for community lenders. These institutions would be permitted to post different types of collateral for various kinds of lending. This critical change will facilitate more small business, rural development, agricultural, and low-income community development lending in rural and urban communities. 
   The second main component of this bill is an issue of basic fairness. Federally chartered savings associations, or thrifts as they are called today, are required to be members of the Federal Home Loan Bank system. Commercial banks, on the other hand, are voluntary members. This disparity is unfair. 
   Our legislation allows federally chartered thrifts to become voluntary members. This is important to these institutions, which are large stockholders in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. It is critical that all member financial institutions have the ability to choose whether Federal Home Loan Bank membership is appropriate or not. As a result of this action, we also equalize stock purchase requirements for all member institutions. We do this in a way that maintains and enhances the safety and soundness of the FHLB system. 
   The third component of this legislation fixes an imbalance in the system's annual REFCORP obligation. Currently, the 12 FHLBanks must collectively pay a fixed $300 million obligation to service the REFCORP bonds that were issued to help pay for the S&L bailout. This fixed obligation has driven the banks to increase their levels of non-mission-related investments. 
   Under our legislation each FHLBank would be required to pay 20.75 percent of its earnings to service the REFCORP debt. Freeing the FHLBanks of the obligation to generate a specific dollar figure would allow them to concentrate on their primary mission of housing finance and community lending. The Congressional Budget Office has indicated this change could bring in an additional $795 million over ten years to the U.S. Treasury. In other words, we have protected the taxpayer from picking up any additional cost of the S&L bailout. 
   Fourth, the legislation addresses the issue of devolution of management functions from the Finance Board to the FHLBanks. On issues of day-to-day management, the FHLBanks should be able to govern themselves independently of their regulator. The function of the Finance Board should be mission regulation and safety-and-soundness regulation. The provisions of the legislation that accomplish this goal are non-controversial and enjoy broad support. In fact, they follow the recommendations of a recent General Accounting Office study. 
   Finally, this legislation reforms the capital structure of the Federal Home Loan Bank system. Current law (established in 1932) dictates that the level of FHLBank capital is determined by the size and mix of a FHLBank's member assets, not by any rational capital standards. The result is the FHLBanks' capital levels don't reflect the risk profile of their lending activities. Furthermore, the FHLBanks' capital lacks permanence because it is withdrawable by members upon termination of their membership. 
   Our bill changes the existing capital rules to include a risk-based capital requirement and a permanent capital requirement which ensures the FHLBanks maintain capital levels appropriate to the risk of their business activities. The new plan also encourages the FHLBanks to build up their retained earnings which act as an additional buffer and protection to the U.S. taxpayer. 
   Mr. President, it's time to modernize the Federal Home Loan Bank System. The landscape of the financial services industry is rapidly evolving. The Federal Home Loan Banks should be allowed to modernize to keep pace with these changes. I am grateful to Senator BAYH, the principal cosponsor of the legislation, for his help in this endeavor. I am also grateful to the other cosponsors who have lent their names to this effort. Today, Congressmen BAKER and KANJORSKI are introducing the companion bill in the House of Representatives. Both are tireless proponents for Federal Home Loan Bank modernization and their help in the formulation of this legislation was critical. 
   I sincerely hope the Senate Banking Committee and the full Senate will have the chance to consider this important legislation, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise to add my enthusiastic support for S. 4. 
   The most important responsibility a nation has is to its people's security, ensuring a nation's freedom. As all of us in life, nations and governments are no different. We must prioritize. We must prioritize our resources. We must prioritize our agendas. We must prioritize the focus that we give to our people. 
   As important as is Social Security, and Medicare, and tax cuts, and education and all that compose a society that helps develop a culture, national security is the highest priority, the highest priority of a government, and its most important responsibility. 
   There will be much debate, as there should be much debate, over the next year and a half about the priorities of this Nation as we move into the next century. None will be more important than the debate that is occurring in this Chamber today, because what we are saying, the message we are sending to our people, to our friends and our foes alike around the world, is that, first, we will address the important issues confronting our national security interests; second, we will put into play and into our national security interests the resources necessary to maintain a national security system second to none. We will, in fact, prioritize our national security so that it will, as history has shown, guarantee our foreign policy, our export expansion, our trade reform. All of these are part of an overarching policy that connects, and we cannot have one without the other. We know--we have heard today, we have heard over the last 2 days--the problems that now confront our military--readiness, retention, recruitment. 
   Any measure we take of our national security today comes up short, comes up wanting, and it is the responsibility of this Congress to lead; it is the responsibility of the President to lead, and it is the responsibility of America to prioritize the national security interests of our country. 
   We need, more than ever before, the best, the brightest, young men and women to make a military career a career not only they can be proud of, our Nation can be proud of, but a career that serves our interests. 
   When we look at what has happened to this military in the last 10 years--longer deployments, more deployments, losing our senior enlisted halfway through their 20 years, pilots dropping out, the investment our society puts in these men and women--we find we are perilously close to the edge as  to how far we can continue to defend not only our freedom but our interests in the world. And make no mistake about this, Mr. President. We just don't have select interests in the world; 
   all the world is in our interests. Does that mean we are the international policemen? No. What it does mean is, because we do live in a globally connected world, a very competitive world, that in every corner of the world our interest is peace, stability, freedom; the development of democratic governments and market economies are in the interests of all of our people. 
   So, this is not esoteric. This is relevant. And as we close the debate on this issue, we are talking about more than just putting the necessary resources into our national security commitments and capabilities, but we are sending a message to our people, to our culture, to our society, that in fact we very much value the men and women who make defending our freedoms their life. What we are saying, as well, to the families of these men and women is: We value you. We know the hardships that you deal with. We know about those long deployments. Not since Vietnam--and I see my colleague, Senator ROBB, standing across the way--not since Senator ROBB and I served in Vietnam has there been any addressing of the pay scale of our military. That is embarrassing. That is not worthy of a great nation and a great people. 
   So, again, I say this is not only in the best interests of our country, but it is making a very specific and definite statement to our people, to our culture, to our society that duty, honor, and country count. Duty, honor, and country count. We want people to be proud to serve our country in uniform. We want to acknowledge them, not just by increasing their pay and their benefits--because that is, in part, a measurement of their worth and a way to keep score--but by saying: We know your worth. We know how important you are and we value that. We need you. 
   For those reasons and many more that we have heard today and we will hear tomorrow, I strongly support S. 4. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HAGEL. I write this statement at my desk on the floor of the United States Senate. After weeks of listening, reading, reviewing, reflection, analysis and contemplation I have come to the conclusion that I will vote to convict the President on both Articles of Impeachment. 
   The Constitution is very clear. It requires Members of the United States Senate to vote for or against each Article of Impeachment. No improvising. No substitutions. No censures. No findings of fact. The completeness of the charges against the President is powerful. The issue is abuse of power. Did the President abuse his power and therefore violate the Nation's trust in him? We must remember that trust is the only true currency elected officials have. 
   Perjury and obstruction of justice are not just federal crimes. When committed by an elected official they are abuses of power. When committed by a president they constitute an abuse of the highest power. The standards and expectations for America's elected officials cannot be calibrated. When elected officials bring down those standards and expectations and violate the people's trust ..... they rip the very fabric of our Nation. There is then a dishonoring of the spirit that is the guardian of American justice. 
   There can be no shading of right and wrong. The complicated currents that have coursed through this impeachment process are many. But after stripping away the underbrush of legal technicalities and nuance, I find that the President abused his sacred power by lying and obstructing justice. How can parents instill values and morality in their children? How can educators teach our children? How can the rule of law for every American be applied equally if we have two standards of justice in America--one for the powerful and the other for the rest of us? 
   What holds this Nation, this society, this culture, together? Yes, laws are part of it. But it is really the strong moral foundation anchored by values and standards--the individual sense of right and wrong, personal responsibility, accountability for one's actions. This is what holds a free people together. Respect for each other--not because a law dictates that action--but rather because it's the right thing to do. 
   The President violated his Constitutional oath and he broke the law. His crimes do rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors prescribed in the Constitution. The President's actions cannot be defended by dancing on the pin head of legal technicality. Every American must know actions have consequences. Even for presidents. All Americans must have faith in our laws and know that there is equal justice for all. The core of our judicial process is the rule of law. 
   Americans deserve to always expect the highest standard of conduct from their elected officials. If that expectation is defined down over time, it will erode the very base of our democracy and put our Republic in peril. That is the point of the Impeachment Clause of our Constitution ..... to protect the Republic. The Impeachment clause of our Constitution is there to ensure the fitness of an individual to hold high office. President Clinton's conduct has debased his office and violated the soul of justice--truth. He has thereby debased and violated the American people. I have no other course to follow than to vote to convict President William Jefferson Clinton on both Articles of Impeachment.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Small Business Banking Act of 1999. I am again joined in the effort by my distinguished colleague Senator REED of Rhode Island, who is the principal cosponsor of this important legislation. 
   We originally introduced this legislation during the last Congress. This legislation was incorporated into a more comprehensive financial regulatory relief bill that was unanimously reported out of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs. We fully expect it will be enacted into law during this Congress. 
   Passage of this bill will remove one of the last vestiges of an obsolete interest rate control system. Abolishing the statutory requirement that prohibits incorporated businesses from owning interest bearing checking accounts will provide America's small business owners, farmers, and farm cooperatives with a funds management tool that is long overdue. 
   Passage of this bill will ensure America's entrepreneurs can compete effectively with larger businesses. My experience as a businessman has shown me, firsthand, that it's extremely important for anyone trying to maximize profits to be able to invest funds wisely for maximum efficiencies. Let me quote from a December, 1997 letter I received from a constituent, Mary Jo Bousek. Mary Jo owns a commercial property company. She writes:  
   ``I was very pleased to see that you sponsored a bill to allow banks to pay interest on checking accounts for partnerships and corporations. When we changed our rental properties from a sole proprietorship to a Limited Liability Company, we suddenly began losing about $1500 a year in interest on our bank account. This seems totally unreasonable and unfair.''  
   Mary Jo is right. It is unfair. 
   During President Ronald Reagan's first term, one of his early actions was to abolish many provisions of the antiquated interest rate control system the banking system was required to use. With this change to the laws, Americans were finally able to earn interest on their checking accounts deposited in banks. Unfortunately, one aspect of the old system left untouched by the change in law was not allowing America's businesses to share in the good fortune. 
   Complicating matters is the growing impact of nonbanking institutions that offer deposit-like money accounts to individuals and corporations alike. Large brokerage firms have long offered interest on deposit accounts they maintain for their customers. This places these firms at an advantage over community banks that can't offer their corporate customers interest on their checking accounts. 
   While I support business innovation, I don't believe it's fair when any business gains a competitive edge over another due to government interference through overregulation. This is exactly the case we have with banking laws that stifle bankers, especially America's small community bankers, and give an edge to another segment of the financial community. The Small Business Banking Act of 1999 seeks to correct this imbalance and allow community banks to compete fairly with brokerage firms. 
   I'm pleased to say our bill has the strong support of America's Community Bankers, the National Federation  of Independent Businesses, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the American Farm Bureau Federation. This bill has the support of many of the banks, thrifts, and small businesses in my home state of Nebraska. These important organizations represent a crosscurrent of the type of support Senator REED and I have for our bill. Senator REED and I also have the support of the Federal banking regulators. In their 1996 Joint Report, ``Streamlining of Regulatory Requirements'', the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Office of Thrift Supervision, stated they believe the statutory prohibition against payment of interest on business checking accounts no longer serves a public purpose. I heartily agree. 
   Mr. President, this is a straightforward bill that will do away with an unnecessary regulation that burdens American business. I urge my colleagues to support it.

    Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today I rise with Senator DORGAN to introduce tax legislation that will help our family farmers cope with the economic crisis now affecting them. 
   Our tax code is full of provisions that are unfair and punitive. We need to overhaul our tax code to make it flatter, fairer and simpler. However, until the present tax code is overhauled, it is important that we fix specific provisions of the tax code to ensure that all taxpayers are treated fairly and equally. 
   In the 105th Congress we passed the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. This legislation included capital gains tax and federal estate tax relief. It was a good first step, but we can't stop there. We have much more to do. We need more capital gains tax relief, and I will keep pushing for more cuts and the eventual elimination of the tax. The federal estate tax also needs to be abolished. The estate tax is a leading cause for the break-up of family-run businesses, including farming, and I will continue to work for its elimination. Additionally, we need to provide all American taxpayers with an across-the-board tax cut. 
   We gave most Americans serious capital gains tax relief in 1997, but we neglected the family farmer. We now have the opportunity and obligation to correct this omission. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 created a $500,000 exclusion for homeowners on the sale of a principal residence, but this does not adequately address the needs of family farmers. Most farmers put whatever profit they earn from their hard work back into the land, not their home. As a result, the $500,000 exclusion for the sale of a principal residence does not provide the same level of relief to the family farmer as it does for the vast majority of others. So, when family farmers are forced to sell their farms due to economic downturns, not only are they out of the farming business, but the federal government is waiting to take a large portion in taxes on the sale of their home and farmland. 
   The legislation that Senator DORGAN and I are introducing would help ease the financial burden associated with selling the farm. It would allow the family farmer to take advantage of capital gains tax relief. It expands the $500,000 capital gains tax exclusion for sales of principal residences to cover family farmers who sell their farmhouses and/or surrounding farmlands. 
   This legislation is not a cure-all solution to the many problems now affecting our family farmers and ranchers. However, it will help. There are many other things that can be done including more tax relief in the areas of the estate tax and capital gains tax. We need to continue to open new markets for our commodities and knock down unilateral economic sanctions that are unfairly punishing our farmers. The future of U.S. agriculture lies in export expansion and trade reform. This tax legislation starts the process, but we must continue to push forward to help our family farmers and ranchers.

    Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, today Senator DODD and I are introducing the Food and Medicine Sanctions Relief Act of 1999. Joining us as cosponsors are our colleagues Senators DORGAN, GRAMS, HARKIN, LUGAR, ROBERTS, and WARNER. 
   This bill makes the simple statement that we should not include food and medicine in any unilateral sanction or embargo we may place on another country. Food and medicine are the most fundamental of human needs. Food and medicine should have no place in any sanctions we may impose on other countries because we do not like the policies of an aggressive or oppressive government. 
   We have gone too far in imposing unilateral economic sanctions on other nations. Sanctions can be a tool of foreign policy, but too often then have become a substitute for foreign policy. 
   From 1993 to 1996, the United States imposed 61 unilateral economic sanctions on 35 nations. We now have some form of sanctions on more than half of the world's population. It is time that we say ``no more.'' This legislation says that we will no longer use farm policy as a foreign policy weapon. 
   The pace of change today is unprecedented in modern history, and maybe all of history. Trade, and particularly the trade in food and medicine, is the common denominator that ties together the nations of the world. American exports of food and medicine acts to build bridges around the world. It strengthens ties between people and demonstrates the basic humanitarian impulse of the American people. 
   We live in a dynamic, interconnected world. Sanctions without the support of our allies only hurt us. And from a foreign policy perspective, unilateral sanctions rarely achieve their goal. Their real harm is on U.S. producers. It's estimated that sanctions cost the U.S. economy more than $20 billion each year. If a nation can't purchase products from the United States, particularly agricultural products, other nations are more than ready to fill the needs of those markets. 
   American agriculture and the U.S. government must send a strong message to our customers and our competitors around the world--our agricultural producers are going to be consistent and reliable suppliers of quality and plentiful agricultural products. 
   Once foreign agricultural markets are lost--for whatever reason--it can take decades to restore them. In 1973, the U.S. banned soybean exports to Japan. What did that accomplish? It turned Brazil into a significant soybean producer, and America has never fully recovered its soybean market share in Japan ..... and for good reasons, because it raised questions about the reliability of America as an agricultural supplier. Another example is that the Soviet grain embargo of 1979 cost the U.S. $2.3 billion in lost farm exports and USDA compensation to farmers. When the U.S. cut off sales of wheat to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, France, Canada, Australia and Argentina stepped in to claim this market and the former Soviet states have been timid buyers of U.S. farm products ever since. 
   This is also the right thing to do. It's beneath this great nation to withhold medicine and food as a tool to implement its foreign policy. We are the most powerful nation on earth. Removing these items from the U.S. arsenal of economic sanctions will say to the poor and hungry of the world that they will not have to suffer the consequences of their government's actions. 
   I am from a Midwestern state, a large agriculture exporting state. But there is not a farmer or rancher in Nebraska who would say, ``I would trade America's national or security interests just to sell more corn or beef.'' That is not the question. The question is whether we should place a humanitarian hardship on the people of other countries because of the actions of their governments. Doing this does not advance our country's interests. In fact, it hurts our national interest, just as it intensifies the hardship being faced today by America's agricultural producers. 
   History has shown, Mr. President, that trade and commerce does more to change attitudes and alter behaviors over time than any one thing. Why? It improves diets; it improves standards of living; it opens societies; it exposes people who lived under totalitarian rule to the concepts of personal freedom, economic freedom, and individual choice. 
   Ultimately, sanctions and embargoes mostly isolate ourselves. Trade embargoes isolate those who impose them. This bill is an important step forward, and is a part of the larger debate this Congress on the role of the U.S. in the world and how we intend to engage in the world. Trade is the keystone of our global engagement. 
   Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation, and to engage in the debate over the role of unilateral economic sanctions in American foreign policy.

    Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President I rise today in support of this measure which will inject some much-needed common-sense into our nation's agricultural trade policy. This measure amends the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 and restricts the President's ability to single out agriculture when foreign embargoes are imposed. 
   Food is basic humanitarian need and should not be included in economic embargoes or sanctions imposed by the United States. Our relationships with other nations must not be held captive to one issue. But our relationships with other nations are complicated. They include trade and commerce. They include U.S. interests abroad, national defense, human rights, and humanitarian efforts. But we must not allow one dynamic of our relationship with all other nations on this globe to be held captive to just one issue. 
   Trade and U.S. agriculture are virtually indistinguishable. The Soviet grain embargo of 1976 cost the U.S. $2.3 billion in lost farm exports and USDA compensation to farmers. When the U.S. cut off sales of wheat to protest Soviet invasion of Afghanistan--France, Canada, Australia, and Argentina stepped in to claim this market and the former Soviet states have been timid buyers of U.S. farm products ever since. 
   In recent months, Nebraska farmers, on many occasions, discussing the negative effects of the Carter grain embargo and many fear that a similar action could happen again. With more focus on sanctions and foreign policy, an anti-agriculture embargo measure is timely. 
   History has shown, Mr. President, that trade and commerce engagement in reaching out does more to change attitudes and alter behavior than any one thing. Why? It improves diets; it improve standards of living; it opens society; it exposes people who have lived under totalitarian rule, who have had limited exposure to freedom, to liberty, to economic freedom, products, choice, consumerism. That is what  trade does. Not one among us believes that just trade alone is all we need. But it is an important, integral part of our relationships around the world. 
   We live in a very dynamic time. The light of change today in the world is unprecedented in modern history, and maybe all of history. Food, fiber, and trade are common denominators of mutual interests of all the peoples of the world. 
   We must not isolate ourselves. Trade embargoes isolate those who impose trade embargoes. We need dynamic policies for dynamic times. The world is not static. 
   This is a strong step forward. This is the beginning of the larger debate that this Congress will have and must have about the role of the United States in the world and how we intend to engage the world, and trade is a very important part of that. 
   Embargoes and sanctions without the support of our allies only hurt us. From a foreign policy perspective, embargoes rarely achieve their goal. Their real harm is on U.S. agricultural producers. It's estimated that sanctions and embargoes cost the U.S. economy more than $20 billion each year. We have got to bring some common sense to our trade policy. 
   American agriculture and the U.S. government must send a strong message to our many customers and our competitors. U.S. farmers, ranchers, and agribusinesses are a consistent and reliable supplier of quality and plentiful agricultural products. Support of the Agriculture-Specific Embargo Act will send a strong message that U.S. agriculture will be once again considered a reliable supplier of food and fiber around the globe. 
    Mr. President, I am very proud to join my friends and colleagues who have worked on these issues diligently, who will continue to provide leadership, not just to this body but to the country, to the world, and to our farmers and our ranchers, our producers, and our citizens. 
   I encourage all of my colleagues to support this very important measure. Again, I say to my colleagues that this is an engagement we must be a part of today.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I have introduced S. 246, the Private Property Fairness Act of 1999. This bill will help ensure that when the Government issues regulations for the benefit of the public as a whole, it does not saddle just a few landowners with the whole cost of compliance. This bill will help enforce the U.S. Constitution's guarantee that the Federal Government cannot take private property without paying just compensation to the owner. 
   Recent record low prices received by American agricultural producers has prompted great concern about the future of family farmers and ranchers. What we must remember is that government regulations are unfairly burdening this vital sector--hitting family farmers the hardest. 
   The dramatic growth in Federal regulation in recent decades has focused attention on a very murky area of property law, a regulatory area in which the law of takings is not yet settled to the satisfaction of most Americans. 
   The bottom line is that the law in this area is unfair. For example, if the Government condemns part of a farm to build a highway, it has to pay the farmer for the value of his land. But if the Government requires that same farmer stop growing crops on that same land in order to protect endangered species or conserve wetlands, the farmer gets no compensation. In both situations the Government has acted to benefit the general public and, in the process, has imposed a cost on the farmer. In both cases, the land is taken out of production and the farmer loses income. But only in the highway example is the farmer compensated for his loss. In the regulatory example, the farmer, or any other landowner, has to absorb all of the cost himself. This is not fair. 
   The legislation I am introducing today is an important step toward providing relief from these so-called regulatory takings. My bill is a narrowly tailored approach that will make a real difference for property owners across America. It protects private property rights in two ways. First, it puts in place procedures that will stop or minimize takings by the Federal Government before they occur. The Government would have to jump a much higher hurdle before it can restrict the use of someone's privately owned property. For the first time, the Federal Government will have to determine in advance how its actions will impact the property owner, not just the wetland or the endangered species. This bill also would require the Federal Government to look for options other than restricting the use of private property to achieve its goal. 
   Second, if heavy Government regulations diminish the value of private property, this bill would allow the landowners to plead their case in a Federal district court, instead of forcing them to seek relief. This bill makes the process easier, less costly, and more accessible and accountable so all citizens can fully protect their property rights. 
   For too long, Federal regulators have made private property owners bear the burdens and the costs of Government land use decisions. The result has been that real people suffer. 
   Joe Jeffrey is a farmer in Lexington, NE. Like most Americans, he is proud of his land. He believed his property was his to use and control as he saw fit. So, after 12 years of regulatory struggles, Mr. Jeffrey got fed up and decided to lease out his land. The Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation District now has use of the property for the next 17 years. The Government's regulatory intrusion left Mr. Jeffrey few other options. 
   Joe Jeffrey first met the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Army Corps of Engineers in 1987. Mr. Jeffrey's introduction to the long arm of the Federal bureaucracy was in the form of wetlands regulations. Mr. Jeffrey was notified that he had to destroy two dikes on his land because they were constructed without the proper permits. Nearly 2 years later, the corps partially changed its mind and allowed Mr. Jeffrey to reconstruct one of the dikes because the corps lacked authority to make him destroy it in the first place. 
   Then floods damaged part of Mr. Jeffrey's irrigated pastureland and changed the normal water channel. Mr. Jeffrey set out to return the channel to its original course by moving sand that the flood had shifted. But the Government said ``no.'' The corps told him he had to give public notice before he could repair his own property. 
   Then came the Endangered Species Act. 
   Neither least terns nor piping plovers--both federally protected endangered species--have ever nested on Mr. Jeffrey's property. But that didn't stop the regulators. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wanted to designate Mr. Jeffrey's property as ``critical habitat'' for these protected species. 
   The bureaucrats could not even agree among themselves on what they wanted done. The Nebraska Department of Environmental Control wanted the area re-vegetated. But the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service wanted the area kept free of vegetation. Mr. Jeffrey was caught in the middle. 
   This is a real regulatory horror story. And there's more. 
   Today--12 years after his regulatory struggle began--Mr. Jeffrey is faced with eroded pastureland that cannot be irrigated and cannot be repaired without significant personal expense. The value of Mr. Jeffrey's land has been diminished by the Government's regulatory intrusion--but he has not been compensated. In fact, he has had to spend money from his own pocket to comply with the regulations. The Fish and Wildlife Service asked Mr. Jeffrey to modify his center pivot irrigation system to negotiate around the eroded area--at a personal cost of $20,000. And the issue is still not resolved. 
   Mr. President, we do not need more stories like Joe Jeffrey's in America. Our Constitution guarantees our people's rights. Congress must act to uphold those rights and guarantee them in practice, not just in theory. Government regulation has gone too far. We must make it accountable to the people. Government should be accountable to the people, not the people accountable to the Government. 
   What this issue comes down to is fairness. It is simply not fair and it is not right for the Federal Government to have the ability to restrict the use of privately owned property without compensating the owner. It violates the principles this country was founded on. This legislation puts some justice back into the system. It reins in regulatory agencies and gives the private property owner a voice in the process. It makes it easier for citizens to appeal any restrictions imposed on their land or property. It is the right thing to do. It is the just and fair thing to do.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to make a brief observation and reflect on one of the points the President made last night during his State of the Union Message. The President suggested--recommended that America pause for a moment and understand and absorb this dynamic, exciting time that we live in. And, indeed, it is exciting, dynamic, and full of hope and opportunity. But, as I listened to the President last night--and I listened to the 20 specific mentions of more government spending for more and new programs, and as I listened to the 24 specific mentions of more Federal Government regulation--I failed to hear any reference to tax cuts, to turning back authority, turning back regulation, turning back government to the people. 
   I connected with what he said in his observation about the times we live in. And isn't it amazing, especially when you look at the report that Freedom House issued a month ago about where the world is going today. In that report, Freedom House pointed out that for the first time since Freedom House has been calculating personal liberty in the world, more peoples are free, with more personal liberties, today than at any time in the history of their measurement; in fact, they went so far as to say maybe in the history, proportionally, of mankind. There is a long way to go, but in their calculations they said almost half of the 5.6 billion people on Earth are free today. I find that rather interesting, in that most of the world is moving this way--less government, less regulation, more personal liberty--and here the greatest Republic in the history of mankind, if you listen to the President, is going back the other way: more restrictions, more government, more regulation, and less individual freedom. 
   On Sunday and Monday of this week I was back in Nebraska and met with teachers, students, parents. One of the things that came out of that meeting from the teachers was this observation, and I say this in light of what the President proposed last night with his advocacy of more Federal Government involvement in education. As a matter of fact, he went beyond that. He said, unless local school districts complied with what Washington said--with our money, the taxpayers' money; even more interesting--then we would cut them off. What the schoolteachers told me, those we have charged to educate our children, those who have maybe the heaviest burden except for the parents, in this debate--they tell me we don't want any more Government. But they also said this, and this is where we are missing the point: We are gliding over this gap of children from 1 to 5 or 6. When the teacher gets that child at 5 or 6, that is a molded product. That is a molded product we can work and develop, but where is the emphasis on the parental responsibility? According to the President, we are going to, in fact, do more for day care, and now summer programs, more education--the Federal Government, essentially, is going to really dictate the dynamics of our foundation. 
   The foundation of our country is not government. The foundation of this country rests on a value system, and morals and honesty and respect for one another. That is what we build from. That is what we have always built from. Not more government programs; not more money. And, when we glide over that and act like that is not there or that is not important, or even emphasize the responsibility of parents and the responsibility of all society, we are in some trouble. 
   I find it interesting, in reading Governor George Bush's comments yesterday, what he said: Too much hope in economics, just as we once put too much hope in Government, may be our greater challenge. He is right. We must go beyond Government, beyond economics, and go back and emphasize parental responsibility and truth and values. That is what we build from. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the remarks of my colleagues here this morning. I also wish to commend my friend, the senior Senator from Mississippi, for reintroducing his defense initiative. Missile defense is as critical a challenge as this country faces, not just for the short term, but for the long term, and I have been a strong proponent of what Senator COCHRAN is proposing. I wish, again, to be a cosponsor of that measure.
