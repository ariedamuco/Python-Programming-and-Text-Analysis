   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today on what is a somewhat bittersweet occasion to reflect on my time in the Senate, and to look ahead to the future. 
   Next to being a husband, a father, and a grandfather, these past 6 years have provided without a doubt the most exciting and also the most inspiring moments in my life. To serve as a Member of the greatest deliberative body in the world--entrusted with fulfilling the hopes and wishes of the people across the United States as well as the people of Minnesota--has been humbling beyond words. When your view out the front window is of the U.S. Capitol, and when your daily travels take you down the same halls once walked by John Quincy Adams, Abraham Lincoln, and Daniel Webster, and you spend your hours working for people who ask nothing more of you than to make government work a little bit better, well, going to the office to work each day is a real pleasure.  
   I am going to miss the Senate, not at all because of the prestige it is said to represent, but because this relatively small group of people is instilled with the power to accomplish so much good. And every day in this Chamber, my colleagues plow their passions into doing that. Yes, we routinely disagree. We have our partisan battles. And as men and women with strong ideas about what is right for America, we can be as stubborn as any creature God ever put onto this Earth. But there is never any doubt that as Senators, my colleagues act out of a deeply held belief that they are doing the right thing for the people who sent them here. 
   I have had the opportunity to serve with many remarkable individuals. They have taught me a great deal, not just about being a Senator, although there was certainly a major part of that, but they also helped me to recognize that compromise does not have to mean compromising one's beliefs, that a small victory is often better than no victory at all, that ``obstacle'' is just another word for opportunity, and that sometimes the best way to get past a mountain is to go around it, and not necessarily tunnel right through it. 
   The majority leader, TRENT LOTT, has been a good friend, and I have appreciated his counsel and his willingness to listen to even the most junior members of this chamber. I'll say the same of his predecessor, Senator Bob Dole, who was in so many ways a mentor to this Senator, and I truly admire him as a wonderful and caring leader and man. The assistant majority leader, DON NICKLES, has been a tremendous example to my colleagues and me, and I want to thank him for his guidance and friendship. I consider it my great fortune, and a great honor, to have been able to work closely with so many other good people on both sides of the aisle, such as Democrat Leader TOM DASCHLE and Assistant Democratic Leader HARRY REID. I have learned from you daily; 
   and, from our most senior and respected Members of this body, Senator ROBERT BYRD and Senator STROM THURMOND; my committee chairmen, JESSE HELMS of Foreign Relations, PHIL GRAMM of Banking, PETE DOMENICI of Budget, and FRANK MURKOWSKI of the Energy Committee. 
   Before I got to the Senate, I never would have guessed that every question would 
   have exactly one hundred different answers. But each of our exchanges forced me to look at old ideas in new ways, and I'm a better person for every challenge you posed. These years with you have been like watching a history book come to life. 
   I want to recognize my colleagues who are also leaving the Senate at the conclusion of this Congress. The distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, BILL ROTH, has been one of this Chamber's greatest champions of the taxpayers, and a Senator of whom I have the highest regard. JOHN ASHCROFT and SPENCE ABRAHAM continually set the highest standard of public service; we came into the Senate together, and I was honored to work closely with them during the past six years. CONNIE MACK, a colleague on the Banking Committee, has served this Senate with great distinction, as has the Senator from Washington, SLADE GORTON. On the other side of the aisle, the Senate is losing one of its most respected voices with the retirement of DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN. He represents to me the ideal of the character of a public servant. The same can be said of BOB KERREY. I also wish the very best to RICHARD BRYAN, FRANK LAUTENBERG, and CHUCK ROBB, all of whom earned my admiration. 
   As to the rest of my colleagues, I won't try to thank you individually here, but I will do so privately, and know that you each have my respect and my gratitude. 
   Not only have I served with exceptional colleagues, but I was elected to serve here during remarkable times. We've been confronted with moments that tested America's resolve in the world, such as the war in the Balkans and the bombings of our U.S. embassies abroad. Other events, like the Oklahoma City tragedy and the recent uncertainty over the presidential election, have tested us domestically. Despite a strong economy, the challenges posed early on in my term by unending deficits and high taxes threatened families and job creators. These have been hard times in my home state as well, with problems on the farm and a series of natural disasters that challenged our citizens with floods and tornadoes. 
   We accepted these challenges because the American people expected us to, and at the end of the day, I'm proud to say that we've left things a little better than we found them. Deficits are a thing of the past, taxes are still a crushing blow for families, but a little less so, welfare is no longer a prison sentence, and trade opportunities have opened up around the world for American products. 
   Is it enough? Of course not, because it's never enough. There's always one more person needing a helping hand, one more bridge to build or road to pave, one more bill to introduce. But I'm confident that we've made the government work a little better for the folks who sent us here, and for the moment, that's enough for this Senator. I leave here with a few more wrinkles and maybe a gray hair or two, but no regrets. 
   I wish my colleagues the very best as you struggle with the challenges that lie ahead. 
   With a fifty-fifty split between the parties come January, you'll undoubtedly be tested in ways you haven't imagined. The Senate will adapt, though, as the Senate always has throughout its history, because the people will be counting on you. Senator-elect Dayton will be in my prayers, and I know the people of Minnesota will stand behind him as they've stood behind me. 
   On every level, this Senate is a family, and it wouldn't feel right to leave here without expressing my thanks to not just my fellow Senators, but everyone who helps this body go about its daily work. Whether it's the food service workers, pages, officers of the Capitol Police force, elevator operators, parliamentarians, and the others who have become such familiar presences, I've enjoyed getting to know you and I appreciate your professionalism. The dedication to this institution extends far beyond those privileged to stand in the well of the Senate to all of its employees. 
   In a Senate office, where the ink on the employee roster is barely dry before somebody leaves for a better opportunity and someone else steps in to fill his or her place, I've been blessed to have as loyal and as caring a staff as any Senator could ask for. Going all the way back to my service in the U.S. House, they've stood by me through good times and the most difficult of days. As staffers do, they worked anonymously. They spent long hours at their jobs. They didn't come to work for me expecting to get rich and besides, a paycheck cannot reward that kind of loyalty. So all I can offer them today is my humble thanks and some well-deserved public recognition by inserting their names in the RECORD.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, in conclusion, I appreciate their service to my office and to the people of Minnesota. I hope they understand that they have all helped to make a difference. 
   Also, I return to Minnesota a little bit older, hopefully a little bit wiser, and feeling mightily blessed for all the opportunities that have come my way. In conception and execution, the American Government--and the Senate in particular--is an institution that has never been equaled anywhere else in the world. I have been honored to be a part of it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, highway safety, especially concerning long-haul  trucks tends to be a contentious issue. It is generally understood that the long-haul truck driver faces a tedious and fatiguing task. Anyone trying to get to Florida from Minnesota in one day knows that. Government regulations on commercial truck drivers set parameters on hours of operation in the hope necessary rest can be achieved, thus preventing tired drivers from undertaking their critical duty. How can a government mandate for rest produce results? 
   Anyone in the business knows that the Administration's proposed regulations governing truck drivers have gone from bad to worse. We recently passed legislation delaying the implementation of a new proposed regulation. However, there is a solution. But first, some background. 
   Prescriptive Hours of Service regulations, HOS, have been unchanged for more than sixty years. After ten hours driving, a driver may not drive for eight hours. A driver may not drive more than seventy hours in eight days. Supposedly the non-driving time is intended to provide opportunity for sleep and other necessary activities. However, long-haul drivers may end a ten-hour driving period at a time of day when their physiological alerting system, or body clock, will not permit sleep. At the end of the non-driving period they may be tired but may legally drive. In many instances, they must drive fatigued in order to make timely delivery. There is consensus in the scientific community that any system of prescriptive hours of service regulation will result in drivers occasionally being prohibited from driving when they are alert and compelled to drive when they are tired. 
   It has come to my attention that a logical and creative alternative is at hand. One that offers the promise of not only improved highway truck safety, but improvement in the life-styles of the participants--the truck drivers--and in the efficiencies of the companies who employ them. The alternative is in managing fatigue. 
   The problem of operator inattention related to sleep deprivation has been the subject of medical, scientific and regulatory inquiry for many years. It is the consensus of the medical and scientific communities that the time has come to apply the knowledge gained by applying it in real operational conditions. 
   That possibility is upon us. Thanks in part to the efforts of one of my constituents, Mr. Donald G. Oren, President of Dart Transit Company of Eagan, Minnesota, a feasibility test has been successfully concluded. This is an exciting development. 
   Recently, the Safety Research Center, Bethesda, Maryland, under the direction of its President, Tony McMahon, together with Stanford University's Sleep Disorders Clinic and Research Center undertook a scientific experiment. William C. Dement, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Psychiatry and 
   Behavioral Sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine, and the director of the Stanford Sleep Disorders Clinic and Research Center, a long-time student of and author on sleep disorders, developed a two-phase approach to developing a solution to driver fatigue. The first is to test and treat individuals for sleep disorders and the second is to teach them how to manage fatigue. 
   Doctors and scientists researching sleep have found that drowsiness results from sleep debt, which is cumulative. There are only two ways to build up a sleep debt: inadequate amounts of sleep and excessively frequent interruption of sleep as occurs in the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and the restless legs syndrome. According to the December 1996 Driver Fatigue and Alertness Study commissioned by the Federal Highway Administration, the two most important factors in driver fatigue are time of day and the amount and quality of sleep received. 
   At the Stanford Sleep Center, drivers from two trucking companies were screened, treated for sleep disorders and trained in how to recognize sleep debt and fatigue and what to do about it. On October 18, 2000, Dr. Dement announced the results of that feasibility study involving nine drivers from Dart Transit, of Eagan, Minnesota, and Star Transport, of Morton, Illinois. The drivers spent two separate sessions of three days each at the sleep research facility at Stanford. Dr. Dement's findings are that effective training will cause behavior change and fatigue avoidance. 
   The next step is to develop a pilot program, which the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, FMCSA, will be asked to undertake. FMCSA possesses the authority to conduct such a pilot program. It will be conducted under strictly controlled exemptions to hours of service regulations. 
   I am told that Clyde Hart, Acting Administrator of FMCSA, believes the idea has merit and is willing to entertain a pilot program proposal. The program will be undertaken by the Safety Research Center, Bethesda, Maryland, and the Stanford Sleep Research Center. It will begin with approximately 40 drivers each from Dart and Star. Screened, treated and trained, they would be exempted from the hours of service regulations (but not total hours that can be driven) to provide maximum flexibility to the trained drivers in managing their time. These drivers would be compared to a control group operating under current hours of service regulations. Assuming that the operations generate positive data, the program would be expanded to other companies. Progress would be evaluated on an ongoing basis and at the end of the three-year program it should be apparent that fatigue management should be a regulatory alternative to current hours of service regulation.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to honor Ms. Katherine Koch-Laveen as Minnesota's Teacher of the Year for the year 2000. This is certainly a high honor, as I note that 98 Minnesota educators were nominated for this award, and their accomplishments were reviewed by 18 judges. It is all the more impressive considering Minnesota's public schools reputation for academic excellence. I also commend the 98 nominees for this honor, 28 of whom were chosen as ``teachers of excellence,'' and 10 of whom were further chosen for an ``honor roll'' of teachers. School teachers that excel at their craft are critically important to the intellectual development of their students, and help shape the student's vision for what they can accomplish in their lives. 
   I still can vividly remember the excellent educators that taught me at Zion Lutheran Christian Day School in Crown. Excellent teachers motivate, show enthusiasm for inquiry, and instill in their students a passion for learning that often continues for a lifetime. A great educator gives the student a core foundation of knowledge about a subject, and a curiosity about the topic that drives a student to study and research more extensively long after they have left that particular class. 
   Great teachers also make sacrifices for their students. It's no secret that in today's high-tech, knowledge-based economy, Ms. Koch-Laveen could probably find a more financially rewarding profession, especially with her science background. And our great teachers need to be rewarded financially, so that we do not lose too many to industry. But ultimately, I have to believe that what keeps them in the classroom is the intangible reward of seeing their students excel, and having a group of students come in to a class with little knowledge about a topic and have them leave with a firm grasp of core concepts, a desire to learn much more, and an excitement to apply what they have learned in ``real world'' situations. And I hesitate to use the term ``real world,'' because these days there is probably nothing more real world than a high school classroom. 
   So congratulations and thank you, Ms. Koch-Laveen, for your commitment to excellence and dedicated service to your students, your community, and to Minnesota. Thanks also to the other hardworking Apple Valley teachers here today that strive for excellence in the classroom and shoulder so much responsibility for Minnesota's future. It has been a pleasure to be here.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today it is my pleasure to pay tribute to the United States Navy as it celebrates the 225th anniversary of its founding. The Navy can be proud of a distinguished heritage, a heritage longer than that of the United States itself. Because of the dedicated service of our nation's sailors, Americans can feel secure that our shores are free from foreign aggression, and the world's oceans and seaways are open for peaceful commerce. The recent terrorist attack on the U.S.S. Cole, resulting in the death or presumed death of 17 sailors, reminds us of the personal risk that the members of our Navy bravely face every day, in peacetime as well as wartime. 
   On October 13, 1775, the Second Continental Congress authorized the acquisition of ships and establishment of a navy. Within a few days, a Naval Committee was established to coordinate the purchase of ships and the recruitment of personnel, and to draft rules regulating the Navy's administration. Although the Continental Navy of the Revolutionary War was rather humble compared to today's Navy--it was made up of only 40 vessels at its peak--it played an important role in the miraculous success of the American Revolution. The Navy was able to seize almost 200 British ships as prizes, including many off the British coast, and this forced the British to divert valuable warships to the protection of transport convoys. It was in one of these raids that the legendary John Paul Jones uttered his immortal words: ``I have not yet begun to fight!'' And this spirit of unflagging courage and selfless discharge of duty has animated the hearts of every sailor since. 
   Our Founding Fathers saw the role of the Navy as important enough to merit specific mention in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, which empowers Congress to ``provide and maintain a Navy.'' As American history has unfolded since then, the U.S. Navy has distinguished itself in every major armed conflict in the history of our country, from the War of 1812 and the Civil War all the way to the Gulf War and the conflict in Kosovo. 
   As we enter the 21st century, the U.S. Navy is without question the preeminent sea power in the world. On October 2, 2000, the active fleet contained 318 ships and 4,108 aircraft, and over 373,000 active-duty personnel filled the Navy's ranks. The U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis provides its midshipmen with an academically rigorous curriculum, and no less important, leadership and character development. This rigorous preparation continues at a more advanced level at the Naval War College, which teaches the latest naval doctrine and strategy to senior and mid-level officers. Thanks to these prestigious institutions, the U.S. Navy boasts the finest and best qualified naval officers in the world, and the ability to face with confidence any challenge to American security. 
   According to the Navy, its mission is to ``maintain, train and equip combat-ready naval forces capable of winning wars, deterring aggression and maintaining freedom of the seas.'' No matter where a sailor serves, whether on an aircraft carrier, submarine, battleship, cruiser, or naval base, his or her contribution is vital to fulfilling this mission. The Navy's worldwide reach allows our country to maintain U.S. national security through dominance of the seas, a dominance made possible by a combination of highly trained service members and highly sophisticated technology. 
   I'd like to take this opportunity to thank in particular those Minnesotans who have served, or are currently serving, in the Navy. I am proud of them, and they should know that their sacrifices on behalf of the cause of freedom are not taken for granted by their friends and neighbors in Minnesota. 
   I'm sure my colleagues will join me in recognizing the rich heritage and  dedicated service of the United States Navy on its anniversary.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today I come to the floor to offer a tribute to a humble man. 
   Yesterday, while I was in Minnesota, I received word that one of my former colleagues from the House of Representatives, Congressman Bruce Vento, had passed away after a battle with cancer. 
   My tribute cannot adequately communicate his successful career, because to Bruce, words always paled in comparison to acts. 
   Bruce was a tireless advocate for the residents of St. Paul, first in the State Legislature and, for the past 24 years, in the U.S. Congress. 
   He was a man of his word and a man of principle. 
   He was a man committed to doing the right thing for the right reason, no matter how long it took. 
   Take for example his work on behalf of Hmong veterans--a large number of whom reside in his Congressional district. 
   He worked on it for over a decade: educating his colleagues about the need to help their constituents and offering the compromises needed to get the job done. 
   I was pleased that after his tireless work Congress after Congress, year after year, Bruce's effort paid off. 
   Earlier this year, Congress passed and the President signed into law his legislation to facilitate citizenship to Hmong veterans who served with us in the Vietnam War. 
   Bruce was an effective Congressman for the St. Paul area. 
   We worked together on a number of fronts to support Minnesota and the people of St. Paul such as improving senior and low-income housing in St. Paul, supporting St. Paul's effort in becoming a Brownfields Showcase Community, and pursuing projects to improve the St. Paul Community. 
   Bruce is best known for his efforts to protect the environment and to improve our national parks and wilderness areas. 
   All Minnesotans will benefit from his work to ensure the outdoor activities we all enjoy will be there for our children and grandchildren. 
   That is his legacy, and we are all proud and grateful for his achievements. 
   Minnesotans were represented well by Bruce Vento, and he will be missed. 
   To his family and friends, I extend my deepest sympathy.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my views toward Federal implementation of the 1996 Telecommunications Act and my support for a strong national rural telecommunications policy. 
   One of the most important responsibilities of a United States Senator is to exercise appropriate oversight of Federal regulatory agencies to ensure sound policy and the wisest use of taxpayers dollars. Toward this end, I have carefully monitored the Federal Communications Commission's implementation of the 1996 Telecommunications Act in an attempt to ensure that this agency follows the intent of Congress in developing a strong national rural telecommunications policy. 
   I am proud to have supported the historic 1996 Telecommunications Act which deregulated the telecommunications industry for the first time in 62 years. I believe this Act has begun to reach its promise of a competitive marketplace, lower prices, and greater consumer choice in services for every American. Since its passage, the telecommunications industry has grown dramatically, creating 230,000 more jobs nationwide, generating an additional $57 billion in revenues, and fostering an environment in which billions of dollars has been invested in telecommunications infrastructure. Despite this promising news, I am very concerned that the FCC's implementation of the Act has stifled the expansion of some of these benefits into rural parts of Minnesota. 
   As a former small businessman, I often hear about the regulatory burdens experienced by my state's entrepreneurs and businesses. As someone who spent 23 years in the broadcasting industry, I also understand their frustration with the far-reaching regulatory authority of the Federal Communications Commission. It has become very clear to me that the administrative and regulatory burdens imposed upon small telecommunications providers reflect the Commission's neglect for the unique needs of rural telecommunications companies and their need for fairer regulatory treatment. 
   The concerns of rural telecommunications companies are underscored in a letter sent to me by Farmers Mutual Telephone Company General Manager Robert Hoffman, who wrote, ``My concern with the FCC is all the additional filings and requirements they are placing on small telephone companies. A couple of years ago we didn't have any filings with the FCC. Now we have about ten annual filings which are confusing and labor intensive, and thus expensive for companies of our size. The FCC has no sympathy for small rural telecommunications companies.'' 
   As my colleagues know, this de-regulatory law has been the subject of litigation from the moment it was enacted due to what many perceive to be the FCC's over-regulatory approach to its implementation. Far too often, the Commission's rules have gone beyond Congressional intent. In particular, I am disappointed by the Commission's implementation of sections of the Act which are intended to preserve universal service assistance and the deployment of advanced telecommunications services. I am sure that my colleagues would agree that universal service assistance is the cornerstone of an effective rural telecommunications policy. 
   In implementing the 1996 Act, the Commission has thus far failed to adhere to the important universal service principles established by Congress under this law. The Act specifically required the joint board on universal service and the FCC to base their universal service policies upon the following principles: the ability of quality services to be provided at just, reasonable and affordable rates; that all regions of the country should have access to advanced telecommunications services; that telecommunications services should be comparable to services in urban areas; and that universal service should be supported by specific and predictable funding mechanisms. Congress should clearly do more to hold the Commission's feet to the fire to ensure that there is proper implementation of universal service support. 
   I have worked hard in Congress to ensure that the decades-long policy of universal service is preserved and advanced and that there are adequate revenues to maintain rural networks. Earlier this Congress, I wrote to FCC Chairman Kennard to express my opposition to any proposal which would transfer authority over the Universal Service Fund to the Department of Treasury. I believe that such an approach would undermine universal service policy and could have an adverse impact upon small telephone carriers and the communities they serve. More importantly, this plan would place the Universal Service Fund at great risk of manipulation by the federal government and the excessive spending habits of Members of Congress. I am pleased that the Administration has finally agreed that is not ``public money'' and has withdrawn this ill-advised plan. 
   I also believe that the Rural Utilities Service telephone loan program is vital to the development of a strong rural telecommunications infrastructure, and an essential component of our national commitment to universal service. I have repeatedly written the Senate Appropriations Committee to urge funding for the Rural Utilities Service telephone loan program. I firmly believe that RUS telephone loans have helped to improve telephone service in rural and high cost areas. Through RUS financing, telephone borrowers have made significant improvements to telecommunications services throughout rural Minnesota. 
   My oversight of the FCC has also included efforts to make it easier for  rural telecommunications carriers to meet the requirements of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or CALEA. In meeting with small telephone carriers from Minnesota earlier this year, I learned about the difficulty many carriers face in meeting the June 30, 2000 CALEA compliance date. I agree that the FCC should grant a blanket extension of the compliance date so that rural carriers will not face a $10,000 penalty for each day that they were not in compliance with CALEA. 
   For these reasons, I was pleased to join this past April with twenty-five of my Senate colleagues in a writing the Commission to urge that it extend the June 30, 2000 CALEA compliance date for software upgrades by small carriers by one year. I regret that the Commission has a different interpretation of the needs of rural carriers in meeting this compliance date. I expect that the Commission's new process by which individual carriers could petition for and receive extensions to comply with CALEA has been time consuming and burdensome for small telephone carriers. I would be supportive of legislative action to address problems with CALEA compliance. 
   During this Congress, I have also worked with the Minnesota Association for Rural Telecommunications and the Minnesota Telephone Association to encourage local phone competition in Minnesota by urging the Commission to address the petition filed by the State of Minnesota in 1997 on whether its ``Connecting Minnesota'' proposal between the state and a private company was consistent with the rights-of-way criteria established through Section 253 of the Act. Not surprisingly, it took the Commission nearly two years to analyze and rule upon the State of Minnesota petition. Rural consumers may witness additional entrants into local television markets following the Federal Communications Commission's decision to deny the petition. 
   Bringing technology to rural areas has always been a top priority for me. As a member of the Congressional Internet Caucus, I have supported policies to address the growing concern in Minnesota about the ``digital divide'' and access to the Internet. High-speed Internet access is a key to improved economic development in rural communities and important to Minnesota's farmers, schools, small businesses, and hospitals. For these reasons, I strongly disagree with the Commission's interpretation of section 706 of the Act which requires the agency to encourage the deployment of high-speed Internet access and other advanced communications services to rural Minnesota. In my view, inaction by the FCC in removing barriers to the deployment of advanced telecommunications services can be overcome through the enactment of incremental proposals that complement marketplace solutions. 
   More specifically, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the ``Universal Service Support Act'' introduced by Senator CONRAD BURNS and endorsed by the National Telephone Cooperative Association. This legislation will lift the regulatory caps imposed upon the Universal Service Fund that limit the amount of support that can be directed to rural telephone companies that serve high-cost areas of our state. These regulatory caps are inconsistent with the de-regulatory framework established by the 1996 Act and an unnecessary barrier to allowing further the further deployment of advanced telecommunications services in rural communities. 
   I believe that we can also prevent rural communities from becoming technology ``have nots'' through repeal of the federal telephone excise tax. The 3 percent telephone excise tax was first established to fund the Spanish-American War of 1898 but has since become an obstacle to community investment in technology. I am proud to be a cosponsor of legislation to repeal this ``Tax on Talking'' and save taxpayers billions annually. 
   There is no single solution to closing the digital divide and I also support S. 2572, the ``Facilitating Access to Speedy Transmission for Networks, E-commerce and Telecommunications Act,'' also known as the ``FASTNET Act.'' This legislation will relieve mid-size telephone companies of excessive reporting requirements that are a barrier to additional company investment in Internet services that would serve rural communities. This legislation was passed unanimously by the House of Representatives and I hope that it will be considered by the Senate soon. Congress should also consider proposals that will authorize the Rural Utilities Service to provide low-interest loans to companies that are deploying broadband technology, as well as legislation that will analyze the feasibility of allowing low power television stations to provide data services to rural areas. 
   As we embark on the 21st Century, it is vital that Minnesota's high-tech businesses serving rural areas are not left behind in our new e-commerce economy. During this session of Congress, I was an early and strong supporter of the enactment of ``E-SIGN,'' electronic signature legislation that will facilitate the growth of electronic commerce into rural Minnesota. This new law grants legal effect to electronic online electronic signatures that will enhance the ability of rural companies to complete business transactions and compete in our emerging digital economy. Rather than spend precious time and resources completing paper transactions, the E-SIGN Act will also allow consumers to pay bills, trade securities, and shop online for a home mortgage and complete the deal by striking a few keys on their computer. 
   Finally, I am proud to have worked with my colleagues on the Senate Banking Committee to pass the ``Launching Our Communities Access to Local Television Act of 2000.'' The LOCAL TV Act would establish a $1.25 billion loan guarantee program to facilitate access to local television programming in rural Minnesota communities. I am very pleased that the Senate unanimously passed my amendment that will ensure that the National Cooperative Finance Cooperation is considered an eligible lender under the proposed loan guarantee program. The CFC is among several private sector lenders which have substantial experience providing multi-million loans in a cooperative environment and which have a track record of projects of this size in rural areas. I am confident that this legislation will be signed into law later this month. 
   I am proud to have worked with consumers and Minnesota's rural telecommunications companies on these issues and other initiatives that will help our state and country to develop a strong rural telecommunications policy.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today I rise to applaud the support the March of Dimes provides for the Campaign for Healthier Babies Month. This month focuses attention on the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation and its many efforts to reduce the more than 150,000 birth defects which occur every year. 
   Debilitating birth defects leave our kids unable to walk, hear, think, or fight off disease. However, with the support of organizations like March of Dimes, community health programs, and especially local advocacy groups, the number of children affected by some 5,000 different types of birth defects continues to steadily decline. Since 1960, infant deaths related to birth defects have been cut in half due to increased awareness and medical advances in both surgery and specialized care in neonatal intensive care units. 
   The March of Dimes Foundation has played a major role in increasing the likelihood that children with birth defects will live to see their first birthday. Over the last decade, scientists have discovered that women who take a daily supplement of B vitamin folic acid in combination with a healthy diet--especially before pregnancy--greatly reduce the chances of their child being affected by birth defects. 
   Another vital step in reducing the chances of birth defects is the accessibility of prenatal care. My own state of Minnesota has one of America's finest health care systems and, as a result, ranks in the top ten states with regard to low birth-weight and infant mortality. But there are many states that are not as fortunate, and I firmly believe recognition of this campaign will help drive change which can have a profound impact on prenatal and perinatal care. 
   In the 105th Congress, the March of Dimes was instrumental in the passage of the Birth Defects Prevention Act, which established the first nationwide network of birth defects monitoring programs. I am confident the law complements March of Dime's efforts in the areas of both alcohol avoidance in preventing Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and the folic acid vitamin supplement program in preventing neural tube defects, NTDs. NTDs are among the most serious and common birth defects in the United States affecting some 2,500 babies each year, and are a result of an underdeveloped brain and spinal cord. The most common NTD is spina bifida, a leading cause of childhood paralysis. 
   Birth defects like these can affect any family. As we head into the new millennium, filled with endless possibilities, I am proud and honored to be able to pay tribute to those whose tireless efforts result in dramatic reductions in the number of birth defects in the United States every year.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a recent alliance which has been made between two internationally recognized biomedical web-portals or web-based information exchanges. This alliance, I believe will have a dramatic impact on the way biomedical information is exchanged and used in developing new medical devices, pharmaceutical products, and life-saving medical techniques. 
   Mr. President, several weeks ago, I, along with my staff, had the pleasure of participating in an event hosted by the Swiss ambassador to the United States, Alfred DeFago, introducing the newly created alliance between MBBNet and Zurich MedNet. 
   MBBNet, a web portal, administered by the University of Minnesota, together with over 900 medical biotech companies and programs, have been the driving forces behind the accumulation and distribution of medical research and open source information for academicians, medical professionals, and corporate researchers in Minnesota and the United States. Zurich MedNet shares the same history, being the largest medical and biotech cluster in Europe. Together these two exchanges, Zurich MedNet and MBBNet by electronically combining resources, are setting international boundaries aside and taking meaningful strides toward the development and improvement of medical education and innovative medical technologies both here in the United States and abroad. I am convinced that alliances like this will help shape the research and development strategies across all industries in the future and I am pleased that Minnesota has again stepped to the fore and provided that kind of leadership. We all stand to benefit. 
   I look forward to other industries following the lead that Zurich MedNet and MBBNet have established, and I believe it is a positive step toward international cooperation others should seek to emulate. Mr. President, I would again like to thank Ambassador DeFago, and my colleagues that have helped and supported this endeavor, and I look forward to doing all I can to ensure the future success of this important alliance.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution along with Senator WELLSTONE which addresses a very tragic event in Kenya involving a native son of Minnesota, Father John Kaiser. 
   Sixty-seven years ago, Father Kaiser was born in Perham, Minnesota and grew up in Maine Township near Fergus Falls. He attended St. John's Prep in Collegeville, along with former Senator Dave Durenberger, and St. John's University. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1964 after attending St. Joseph's Seminary in England. 
   His thirty-six years in the East African country of Kenya was spent building schools and helping the people. He was a strong supporter of human rights and justice for the poor and oppressed. He was their spokesman and a highly visible reminder to the Kenyan government of the injustices he sought to remedy. His courage in the face of death emboldened and strengthened the resolve of others in the human rights community to stand for principle--for law and order, decency and respect. 
   The cattle herders and farmers in the Great Rift Valley, the helpless young girls who may have suffered abuse at the hands of government officials and the dedicated members of Father Kaiser's Mill Hill Mission have lost a champion--but not the principles on which he stood--justice and equity and human rights for all.  
   I have addressed this issue at the highest level with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright during a recent Foreign Affairs Committee meeting. The resolution of this United States citizen's death is important to Kenya's credibility in the world community. We intend to see his assassins quickly brought to trial, and our Resolution reflects the desire of Congress to step-up the investigation into his death. I join Bishop John Njue, Chairman of the Kenyan Catholic Episcopal Conference in saying ``Do not be afraid''--we are with you.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to talk about an issue which has commanded a lot of attention lately in this body, an issue which has been a major concern of mine for a long time. That is, prescription drug coverage under our Medicare program. 
   Prescription drugs, as we all know, are becoming an increasingly important, in fact, an essential component of our health care delivery system in the United States. Because of their increasing role in the improvement of health outcomes, I believe a newly designed Medicare would unquestionably include a prescription drug benefit. Unfortunately, Medicare is still operating under a 1965 model. Our seniors continue to lack this very essential coverage. 
   Over a year ago I introduced the Medical Ensuring Prescription Drugs for Seniors Act, or MEDS, and this role would provide a prescription drug benefit for all Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, and on a volunteer basis. My plan would ensure that our neediest  seniors would get the assistance they need, when they need it, for as long as they need it. And MEDS, as most other plans that have been introduced in the Senate, is a comprehensive, Medicare-based approach and will take a few years to fully implement. 
   Though I fully support MEDS and will fight for its passage, I believe our seniors need some relief now. To that end, I am supporting Senator ROTH's bill, which would send Federal funds back to the States today in order to establish or improve our prescription drug coverage immediately for our seniors and those seniors who need that help and coverage now. 
   I want to be clear, the only way that Congress will be able to address the prescription drug needs of our seniors this year is to pass the Roth proposal. We need to do it. Unfortunately, our friends on the other side of the aisle disagree with that view. They would rather work to push a massive Medicare-based plan which only seems to increase the burden on the majority of seniors through increased premiums, reduced benefits, and more bureaucracy; in other words, create a bigger and bigger government bureaucracy to handle this. 
   I believe it is a backdoor tax increase on our seniors, which is both irresponsible, and it would be totally unacceptable, especially to those who really need the help in the coverage to afford prescriptions. 
   The Democratic proposal, which Vice President AL GORE and others advocate, is frought with a lot of problems. First, his plan would take 8 years to be fully implemented--8 years. The Roth bill would go into effect today. The Vice President's plan would take 8 years to phase in. 
   You don't hear that when they talk about it, do you? But we all know that our seniors cannot afford to wait 8 years, especially the neediest of our seniors' population, to start realizing a prescription drug benefit under our Medicare program. 
   This is a part of the plan that often goes unmentioned and one that needs to be highlighted. Either have a plan now that is immediate and provides help to our seniors today, or pass a plan that costs more, reduces benefits, and asks our seniors to wait 8 years to have it fully implemented under Medicare. 
   The second problem with the proposal is that when it is fully phased in, it will put a new tax on our seniors because it asks for premiums of $600 a year in new additional premiums over and above what they are paying. Above and beyond the fact that many seniors would find that $600 to be cost prohibitive, statistics suggest that the average senior uses only about $675 in prescription drugs in a year. 
   I am not a mathematician by profession, but I can tell you when the proposal only covers 50 percent of the costs of the prescription drugs to begin with--so, in other words, after paying your $600-a-year premium, you have to pay a 50-percent copay on all the drugs you consume, and I believe there is also a cap with it--it means that for the additional $600 premium, again a new tax on our seniors, the average senior would receive at best $37.50 in benefits. 
   Considering the enormous financial burden this is going to place on an already ailing Medicare system, I am not sure the American people are going to want to assume what will inevitably be a new tax liability and at the same time risk the collapse of Medicare in order to prop up a plan that delivers only pennies a year in prescription drug benefits. 
   Because it is a bit politically distasteful, supporters of this plan and similar measures fail to mention the cost of these proposals. They make it sound as if this is going to provide Medicare prescription drug coverage to all seniors at no cost. That is the way they always like to present a lot of these plans, that somehow it is free. I don't know of many seniors out there who believe they are going to get something for nothing. When was the last time they had a free lunch? They know that. Our seniors are smarter than that, but yet they are being told these are things we can provide free. 
   The bill supported by the Vice President and a number of my colleagues will cost nearly $250 billion over the next 10 years. Aside from having to raid either the Social Security or Medicare trust funds to pay for it--and that is how they pay for it. They are going to take money from an ailing trust fund and try to shift it into expanding new benefits and saying nobody has to pay for it but they are basically robbing from Peter to pay Paul and weakening an already weak system. 
   An equally troubling fact is that it does nothing to modernize the Medicare program at all. It is basically just putting a Band-Aid over an old system that has problems; again, trying to bring in a 1965 model and adapt it to the year 2000. When the Medicare Commission actually made these proposals, President Clinton pulled the plug. He did not even consider what this panel was recommending. But thanks to Senators FRIST and BREAUX, they are introducing this plan which makes sense, and that is to overhaul, to reform Medicare, and to make sure prescription drugs are an important part of that. But the Roth bill would be that stopgap in order to provide coverage today for our seniors until we can have a real Medicare reform package. 
   In the absence of these important reforms, this plan offered by the Vice President is nothing more than a prescription for disaster. The funding comes out of the Social Security surplus, which, by the way, the Vice President claims to wall off for only Social Security and only Medicare, but while they are doing that they are trying to expand these services and say it is going to cost nothing. It is a free lunch, a free ride. Nobody believes that can happen. Especially our seniors know that there is no free lunch. Adding new demands on Medicare through the Social Security surplus without reforming the program, again, will only put Medicare further at risk than what it is today. 
   Finally, their proposal provides no flexibility in terms of being able to opt in or opt out of their program. Again, our proposal is voluntary. If it benefits you, you can get into it. 
   If it doesn't benefit you, don't; keep your own coverage as you have it today. But you have a choice. 
   Again, these big government programs, the first thing they want to eliminate is choice for the consumer, and in this case for our seniors. You only have one shot under the Vice President's plan to get in and that is it. Seniors, as they age into Medicare, need to make a determination whether they want to get in and save a few dollars a year at best, into a system that is going to cost them at least $600 a year in more taxes. If they take it and change their mind, it is simply too late; they are stuck. They are either in or they are out. 
   I am happy and proud to have been one of the first to introduce a prescription drug plan in the Senate, and I am hopeful that by having done so, my commitment to this issue and our Nation's seniors is underscored. But, most importantly, I want to ensure that any effort we undertake in Congress will actually help to provide assistance to those who truly need it and provide it sooner rather than later; not with a plan where we are going to try to solve the problems for 6 or 10 percent of the population, but the way they try to solve it is to mandate 100 percent of Americans get involved in their big new bureaucracy for prescription drugs. Importantly, too, my plan does not use the Social Security surplus which I have also secured in a lockbox. 
   I reiterate, I believe our seniors deserve a prescription drug plan that is truly voluntary, one that will not jeopardize the future of Medicare, and one which will not place on the backs of taxpayers any additional burdens or liabilities. Instead, I am hopeful the Senate can pass legislation immediately returning the money to the States to provide relief while strengthening Medicare and implementing the long-term comprehensive benefit that does not result in a new tax on our seniors. We have an historic opportunity to help our Nation's seniors. I believe we should act now, this year. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. My understanding is that in order to be a part of the Vice President's plan of receiving prescription drug coverage, one must pay a $50 premium per month, or new tax, in order to be involved in the system. You have one choice, one chance to get in or you are left out. So you are putting pressure on seniors at whatever age. Then, when you average in what an average senior consumes today in prescription drugs, it is very little if any benefit at all.

<DOCNO>106-grams-mn-9-20001004</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAMS. I disagree with the Vice President--if I may reclaim my time--and I will tell you why. Because, as you said, when it goes into effect in 2002, it is not fully implemented for 6 to 8 years. You might start off with a low payment, but it escalates to $50-a-month premiums fully implemented, and it does provide you have to pay 50 percent, up to $4,000. 
   To compare that with my MEDS plan, we have a $25 copay per month, $300 per year. We do not have a cap for people below 135 percent of poverty. So they will get any amount of drugs for $300 a year compared to the President's $4,000. For some who are on the edge of poverty, they do not have the $4,000, I say to the Senator, to pay for this.

   Mr. GRAMS. Not to belabor this debate, and it is good we are talking about it because the American people need to hear it, but over that amount of money you are talking about, we would still have a $25 copay, the $150 deductible, and then no cap at all on coverage. If you were at that income level, you would probably pay, at most, $175 per month for the whole year or $175 per month per year.

   Mr. GRAMS. Reclaiming my time, not to leave the impression that by any means this is an assault on Medicare, because the plan I have proposed and outlined is handled and complemented through Medicare. I know they like to always say the Republicans are making an assault against Medicare and somehow we want to end the program of providing this help and assistance to millions of seniors across the country. That is simply not true. 
   This plan does nothing to make an assault on Medicare or the benefits it provides today, but it also does not turn a prescription drug program into a national prescription drug program run and handled by the Government, and that is basically my belief of what is outlined here. 
   We will work to preserve and strengthen Medicare, and that includes adding an affordable prescription drug plan that will take care of the neediest of the seniors in our society today. 
   Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the strong partnership between localities and the federal government in preventing crime across the United States. As my colleagues may know, October is recognized as ``National Crime Prevention Month.'' 
   Earlier this year, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that serious crime had declined nationally for the eighth consecutive year. Although many reasons for this promising news can be cited, I believe the efforts of state and local governments have caused a reduction in crime rates. To ensure continued success, the federal government should not impose additional mandates upon local communities that will only prevent the development of effective crime prevention programs. 
   During this session of the 106th Congress, I am pleased to have worked with Minnesota's public safety officials on a number of crime and drug abuse prevention initiatives. Most importantly, I am pleased that the Fiscal Year 2001 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill includes $4 million for the State of Minnesota to develop a statewide computer network that will provide judicial and law enforcement agencies with universal access to critical information about criminal offenders at the time of their arrest, prosecution, sentencing, and during other important proceedings. Information is the key to an effective and accountable criminal justice system. The Minnesota Legislature recently enacted legislation, known as ``Katie's Law,'' that provides state funding for the development of this initiative. 
   I also believe it is essential that Congress do more to ensure that anti-drug resources reach the areas of our country where drug abuse and crime is on the rise and the anti-drug resources of state and local law enforcement have been seriously strained. That is the situation facing law enforcement agencies  in my home state that have worked to combat methamphetamine production and trafficking throughout our communities--particularly in rural areas. 
   For more than a year, I have been working to address the rising methamphetamine drug epidemic in Minnesota by having Minnesota designated as a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, HIDTA. This designation will provide additional anti-meth resources to Minnesota and ensure better coordination of federal-state-local efforts at defeating this threat to public safety. I am pleased that the Fiscal Year 2001 Treasury-Legislative Branch Appropriations bill includes funding for new HIDTA designations, and a directive to the Office of National Drug Control Policy that Minnesota must be among the first states considered for HIDTA designation in the upcoming fiscal year. 
   My rural crime prevention agenda has included strong support for S. 3009, the ``Rural Law Enforcement Assistance Act of 2000.'' The value of this legislation was brought to my attention by St. Cloud State University Professor John Campbell and several Minnesota police chiefs and sheriffs. I greatly appreciate having the benefit of their expertise. The Rural Law Enforcement Assistance Act would provide funding to the National Center for Rural Law Enforcement to expand the technical assistance and training available to rural law enforcement personnel. As a cosponsor of this bill, I am hopeful that rural Minnesota will soon establish a regional center that will bring the benefits of these programs to our state. 
   During National Crime Prevention Month, it is also important to note the impact the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, has had upon the rate of domestic abuse, stalking, and sexual assault across the nation. Since its enactment, the VAWA has provided thousands of communities with assistance to develop innovative and effective programs that have contributed toward protecting individuals from sexual offenses and domestic abuse. 
   In Minnesota, domestic violence shelters and centers have improved their services to victims of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse through such important programs as the Rural Domestic Violence and Child Abuse Enforcement Grant program and funding to combat violence against women on university campuses. Additionally, many domestic abuse victims have benefited from the counseling and guidance provided through the National Domestic Violence Hotline established under the Violence Against Women Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of legislation to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and expect that this legislation will be passed before the 106th Congress adjourns. 
   Finally, I commend the dozens of Minnesota cities that are active participants in the ``National Night Out'' program. These neighborhood residents have sent a strong message to criminals that our neighborhoods are organized and fighting back against the threat of crime. Similar to the TRIAD seniors crime prevention program, National Night Out encourages increased citizen interaction with law enforcement officers to prevent crime. I will continue to be a strong advocate in Congress for the National Night Out and TRIAD programs. 
   I am proud of the active involvement of our citizens in developing innovative crime prevention initiatives. Their commitment to ensuring safer streets and safer communities throughout our state has made Minnesota a better place to work and a better place to call home.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I will talk for a couple of minutes about one of the issues about which I am most passionate, and that is taxes, or the overtaxation of the American people in a time of surpluses, and the refusal of this Congress, this President, to even make an attempt to have meaningful tax cuts or meaningful tax relief before the end of this Congress. 
   In 1997, the Congress passed and the President signed into law my $500-per-child tax credit legislation. As a result, today about 40 million children in this country receive this tax credit every year, and it returns a total of about $20 billion a year in tax savings to families. That is money that families can use for savings for their children's education, for day care, for tutors, for braces, a new washer, dryer--anything--a family vacation. But it is what the family decides to spend their hard-earned money on, rather than waiting for a handout from Washington. 
   In fact, for the first time since the 1980s, this tax credit and other Republican-initiated tax cuts have reduced the tax burden for low- and middle-income families. I have heard many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle bragging about how some people in the United States are paying less taxes today--and that is true--but it is mainly true because of the $500-per-child tax credit, nothing else that this administration or this Congress has done. 
   Despite this tax credit, the total tax burden is still way too high for working Americans. Today, let's look at an average two-income family. The median two-income family pays $26,759 in Federal, State, and local taxes. Let's compare this with back in 1992. Those taxes were $21,320 a year--a 26-percent increase in the tax burden for average families in just the last 8 years of the Clinton administration. That is according to the Nonpartisan Tax Foundation. To date, $26,759; 8 years ago, $21,320. 
   That shows the increase in taxes to the median-income family--not the rich of this country. They are paying more in taxes, as well. But it is the average working family that is paying the brunt of the tax increases imposed by this administration. Again, that is according to the Nonpartisan Tax Foundation. Total taxes nationwide claim 39 percent of hard-earned income, and that is more than the typical family in this country pays for food, clothing, shelter, and transportation combined. 
   In the past few years, over 20 million Americans earning between $30,000 and $50,000 have been pushed from the 15-percent tax bracket into the 28-percent tax bracket due to our unfair tax system. They are paying almost twice as much for those incomes, pushed from the 15-percent to the 28-percent tax bracket. As low-income and minimum wage workers work harder and pay more, their payroll taxes also increase, taking a huge bite out of their hard-earned dollars--dollars that I believe are desperately needed to keep those families above the poverty line. 
   Taxes collected by the Federal Government have reached 20.6 percent of all national income. That is the highest level 
   since World War II. The government takes one-fifth of every dollar produced in this country every year. In the next 10 years, working Americans will pay taxes that will contribute to an over $2.2 trillion non-Social Security surplus. This non-Social Security surplus will be $2.2 trillion and that is even after assuming government spending is increasing along with the level and rate of inflation. This non-Social Security surplus comes from increased personal taxes and the realization of our capital gains taxes. 
   I believe this money should be returned to working Americans in the form of some tax relief, debt reduction, and also Social Security reform. Yes, overtaxed American families still need tax relief today. I believe using some of the non-Social Security surplus to expand the $500-per-child tax credit is one of the right things to do because Washington, again, is taking more taxes from American families at a time when it doesn't need the money as bad as families do. 
   I have repeatedly argued in this Chamber that the family has been and will continue to be the bedrock of our society. Strong families make strong communities, strong communities make for a strong America, and our tax policies should strengthen families and should be there to reestablish the value of families. 
   Between 1960 and 1985, Federal taxes on American families increased significantly. For families with 4 children, the Federal income tax rate increased 223 percent; for families with two children the rate increased 43 percent. The inflation-adjusted median income for families with children also decreased between 1973 and 1994. So its income was going down and taxes were still going up. 
   While the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act, which included my $500-per-child tax  credit, has helped to change this situation, there is still room for improvement, a lot of room for a lot of improvement. For example, combined with the dependent exemption, the tax benefits for families raising children still falls well below both the inflation-adjusted value of the original dependent exemption, and also the actual cost of raising children according to Minnesota's Children Defense Fund. 
   In addition, this child tax credit and the income threshold for families qualifying for credit are not indexed for inflation. As a result, the value of this child tax credit would also shrink in the future and fewer families would qualify for the credit. 
   That is why I am introducing tonight legislation aimed at expanding the tax credit. My legislation would increase the tax credit from $500 per child to $1,000, and it would be adjusted for inflation every year. It would also index the income threshold for families qualifying for this tax credit. 
   While I strongly support this increase as well as the marriage penalty repeal and getting rid of the death tax, the only way we will achieve meaningful tax relief is to reform our entire tax system completely. Even my legislation today, I look at as just an interim step toward this very essential goal of having a tax system that is simple, fair, and easy to understand. 
   With these proposed improvements we would allow overtaxed working families with children to keep a little bit more of their own money--give them the opportunity to spend it on their own priorities, not looking for a handout from Washington, not saying they need another program from Washington, not that they want another big government approach--but allowing them to keep some of their dollars so they can make the determination on how they want to spend their money, a little bit more of their own money, to spend on their own priorities. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. GRAMS. The Senator from Alabama is right. If we look at it, at a time of overtaxation, when American workers are getting up every morning, working hard, and sending this money to Washington, and then it is overtaxed--we are not talking about cutting taxes at all. We are talking right now about returning some of the surplus to make sure those people who worked hard and produced this windfall get it back. 
   We tell our children: If you find a wallet on the street with $1,000 dollars in it, the first thing you should do is try to return it to the owner. Make sure you give the money back. Washington has found a wallet with $2.2 trillion in it, and they won't give it back. They are trying to find a way to spend it. I think our hard-working families deserve some tax credit along with debt reduction and securing Social Security, rather than leaving it for the big spenders in Washington to decide how they want to divvy up and dole out their money.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I offer today legislation entitled the ``Consumer Rights in Federal Class Actions Act of 2000.'' It is designed to incorporate checks upon the abuses of class action law that has led to an increasing number of suits where the primary benefit accrues to the attorney, and not the class represented. The bill also takes steps to ensure that attorney fees in class action resolutions are in proportion to the benefits that actually accrue to the class. 
   The last few years have seen the rise of ``coupon settlements'' in class action suits, in which attorneys reap literally hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees while the class members merely receive coupons for discounts on later purchases. For instance, in one well-known airline price-fixing settlement, class members received coupons in $8, $10, and $25 denominations which could not be pooled. In another class action settlement, a manufacturer was sued because its dishwashers caught on fire under conditions of normal use. Under the settlement, customers were provided coupons to purchase replacement dishwashers from the very same maker. So not only are the trial lawyers hitting the jackpot for themselves, but the defendants in many coupon settlements actually receive the benefit of a promotional tool for their products. These types of deals only further erode the credibility of our judicial system. 
   Moreover, notices to class members are so densely worded and difficult to slog through that they are routinely ignored, and the class action attorneys are free to proceed and negotiate without true accountability to their supposed clients. The idea of attorneys working for the benefit of their clients has been turned on its head, and now in many class action lawsuits class members exist for the benefit of the lawyer, and the lawyer walks away from the table with a large fee while the class members receive next to nothing. 
   The Senate Judiciary Committee has recently addressed the problem of ``coupon settlements'' with S. 353, the Class Action Fairness Act, which would move more large, multi-state claims into federal court where there has been more vigilance in reviewing class action certifications and settlements. This is an important reform, but I think we can take specific steps that go beyond this reform to cut down on the number of ``coupon settlements'' in class action lawsuits. 
   The first reform in my bill requires that the attorney filing the class action lawsuit file a pleading, including a disclosure of the recovery sought for class members and the anticipated attorney's fees, along with an explanation of how any attorney's fees will be calculated. This will give the court and the public notice of what the attorney is actually attempting to accomplish with the litigation for the class, and for themselves. 
   The second reform would require that, after a proposed settlement agreement has been filed by the parties, counsel for the class shall provide notice to the class members of the expected benefits they will receive, the rights they will waive through the settlement, the fee amount class counsel will seek, an explanation of how the attorney fee will be calculated and funded, and the right of any class member to enter comments into the court record about the proposed settlement 
   terms. This will give class members a  more thorough knowledge about what they will receive in the settlement compared to what the attorney would receive, and will provide the court a mechanism for receiving comments from the class about the proposed settlement terms before rejecting or approving the agreement. 
   The third reform would require a regular, continuing disclosure as to how many members of the class are participating in the settlement. One of the dirty secrets of coupon settlements is that the benefits to the class are often of such minimal value that the class members do not even bother to take the steps necessary to receive the benefit, making the high fees received by the attorneys even more outrageous. Some settlements even offer cash recoveries to class members that are so minimal that it is not worth their time to recover the funds. The required disclosure will be via Internet so that the public and legal researchers can access the information, and also will be mailed directly to the class members for their information and use. 
   The final reform is that Congress will authorize a report by the Judicial Conference of the United States on ways to correct a particular abuse by class action lawyers in which they use polling surveys of the class to determine how many class members would utilize the settlement, and then submit it to the court as evidence for determining an appropriate fee. Courts have indeed used these tools to determine fees, however, the polling numbers regularly overestimate class utilization of the settlements by a wide margin, leading to inflated fee awards for class attorneys. My legislation directs the Conference to make recommendations to ensure that attorneys receive fees that are commensurate with the degree that the lawsuit benefits the class. The Judicial Conference is also directed to make recommendations affecting the broader topic of ensuring that proposed class action settlements are fair to the class members for whom the settlements are supposed to benefit. 
   My legislation will expose the trial bar to greater scrutiny in lawsuits that are filed primarily to line their own pockets, give class members greater rights in assessing the settlement offers, and set in motion other reforms that will put attorneys fees in line with the benefit they bring to the class. This is a true consumers' rights bill that will cut down on the abuses by the trial bar and shed more light on who is actually being benefited by these lawsuits. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense reform.

Having recognized the value of these organizations, the Department of the Navy requested the Navy League to establish a similar program for American youth. 
   Since their creation in 1958--and their federal incorporation by Congress in 1962--the Naval Sea Cadets Corps has encouraged and aided American youth ages 13-17, training them in seagoing skills and instilling within them patriotism, courage, and commitment. By teaching America's youth the important role of maritime service in national defense and economic stability, the Corps has produced responsible and capable leaders. Weekly and monthly drills at local units and more intensive two-week training sessions, stress physical fitness, seamanship, shipboard safety, first aid, naval history, and leadership while advanced training sessions range from a submarine seminar to aviation school. Thanks in part to this training, Sea Cadets demonstrate the leadership skills and responsibility that allow them to excel and become leaders in their communities. 
   I wish to pay special tribute to LT Lance Nemanic and the Twin Cities Squadron of the Sea Cadets, for their dedicated service to Minnesota's Youth. I would also like to thank those men and women who continue to make the U.S. Sea Cadets Corps the pride of the Navy.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Veterans of Foreign Wars on the 101st anniversary of its founding, which is to be celebrated this Friday, September 29, For over a century, the men and women of the VFW and the VFW Ladies Auxiliary have worked tirelessly to ensure that veterans are treated with the respect they deserve. 
   The Veterans of Foreign Wars can trace its origins to 1899, with the founding of several local organizations composed of veterans of the Spanish-American War and the Philippine Insurrection. Members of these organizations were interested in securing medical care and pensions related to their military service. Over the next few years, these groups took part in a series of mergers, until by 1913 a single group calling itself ``the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States'' was formed. The VFW was chartered by the U.S. Congress in 1936. 
   According to the VFW, which is headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri, eligibility requirements for membership include ``military service on foreign soil or in hostile waters in a campaign for which the U.S. government has authorized a medal.'' This has been a particularly war-torn century, and America has provided leadership in many of our century's conflicts, so a great many Americans meet these requirements. And a great many Americans have taken advantage of the benefits of membership: at this time, almost 2 million men and women belong to the VFW, including over 72,000 in my home state of Minnesota. The VFW pursues a number of goals through its many programs and services, which are aimed at strengthening comradeship among its members, perpetuating the memory and history of our fallen soldiers, fostering patriotism, defending the Constitution, and promoting service to our communities and our country. 
   The VFW also works to advance legislation benefiting veterans, their dependents and survivors. One of its main legislative goals, and one that's very near and dear to my own heart, is ensuring that Congress maintains an adequate budget for veterans' health care. The VFW also fights to make a full range of employment and educational opportunities available to veterans after they exit the service. And through its goals of an open national cemetery in every state, the VFW is honoring our nation's heroes in death no less than in life. Through these and other activities, the VFW is working hard to make sure that our nation lives up to its sacred commitment to those who have given freedom to America and the world by giving so much of themselves. 
   As a nation, we are duty-bound to pass on the experiences of America's veterans, and their brothers and sisters who didn't come home, to future generations. Through the sacrifices of our servicemen and women, freedom and prosperity flourish. The Veterans of Foreign Wars does the vitally important work of making sure that these sacrifices will never be forgotten.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the month of September as Baby Safety Month. This year's theme, ``Good Night, Sleep Tight,'' stresses crib safety. As a grandparent, I experienced the tragic loss of my grandson Blake on March 30, 1995, when he passed away from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, or SIDS. My experience, and the experiences of the many others I have met since then who faced similar losses, have helped heighten for me the importance of doing everything we can to ensure the safety of an infant. 
   A baby brings so much joy and excitement into a family, along with a new perspective on life. Of course, a birth also means a host of baby products coming into the home--everything from a car seat and safety locks on cabinet doors, to a crib. Experts recommend parents do not use second-hand products because of the safety standards new baby products have to meet. However, if older products are used, parents should make certain they do not have loose or missing parts. 
   The most important thing parents can do for the safety of their baby is to supervise them carefully, especially when they are using juvenile products. Baby products are designed for safe use, but not as a substitute for parental supervision. For more than 20 years, the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association has been helping parents keep their babies safe from harm by certifying juvenile products and working with the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM), a nonprofit organization, to inform and educate the American public on safe products. 
   Research has told us that normal, healthy infants should ALWAYS sleep on their backs unless otherwise advised by a pediatrician. Consulting their pediatrician and using a safe crib that meets current federal and ASTM standards will help parents feel comfortable placing their babies to sleep. Despite all the precautions, however, nearly 50 babies suffocate or strangle themselves each year in cribs with unsafe designs. During Baby Safety Month, JPMA provides promotional materials at retail outlets to help promote crib and baby safety to every new parent. 
   Since the death of my grandson, I have been privileged to get to know the men and women of the Minnesota SIDS Center, which serves Minnesotans by working to prevent SIDS and helping families who have suffered a loss due to SIDS. They are doing important work, and their efforts are very much appreciated. The Minnesota SIDS Center and other organizations have helped reduce SIDS rates by 43 percent by spreading the word to parents that putting infants to sleep on their backs has been proven to reduce SIDS deaths in some cases. The lives of more than 1,500 infants are being spared each year. That is exciting news. Even with the recent progress, though, SIDS claims nearly 3,000 lives every year and remains the leading cause of death for infants between one month and one year of age. Clearly, there is still much more we need to learn. 
   Mr. President, I hope every parent, new and expecting, takes the necessary precautions to prevent all potential risks to the safety of their baby. I would also like to thank those at the Minnesota SIDS Center and similar organizations across America who are working hard to improve the safety of every baby, thereby ensuring that ``Good Night, Sleep Tight'' is more than just another catchy slogan.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize September 22 as American Business Women's Day. On this day in 1949, the American Business Women's Association (ABWA) was founded as a support organization for women either entering or already in the workforce. The ABWA was founded by Mr. Hilary A. Bufton, Jr., a Missouri business owner who realized the positive economic impact women can have in the workplace. 
   American Business Women's Day won national attention after passage of a congressional resolution in 1983 and 1986, and President Ronald Reagan issued a proclamation granting it official recognition. Today, American Business Women's Day gives every American an opportunity to recognize the vital contributions women are making to this nation. 
   Women have long played a vital role in America's workforce. As scientists, elected officials, presidents of companies, and small business owners, in every job category in every profession upon which this nation depends, women take key roles in all facets of business. Some 27.5 million women work in the 9.1 million women-owned businesses in the United States, representing 38 percent of all businesses and generating over $3.6 trillion in annual sales. Consisting of nearly 48 percent of the overall workforce in the United States, more than 61 million  working women continue to prove their excellence with the positive influence they have on America's growing economy. 
   These women are rightly concerned about the critical issues in Congress that affect their ability to work and provide for their families, at the same time they are often trying to balance the competing demands of business and family. The tax burden, for example, imposes a marriage penalty on women who choose to get married, which in turn often forces both spouses to take jobs just to meet their annual tax obligations. And that, of course, ultimately forces families to spend less time together. The estate tax, or ``death tax,'' severely limits the ability of a business owner to pass along her business to her children, and often results in that business having to be sold upon her death. Social Security discriminates against women, especially those who are forced to return to the workforce after the death of a spouse, or who choose to work part time while raising a family. Obsolete federal laws restrict the ability of employers to offer flexible working arrangements. For example, a week in which a working mother must stay home with a sick child cannot legally be ``balanced'' with the hours of the following week, when a lighter home schedule means a worker could spend extra hours on the job. 
   At the urging of thousands of Minnesota's working women, these are concerns I have worked hard to address. We have made progress--the $500 per-child tax credit I authored is helping ease the family tax burden--but much work remains. 
   The American Business Women's Association has recognized 10 influential women each year since 1953 for their stellar achievements and contributions to the American work force. I am proud to mention that Ms. Leslie Hall from Rochester, MN, is one of the 10 finalists for the year 2001. Ms. Hall is an associate of clinical microbiology at the Mayo Clinic, who was recognized in 1998, for her scientific work in mycology as the recipient of the Billy H. Cooper Memorial Award. I congratulate her for her many achievements. 
   Mr. President, I am honored to be able to stand here today and pay tribute to every woman in my home state of Minnesota and across America who has contributed to our nation's economic prosperity and innovation. They have my sincere thanks.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill to clarify the tax exemption status for small property and casualty insurance companies. These small companies are vitally important to provide needed services for our rural and farming communities. 
   Under current law, an insurance company with up to $350,000 in premium is tax-exempt. In addition, companies with premiums that exceed $350,000 but do not exceed $1,200,000 are allowed to elect to be taxed on their net investment income. 
   Investment income or assets are not considered when determining qualification for either tax-exempt status or investment income taxation. These companies are allowed to elect to be taxed on their net investment income. 
   Early this year, President proposed in his FY 2001 budget to modify this calculation to include investment and other types of income. The proposal would also change the tax law to allow companies with premiums below $350,000 to elect to be taxed on their net investment income. 
   By including investment income into the calculation, it is the intent of the administration to prohibit foreign companies and other large insurers from sheltering income from taxes. 
   However, by including investment into the calculation, the intended beneficiaries, small property and casualty insurance companies, will not be able to qualify for the exemption defeating the intent of Congress and purpose for the provision. 
   Mr. President, since 1921, small insurance companies have been exempt from federal taxation so that all their financial resources could be used for claims paying. 
   It has been the public policy goal to maintain small, rural, farm-oriented insurers so that all Americans would have access to coverage at a reasonable cost. 
   While the administration's goal of closing the loophole is admirable, the current proposal would only serve to harm the small U.S. farm insurance company that the provision is there to protect. 
   My legislation would close the loophole by limiting the provision to only those companies that are directly owned by their policyholders and the company operates in only one state. 
   In addition, the legislation would increase the tax exemption level from $350,000 to $531,000, indexed for inflation every year thereafter, and it would increase the investment income election from $1.2 million to $1.8 million, indexed for inflation every year thereafter. 
   The last time these levels were increased was 1986. Inflation has eroded the levels to the point of being irrelevant. The increased levels were calculated by using the CPI to adjust the levels for inflation. 
   Mr. President, by making these changes we can ensure that our rural and farming communities will continue to receive the needed insurance services. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, in a brief colloquy on an extremely important flood reduction project. As the Chairman may recall, I have been a strong proponent of the ongoing Breckenridge flood reduction project in Breckenridge, Minnesota. I am pleased that the Chairman has agreed that this existing flood control project should continue to proceed expeditiously. As a result of the 1997 floods, the city of Breckenridge experienced over $30 million in flood related damages. That flood cost the Federal Government millions of dollars in expenditures for advanced measures for flood fighting, flood emergency actions during the flood, and post-flood cleanup and recovery efforts at Breckenridge. 
   After the 1997 flood, the city has taken numerous actions to protect themselves from future catastrophic flooding. Such actions include the acquisition of many flood prone properties; local design and construction of new local flood levees at selected areas; initiation of a partnership between the Corps of Engineers, the city, and the State of Minnesota for a cost-shared Section 205 Feasibility Study to define an implementable Federal flood reduction project. 
   The city of Wahpeton, North Dakota is located immediately across the Red and Bois de Sioux Rivers from Breckenridge and is therefore strongly inter-related from a hydraulic and social perspective. Wahpeton has also entered into a separate cost-shared Section 205 flood reduction study for protecting their city. The flood protection plans now formulated for Wahpeton and Breckenridge are interdependent with each project relying on flood control features to be implemented by their sister city. If Wahpeton moves forward before Breckenridge, then Breckenridge could experience even more flooding. The two projects should proceed together. Therefore, in order for either project to move forward through completion these separate Federal flood reduction projects must both be constructed expeditiously. The timing associated with construction of each project will affect the implementation options and costs for each project. 
   I would like to continue to work with the Chairman as this bill goes to conference in providing further assurances that this existing flood control project be constructed as quickly as possible so that the city of Breckenridge can be protected from future flooding.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize September as National Library Card Sign-up Month and pay tribute to those dedicated individuals who, through their passion for books and learning, make our libraries places of great discovery. 
   As school begins for millions of children this month, parents and mentors are coming together to promote one of the most important school supplies, one available free to every child: a library card. With the support of the American Library Association, National Library Card Sign-up Month spotlights the wealth of resources found at our local public libraries. Libraries not only offer books, magazines, and reference materials, but many also provide CDs, videos, and Internet connections to assist children and adults meet their educational goals. 
   There is no better place than our libraries for bringing the world and the events that shape it--past and present--to life. Fortunately, a child doesn't need any special gadgets to experience all the library has to offer; they just need their library card. A library card can open the doors to space exploration, put a reader in the front seat with a storm chaser, transport anyone with a good imagination back thousands of years in time, and offer every imaginable point of view on every topic of interest. 
   Mr. President, during National Library Card Sign-up Month, I commend America's schools and libraries for providing and promoting an environment that sparks a passion in people of all ages for books and learning. And I urge parents and teachers alike to share their knowledge and passion for learning with our children by signing them up for library cards at the local public library.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to the United States Air Force as it celebrates its 53rd anniversary. For more than half a century, the men and women of the Air Force, through their dedicated service and sacrifice, have helped to ensure the freedom and security of America and the world. 
   Although military aviation in this country had its beginnings in the Army, less than four years after the Wright brothers made their historic first flight, it was not until 1947 that the Air Force was established as a separate branch of the armed services. 
   The birth of the Air Force itself can be traced to 1907, when the Aeronautical Division of the U.S. Army Signal Corps was organized. In 1935, the General Headquarters was established, and the Air Corps gained control of tactical units under General Frank Andrews, after whom Andrews Air Force Base was named. Between the years of 1939 and 1945, this organization was known as the Army Air Force and was led by the legendary General Henry ``Hap'' Arnold. In March 1942, the Army Air Force became coequal with the Army ground forces, a major step in the evolution of the Air Force. 
   Chief Army officers such as Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower witnessed firsthand the vital role played by air power in World War II, and foresaw the increasing importance of air power in future conflicts. Military leaders recognized that the growing strategic significance of aircraft made necessary the creation of an additional military branch, alongside the Army, Navy, and Marines, and in 1947 the National Security Act made the Air Force an autonomous military power. 
   Over the course of its illustrious history, the Air Force has taken on additional responsibilities, extending its reach beyond the atmosphere into space. In 1956, it was put in charge of all land-based ballistic missile systems. The first missile under the control of the Air Force--the Atlas ballistic missile--was made operational in September 1959. By 1965, the Air Force was responsible for the development of satellites, boosters, space probes, and other systems used by NASA. According to former Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Ronald R. Fogleman, America is safer in a dangerous world because of what the Air Force brings to our nation's defense: ``long range lethal combat power ..... strategic mobility ..... global awareness that comes from space assets, and ..... theater air dominance.'' This has been made possible through a combination of highly trained service members and highly sophisticated technology. 
   Thanks to the Air Force, the lives of American servicemen and women in all military branches are safer than ever before during times of conflict. Military aircraft are now able to achieve many military objectives that once required ground troops, and American  casualties are greatly reduced as a result. The amazing performance of the Air Force in the Persian Gulf War, which by all accounts dramatically reduced the number of American lives lost in that conflict, shows just how much we all owe our brave airmen. 
   In addition to its critical defense role, the Air Force has been highly active in humanitarian and relief efforts over the years. One of the most famous of these undertakings was the Berlin airlift between June 1948 and June 1949. The largest airlift/evacuation in American history occurred in 1991 when the Air Force moved 52,000 military personnel and dependents from the Philippines to the U.S. following the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. An airlift in February of 1992 provided food and medicine to Russia in Operation Provide Hope. Operation Provide Promise, a relief effort into Sarajevo in 1992, was the longest sustained humanitarian airlift in history. The Air Force has also been involved in hundreds and hundreds of other relief missions all over the world in response to earthquakes, hurricanes, and other natural disasters. 
   I would like to take this opportunity to note the contributions made by Minnesotans and those men and women serving at Minnesota's Air Force bases. These airmen have made a vital contribution to the success of the Air Force over the past 53 years. I would like to thank in particular those serving at Minnesota's Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard facilities, specifically the airmen of the 934th Airlift Wing and 133rd Airlift Wing in Minneapolis and the 148th Fighter Wing in Duluth who keep our C-130s and F-16s flying. These men and women deserve our thanks for making sure that we will always be prepared to face with confidence any future threats to our nation's security. 
   On behalf of all Minnesotans, I thank the members of the Air Force for their selfless devotion to our nation's defense. Throughout the history of the Air Force, its members have made countless sacrifices for their country, from the financial struggles all too often faced by service members and their families, to the high price paid by those who have been wounded, taken prisoner, or killed in battle. A grateful nation will always be in their debt. 
   I'm sure my colleagues will join me in recognizing the rich heritage and dedicated service of the United States Air Force on its anniversary.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I wanted to take time before leaving for the weekend to be here to express my strong disappointment with President Clinton and his Democratic allies in the Congress who have once again denied millions of American couples marriage penalty relief. 
   On August 5, President Clinton vetoed the Marriage Tax Penalty Relief Reconciliation Act. This week, due to strong opposition from some of our Democrat colleagues, the House fell 16 votes short of the number needed to override the President's veto, thus letting down 22 million American couples, including 550,000 couples from my state of Minnesota. 
   These hard-working Americans are penalized, on average, $1,500 per year simply because they are married. This $32 billion annual tax burden is extremely unfair to these working men and women. 
   Washington is taking this money from American couples at a time when it doesn't need the money as much as these families do. This money could be used for savings for their children's education, for daycare, for tutors, for braces, for a new washer/dryer, for a family vacation, or for a down payment on a car. 
   For President Clinton and his Democrat allies in the Congress to deny working men and women this desperately needed tax relief is not only wrong, it is a disgrace. 
   It is shameful that their spending appetite is growing bigger each year and faster than the incomes of American workers and all of the people across this country who simply choose to get married, start a family, to begin their lives together, and at the altar they have the IRS standing with them. 
   Since 1969, our tax laws have punished married couples. There are more than 60 provisions in the tax code that penalize working American couples by pushing them into 
   a higher tax bracket, punishing them because of their decision to be joined in holy matrimony. 
   This was not the intention of Congress when it separated tax schedules for married and unmarried people. It also runs contrary to our often-stated desire to strengthen the institution of the family in America a desire that was reaffirmed with the enactment of my $500 per child tax credit legislation. 
   The family has been, and will continue to be, the bedrock of our society. Strong families make strong communities; strong communities make for a strong America. We all agree that this marriage penalty tax treats married couples unfairly. 
   President Clinton himself agrees that the marriage penalty is unfair. He has said that. He believes the marriage penalty tax is unfair, but he vetoed a bill that, by the way, was a compromise, calling into question his resolve to reverse this inequity that he called unfair. But evidently the President believes it is more important for Washington to collect unfair taxes than it is to give tax breaks to working Americans. He uses any and all excuses he can find to keep as many dollars as possible coming into the Government's coffers. Even at a time of huge surpluses, he refuses to let American couples keep a little bit more of their own money. 
   We are not even talking tax cuts; all we are talking about is tax overcharges that should be returned. If you overpay a bill, you expect to get your change back. If you go to McDonald's and the meal is $5 and you give them $10, you expect to get your change back--or for any kind of a transaction. In this transaction, you should be able to expect to get your money back. On a marriage penalty which is unfair, you should at least be able to get your refund. But despite the rhetoric of this administration suggesting otherwise, the Clinton and Gore administration and its Democratic allies in Congress are not serious about correcting this unfair tax penalty. 
   Out of eight budgets the Clinton/Gore administration proposed, only one included a tiny bit of relief for married couples. Their paltry marriage penalty relief means millions of couples would not receive the tax relief they want and need. In fact, the President's plan was less than 25 percent of the plan that was sent to him, which would mean that out of 100 couples, he would say 75 married couples don't deserve tax relief even though they are unfairly taxed. A minor, paltry tax relief was proposed by this administration. 
   Today, families pay more in taxes than they do for food, clothing, and shelter combined. Something is wrong when parents work more to provide for the government than they do for their own families. It is time for the government to contribute to the strengthening of the family, rather than aiding its breakdown. 
   There is no legitimate policy reason to continue punishing millions of American couples through this unfair marriage penalty. 
   By denying Americans marriage penalty tax relief, President Clinton and his Democrat allies in the Congress have shown that they care less about working couples who are struggling to raise families. They care more about dumping money into Washington's coffers. By continuing this bad tax policy that discourages marriage, they will force millions of married couples to pay more taxes to support a big government rather than being able to provide better for American families. 
   By denying Americans marriage penalty tax relief, President Clinton and his Democrat allies in Congress have chosen to continue to discriminate against working women. Since more and more women work today, their added incomes drive their households into higher tax brackets unfairly, reducing their take-home pay. 
   By denying Americans marriage penalty tax relief, President Clinton and his Democrat allies in Congress have done harm to the minority, low-income families whom they claim to help, because the marriage penalty hits lower-income working families hardest. 
   This is not a tax cut for the rich, as this administration always loves to say. Anytime there is any tax relief out there, it is always somehow for the rich. But this hits hard-working, middle-class, middle-income families. 
   In fact, President Clinton has denied relief for couples at the bottom end of the income scale who incur penalties. As a result of the marriage penalty, they paid nearly $800 in additional taxes, which represents 8 percent of their income. 
   So what about that? This is not tax relief for the rich. 
   By denying Americans marriage penalty tax relief, President Clinton and his Democrat allies in Congress have undermined the family the institution that is the foundation of our society by discouraging women from marriage, or even leading some married couples to get friendly divorces. 
   This is just plain wrong. 
   To President Clinton and Vice President GORE, I would consider asking you once again to put aside the election-year politics and reconsider your veto on our marriage penalty tax relief that would help millions of couples live the American Dream. I would ask that. But I know it would be a waste of time. And so do millions of Americans. I know and they know we'll have to wait for a President that is more sympathetic to those who work everyday rather than big government. 
   To ask this President to reduce or sign this bill I guess would be a waste of time, because I believe, as do millions of Americans, that we will not see one dime of tax relief as long as he is in the White House. We need another President who is going to be more sympathetic to those who pay the bills. I always call them the most used and abused and underappreciated people in the country. That is the people who pay the bills--the taxpayers. 
   To the 44 million Americans, including 1.1 million Minnesotans, who suffer from this unfair penalty, I want to pledge that we will repeal this marriage tax bill next year and we will not rest until our Tax Code becomes truly family friendly. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to remind my colleagues that today is National POW/MIA Recognition Day. On this occasion, we should remember and pay tribute to the 2,005 soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen who are still missing and unaccounted for, and we stand in solidarity with their loved ones and families. I am humbled by, and grateful for their love of country and sense of duty and honor. 
   It is difficult not to feel uneasy amidst the mixture of somber thoughts and feelings of gratitude and pride that this day brings. Uneasy, because, while we are a nation at peace and the wars in which these men fought are long over, they have not all returned home. 
   These Americans swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution, and with great personal sacrifice, carried through on that promise to their nation. Undoubtedly, many endured years in starved, tortured, isolated misery. Their integrity and heroism are examples of the core values on which this nation was founded. 
   Today, I want to pay special tribute to the dedication and service of the soldiers from my home State of Minnesota who are or were POW/MIAs from the Vietnam war and the Korean war. 
   These great Americans and their families have the gratitude of this free Nation. Yet, we must not rest until all American POW/MIAs are returned and accounted for, and the many questions that have overwhelmed their families are answered. I urge the Senate, the administration, the Departments of Defense and State, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the National Security Agency to redouble their efforts to bring our soldiers home as quickly as possible. Let us all take heart from the POW/MIA flag, which is displayed every day in the Capitol rotunda and which I display proudly in my offices. ``You Are Not Forgotten.''

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today I rise to draw attention to a vital service upon which many older Americans depend: assisted living. I also want to pay tribute to those who work in this nation's assisted living facilities and dedicate their lives to making someone else's life a little easier. 
   Grandparents Day--Sunday, September 10--marks the beginning of the sixth annual National Assisted Living Week (September 10-16), sponsored by the National Center for Assisted Living. This year's theme is ``The Art of Life,'' highlighting the creative new ways in which seniors are expressing themselves as they strive to maintain their independence and autonomy. 
   In the U.S., nearly 28,000 assisted living facilities accommodate more than 1.15 million people by providing supervision, assistance, and health care services. The need for assisted living services is growing with the rapidly increasing elderly population in America. Advances in medicine and technology have dramatically extended the ability of seniors to live independent lives without the need for assistance with daily functions. However, as seniors live longer, more of them eventually discover they need a helping hand in order to maintain the lifestyle to which they have become accustomed--a lifestyle they should not have to give up simply because they are growing older. 
   Just as we are full of excitement from new challenges in our adolescence, in our later years, after retirement, we recognize that we cannot do it all ourselves. The difficult task is understanding when, after many years of easy mobility in life, an individual needs assistance. National Assisted Living Week promotes not only an increased quality of life for the elderly, but builds a team and network to accomplish this added quality of life by opening our eyes to the obstacles we can conquer if we only ask for a little assistance. 
   National Assisted Living Week provides an environment which brings together friends and family with the staff and volunteers of assisted living programs to discover and explore the contributions and services these facilities offer to their communities. These centers will hold many events this week to spotlight their activities and help educate the communities they serve. National Assisted Living Week works as a catalyst, by helping to create strong relationships involving all facets of the community, including places of worship, health care facilities, schools, and businesses. 
   During this National Assisted Living Week, I recognize the selfless efforts of those Minnesotans and many other caring Americans who help make dignity in retirement a reality, and I offer them my thanks as they promote assisted living as a quality way of life for America's elderly.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the Thompson-Torricelli amendment, both in principle and, as all amendments to PNTR, this one is a killer that will delay PNTR until another Congress. I appreciate what they are trying to accomplish but disagree with the direction. 
   Despite what you have heard, this is a very controversial amendment that carries more of a political message than is a legislative proposal that would accomplish its purpose. This legislation has not gone through the committee process, nor has it been thoroughly analyzed by many Members of this body. I urge my colleagues to read the latest version carefully before we vote--there have been four versions of this legislation, the last one presented this morning. 
   I agree we should work with China to reduce its proliferation, just as we should work with all countries which proliferate. And I believe the President should exercise his authority under the 11 statutes we have now to sanction when that is necessary. I am not ready to give up on bilateral efforts and existing laws, especially as we are close to a new administration. This legislation is simply not appropriate since we don't know how the new administration will address nonproliferation. 
   Recently Alan Greenspan commented at a hearing I attended that he opposes this legislation. Chairman Greenspan noted ``..... there is a very serious question as to whether it will produce indeed what is suggested it will produce.'' He went on, ``But most importantly, to the extent that we block foreigners from investing or raising funds in the United States, we probably undercut the viability of our own system. But far more important is I'm not even sure how such a law would be effectively implemented because there is a huge amount of transfer of funds around the world.'' He says, ``the only thing that strikes me as a reasonable expectation is it can harm us more than it would harm others.'' 
   This again begs the question of an amendment that could actually be counterproductive to our efforts to curb Chinese proliferation? 
   Before I discuss my concerns about this amendment more specifically, I want to address charges I have heard against those of us who oppose this legislation. We are accused of being pawns of the business and agriculture communities. We are accused of not caring about nuclear proliferation. Some of us are accused of opposing the Thompson-Torricelli legislation because Senator THOMPSON has blocked some legislation we strongly supported. We have been accused of misrepresenting the amendment. The Senator has the right to question legislation or oppose it; so do I and others who oppose the approach of this amendment. I will state as firmly as I can--every position I take in the Senate is based on policy--not on politics, not on contributions, not on retribution--not on anything but whether the legislation is good policy and whether it can accomplish its purpose. This fails on both counts. 
   At the same time, I respect my colleagues' belief that this 
   legislation can accomplish its purpose. They firmly believe it takes a ``club 'em over the head'' approach to achieve any progress with China. I respect their right to that analysis, but very strongly disagree. And I strongly urge all of you to look at this legislation from a policy perspective, and nothing more. This is why we were sent here--not to punish a country which has leaders we don't agree with; not to vote for something that balances our PNTR vote; not to send a message to an outgoing administration. 
   I share some of the concerns you will hear today about this administration's China policy. If there was evidence of proliferation that violated international agreements, it should be pursued under existing laws. But to pass new, tougher laws because one administration may not have been tough enough--particularly at the end of the administration--is surely ill-advised and inappropriate. We have no reason to believe that either Presidential candidate would not use existing laws to their full intent. I am especially concerned about this because of my own optimism that the Presidency will change parties, and I don't want the new administration's hands to be tied so severely in this way. Some have termed the broad congressional authority under this legislation as contrary  to the President's authority as Commander in Chief under the Constitution. 
   Many of you are aspiring Presidential candidates in the future. I ask you, Would you want this severe limitation on your authority as President? 
   Mr. President, many of us sat down and tried to come up with a way to achieve a compromise with the sponsors when they tried to bring this amendment up before. This is now the fourth draft of the original Thompson-Torricelli legislation, and you have heard earlier today that it answers all of our concerns. There were some improvements, but many new issues of concern have been added, and the core problems remain. Clearly, proponents and opponents are still very far apart on this issue, and I do not believe it should be considered here today without committee hearings and action. 
   Let's take a look at where we are with China on proliferation. We have a long way to go, but we shouldn't leave the impression that there has been no progress. We have just started talks again on nonproliferation after the Chinese called off our dialogue due to their concerns about the bombing of their embassy in Belgrade. Before that time, we had made some progress with China on sales to Iran. China has also followed up on various intelligence reports of proliferation. They have worked with U.S. officials to develop an export control system, and have admitted they need help administering an effective system as a developing nation with many people, many companies and many opportunities for proliferation that may or not be intended. We can hold their feet to the fire by providing support to help them improve--or by enforcing existing laws if necessary. 
   China has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Zangger Committee and has committed to adhere to the Missile Technology Control Regime guidelines. I believe it has the will to improve. I also believe it has security concerns of its own that must be factored in. It has an alliance with Pakistan and it has concerns about how our missile defense 
   system might affect their own security interests. Whether we agree with those positions or not, we cannot expect other countries not to be concerned when we improve our own security--or when other nations do so. I still believe engagement between two countries that have differences works better when both countries act out of respect for each other. When we work with others rather than dictating what the results should be and when. To threaten a country's sovereignty rights by imposing sanctions for proliferation we may not even be able to prove only promotes an adversarial relationship that will achieve no progress. 
   Will an adversarial relationship continually worsened by an annual proliferation report which includes ``credible information'' of proliferation with an automatic expedited congressional review overturning a President's decisions not to sanction have any impact whatsoever on China's will to improve? Especially after China thought PNTR would bring an end to the annual review? Thompson-Torricelli continues the annual review and will make it easier for the Congress to sanction. 
   Before the embassy bombing, we saw some good signs China did want to improve. That can start again, but not if this legislation represents the terms under which we will request improvement. This approach would threaten any country's sovereignty--and China has just as many of those concerns as we do. In fact, its long history probably makes them more concerned about how to respond to world powers wielding huge clubs. 
   Further, U.S. leadership is jeopardized since no other country is likely to follow our lead, and I believe the U.S. should be a leader on proliferation issues. Other countries will also strongly object to the extraterritorial reach in the Thompson amendment. The amendment covers commercial items not controlled under existing multilateral arrangements. Therefore, the U.S. alone will decide whether these agreements have been violated by both adversaries and allies. 
   My concerns about this legislation are many--and most of them would continue no matter how many concessions are made by the authors. 
   First--unilateral sanctions do not work. Each year the President would submit a report to Congress detailing proliferation by companies and governments. His standard for identifying proliferation is ``credible information.'' By no means can this be defined as proof of proliferation. The President then would either impose the mandatory sanctions on the persons, companies, or government entities or indicate why he has not done so. The report also includes sales to Chinese companies which ``contributed to the design, development, production'' of nuclear, chemical or biological weapons. That could draw in a lot of companies--contributed is a very broad term. A ``contribution'' could be unknowing and it may not even be material to developing a weapon or missile. Also in the report, the President would list noncompliance with international agreements, with export control laws by covered countries, which, if not sanctioned through a national security waiver, could result in a congressional sanction of the entire country--whether or not that country was attempting to help improve its nonproliferation record, laws and enforcement of its laws. It 
   would also include a report on the Commerce Department's role in exporting licensing and post-shipment verifications--inferring Congress could also quickly reverse some of these decisions. To make matters worse, the report would include technology transfers the CIA determines would have ``a significant potential to make a contribution to the development'' of nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. 
   Now the CIA is making policy under a fairly low evidentiary standard that could result in congressional action overturning any Presidential decision not to sanction, other than a national security waiver. 
   This report, what is included in it, what is sanctioned under what evidentiary standard and what is not, opens up a can of worms we should not be considering here today in a floor amendment. To say trade sanctions are not included is simply inaccurate. 
   Second--if the President chooses not to sanction, determining the low evidentiary standard of ``credible information'' cannot prove a national security risk in certain instances, there is an automatic congressional review, if 20 Senators agree, which would provide expedited congressional procedures that would allow Congress to quickly overturn any alleged proliferation in the report that is not sanctioned, thus putting Congress in the business of routinely sanctioning persons, companies or the government of China, Russia, or North Korea. This raises serious constitutional concerns and would allow Congress to politicize these decisions. This revised Thompson-Torricelli amendment exempts congressional review of alleged proliferation exempted from sanctions under the President's national security waiver authority which is an improvement. 
   Congress cannot take the time to fully analyze these matters, no matter how much we would like that to happen. And since most of our personal staff doesn't have access to the highest clearance, we would rely on the advice of a very few staffers to make these very sensitive foreign policy decisions normally made by the President. 
   At a recent Foreign Relation Committee hearing, even Elliott Abrams, an opponent of PNTR, indicated it was bad policy to have this kind of legislative review. He also opposed the insufficient waiver authority and thought the legislation should be broadened to more countries. 
   Next--this amendment started out focusing just on China--even though there are other proliferators. Senator THOMPSON, after reviewing this criticism, broadened it to include North Korea and Russia, but still titles the bill the ``China Nonproliferation Act''. He claims after the third draft that his bill covers all countries, but it only covers ``key'' countries as determined by the CIA--once again we are letting the CIA dictate policy. I recall some of the past mistakes when CIA had too great a role in policy decisions. 
   This legislation should include all countries, not just a couple, and not just ``key'' countries. No country should be exempt if there are proliferation concerns. 
   It is only after I concluded this legislation would not accomplish its purpose of curbing proliferation that I object to the way unilateral sanctions  would harm American workers and farmers. The actual sanctions under this legislation harm our workers despite what 
   the authors claim. China would buy from other countries, not us, and the U.S.-China WTO agreement would be ignored. There are plenty of other countries willing to step in and take our share of this market from us. The claims that agriculture is exempted from the sanctions is meaningless, as agriculture exports from the U.S. would be the first point of retaliation by China if we impose sanctions. 
   The author claims there are no mandatory trade sanctions. However, I believe my constituents who produce dual-use items and sell under Ex-Im Bank programs would strongly differ with that statement. 
   While the latest draft claims that sanctions against countries are discretionary, the ability of the Congress to impose sanctions on countries listed in the reporting requirements as violators definitely could result in countries being sanctioned, if not by the President, by the Congress under the congressional review. Further, the definition of ``persons'' subject to mandatory sanctions still includes government entities, so it seems clear to me that countries still are covered. 
   Mandatory sanctions would prohibit the sales of dual-use exports and U.S. assistance, including Ex-Im Bank programs. The discretionary sanctions against countries include scientific and academic exchanges as well as rule of law and human rights programs--programs that help us achieve progress with China in many areas of difference. Access to U.S. financial markets, all of which will seriously harm U.S. exporters, and, again serve no purpose since those sanctions will just force China to trade with other nations, risking the jobs of many American workers. 
   As noted earlier, the President would also include on his annual list those who ``contribute to'' proliferation which could easily catch U.S. companies, as well as those in other countries, which export commercial items that are not controlled under multilateral agreements yet many end up being used in the design or production of nuclear weapons without the exporter's knowledge. The standard used under existing nonproliferation laws for sanctions is there would be a ``knowing'' transfer of technology that makes a ``direct and material contribution'' to weapons of mass destruction development, production or use. This is a major weakening of our current standard that could sanction many companies in the U.S. by cutting off their exports of dual-use items, some of which may have been diverted to an illegal end user without knowledge of the U.S. seller. Also, U.S. exports of nearly anything could be determined as ``contributing to the design, development, production,'' etc. of nuclear weapons. While the legislation claims to only cut off our exports to companies in China engaging in proliferation, the ``contribution to'' standard is very broad indeed, and at the very least could sanction companies engaging in joint ventures in China and Russia. And of course the Congress, in its expedited review, could well choose to cut off all exports of certain items without much debate or consideration. 
   While the authors claim to only sanction under existing multilateral export control arrangements, the ``contribute to'' standard could reach far beyond these agreements, as discussed previously. 
   The revised version claims to only enforce China's international nonproliferation commitments, 
   but it lists the Missile Technology Control Regime annex which China has not agreed to implement. There are bilateral discussions addressing this matter which I hope will result in China agreeing to abide by the MTCR annex but the claim made by the authors is not accurate. 
   Again, the President has sanctions authority under the Arms Export Control Act, Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act, IEEPA which currently covers our dual use export control laws, Export-Import Bank Act, Arms Control and Disarmament Act, Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act, Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act, 1997 Intelligence Authorization Act, Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal 2000, and the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000. China was sanctioned by President Bush in 1991 and by President Clinton in 1993 and 1997. I agree with Senator THOMPSON that these laws should be used to address proliferation by all countries. 
   This legislation, for the first time, draws the SEC into nonproliferation policy by requiring it to come up with guidelines and regulations regarding notification of investors of any company listed in the report which have securities that are either listed or authorized for listing on one of our exchanges. Notice of listing would have to be included in all filings or statements submitted to the SEC. This would include companies the President has chosen not to sanction because progress is being made, or when he has exercised his national security waiver. This, too, is an extremely controversial new government mandate that brings the SEC into an area it knows nothing about and is an expansion of its authority that would be opposed by many of us. 
   The revised version would also tie the President's hands on Russian and North Korean foreign policy matters. 
   This legislation would involve the jurisdictions of four different committees, yet it also has many references to dual-use exports, which is the jurisdiction of the Banking Committee. There is no reference to the Banking Committee in this legislation, yet supporters of the bill claim Banking Committee members are opposing this legislation due to differences with the authors of this bill. By refusing to involve Senators with committee jurisdiction in consideration of this legislation, or by reference in this amendment, I believe it is clear the problem is in the other direction. 
   There are, I believe, inconsistencies in the way this bill is drafted. There are too many to justify considering this amendment without ample hearings and committee markup. The second, third and fourth drafts of the bill do not solve concerns raised in the original S. 2645. In fact, they have raised even more concerns and new issues. 
   Because of these concerns, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment. 
   Again, I want to say I appreciate the Senator's intent, but I just disagree with the direction of this bill. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator from Montana for his remarks. 
   Mr. President, I join in saying that we all share the concern of Senator WELLSTONE regarding China's repression of its citizens' religious freedoms. I am sure every other Member of the Senate does as well. But if passed, make no mistake about it, this amendment, as with any amendment that would be offered to this bill, will effectively kill permanent normalized trade relations with China, since a House-Senate conference and a second vote on PNTR would then be required. 
   So this amendment, or any amendment, for any reason, basically is a killer amendment to this bill. That is why I am going to oppose all amendments to PNTR and ask my colleagues to join me in adopting this approach. 
   As I've said before, I believe H.R. 4444 is certainly among the most important legislation we will consider this year and likely the most consequential of the past decade. That's because passage of PNTR will create vast new opportunities for our workers, farmers and businesses and also vast new opportunities for the people of China. 
   It's also because PNTR serves America's broader national interest in meeting what is likely to be our single greatest foreign policy challenge in the coming years--managing our relations with China. 
   And as those with the greatest experience working in faith-based organizations actually based in China will tell you, engaging the Chinese through PNTR and other avenues offers us the best chance to advance religious freedom--not hinder it, or stop it, but to advance religious freedom in China. The best thing they say we can do is help pass PNTR. 
   Here is what Billy Graham, one of whose organizations has been working in China for 10 years providing Bibles, literature and leadership training, has to say:  
   I believe it is far better for us to thoughtfully strengthen positive aspects of our relationship with China than treat it as an adversary. In my experience, nations can respond to friendship just as much as people do.  
   And here is what Reverend Pat Robertson says:  
   I do not minimize the human rights abuses which take place in [China], but I must say on first-hand observation that significant progress in regard to religious freedom and other civil freedoms has been made over the past twenty-one years. If the U.S. refuses to grant normal trading relations with [China] we will damage ourselves and set back the cause of those in China who are struggling toward increased freedom for their fellow citizens.  
   Randy Tate, former Executive Director of Christian Coalition, said the following last year:  
   Our case for greater trade . . . is less about money and more about morality. It is about ensuring that one-fifth of the world's population is not shut off from businesses spreading the message of freedom and ministries spreading the love of God. . .  
   According to a letter from 21 U.S. religious leaders,  
   Despite continued, documented acts of government oppression, people in China nonetheless can worship, participate in communities of faith, and move about the country more freely today than was even imaginable twenty years ago. ..... These positive developments have come about gradually in large part as a result of economic reforms by the Chinese government and the accompanying normalization of trade, investment and exchange with the outside world.  
   Finally, let's listen to His Holiness, the Dalai Lama: ``Joining the World Trade Organization .....'' he said, ``is one way (for China) to change in the right direction. I think it is a positive development. In the long run, certainly [the trade agreement] will be positive for Tibet. Forces of democracy in China get more encouragement through that way.'' 
   Mr. President, let us also remember that H.R. 4444 contains a provision to establish a Congressional-Executive Commission on the People's Republic of China modelled after the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which played such an important role in promoting human rights in the former Soviet Union. 
   This new Commission's purpose is to monitor human rights conditions in China, including the right to worship free of involvement of and interference by the government. 
   Each year, the Commission will issue a report to the President and the Congress setting forth the findings of the Commission as well as recommendations for legislative or executive actions to push China to improve its record on religious freedom and in other areas of human rights. 
   Let us also remember that the U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for International  Religious Freedom visited China in 1999 to emphasize to Chinese authorities the priority the United States places on religious freedom. 
   In addition, the United States has designated China as a ``country of particular concern'' for violations of religious freedom under the International Religious Freedom Act. 
   Mr. President, every one of us in this body is concerned about religious freedom. Yet as so many religious leaders with long-term experience working in China contend, the best way to advance religious freedom is to further our engagement with China economically and otherwise. PNTR is central to such engagement, particularly as H.R. 4444 specifically addresses the issue of religious freedom. 
   Finally, I must emphasize again that a vote in favor of the amendment offered by my friend from Minnesota--or for any amendment for that matter--effectively is a vote to kill PNTR. There is simply too little time left in this Congress to conference PNTR and conduct a second round of votes. 
   I ask my colleagues to join with me in tabling this amendment.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President. I would like to engage the distinguished Chairman of the Subcommittee in a brief colloquy on an extremely important public safety project in St. Paul, Minnesota. As the Chairman may recall, I have been a strong proponent of $3,000,000 in Federal funding for the Mississippi Place project in downtown St. Paul. Not surprisingly, I am quite disappointed that the Committee was unable to accommodate requests to initiate work on recently authorized projects. 
   This project, authorized in the Water Resources Development Act of 1999, entails much needed improvements to the Mississippi River shoreline. For the past 100 years, this shoreline was virtually inaccessible to residents of St. Paul, cut off by a major parkway, industrial property and a main rail line. However, much has changed in the last five years, and the community now finds itself with an unprecedented opportunity to re-establish a physical connection to the Mississippi River. The industrial property has been converted into a new Science Museum and parkland, the parkway has been re-aligned and the rail lines have been regraded. 
   As envisioned by the Corps, the project will consist of a series of improvements to a section of river which contains some of the strongest currents on the Upper Mississippi. The need to initiate prompt work on the project led the Minnesota State Legislature to allocate $3,000,000 in state matching funds to the 2000 Bonding Bill signed by the Governor. An additional $3,000,000 in funding from local and other sources will be made available for parklands, trails and other amenities. All told, the community has pledged two thirds of the funding required for the project, far in excess of what is required by law. 
   But the most important work of all is the Corps portion along the shoreline, work which is critical to keeping the public (including 1.5 million annual visitors at the new Science Museum of Minnesota) away from the fast moving current. Without the funding I have requested from the Committee, this project will not be initiated. 
   Mr. President, could the distinguished Chairman provide me with his views on the upcoming conference with the House on this legislation, with particular emphasis on the funding which I am seeking for this project?

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I had intended to offer an amendment that would have provided $1 million in funding for the Red Lake River Flood Control Project at Crookston, Minnesota. This is a high priority of mine, and I regret the Committee's inability to fund new start construction projects. I understand there may be more flexibility to fund new starts in conference, and I want to continue to work with Chairman DOMENICI at that time to ensure funds are available to begin construction of this important project. 
   Communities in the Red River Valley in Northwestern Minnesota have suffered some of the worst flooding in our nation's history during 1997. Many Americans watched the television coverage of Grand Forks, North Dakota and saw the burning buildings which destroyed a city block, all in a sea of water. But just across the Red River, on the Minnesota side, is East Grand Forks, a town of nearly 10,000 people that had no water, no electricity, and no sewer system. 
   This disastrous flooding has severely disrupted the lives of many, many Minnesotans. Dreams of enjoying warm, spring weather after a brutally long Minnesota winter were replaced with efforts to ensure families and communities were safe, and that adequate food, water, and shelter was available. 
   Just 22 short miles east of East Grand Forks is the community of Crookston. Fortunately, through hard work and some luck, Crookston escaped major flooding in 1997. But Crookston's luck may not hold. The Red Lake River has flooded Crookston in the past, and without improved flood protection, it will flood the city again. The city has experienced severe flooding as a result of the topography of the land, as well as agriculture drainage, loss of wetlands, and the construction of county ditch systems. In fact, all of which have altered the flow of water adding to the risk of flooding. The threat to life and property in Crookston has increased since the 1950 flood when many homes were destroyed. The city has constructed levees between 1950 and 1965, but these levees are seriously deteriorating. 
   Mr. President, there is a plan for flood protection in Crookston. City planners have suggested a combination of channel cuts and dikes. The channel cuts would allow water to flow more quickly through town. The dikes would hold back flood water. 
   The city needs federal funding for this project. Already, the State of Minnesota has appropriated $3.3 million for Crookston for the dual purpose of providing funds to match the pending federal money, and to buy out homes in preparation for construction of the project. Local contributions, thus far, have exceeded $1.5 million, a third of which was used to meet the 50% federal requirement for the feasibility study, and the remainder is to be used as a part of the local match for the construction of the project that was authorized in the Water Resources Development Act of 1999. The cost benefit ratio for the project was determined in the Corps' feasibility study to be 1.6, far exceeding the federal requirement of a 1:1 cost benefit ratio for flood prevention projects. 
   It is my understanding that the city has met every requirement, cooperated with the Corps, and done everything asked of them to ensure the federal funding they expected after the authorization. 
   I want to commend the leadership of Mayor Don Osborne, members of the city council and city engineers in working on this important flood control project for their community. It is my hope that federal funding for this project be achieved so that work can begin to provide essential flood protection for the people of Crookston.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to address the ongoing dispute between advocates of low power FM radio and full power FM radio broadcasters. I am pleased to be joined in this bipartisan effort by Senators BAUCUS, INHOFE, GREGG, and HUTCHISON. Our legislation, the ``Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000,'' was overwhelmingly passed by the House of Representatives on April 13th by a vote of 274-110. 
   On January 20th, the Federal Communications Commission narrowly adopted a proposal that would establish a new radio service known as low power FM radio (LPFM). Under this program, the Commission would license hundreds of new low power FM  radio stations in two classes. The new service would license stations with a maximum power level of 10 watts that would reach an area with a radius of between 1 and 2 miles, and a second class of stations with a maximum power level of 100 watts that would reach an area with a radius of three and a half miles. Although the commission adopted first- and second-adjacent channel interference protections as part of its rulemaking, it chose to allow LPFM stations to be licensed on third-adjacent channels. The FCC began accepting applications for this new service on May 30th. 
   Over the last several months, I have carefully listened to Minnesotans who care deeply about the issues involved in the debate over LPFM. In the absence of third-adjacent channel protection, incumbent FM broadcasters believe that low power FM radio stations would cause interference to existing radio services. LPFM advocates argue that the Federal Communications Commission has conducted adequate testing for interference and that requiring third adjacent channel protections would unnecessarily limit the number of licensed low power FM radio stations. Further, they suggest that the 1996 Telecommunications Act has resulted in unprecedented concentration within the telecommunications industry. 
   Although I have many concerns about the impact of LPFM service upon current FM radio broadcasting, I share the commission's stated goal of increasing diversity in radio and television broadcasting. Earlier this Congress, I supported the enactment of the Community Broadcasters Act, which preserves the unique community television broadcasting provided by low power television stations that are operated by diverse groups such as high schools, churches, local government and individual citizens. I also look forward to reviewing the findings and recommendations from the ongoing survey of minority broadcast owners being conducted by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration that will be used to analyze the impact of the 1996 Telecommunications Act upon minority broadcast ownership in the United States. 
   Mr. President, I am also very mindful of the concerns about LPFM raised by radio reading service programs. In my home state, the State Services for the Blind sponsors the ``Radio 
   Talking Book'' program. Radio Talking Book is a closed-circuit broadcast system which uses FM subcarrier frequencies from radio stations in Minnesota and South Dakota to deliver readings from newspapers, magazines and books on a daily basis to more than 10,000 blind and visually impaired persons. Sub-carrier signals are the most vulnerable to low power FM radio interference because they are located at the outer edge of the frequency space. 
   I am troubled by the Federal Communications Commission's decision to adopt LPFM without conducting field testing of subcarrier receivers. Nearly eight months after the Commission approved LPFM, engineering studies and field testing of these receivers have not yet been completed by the Commission, and it remains unclear as to how the FCC intends to address interference that may be caused to radio reading services. The agency's inaction underscores the haste in which the LPFM plan was developed and gives credence to the view that the adoption of the FCC rules was a rush to judgment. I ask unanimous consent that letters from Minnesota Public Radio, the Minnesota State Services for the Blind and the International Association of Audio Information Services be inserted into the RECORD at this time. 
   For these reasons, I am pleased to introduce the ``Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000.'' I believe this legislation represents the interests of LPFM advocates, full power FM broadcasters, and most importantly--radio listeners. This compromise bill will allow the Federal Communications Commission to license lower power FM radio stations while requiring additional third adjacent channel protections for full power FM broadcasters. 
   Among its other provisions, the Radio Broadcasting Preservation Act of 2000 would require that an independent party conduct testing in nine FM radio markets to determine whether LPFM without third adjacent channel protections would cause harmful interference to existing FM radio services. The legislation would require the FCC to submit a report to Congress which analyzes the experimental test program results; and evaluates the impact of LPFM on listening audiences, incumbent FM radio broadcasters, minority and small market broadcasters, and radio stations that provide radio reading services to the blind. 
   Mr. President, some advocates of the low power FM plan adopted by the Commission argue that the Congress should simply allow the agency to move forward on LPFM without any input or modifications from Congress. Those individuals apparently favor granting legislative authority to federal regulatory agencies. Since the establishment of the Federal Communications Commission through an Act of Congress in 1934, members of the House and Senate have consistently exercised appropriate oversight of FCC rules and proposals. 
   As a member of the Senate, I have carefully monitored the Commission's activities to ensure responsible public policy and the wisest use of taxpayer dollars. Over the last few years, I have expressed my concern over a number of issues considered by the Commission, including satellite television, rights-of-way management, universal service, the impact of digital television rules upon low power television and translator stations, and most recently low power FM radio. Congress should not abdicate its oversight responsibilities when considering the LPFM issue.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I would like to talk about my support for H.R. 4444, but I just want to respond briefly to one comment of the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. DORGAN. I think he was bragging a little bit, maybe, about his uncle who is 80 years old and running in a marathon. I just congratulate him. How great that our senior citizens, because of the advances of medicine, can do that. I have a friend retiring at the age of 65. He wanted to retire to spend more time playing golf with his dad. Another is an uncle who was 85 last year who got his first hole-in-one, Ray Sandey. I just wanted to put that into the RECORD and congratulate them on their achievements.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4444, which grants permanent normal trade relations--PNTR--to China. We should have passed this in early June, and I deeply regret the delay and hope we can expedite the House bill without amendments. 
   I believe this is a no brainer. China negotiated a WTO accession agreement with the United States--an agreement in which China has committed to improve market access for most U.S. products and services to China. In exchange, the one thing we are required to grant them is PNTR--the same treatment all WTO members afford each other.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to today announce my support for S. 353, the Class Action Fairness Act, just reported by the Judiciary Committee, and announced my intention to complement this legislation by introducing legislation soon that will require lawyers representing plaintiffs in class actions to make preliminary disclosures estimating the anticipated attorneys' fee, and an explanation of the relative recoveries that both the attorney and class action clients can expect to receive if the claim is settled or decided favorably. My cosponsorship of the Class Action Fairness Act and intention to introduce my own legislation is prompted by some high profile class action case settlements that have generated a great deal of controversy. Labeled ``coupon'' settlements, these agreements have involved the class action claimants receiving coupons for discounts on later purchases of goods or services while the attorneys representing the class walk away with literally hundreds of thousands of dollars, or even millions of dollars, in fees. Often these coupons are for discounts on the same item rejected by the claimants in the class action. 
   For instance, several years ago many of the nation's airlines were sued based upon a claim that they had fixed prices. A database that the airlines were using to communicate fares to the travel industry was suspected of being used to compare and fix fares, and a Justice Department antitrust investigation thus ensued. The Justice Department subsequently filed a civil antitrust suit in 1992 and settled the case in 1994. But firms specializing in class action cases also brought their own civil suits against the airlines on behalf of air travelers. In fact, 37 firms were involved on the plaintiff side of the litigation. 
   A settlement was eventually reached that provided $438 million worth of coupons to an unknown number of passengers, while the legal fees to plaintiffs' attorneys amounted to $16 million. In other words, the passengers got coupons, and the lawyers got cash. You may be thinking that $438 million in coupons sounds like a pretty generous amount of discounts for the passengers, but the details indicate otherwise. Each coupon was good for only a 10 percent maximum discount off an air fare. 4.2 million air travelers recovered between $73 and $140 in coupons, but, again, any one coupon was only good for 10 percent of the actual fare. 
   One particularly revealing fact about this settlement was that one airline that had not been named as a defendant actually asked to be joined in the suit as a defendant because they saw the promotional value of all these coupons going to air travelers. So what ostensibly was a high stakes civil action degenerated into a promotional tool for the airlines, a negligible recovery for the class members, and a financial boon for the plaintiffs' attorneys. 
   It's not difficult to foresee the possibility of collusion between plaintiffs' and defendants' attorneys when the plaintiff attorneys can get huge fees and defendants can eliminate the risk of a large judgment. It obviously is an attractive option to a defendant to settle a case and pay large fees to a small number of people--specifically the attorneys--and avoid the risk of protracted litigation and lawyers seeking a jackpot recovery. Attorneys have a fiduciary duty to represent the best interests of their clients, but it's clear that in the cases of coupon settlement usually the primary interest served is their own. 
   So we now have a problem of plaintiff attorneys searching for causes for which they can bring suit, and then representing anonymous clients that they don't know and to which they have no accountability. In fact, many members of a class in a class action don't even know they are being represented. The windfall profits to attorneys has prompted a deluge of these type of suits, and recent studies indicate that in the last 36 months, some companies have faced a 300 to 1000% increase in the number of class actions filed against them. And you know the problem has gotten bad when the president of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America comes out against coupon settlements. 
   The problem of coupon settlements has been manifested primarily in state courts. Federal court judges generally, to their credit, have been more vigilant in policing such ``sweetheart settlements.'' The problem of the proliferation of this type of litigation in state courts prompted 
   Congress to seek a legislative remedy. The Judiciary recently marked up the Class Action Fairness Act, which moves many of these large, multi-state claims to the federal courts where they belong. Many of the class action trial lawyers have worked the system to keep their claims in state court, where they know there is not the expertise nor staff to handle the issues, and which provides them advantages over the defendant. The bill also requires the Judicial Conference of the United States to recommend best practices the courts can use to ensure settlements are fair to the class members, that attorneys fees are appropriate, and that the class members are the primary beneficiaries of the settlement. 
   I believe that these are important reforms, and I want to take the reforms a step further by requiring attorneys in class action cases to make an up-front disclosure about the prospects for success and also give information about attorneys' fees and individual class member recovery in the event of a successful conclusion to the suit. If potential class members are likely to receive only a small fraction of what their attorney would receive, or perhaps a coupon which they may or may not end up using, then they need to be appraised of that fact from the start. These types of disclosures will at least put the potential class members on notice that perhaps the attorneys don't have some noble pursuit of justice in mind as much as they do getting a quick settlement that will net them huge profits, while the clients they ostensibly are trying to assist receive little or nothing. 
   Again, I am pleased to join as a cosponsor of S. 343, and look forward to introducing my own legislation to combat this abuse of our legal system.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about taxes, as my Democratic colleagues have done already this morning. I want to go back over what the President said on Saturday in his weekly radio address to the Nation. 
   I also had the honor this week to respond to the President's radio address. But at the time I wrote up the speech, I had not had an opportunity to see exactly what the President was going to say. I assumed he was going to be talking about taxes this week because that is what the Senate concentrated on last week. But I have now had the opportunity to look through the President's speech. I want to comment on some of the things the President talked about, now that I have had the opportunity to see it. 
   I want to go back to Saturday morning, when the President gave his radio address. In his speech to the Nation he said:  
   Now we have the chance to pass responsible tax cuts as we continue to pursue solid economic policy.  
   What the President is talking about is that he is willing to give some kind of tax relief to the American public but only the kind the President thinks you need; not what your family needs or not what you are looking at in your budget this month but what Washington, inside the beltway, has determined you should have and, by the way, what amounts you should have. 
   But these are targeted tax cuts. In other words, you only can receive these dollars back, or this tax relief, if you do what the President tells you to do. If you invest here or if you do this or you do that, then you can receive back or be able to keep some of your hard-earned money. But if you don't, Washington is going to take it. It is telling you what to do, how to spend your money. 
   Then he went on to say:  
   Instead of following the sensible path that got us here, congressional Republicans are treating the surplus as if they had won the lottery.  
   We are talking about giving the money back to the people who earned it, and by the way, the ``risky, budget-busting tax cuts'' we are talking about--that is eliminating the death tax and marriage penalty, the unfair taxes--would be less than 10 percent of the projected budget surplus. It is less than a dime on the dollar, and this is what the President is saying is going to create complete chaos because somehow we are going to give back to the American taxpayer about 10 percent of the projected surplus. But he says we are acting as if we won it in the lottery. It is the President and my colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle who think this is a lottery that they have won; that the surplus is  there and they are somehow going to find the best way of spending it for you. They are going to determine the best way of spending it for you. 
   They say we think it is a lottery when our proposal is to give the money back to those who earned it, not spending it. Even Alan Greenspan--and again we had him before our Banking Committee last week where we went over the same thing: The surplus is here; what's the best thing we can do with the surplus? Mr. Greenspan says: Pay down the debt. 
   We are paying down the debt. A huge amount of these surplus dollars is targeted to reducing the debt, but also there is money left that can be and should be given back in the form of tax relief. But he said the worst thing we could do is 
   what the President is advocating and my Democratic colleagues are advocating. The worst thing, Alan Greenspan said, that we could do is spend the money. 
   That is what they want to do. They want to find new ways to spend it--but, of course, to benefit you. But they want to determine how to spend it, so they are going to enlarge Government or fatten existing programs. But who is going to pay the bill? It is going to be taxpayers. If we do not get tax relief today and we allow these dollars to be spent to enlarge or fatten the Government, who is going to support that larger, fatter Government tomorrow? It is going to have to come from possibly even in an increase in taxes. So if we miss this opportunity during times of surplus to cut taxes now, you can almost bet we are going to be facing the possibility of tax increases in the near future. 
   We are talking about eliminating unfair taxes, and the majority of Americans agree with this. The marriage penalty and the death tax--even the President has called these unfair taxes. 
   The President said in his speech:  
   Taken together, the tax cuts passed last year and this year by this Congress would completely erase the entire projected surplus over 10 years.  
   Of course, he is talking about the $800 billion tax cut package last year which he vetoed, that is dead and in the wastebasket, and combines it with the cuts we have this year, only 10 percent of the surplus. But he puts them together and says Republicans want to give it all back. 
   That is not all bad. It should be given back. We are talking about overcharges, surpluses. These are dollars over and above what the Government has projected to need to carry out all of its responsibilities. 
   We have $1.8-plus trillion earmarked to pay for programs the Government has said we need to do. 
   These dollars are over and above that. Taxpayers fund every agency, every program, every project, every bureaucrat in that $1.8 trillion budget. Taxpayers are the most used, abused, and underappreciated people in our society. In other words, if they can get more money from you by twisting you a little bit harder, they are going to do that. 
   One of my colleagues earlier this morning said if you make $75,000 a month and you receive through this tax cut another $2,000 a month, would that really make a difference? That is not for him to decide. These are dollars that somebody has worked for and earned. 
   By the way, they are not talking about how much in taxes this individual is already paying on that $75,000, but they are saying: $2,000, what difference would it make to them? In other words, Washington can use it and spend it better than they can, so it should be no problem that we take these tax dollars away from them, even if they are unfair. 
   Again, the majority of Americans agree, the death tax is unfair. You have paid all your taxes all your life to accumulate your estate, and the Government wants to come in after you die and take more than half of it again. It is the same with the marriage tax penalty. Because you are married, you are going to be taxed at a higher rate--on average, per couple, $1,400 per year--and somehow that is fair. 
   Think of it. If someone asked you, what is your projected income over the next 10 years, would you want to sign a contract committing you to spend every single penny of it right now? The President is distorting this whole story. We are talking about a surplus, the overcharge. We are not talking about the base wage which the Government is receiving in taxes, but he is talking about the surplus. 
   We should give the surplus back. I like to use a story about finding a wallet. Say this family is sitting around their kitchen table. They find a wallet, and it has $1,000 in it. They say: If we take our regular budget and now add this $1,000 to it, we can buy that big-screen TV we always wanted. They say: We have the money; we found it. 
   Congress has found this wallet with all these surplus tax dollars in it. I was taught--and I think most parents continue to teach their children today--that if you find a wallet with money in it, you should do your best to find the owner and give it back, not to run with it and say: Oh, we found this money; how can we better spend it? We can spend this money. 
   That is what is happening here. These are overcharges. Would you spend all your money now? All we are saying is we should give it back to the taxpayers so they can decide how to spend it best. 
   The President said:  
   We should have tax cuts this year, but they should be the right ones.  
   We should have tax cuts, but they should be the right ones. The President 2 years ago in Buffalo, NY, said something to this effect, and I will paraphrase it: We could give back all of this surplus, but what if Americans do not spend it right? 
   That is the same thing he is doing here: We could have tax cuts, but they should be the right ones. In other words, if we give the taxes back to the American people, the overcharge, the surplus--we are not even talking tax cuts here. That is a misused term. We are not cutting taxes. What we are trying to decide is how much of the surplus should go back to you, the 
   taxpayer, that you have been overcharged. 
   The President said: We could give it all back, but what if you don't spend it right? In other words, you are smart enough to go out and earn your money, but somehow you are too dumb to know how to spend your money, and Washington can do that for you and do it better and do it in these targeted programs that are going to help everybody. But it will not let you have the opportunity to spend the money the way that will best benefit your family. 
   Every family is a little different. Your needs are different from mine and your neighbors' or even your brothers' and sisters' in raising their families. You should have the opportunity to decide how this prosperity, these extra dollars, should be spent. 
   What the President is saying is, send them to Washington, or keep sending this surplus to Washington, and we will decide what is best for you and how best to spend it. 
   The President said: In good conscience, I cannot sign one expensive tax break--again, it is not a tax break; it is an overcharge--after another without coherent strategy. In other words, they want to control how these extra tax dollars are spent --not you, taking it out of your control. They want to determine exactly how these tax dollars should be spent. 
   The President also says he supports this marriage tax penalty we passed, but he said it should be a carefully targeted marriage tax penalty that will cost less. Why will it cost less? Because the President eliminates a great number of these couples who currently qualify for the marriage tax penalty. He is saying that if you make too much money, if you itemize, or do not itemize, somehow you will not qualify. 
   The President says ``targeted.'' Again we hear that word ``targeted.'' When we hear that, it means Washington believes it can best determine what you need or what program the Government can create or how the Government can spend your tax money. 
   I want to say one other thing before I close, and that is what the President said at the end of his speech. I agree with these last few lines:  
   The surplus comes from the hard work and ingenuity of the American people. We owe it to them to make the best use of it, for all of them and for our children's future.  
   I agree with that statement. The only thing is we disagree on how to accomplish it. ``The surplus comes from hard work and ingenuity of the American people. We owe it to them to make the best use of it. .....'' To me, the best use would be to give the surplus back.  
   We are not talking tax cuts at all. We are not talking about reducing the revenues Washington needs to run this Government and its programs. What we are talking about is the surplus. We owe it to them to make the best use of it. That will be in rebating, returning those dollars to you so you can then decide what is best for your family. Is it braces for one of your children, or dancing lessons? Is it to begin an educational fund for your child? He is 5 years old, and you want to prepare for his college. You will make that decision, and you will not have to worry or wait for a Government program and then stand there with a hand out asking: Do I qualify, and can I get some of my tax dollars back? 
   You will have to wait for somebody in Washington to say yes or no. That is not what should be happening. You should have control over your dollars. We all need to pay taxes. We know 
   that. There are a lot of good things the Federal Government does. We know that. But Washington should not have the control of determining how to spend the additional dollars, the surplus. 
   I strongly urge the President to sign our two tax bills that we want to send him: the death tax repeal and the marriage tax penalty. I hope the President will consider them and, as he said in the last line of his speech--again I will read it--we owe it to them to make the best use of it for all of them. And my opinion is to give it in tax relief. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to today offer my support and cosponsorship of the Dorgan amendment providing additional disaster assistance to producers hit hard by floods, drought, and other severe storms that have resulted in crop destruction and disease. In Minnesota, floods in the northwest and southern portions of the state have devastated many farmers causing some crops to rot in the field. 
   This is yet another hit for the struggling Minnesota farm economy. Portions of my state have faced heavy  rains and flooding for several years now, and things aren't getting any easier for these hardworking farmers also hit with low prices. In northwest Minnesota, FSA estimates that nearly 50 percent of the acreage has been affected by floods. In nine counties in Minnesota, there have been nearly 1.2 million acres affected. In Mahnomen county, 100 percent of the acreage has been impacted by floods. 
   FEMA funding and disaster assistance under the Small Business Administration and other programs do not provide these farmers the help they need. If we are willing to help farmers who are suffering from falling prices, as we have already done this year through supplemental spending, we should also come to the aid of those suffering from natural disaster, as we do on a routine basis each year as we experience such disasters. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important amendment.

   I want to take this opportunity to commend the numerous ways Special Olympics helps not only the athletes who participate, but also their families and friends and the many volunteers who have made the program such a success.  
   Special Olympics plays an important role in the lives of many of the mentally challenged throughout the world, including my home state of Minnesota. Since the start of Special Olympics, the organization has grown to include more than 1.7 million athletes worldwide, with 3,300 in Minnesota. 
   Special Olympians compete in a variety of events at all skill levels. Competitions in events such as basketball, golf, figure skating, and gymnastics enhance the lives of all participants and the families who root for them from the stands. These athletes start training as early as age six, with some participants in Minnesota competing into their sixties. Special Olympics athletes can compete in as many events as they choose. 
   Not only does Special Olympics hold annual competitions, but the organization helps participants train year round for their events. This encourages Special Olympic participants to develop physical fitness and generally helps improve their quality of life. 
   The Special Olympics would not be possible without the devoted volunteers who lend their time and effort to this worthwhile cause. There are over 1,700 volunteers in Minnesota who serve as coaches, officials, teachers, and in other capacities. I want to thank all who take time out of their schedule to volunteer through Special Olympics. 
   Mr. President, it is an honor to be able to recognize the accomplishments of the Minnesotans involved in Special Olympics. This organization deserves recognition for all they do and the positive impact they have on the lives of our Special Olympians.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in paying tribute to the life and legacy of a man I considered a friend first, a Senator second, and a great American above all. 
   Senator COVERDELL was everything that those of us who were blessed to serve with him strive to be:  
   effective, committed, compassionate, and tenacious when it meant doing right by the  people of Georgia and the American taxpayers he revered.  
   PAUL was a voice for families, for children, for the nation's workers, and every individual seeking to build a better life for themselves, their family, and generations to come. 
   Of all my colleagues, I think I spent more of my working hours with PAUL COVERDELL, in meetings, strategy sessions, and casual conversations. 
   I considered him to be the ``sparkplug of the Senate'' because of the life and energy he brought to this body. 
   As others have said, very little went on here that PAUL wasn't somehow involved in, and he was the man I went to when I needed a friendly ear. 
   I didn't always hear what I wanted to hear, or get the sympathy I thought I needed, of course, but I always received the counsel of a man who spoke from the heart. 
   He leaves behind a remarkable legacy of service, and not just here in the Senate. Other colleagues have spoken of his leadership of the Peace Corps, his 16 years in the Georgia State Senate, his military service, his real-world experience in business. 
   In this Chamber, he will be especially remembered for his unyielding dedication to working Americans, whether through his work on education, and in particular his education savings accounts, leading the fight against illegal drugs, promoting volunteerism, and lifting up America's farmers. 
   I think, though, that PAUL will be remembered foremost as an ardent defender of freedom. 
   The highest tribute one can pay to a colleague is to say that, day in and day out, they got the job done. Senator PAUL COVERDELL got the job done, with humility, with enthusiasm, and always with good humor. 
   With PAUL's passing, the State of Georgia has lost a leader, the Senate has lost its sparkplug, many of us have lost our best friend, and the Coverdell family has lost a truly exceptional man. My prayers, and the prayers of our colleagues and our staffs, are with Nancy and her entire family during this difficult, difficult time. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to allow farmer-owned cooperatives access to the small ethanol producer tax credit. Mr. President, current law provides for an income tax credit of 10 cents per gallon for up to 15 million gallons of annual ethanol production by a small ethanol producer. A small ethanol producer is one defined as having a production capacity of less than 30 million gallons per year. The credit was enacted as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and championed by our former colleague, Senator Bob Dole. Unfortunately, the credit was enacted at a time when the growth and shape of the ethanol industry was still difficult to predict. 
   This situation has led to an unfortunate situation in Minnesota, Iowa, and in other areas where farmer-owned cooperatives have been unable to access the credit due to the way in which the original legislation was drafted. The original legislation certainly envisioned these small, farmer-owned cooperatives as being eligible for the tax credit, but the intricacies of the tax code have made it impossible for them to do so. 
   Mr. President, there are currently 22 cooperative ethanol plants in the United States. Twelve of them are located in Minnesota. Eleven of these Minnesota cooperatives involve over 5,000 farmers and their families. Minnesota cooperatives are able to produce roughly 189 million gallons of ethanol per year. 
   My legislation would simply provide a technical correction to ensure farmer-owned cooperatives are included in the definition of who can benefit from the small ethanol producer tax credit. My bill also expands the definition to include facilities with less than 60 million gallons in annual capacity. 
   I want to again stress that this proposal is consistent with the original intent of the 1990 law that created the small ethanol producer tax credit. Farmer-owned cooperatives were never intended to be excluded from receiving the benefits of the tax credit if they produce less than 30 million gallons. It was just hard to envision the role and growth of cooperatives when we passed the 1990 law. Cooperatives are not huge corporate ventures, but associations of small farmers. 
   Mr. President, the ethanol industry in Minnesota and across the country is one we should promote. Ethanol is a crucial product for rural America, for our nation as a whole, and especially for Minnesota. I'd like to point out just a few of ethanol's impressive benefits--environmentally and economically. According to the Minnesota Corn Growers, ethanol production boosts nationwide employment by over 195,000 jobs. Ethanol improves our trade balance by $2 billion and adds $450 million to state tax receipts. It reduces emissions from gasoline use and therefore helps us clean up the environment. 
   According to the American Coalition for Ethanol, more than $3 billion has been invested in 43 ethanol facilities in 20 states. Those investments have directly created 40,000 jobs and more than $12.6 billion in increased income over the next five years. 
   Minnesota is now home to over a dozen operating ethanol plants with a capacity of over 200 million gallons annually. These plants mean new jobs with good wages and good benefits for people living in rural areas where these plants are built. According to a report by the Minnesota Legislative Auditor, those plants, and the resulting economic activity, are expected to create as many as 5,000 new, high-wage jobs--including jobs in production, construction, and support industries. 
   In addition to its positive economic impact, ethanol production allows our nation to move away from our dependence on foreign energy sources. The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that for every gallon of ethanol produced domestically, we displace seven gallons of imported oil. Ethanol plays a role in increasing our national energy security by providing a stable, homegrown, renewable energy supply. Ethanol is estimated to reduce our demand for foreign oil by 98,000 barrels per day. 
   Those are just some of the reasons why I urge my colleagues to join me in allowing small, farmer-owned cooperatives to enjoy the full benefits of the small ethanol producer tax credit. 
   I want to thank Senator CHARLES GRASSLEY of Iowa for working with me on this important legislation. As everyone knows, Senator GRASSLEY has been a steadfast leader of efforts to promote tax relief for farmers and rural Americans. I'm proud to be working with him on this legislation.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment to reverse the snowmobile ban in our national parks and provide funding for a study to determine how the National Park Service can minimize the impact of snow machines and properly manage competing recreational activities in the National Park System. I want to thank Senators THOMAS and CRAIG for their efforts to bring this important amendment before the Senate for consideration. 
   While the Interior Department's ill-conceived ban will not immediately affect snowmobiling in Minnesota's Voyageurs National Park, it will impact snowmobiling in at least two units of the Park System in my home state--Grand Portage National Monument and the St. Croix National Scenic Riverway. In addition, this decision will greatly impact Minnesotans who enjoy snowmobiling, not only in Minnesota, but in many of our National Parks, particularly in the western part of our country. 
   When I think of snowmobiling in Minnesota, I think of families and friends. I think of people who come together on their free time to enjoy the wonders of Minnesota in a way no other form of transportation allows them. I also think of the fact that in many instances snowmobiles in Minnesota are used for much more than just recreation. For some, they're a mode of transportation when snow blankets our state. For others, snowmobiles provide a mode of search and rescue activity. Whatever the reason,  snowmobiles are an extremely important aspect of commerce, travel, recreation, and safety in my home state. 
   Minnesota, right now, is home to over 280,000 registered snowmobiles and 20,000 miles of snowmobile trails. According to the Minnesota United Snowmobilers Association, an association with over 51,000 individual members, Minnesota's 311 snowmobile riding clubs raised $264,000 for charity in 1998 alone. Snowmobiling creates over 6,600 jobs and $645 million of economic activity in Minnesota. Minnesota is home to two major snowmobile manufacturers--Arctic Cat and Polaris. And yes, I enjoy my own snowmobiles. 
   People who enjoy snowmobiling come from all walks of life. They're farmers, lawyers, nurses, construction workers, loggers, and miners. They're men, women, and young adults. They're people who enjoy the outdoors, time with their families, and the recreational opportunities our diverse climate offers. These are people who not only enjoy the natural resources through which they ride, but understand the important balance between enjoying and conserving our natural resources. 
   Just three years ago, I took part in a snowmobile ride through a number of cities and trails in northern Minnesota. While our ride didn't take us through a unit of the National Park Service, it did take us through parks, forests, and trails that sustain a diverse amount of plant and animal species. I talked with my fellow riders and I learned a great deal about the work their snowmobile clubs undertake to conserve natural resources, respect the integrity of the land upon which the ride, and educate their members about the need to ride responsibly. 
   The time I spent with these individuals and the time I've spent on my own snowmobiles have given me a great respect for both the quality and enjoyment of the recreational experience and 
   the need to ride responsibly and safely. It has also given me reason to strongly disagree with the approach the Park Service has chosen in banning snowmobiles from our National Parks. 
   I was stunned to read of the severity of the Park Service's ban and the rhetoric used by Assistant Secretary Donald J. Barry in announcing the ban. In the announcement, Assistant Secretary Barry said, ``The time has come for the National Park Service to pull in its welcome mat for recreational snowmobiling.'' He went on to say that snowmobiles were, ``machines that are no longer welcome in our national parks.'' These are the words of a bureaucrat whose agenda has been handwritten for him by those opposed to snowmobiling. 
   The last time I checked, Congress is supposed to be setting the agenda of the federal agencies. The last time I checked, Congress should be determining who is and is not welcome on our federal lands. And the last time I checked, the American people own our public-lands--not the Clinton administration and certainly not Donald J. Barry. 
   I can't begin to count the rules, regulations, and executive orders this Administration has undertaken without even the most minimal consideration for Congress or local officials. It has happened in state after state, to Democrats and Republicans, and with little or no regard for the rule or the intent of law. I want to quote Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt from an article in the National Journal, dated May 22, 1999. In the article, Secretary Babbitt was quoted as saying:  
   When I got to town, what I didn't know was that we didn't need more legislation. But we looked around and saw we had authority to regulate grazing policies. It took 18 months to draft new grazing regulations. On mining, we have also found that we already had authority over, well, probably two-thirds of the issues in contention. We've switched the rules of the game. We're not trying to do anything legislative.  
   As further evidence of this Administration's abuse of Congress--and therefore of the American people--Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner was quoted in the same article as saying:  
   We completely understand all of the executive tools that are available to us--And boy do we use them.  
   While Ms. Browner's words strongly imply an intent to work around Congress, at least she did not join Secretary Babbitt in coming right out and admitting it. 
   Well, Mr. President, I for one am getting a little sick and tried of watching this Administration force park users out of their parks, steal land from our states and counties, impose costly new regulations on farmers and businesses without scientific justification, and force Congress to become a spectator on many of the most controversial and important issues before the American people. Quite frankly, I'm getting a little sick and tired of this Administration's positions of zero-cut, zero-access, and zero-fun on public lands. 
   When forging public policy, those of us in Congress often have to consider the opinions of the state and local officials who are most impacted. If I'm going to support an action on public land, I usually contact the state and local official who represent the area to see what they have to say. I know that if I don't get their perspective, I might miss a detail that could improve my efforts are necessary or if they're 
   misplaced. They can alert me to areas where I need to forge a broader consensus and of ways in which my efforts might actually hurt the people I represent. I think that is a prudent way to forge public policy and a fair way to deal with state and local officials. 
   I know, however, that no one from the Park Service ever contacted me to see how I felt about banning snowmobiling in Park Service units In Minnesota. I was never consulted on snowmobile usage in Minnesota or on any complaints that I might have received from my constituents. While I've not checked with every local official in Minnesota, not one local official has called me to say that the Park Service contacted them. In fact, while I knew the Park Service was considering taking action to curb snowmobile usage in some parks, I had no idea the Park Service was considering an action so broad, and so extreme, nor did I think they would issue it this quickly. 
   This quick, overreaching action by the Park Service, I believe, was unwarranted. It did not allow time for federal, state, or local officials to work together on the issue. It didn't bring snowmobile users to the table to discuss the impact of the decision. It didn't allow time for Congress and the Administration to look at all of the available options or to differentiate between parks with heavy snowmobile usage and those with occasional usage. This decision stands as a dramatic example of how not to conduct policy formulation and is an affront to the consideration American citizens deserve from their elected officials. 
   That is why this amendment is so important. It reverses the dark of night, back room tactics used by this Administration to arrive at this decision. We cannot simply stand by and watch as the administration continues its quest for even greater power at the expense of the deliberative legislative processes envisioned by the founders of our country. Secretary Babbitt, Administrator Browner, and Donald J. Barry may believe they're above working with Congress, but only we can make sure they're reminded, in the strongest possible terms, that when they neglect Congress they're neglecting the American people. This amendment does just that.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, every year at this time it seems we're here on the Senate floor debating another attack on the Forest Service's Timber Management Program. Every year those who wish to eliminate logging in our National Forests come up with another angle which they claim helps protect the environment by eliminating ``wasteful'' spending on logging practices. Every year people throughout northern Minnesota and forested regions across the country see their jobs and their livelihoods threatened in the name of preservation or conservation. And every year, those of us who represent the good people of the timber and paper industry in our states have to fight, scratch, and claw our way to a narrow victory that saves those jobs and those families from economic ruin. 
   I come from a state in which the forest and paper industry is vital to our economy. The reduction in the timber program on National Forests has had a dramatic impact over the past ten years on the number of jobs and the economic vitality of northern Minnesota. According to Minnesota Forest Industries (MFI), jobs provided by the timber program in Minnesota dropped from over 1,900 in 1987 to less than 1,100 last year, and they continue to decline. 
   The reduction in timber harvests on federal lands has had an equally dramatic effect on unrealized economic impacts. MFI estimates that unrealized economic benefits include over $10 million from timber sales, $25 million in federal taxes, $2.5 million in payments to states, and $116 million in community economic impact in Minnesota alone. 
   It's important to point out that the timber program in National Forests have a very positive impact on the amount of federal money that goes to rural counties and schools. Nationally, the program contribute $225 million to counties and schools each year through receipts from timber sales in national forests. In Minnesota, the timber program provided roughly $1.7 million to counties and schools in 1998 alone. If the timber program would have met its allowable sale quantity in 1998, that number would have risen to nearly $2.5 million. 
   I'm fascinated by the claims of some of my colleagues that the timber program is a subsidy to wealthy timber and paper companies and the claims that the timber program loses money because we're giving timber away to these companies. If you truly believe that, I challenge you to visit forested regions and speak with the families who have lost their mills and the loggers who have lost their jobs. Talk to the counties and the private landowners who cannot access to their own property because the Forest Service doesn't have enough money to do the environmental reviews. Or talk directly to the Forest Service personnel and let them tell you how lengthy and costly environmental reviews and the overwhelming number of court challenges to those reviews are making the timber program so costly. 
   Then go speak with state or county land managers and ask them why their timber programs are so successful. Ask them why their lands are so much more healthy than the federal lands and why they're able to make money with their timber programs. In Minnesota, St. Louis County only has to spend 26 cents in order to generate one dollars of revenue in their timber program and the State of Minnesota spend 75 cents to generate one dollar of revenue. The Superior National Forest, on the other hand, spend one dollar and three cents to get the same results. 
   I cannot see how my colleagues can stand here on the Senate floor and tell me that the forest and paper industry in our country, and its employees, are the bad guys. The forest and paper industry in America employs over 1.5 million people and ranks among the top ten manufacturing employers in 46 states. These are good, traditional jobs that help a family make a living, allow children to pursue higher education, help keep rural families in rural areas, and provide a legitimate a base from which rural counties can fund basic services. These are jobs that we in Congress should be working diligently not only to protect, but to grow. 
   Unfortunately, many Members of Congress who advocate these ideas have never taken the time to understand the positive economic and environmental benefits of science-based timber harvests. They've never sat down with a county commissioner who doesn't know where he is going to get the money for some of the most basic services the county provides to its citizens. They've never considered that for every 1 million board feet in timber harvest reductions in Minnesota, 10 people lose their jobs and over $570,000 in economic activity is lost. And they've never taken the time to go into a health forest where prudent logging practices have been essential to ensuring the vitality and diversity of species. 
   If Members of this body want to make the timber program profitable across the country, then we should have an honest debate about what  works and does not work in the program. We should discuss frankly the ridiculous number of hoops public land managers have to jump through in order to process a timber sale. I think we need to discuss the fact that under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act the federal government must provide access across federal lands for state, county, and private landowners to access their land. Yet in Minnesota, those landowners either have to wait a number of years or pay for the environmental reviews themselves because the Forest Service claims it doesn't have enough money. We should also discuss openly the dramatic impact court challenges are having on the ability of the Forest Service to do its job and to carry out the timber program in a cost-effective manner. On top of that, it's clear that under this Administration the Forest Service doesn't want a timber program that shows a profit and they've done an effective job of using the powers of the Executive Branch to vilify both the timber program and the men and women of my state who rely upon that program in order to meet their most basic needs. 
   Virtually everyone in this body, including this Senator, is committed to the protection of our environment and to the conservation of our wildlife species and wildlife habitat. I believe we can expand upon our commitment to wildlife and provide additional resources for habitat protection. But I do not believe we must do so on the backs of timber and paper workers throughout the nation. I am willing to work with anybody in this chamber towards those conservation efforts, but let's not do it by pitting timber and paper workers against conservationists. 
   We cannot simply stand here and claim that the Bryan amendment is an easy way to throw some money towards planning for the threat of forest fires. Rather, this amendment is going to take jobs from my constituents and hurt the economy of the northern part of my state. The Bryan amendment is just one more step down the road toward eliminating logging on federal land. This amendment is going to reduce the ability of a number of rural counties in my state to make ends meet and to provide necessary services to residents. These are just a few of the realities of the Bryan amendment and just a few of the reasons why I cannot and will not support its passage.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to make a few brief follow-up remarks about the repeal of the unfair and unjust death tax. As I said before, it is the family farms and small business owners that the death taxes particularly harm, not the rich, as our colleagues from the other side of aisle claim. 
   Mr. President, the death tax hurts average American workers as well. Let me give you another example of how this tax penalizes those workers: 
   Hy-Vee, Inc., headquartered in Iowa, with operations in my state of Minnesota and 7 other Midwestern states, is one of the largest employee-owned companies in the nation. Over the past half a century, the employees and the management of Hy-Vee have built a very successful business. It is ranked one of the top 15 supermarket chains in this country, and top 5 supermarket chains based on cleanliness, and other services. 
   Through the company's profit-sharing mechanism, workers in Hy-Vee are rewarded for their hard work. Over 171 workers of the Hy-Vee company have accumulated assets of over $650,000. These employees are not wealthy individuals by any means but average workers who work at the checkout lines or at mid-level management. 
   However, a large portion of the earnings from their hard work can be taken away by the government if we don't eliminate the death tax. 
   Ron Pearson, CEO of Hy-Vee, says: ``We believe that in many ways, employee ownership represents the truest expression of the American dream. It is simply unfortunate that the dream also contains a nightmare--the estate tax.'' 
   Mr. President, I believe Mr. Pearson is right. We must repeal the death tax to preserve the American dream for working Americans.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today the Senate begins consideration of the first tax reconciliation bill, which would correct the injustice of the marriage penalty. As a long-time advocate of repealing the marriage penalty, I rise to strongly support this legislation and support elimination of the marriage penalty entirely. 
   First, I'd like to take this opportunity to commend our leaders for bringing up this important legislation. I'd particularly like to commend Chairman ROTH for his leadership on tax relief. He has consistently championed critically needed tax relief that will restore fairness for millions of American families. 
   This marriage penalty tax relief legislation would increase the standard deduction so that married couples filing jointly get the same deduction as single taxpayers. It expands the 15 percent and 28 percent tax brackets to ensure that 21 million American couples--including 3 million American seniors--pay the same tax rate as unmarried taxpayers. The bill makes Alternative Minimum Tax exemption for family-related tax credits permanent, so families won't be pushed into higher tax brackets. 
   This bill also takes care of low-income married couples by increasing the threshold of the Earned Income Credit to allow them to enjoy this tax relief. Mr. President, in my view, this is fair, well-balanced legislation by any standard. 
   There are compelling reasons to eliminate the marriage penalty tax and provide immediate tax relief for millions of married couples: 
   As I have said many times before in this Chamber, the family has been and will continue to be the bedrock of American society. Strong families make strong communities; strong communities make for a strong America. We all agree that this marriage penalty tax treats married couples unfairly. Even President Clinton agrees the marriage penalty is unfair. 
   But our tax policy reflects just the opposite. It discourages marriage, punishes married couples, and damages the family--the basic institution of our society. 
   The Congressional Budget Office reports that 22 million American couples suffered from the marriage penalty in 1999. The average penalty paid by these couples was $1,500. 
   This wasn't always the case. For over half a century--from 1913, when Washington first imposed the federal income tax, to 1969--the federal income tax treated married couples as well as, or better than, single individuals. Since 1996, however, many married couples every year have had to pay a penalty just for saying ``I do.'' At the time they exchanged their vows, I'll bet most of those couples didn't realize they were also saying ``I do'' to Uncle Sam. 
   The tax hike of 1993 further aggravated the problem because it added new, higher tax rates. In addition, now that a greater number of households are dual income, that means that more couples are subject to this penalty. 
   Mr. President, the consequence of this unjust penalty is devastating. It has put an additional financial burden on already overtaxed American families. Here is an example of how this penalty hits the average American: 
   Alicia Jones from my state of Minnesota and her husband graduated from college and had just begun working full-time two years ago, in professional careers. They had no children and were renting an apartment, saving to buy a house. They had to pay at least an additional $1,500 for simply being married. As a result, on top of the over $10,000 tax they already paid, they had to take an additional $700 from their limited 
   savings account to pay for federal taxes--taxes that they wouldn't have had to pay if they weren't married. 
   She wrote, ``I am frustrated by this, I'm frustrated for the future--how do we get ahead, when each year we have to take money from our savings to pay more for our taxes. I hope that you will remember my concern.'' 
   Millions of married couples similarly suffer because of this penalty. This is extremely unfair. This was not the intention of Congress when it created the marriage penalty tax in the 1960s by separating tax schedules for married and unmarried people. This unjust marriage penalty also has an adverse social impact, as more and more people delay their wedding just for tax purposes. I have an example of that in my own office. Research also shows that the marriage penalty has discouraged couples from getting married. It has also encouraged some married couples to get friendly divorces. They continue to live together, but save on their taxes. 
   Clearly, this tax policy has interrupted and distorted the normal lives of many Americans. It should not be allowed to continue. 
   Repealing the marriage penalty will provide immediate, meaningful tax relief to American families and allow them to keep $1,500 or more each year of their own money to pay for health insurance, groceries, child care, or other family necessities. 
   In my state of Minnesota alone, over 550,000 couples will benefit from this tax relief and will no longer suffer from this unfair tax. 
   However, the biggest beneficiaries of the elimination of the marriage penalty tax are working women and low-income families. 
   Federal tax policy penalizes working women by taxing their income at the highest rate imposed on their husbands' income. Our legislation addresses this injustice by allowing married working women to keep significantly more of their hard-earned money for family needs. 
    The elimination of the marriage penalty will primarily benefit minority, and low and middle income families. Government data suggest the marriage penalty hits African-Americans and lower-income working families hardest. Couples at the bottom end of the income scale who incur penalties paid an average of nearly $800 in additional taxes, which represented 8 percent of their income. Eight percent, Mr. President. Repeal the penalty, and those low-income families will immediately have an 8 percent increase in their income, larger than for all other income levels.  
   Despite these facts, some of our colleagues from the other side of aisle still call this a ``tax cut for the rich.'' They seem to have gotten into the habit, whenever they hear the phrase ``tax relief,'' of jumping up and shouting ``tax cut for the rich!'' That's not fair to working Americans who are hit hard by these taxes. 
   Mr. President, some also argue that marriage penalty tax relief will go to those families who already receive marriage bonuses. The argument does not fold true either. While about 51 percent, or 25 million couples, receive marriage bonuses, this doesn't justify the federal government penalizing another 22 million couples just for being married or for choosing to work. 
   In addition, most of those who receive marriage bonuses are likely to receive this due to family-related tax credits, such as the $500 per-child credit I passed into law to help a family afford raising children. It is contradictory to allow married couples to receive these credits and then turn around and require them to pay more income taxes for receiving the tax credits. We should give more bonuses to all American families whether both spouses or only one of them are working. 
   More importantly, the trends show that more couples under age 55 are working, and the earnings between husbands and wives are more evenly divided since 1969. This means more and more couples have received, and will continue to receive, marriage penalties and fewer couples will have bonuses. 
   Another conventional argument of our Democratic colleagues against tax relief is that the tax relief costs too much. This is a typical Washington way of thinking. They forget the fact that it is the taxpayer's, not Washington's, money in the first place. 
   Mr. President, it is hard to justify under any circumstances continued punishment of married couples in this country regardless of the costs. Moreover, in this era of record budget surpluses, the so called ``costs'' associated with the repeal of the marriage penalty are just a fraction of the tax overpayments made by working Americans. Over the next 10 years, the federal government will collect over $1.9 trillion in tax overpayments from taxpayers, while the total tax relief in the reconciliation instruction adopted under the FY 2001 budget resolution is merely $150 billion. This is less than 8 cents of every dollar of non-Social Security surpluses collected by the government. 
   We have also heard some argue that Washington needs tax overpayments to save Social Security and Medicare with an addition of prescription drug benefits. President Clinton has also said that he will support the marriage penalty repeal if prescription drug benefits are added. 
   Mr. President, I support saving and strengthening Social Security and Medicare, and I support prescription drug benefits for seniors. I have my own plan to do that. I support repealing the marriage penalty tax, the death tax, and the tax on seniors' retirement benefits. But I believe they all should be passed and signed into law on their own merits, and shouldn't be traded against each other. 
   As a matter of fact, the Administration has never come up with a viable plan to save Social Security. It has blocked bipartisan efforts to strengthen Medicare, including prescription drug benefits. Now it uses this as a cover to deny working Americans the moderate tax refund they deserve. 
   Mr. President, this is not acceptable. 
   I have repeatedly argued that American families today are overtaxed, and the surplus comes directly from taxes paid by the American people. It is only fair to return it to the taxpayers. With a huge budget surplus, we can reduce working Americans' tax burden, pay down the national debt, save Social Security, and provide prescription drug benefits for seniors--if the Administration and the Congress have the political will to do so. 
   In closing, Mr. President, the marriage penalty is simply bad tax policy and we must end it once and for all to restore equity and fairness for working Americans.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, current law provides for an income tax credit of 10 cents per gallon for up to 15 million gallons of annual ethanol production by a small ethanol producer. A small ethanol producer is one defined as having a production capacity of less than 30 million gallons per year. The credit was enacted as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and championed by our former colleague, Senator Bob Dole. Unfortunately, the credit was enacted at a time when the growth and shape of the ethanol industry was still difficult to predict. 
   This situation has led to an unfortunate situation in my state and in other areas where farmer-owned cooperatives have been unable to access the credit due to the way in which the original legislation was drafted. The original legislation certainly envisioned these small, farmer-owned cooperatives as being eligible for the tax credit, but the realities of the tax code have made it impossible for them to do so. 
   There are currently 22 cooperative ethanol plants in the United States. Twelve of them are located in Minnesota. Eleven of these Minnesota cooperatives involve over 5,000 farmers and their families. Minnesota cooperatives are able to produce roughly 189 million gallons of ethanol per year. 
   My language would simply correct the provision of the law that shuts out these farmer-owned cooperatives from the complete benefit of the small ethanol producer tax credit. 
   I want to again stress that this language is consistent with the original intent of the 1990 law that created the small ethanol producer tax credit. Farmer-owned cooperatives were never intended to be excluded from receiving the benefits of the tax credit if they produce less than 30 million gallons and I believe it's time the Congress stepped in and clarified the law. 
   The ethanol industry in Minnesota and across the country is one we should promote. Ethanol is a crucial product for rural America, for our nation as a whole, and especially for Minnesota. I'd like to point out just a few of ethanol's impressive benefits--environmentally and economically. According to the Minnesota Corn Growers, ethanol production boosts nationwide employment by over 195,000 jobs. Ethanol improves our trade balance by $2 billion and adds $450 million to state tax receipts. It reduces emissions from gasoline use and therefore helps us clean up the environment. 
   According to the American Coalition for Ethanol, more than $3 billion has been invested in 43 ethanol facilities in 20 states. Those investments have directly created 40,000 jobs and more than $12.6 billion in increased income over the next five years. 
   Minnesota is now home to over a dozen operating ethanol plants with a capacity of over 200 million gallons annually. These plants mean new jobs with good wages and good benefits for people living in rural areas where these plants are built. According to a report by the Minnesota Legislative Auditor, those plants, and the resulting economic activity, are expected to create as many as 5,000 new, high-wage jobs--including jobs in production, construction, and support industries. 
   In addition to its positive economic impacts, ethanol production allows our nation to move away from our dependence on foreign energy sources. The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that for every gallon of ethanol produced domestically, we displace seven gallons of imported oil. Ethanol plays a role in increasing our national energy security by providing a stable, homegrown, renewable energy supply. Ethanol is estimated to reduce our demand for foreign oil by 98,000 barrels per day. 
   Those are just some of the reasons why I urge my colleagues to join Senator GRASSLEY and me in allowing small, farmer-owned cooperatives to enjoy the full benefits of the small ethanol producer tax credit. 
   I thank Senator GRASSLEY for including this provision, which I had planned to introduce separately, in his package of important tax relief for farmers. As one who has sponsored similar legislation providing tax relief for farmers, I strongly support his amendment and have asked to be a cosponsor. I appreciate the Senator from Iowa's efforts in support of our nation's farmers and all of rural America.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. The amendment repeals the 1993 tax increase that was imposed as part of the Clinton tax package in 1993, but this was an additional increase in taxes on seniors' Social Security benefits. While we should repeal all of the taxes on seniors' Social Security benefits, as it was when Social Security began, as I have proposed in my legislation, S. 488, I believe this amendment is at least a move in the right direction, and that is to restore some fairness for our senior citizens. 
   This amendment, as I said, repeals completely President Clinton's 1993 tax increase on seniors' Social Security benefits. The repeal does not affect Medicare because the revenue loss is offset by the non-Social Security surplus. We are holding the Medicare trust fund harmless while correcting what I believe, and I think the majority in Congress believe, is the injustice of the 1993 tax increase on Social Security benefits for our senior citizens. 
   There are many compelling reasons to repeal this unfair tax increase. When Congress established the Social Security program, the benefits that were then paid to senior citizens were exempt from all Federal income tax. In fact, Social Security benefits were not taxed at all by the Federal Government for nearly half a century. However, when Social Security encountered a financial crisis in the early 1980s, Congress began taxing the benefits. Half--50 percent--of Social Security benefits were subjected to taxation if a single senior citizen earned an annual income of over $25,000 a year and where a couple earned more than $32,000 a year. With the couples and the singles, this is almost a marriage penalty on senior citizens in their retirement benefits. 
   In 1993, when President Clinton needed even more money to fund his new spending programs, he increased the taxable portion of Social Security benefits from the 50-percent level to 85 percent of income for our seniors. These tax increases have been an unfair tax burden on a number of our senior citizens. In fact, 25 percent of our retirees are affected by this provision.  
   I believe taxation on Social Security benefits is wrong and it is unfair because Social Security benefits are already earned benefits for senior citizens. By that I mean that Federal income tax has already been paid on Social Security contributions. I do not know if a lot of people realize this, but before they take Social Security out of your check, the Government taxes it. So for your whole life, all of your Social Security earnings have already been taxed before the Government takes it and puts it into the system. What they are saying now is they want to tax you again as you bring it out not at 50 percent, but as high as 85 percent for up to 25 percent of our seniors. This is a very unfair tax. Yet the Government is now taxing them again on the benefits they are collecting. Clearly, taxing Social Security benefits is a double taxation. 
   Millions of senior citizens planned for their retirement based on the expectation that their benefits would not be taxed. As the tax rate continues to grow and health care costs are also increasing, the income of more and more senior citizens is falling along with their standard of living. 
   Social Security has become the primary source of retirement income for most Americans, and as I said, as the health care costs go up and the Government is taking more money from them in taxes, it leaves them less to pay for health care and to pay for 
   prescription drugs if they need it. It all, again, goes back because the Government wants a bigger part of their income. 
   Six out of 10 recipients today get more than half of their income from Social Security. For some families, Social Security benefits are the only source of their retirement income, and research shows American seniors will depend even more on just Social Security income in the future. That is because a lot of our citizens today do not have money left at the end of the month to put into a savings account for their retirement. They are left with only one choice, and that is Social Security. Again, they have less left at the end of the month to put into a savings account because Government taxes are going up. In fact, they are 15 times higher on a household today than they were at the turn of the century in 1900. 
   Although Social Security has helped many American seniors, the income that is derived from Social Security is often insufficient to maintain a decent retirement today. For example, 1995 data shows that male retirees received on average $810 a month in benefits. Women received only $621 a month from Social Security. I repeat, data from 1995 shows on average $810 a month for men when they retire, and only $621 on average for women when they retire. 
   In fact, Social Security benefits are paltry, which is one reason why the poverty rate among widows is nearly 20 percent, two times greater the rate than widowers, and poverty rates are higher among retired minority women. Twenty-nine percent of African American women and 28 percent of Hispanic women retire into poverty. 
   I believe it is unconscionable for Washington to tax Americans' Social Security retirement benefits. 
   In addition, over the past 15 years, goods purchased by seniors have increased 6 percentage points more than goods purchased by the general public. Again, their dollars are not stretching as far as they used to stretch. Their medical costs skyrocketed by 156 percent, and they have less of their retirement benefits because the Government is taxing more. 
   My concern is as inflation on medical and pharmaceutical goods continues to rise, without repeal of this unfair tax increase, older Americans' hard-earned Social Security benefits will be worth less and less, and that means their purchasing power will continue to diminish and so will their standard of living. 
   This tax hurts seniors who choose to work or must work after retirement in order to maintain their standard of living or to pay for health insurance premiums, medical care, prescriptions, and many other expenses. 
   This tax increase is nothing but a reduction in seniors' benefits that Washington has promised. Unlike welfare where need determines the level of benefits, Social Security is an earned right for our seniors. Taxing their benefits--again, double taxation--is simply an indirect means test on those benefits. 
   I bet millions of American seniors would agree with me. In fact, repeal of the 1993 tax increase has strong support in the Congress. It was part of the Republican Contract With America and was approved by the House as part of the omnibus reconciliation bill in 1995. In the 106th Congress, 14 bills have been introduced calling for the repeal of this unjust increase in taxation. Some will argue that Medicare will be hurt through this amendment, but, in fact, Medicare funding will be left untouched. Social Security tax dollars going to Medicare will be supplanted by general revenue funds. I believe all of us recognize the need to preserve the integrity of the Medicare program. Therefore, I have ensured through this amendment that it will not harm Medicare. 
   Many seniors across the country strongly support the repeal of this unfair tax increase. Seniors' organizations such as United Seniors and the Council for Government Reform strongly favor its repeal. The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare has also stated that it favors the repeal of this 1993 tax increase that was imposed by President Clinton on our senior citizens. 
   The American Association of Retired Persons originally opposed the 1993 tax increase and has not changed its position. In this era of budget surplus, there is absolutely no reason at all for the Government to continue taxing our seniors' retirement income in order for the Government to subsidize excessive spending from Washington. 
   I believe seniors deserve tax relief so they can keep a little more of their own money in their pockets, again, so they can help pay for their own medical bills, their prescriptions, and other expenses. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I reiterate this is an unfair tax. This is double taxation on senior citizens, raising it from 50 to 85 percent on their income, and at a time when we are talking about seniors needing additional dollars to help pay their medical bills, and especially to help them meet their prescription drug bills. So I think this would be one way to enable our seniors to have a little more say in their income and be able to provide for themselves a little better. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to repeal the President's 1993 tax on Social Security earnings for our retired Americans. 
   I yield back the remainder of our time.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, all I want to say is that if it is justifiable to increase taxes on our senior citizens to help supplement the Social Security system, it would be like increasing taxes on our farmers so we could give them a better farm bill. It would be like taking more taxes from the farmers so we can give them more back in the farm program. It is saying: Let's tax our seniors at a higher rate--which is unfair--so we can give them more back to stabilize the Social Security system. It is a basic double taxation. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. It asks for the repeal of the 1993 tax increase that was placed on Social Security benefits. By the way, that does not affect Medicare because we have provided offsets to do that in this amendment. 
   For the first 50 years of Social Security, there was no Federal tax on the benefits our seniors received from Social Security. You were taxed on those benefits before it was taken out of your check and not when you received the benefits. But in the 1980s, they put on a tax and exposed 50 percent of the benefits. Then in 1993, under President Clinton's tax increase plan, it increased to 85 percent. Social Security is taxed before being taken from your checks. Now it is taxed up to 85 percent when you receive the benefits. That is double dipping, and, at a time when health care costs are going up and we are debating prescription drug benefits, we need to leave more dollars in our seniors' pockets. 
   Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I join with Senator WELLSTONE to speak about the urgent need for cleanup and fire threat reduction funding in northern Minnesota. I first want to thank Senator GORTON for his willingness to work with me on this crucial issue for our state. 
   As many of my colleagues know, I've been working with my colleagues in the Senate, including Senator WELLSTONE, Senator GORTON and Senator STEVENS, for months to ensure that this crucial funding would be available for the Superior and Chippewa National Forests. I've made my request repeatedly, in both letters and  in conversations with the Appropriations Committee and the Senate Leadership. My colleagues on the Appropriations Committee gave me their assurance that the needs of Minnesota would be met. 
   I just returned from hearing over five hours of testimony in northern Minnesota on last year's storm and its dramatic aftermath. Regardless of political affiliation or the specific interests of those testifying, everyone agreed that the most crucial need in northern Minnesota was the reduction of the tremendous amount of downed timber scattered across the Superior National Forest and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Right now, there are over 450,000 forested acres in northern Minnesota upon which lie millions of broken, dead or dying trees. Right now, those downed trees pose a fire threat that the Forest Service cannot model. If they're not first burned in a catastrophic fire, many of those trees will become ridden with disease, creating another threat for nearby forested areas that weren't impacted by the storm. 
   While much of the area most impacted by this storm lies within a federally designated wilderness area, the region is also known for its many homes and resorts and for the diversity of recreational activity it offers. Most importantly for those of us who represent the area is the protection of the lives and property of those who live in and visit this wonderful area of Minnesota. That's why I've insisted that there's an immediate need to reduce the threat of catastrophic fire and provide the Forest Service with the funding it needs to conduct cleanup and fire threat mitigation efforts. 
   I want to take a moment to address the process through which we arrived at this point. As I said earlier, I've been working with the Appropriations Committee for a number of months to secure this important funding. I first wrote to Senator STEVENS on March 15th seeking emergency funding in a supplemental appropriations bill for cleanup activities this year. I then wrote to Senator GORTON on April 12 asking that he include $9.249 million in emergency funding to address the pressing needs of the Superior and Chippewa National Forests. When the Agriculture Appropriations bill passed through the Appropriations Committee, I was pleased that my request had been approved and would soon be before the full Senate. And finally, when the Military Construction Conference Report was brought out of committee, we were successful in getting a $2 million down payment on the $9.249 million and a commitment that the remainder would soon follow in either the Interior bill or in the Agriculture bill. As I said earlier, the agreement reached today between Senators GORTON, BYRD, WELLSTONE and me fulfills the commitment I received almost two weeks ago. 
   There have, however, been some suggestions that the funding we're discussing today had been approved in the House of Representatives and then stripped out by the Senate. However, the House has never passed a single dime in emergency funding for northern Minnesota. I would also like to address claims that the Senate had somehow stripped this money out and ignored the needs of northern Minnesota. I've been in almost constant contact over the past few months with the Senate Leadership and with the Appropriations Committee. I have been assured repeatedly that this money will be available for Minnesota and that the pressing needs in this region of my State would be met no later than on the Agriculture Appropriations bill and hopefully on this bill. I'm grateful that now those needs will be met, consistent with the previous assurances I had received. 
   I would also like to mention that this is not the end, but the beginning of our efforts to ensure the safety and well-being of the people who live in or visit northeastern Minnesota. Reducing the threat of fire, protecting human life and property, and ensuring the continued economic viability of this region of our State should be our number one priority. I intend to see to it that those concerns are addressed by the Federal Government in the coming weeks, months, and years. 
   To that end, I intend to secure, through an amendment I have already filed, additional funding of $6.947 million for blow-down recovery and fire threat reduction efforts in northern Minnesota for fiscal year 2001. 
   As, again, Senator WELLSTONE mentioned, he is joining me on this amendment as well in support of this request. This money will provide the Forest Service in northern Minnesota with the funding they need in the coming fiscal year so that they can continue the cleanup efforts beyond October of this year. This is a massive cleanup effort that will cost millions of dollars and will continue for years past fiscal year 2001. I hope we can reach agreement with Senator GORTON and Senator BYRD to accept this important amendment as soon as possible. 
   Again, I thank Senator GORTON, Senator STEVENS, the staff of the Appropriations Committee, and Senator WELLSTONE for working with me for so many months to secure the funding needed to protect the lives and the property of the people of northern Minnesota. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in strong support of the House legislation that would repeal the death tax for working Americans. I support this bill because death taxes are just basically, bottom line, anti-American, antifamily, antieconomic, and antijob growth. The death taxes are just plain unfair. They are unjust, and they must be eliminated. 
   I know our friends on the other side of the aisle are just so enamored by being able to take some dollars from somebody so they can direct them to the causes they believe are the best. They want to direct where the money goes. They are saying we should take these dollars from these individuals or these families or these groups and bring it to Washington so we can decide in Washington how the money should be spent--not the individual who earned the money, not the trust funds that they might set up. 
   They always throw around the names of Bill Gates, Donald Trump, and Leona Helmsley. I do not see anything wrong with what they have done and what they have contributed. But somehow if they want to direct or control their money, even after death, somehow my friends on the other side of the aisle have a problem with that. In fact, if I am not mistaken, I think Mr. Gates has already set up a huge trust fund of about $20 billion to be given to charitable causes. 
   I hear over there that there would be a reduction in charitable giving. So somehow, if the Government took less of the money from you in taxes, you, in turn, would say: I have more money now, so I am going to give less to charity, or somehow, if the Government takes more from you in taxes, you are going to be more charitable with the little bit you have left. 
   I think the real debate here is, again, fairness, equity, and who is going to  control or direct the money. Are we going to listen and have it all directed from here; That somehow they know better how to spend the money? They want to generate, control, and grow more Government, that it is more efficient, can deliver better services, and is more fair to Americans. 
   To me, this is nothing but greed on behalf of some politicians who want to control people. As I said, even after they are dead, they want to take even more money from them. 
   But their estates give back just a ``little bit'' in taxes. I do not call 55 percent of everything you worked for, and managed to save, put away, a ``little bit.'' Fifty-five percent--give back a ``little bit.'' Or the heirs should be happy to get half of the estate that your family has worked for, for nothing. You have probably been a part of it. And then after death, the Government can come in and grab 55 percent, and you should be happy because you get what is left over. Don't say anything. Just sit there and be happy because the Federal Government, in all its wisdom, is going to direct those dollars to the best causes and, indirectly, somehow they are going to benefit you and every other American. 
   There might be waste, fraud, and abuse going through the systems we have today, but if we only pump a little more money into it, or if we can only create more Government, somehow this is better than allowing an individual to decide how that money is going to be spent, what charities that individual wants to give to, what educational programs they want to support. But, no, somehow it is better if it comes to Washington. 
   But as you know, the Federal death tax is similar to the income tax. It was first imposed as just a temporary measure to finance World War I. Ronald Reagan said: There is nothing more permanent than a temporary Government program. 
   This is just a great example. The excise tax on the telephone--that was just repealed here a little while ago--imposed 100 years ago as a temporary tax is another great example. 
   Here is a temporary tax to help finance World War I. It was temporary. But once people get their hands on the money, they somehow believe they have more of a right to your labor than you do, that somehow they have more of a right to the money that you have worked for or generated than you do. 
   Why? When death taxes became permanent in 1916, estates under $9 million--that is in today's dollars--were not taxed at all. Death taxes later evolved to supposedly prevent the buildup of inherited wealth. The Government wanted to prevent the buildup of inherited wealth. 
   This idea of social engineering has made the death taxes, which now range from 37 percent to 55 percent, substantially higher than any other Federal taxes. The lowest estate tax rate is almost as high as the highest income tax rate, which is now, thanks to President Bill Clinton and the Democratic bill passed in 1993, the highest income tax rate, 39.6 percent. 
   Keep in mind the death taxes are levied on earnings and assets that have already been subject to income, payroll taxes, and other taxes at the Federal and State level. In other words, you have worked all your life. You have paid taxes up front on your income, on your profits. This is moneys that you have taken home after taxes, where you built an estate and somehow now they believe that you should pay just a ``little bit'' more--just a ``little bit''--and, oh, by the way, only on the most wealthy in this country. If you have a farmer with $1 million out there driving a 1975 pickup, and he happens to die unexpectedly, he is among those wealthy individuals that we talk about. 
   Yes, they throw around the names of Bill Gates and Donald Trump, as if somehow they are bad people, but what they do is they try to camouflage the real reason for this bill, and that is, to get their hands on additional moneys. Despite the efforts by liberals, deaths taxes have failed to accomplish their stated purposes and instead have created inequality and injustice that hurts millions of Americans. Instead, this is one of the most expensive taxes imposed, and it does some of the most damage on the individuals who this money is taken from. 
   In fact, I think there are studies out there that have said, if we eliminated the inheritance tax, the estate tax, the death tax, that it would almost be a wash to the Federal Treasury because it costs billions of dollars today to administer because of all the audits and everything that has to be done. 
   It is costing billions of dollars to impose this tax. Then when we look at the damage it does to farms, to small businesses, to individuals, jobs that are lost, businesses that are lost, tax dollars that are lost, of course, in the process, the Government comes out probably a loser. There are many who would bet that if we could eliminate this death tax today, it would not affect the revenues and, in fact, we would probably have even larger economic growth; that the revenues to the Federal Treasury would be even larger because of it. 
   It is a punitive, mean-spirited, unfair, unjust, antijob, antieconomic tax that the other side of the aisle seems to like to impose on Americans, successful Americans or Americans just trying to hang on to their farm or their small business. 
   Let me give a few examples of how death taxes are hurting working Americans. My good friends on the other side of the aisle say they don't want to hear any more of these stories, but we have a lot of these stories because they affect millions of Americans every year. 
   John Batey of Tennessee runs a 500-acre family farm that has been a part of the Batey family for about 192 years. John has spent all of his life on his family's farm and, as most other farmers, he plans to be a good steward of the land, to save and to build his assets and some day leave the farm to his children. 
   After the death of his father 5 years ago and the death of his mother last June, John began to settle his parents' estate. As he was about to take over the family farm, the IRS sent him a death tax bill for a quarter of a million dollars, on a 500-acre farm in Tennessee, a quarter of a million dollar tax bite. The value of the farmland had increased significantly, but the death tax exemption has never been indexed. John had no choice but to sell some other assets. He also had to dip into their life savings and even borrow money to pay Uncle Sam. 
   Now, when we talk about wanting to have a prescription drug benefit, everything else, what kind of a financial shape has it put this family in? It has taken them from being able to pay and make due for themselves and exposed them to financial ruin and the need possibly of having to come to the Government begging for help because we have taken all their money. Now they are in debt, have less of their assets, and their savings are gone so they can pay Uncle Sam this unfair, unjust death tax. Somehow the big spenders in Washington needed that money more than John and his family needed it for their own well-being. 
   The story of Lee Ann Goddard Ferris, who testified during the Senate Finance Committee hearing, is another disheartening story. This isn't the Bill Gates of the world. This isn't Donald Trump, Leona Helmsley. This is Lee Ann Goddard Ferris. Her family owns a cattle ranch in Idaho which prospered through 60 years of hard work by her grandfather and father. By the way, they accumulated this after they paid the taxes on all of their income up to this point. In the fall of 1993, her father was accidentally killed when his clothing got caught in farm machinery. The unexpected death was devastating on the family, but so was the news from their attorney. Later on he told them: There is no way you can keep this place, absolutely no way. They said: Well, how can this be? We own the land. We have no debt. We lost my father, but now how are we going to lose the ranch? We don't have a mortgage on this place. 
   According to Lee Ann, in her testimony before the Finance Committee:  
   Our attorney proceeded to pencil out the estate taxes.......and we all sat back in total shock.  
   When their mother dies, the lawyer told the family, estate taxes will be $3.3 million. I know that is just a little bit, just giving back a little bit of what has been generated by Washington and this great economy, not by the hard work of millions and millions of Americans. You didn't do anything to create this economy. It all came out of here,  out of Washington. You have benefited from it because of the benevolence and the wisdom out of Washington, not your hard work, not your brainpower, but Washington created this environment. We have heard this on the floor, that because Washington has done this, you have been the one who has taken advantage of it. So you should give back just a little bit to help, $3.3 million for a family in Idaho from a cattle ranch, just a little bit. 
   According to Ferris, the family had to sell off a parcel of land. They did this so they could buy a $1 million life insurance policy for her mother in the event that she should suddenly die. That would pay off one-third of the estate tax. The question still is, How will they handle the remaining $2 million? They already had to sell some assets to go out and buy this huge insurance policy. That only takes care of 33 percent. Who will pay the remaining $2 million? Ferris says she doesn't know. When her mother passes away, they are going to have to figure out another way of paying the other $2 million. Will that be in the sale of more of their assets, selling off more of the farm, basically driving them off the land and putting them somewhere else? 
   Timothy Scanlan, from my State of Minnesota, owns a family business. His family has built their business over the last 80 years. Their business has created many jobs. It has offered fine products. Again, they have paid taxes all their lives on everything. You are taxed to death the way it is now; the estate tax just finishes the job. They paid taxes, and they have never asked the Government for a handout. When his father and mother died a few years ago, the estates tax took nearly 60 percent of the value of his family business. Mr. Scanlan says:  
   I am now trying to plan for the fourth generation to take over. As of today, it can't be done. We've worked so hard to create something good that we've created a company that has so much value that we would have to sell it in order to pay the taxes. Families, companies and farmers like us are a small minority working hard for generations only to have our government tax us out of our family business.  
   This isn't Bill Gates. This isn't Donald Trump. This isn't Leona Helmsley. These are average Americans. 
   There are many more stories such as these clearly showing that the death tax has hurt hard-working Americans the most. Not the rich; the rich can hire the lawyers. They can hire the estate planners to avoid all these taxes. We are not talking about tax relief for the wealthy, as some claim. I am not here trying to defend the wealthy. They are going to take care of themselves. It might cost them a couple million dollars to go out and hire people to set up the shelters they need. They will do that. 
   Why are we doing this? Why are we costing millions of dollars in the private sector, billions of dollars in the public 
   sector to try to levy an unfair, unjust, antieconomic tax that hurts millions of Americans? 
   Realizing this injustice, the Republican-controlled Congress began to provide death tax relief in 1997 to farmers and small business owners by increasing the exemption from $600,000 to $1.2 million. When I talked about how increasing taxes of the Federal Government or eliminating the estate tax would almost be a wash, statistics show that about one-third of the surpluses we enjoy today are the direct result of the tax cuts in 1997. It means if we can reduce taxes, the economy grows. The economic pie gets bigger. The economic opportunities are better. The wages can improve. But, no, if you tax something, you get less of it. If that is what we want to do, continue to tax Americans into submission with these death taxes and having to break up or sell their businesses and farms, that is exactly what this unfair tax does. 
   There are crocodile tears about how if we can only collect this money, how much good can we do with this. Washington can do so much good. Just let us collect this tax, just a little bit of it--by the way, 55 percent--let us collect it, and we will continue these great Government programs. In fact, we will even create some new ones to go along with them. 
   Last year, we passed the Taxpayers Refund Act. For the first time ever, we voted to completely repeal the Federal death tax. Despite the fact that the President's own White House conference on small business made death tax repeal a top legislative priority, President Clinton vetoed this tax relief legislation. 
   When I travel around the State of Minnesota, I talk to hundreds of farmers. The one thing they tell me would help them most is the repeal of the death tax. 
   The average age of the majority of the farmers in Minnesota is 58. Within 10 years, there is going to be a tremendous shift of wealth of farmland and farm assets in Minnesota. Right now a lot of those assets are going to go to the Government, and it is going to drive the next generation off the farm because they won't be able to afford to do it. 
   I don't know where those farm assets are going to end up, but, because of this unfair tax, the majority of farmers in Minnesota tell me that would be their No. 1 priority. If we want to help rural America, if we want to help rural Minnesota, rural Wisconsin, the best thing we could do is help these farmers by getting rid of this death tax to allow them to pass their assets from generation to generation. 
   But again, despite the fact that the President's White House Conference on Small Business made the death tax repeal a top legislative priority, President Clinton vetoed this tax relief legislation. This is an administration that does not want to give one dime in tax relief--not one dime. In fact, the President's own bill that he submitted this year, which had a tax relief component included, would actually raise taxes this year by $9 billion. That is the President's version of tax relief. We will raise your taxes $9 billion this year. That is real tax relief. 
   Here is another example of a President who doesn't want less taxes but more taxes. It is supported by our good friends on the other side of the aisle. 
   Our Democratic colleagues insist that a cut in the death tax is a tax cut for the rich, and they ``can hardly justify a costly tax cut that benefits some of the wealthiest taxpayers.'' 
   That is simply wrong. As I said earlier, it is the family farms and the small business owners whom the death tax particularly harms; it is not the rich. That is just cover, a smokescreen. That is the magician saying: Look at this hand, not at what I am doing here with this other hand. Concentrate on the super rich, but don't worry about the average middle-income taxpayer or small businesses. 
   A typical family farm could be valued at several million dollars due to land appreciation and the expensive farm equipment needed. I have said so many times that a farmer can die and can be worth $2 million or $3 million, but it is all in assets, value, and equipment. He has probably never driven a new pickup in his life and has worn his gloves until he can't hold them anymore. Yet, when he dies, he is a millionaire who should ``give just a little bit back.'' Don't pass on the family farm; let Washington have it. 
   Many farms may never even earn a penny of profit. When the head of the household dies, the family can't come up with the money for estate taxes. They don't have a quarter million dollars in cash-flow. Everything they have is normally invested in the farm, in the assets and equipment. But they have to come up with money to pay the estate tax, and that means they have to sell equipment or land--in other words, break up the family farm. 
   This is the main reason we lose about 1,000 family farms each year in my State of Minnesota alone. They are driven out of business because of the estate tax. Are these rich people? No, they are hard-working Americans. I strongly believe Government policies should not punish those who have worked hard and been out there building up farms and businesses. There are many compelling reasons to end this unfair and unjust death tax: 
   First, the American dream is to work hard and make life better for their children. Here, if you work hard and put everything into it, you break your back to do it, if you are successful, they are going to penalize you. You may have built a business from the ground up, brick by brick, acre by acre, founded on persistence and determination, but if you are successful, they are going to break you. 
   Years of hard work eventually pay off. Their business thrives, farms prosper, and when the time comes to retire or leave the world, they are proud to  pass something on to their children. But, wait, there is the tax man. By allowing them to build upon the success their parents and grandparents had achieved, they know they have given their children a good head 
   start--again, until the tax collector steps in to demand Washington's share, taking up to 55 percent of the estate. As the witness said earlier in her testimony before the Finance Committee, her attorney said, ``There is no way you can continue to operate this farm because you have to pay the taxes.'' 
   Once the Federal Government has finished taking its portion of the estate, few family businesses and farms can survive. Their heirs may be forced to sell off all or part of the business --again, just to satisfy the tax bill. All of the years of hard work poured into the creation of a piece of security for their family and their future evaporates. Oh, no, this is only for the rich, for the wealthiest. Again, that is a smokescreen to divert your attention, saying: Good, tax the rich people. But those ``rich'' people are many, many Americans--not a few but many average Americans. 
   Newt Gingrich once said, ``You should not have to visit the undertaker and the tax man on the same day.'' 
   I think Mr. Gingrich was right. Research shows that 70 percent of family businesses do not survive through the second generation. Eighty-seven percent don't make it through the third generation. The death tax is a major factor contributing to the demise of family businesses and, as I said earlier, family farms. Nine out of ten successors whose family-owned businesses failed within 3 years of the principal owner's death said it was trouble paying the estate taxes that contributed to the company's demise. 
   I think Senator BURNS earlier talked about the year after year after year of payments a family had to make to the Government--$14,000 a year, $15,000 a year, $17,000 a year, and their dad had died 13 years earlier. So they were still trying to make a profit and pay the bills and then pay the tax man over and above their other taxes. 
   In fact, under the current tax system, it is cheaper to sell the family-owned business before death--cheaper to sell it before you die--rather than pass the business on to one's heirs. That is what happens a lot of times. You can't afford to die, so you have to sell the business beforehand so you can pay less taxes, and you help your family more than by waiting until you die. 
   No growing business can remain competitive in a tax regime that imposes tax rates as high as 55 percent upon the death of the founder or owner. Clearly, the Nation's estate tax laws penalize those who have worked the hardest to get ahead. Instead of encouraging family-owned businesses, the Federal Government has enacted tax policies that are a barrier to a better economy and better jobs. 
   A good question would be: On what moral ground should the Federal death tax be allowed to continue to punish hard-working Americans? If a death tax is unfair on somebody with a $500,000 estate, or a $50,000 estate, or if it is unfair to somebody with a $2 million estate--and now our good friends on the other side of the aisle say we will even grow that to $10 million--if it is unfair to a $10 million estate, how can it become fair or morally right on anything above that? On what moral ground should the Federal death tax be allowed to continue? 
   Revenue from death taxes accounts for about 1 percent of Federal tax receipts. But the real loss to the Federal Treasury could be much greater. It takes 65 cents to collect every dollar. Again, I told you it is a very expensive tax to go out and try to collect because of all of the auditing and everything 
   that has to be done. So it takes 65 cents to collect a dollar. If we take in $20 billion a year, we have spent about $13 billion to collect it. It is an unfair tax, an immoral tax, which can drive these families out of business; and we lose even more revenue in lost jobs, lost productivity, not to mention the revenue loss from payroll, income, and other taxes when businesses are destroyed and those jobs are lost. 
   The death tax provisions are so complicated that family-owned businesses must spend approximately $33,138 over 6.5 years on attorneys, accountants, and financial experts to assist in estate planning. 
   Eliminating the estate tax would have a nominal impact on Washington's $1.8 trillion budget. When you look at the money we would save and the additional tax revenues, we could probably gain from the payroll and other taxes--and, again, this could be a wash--and we don't disrupt or destroy businesses, lives, and jobs. 
   But by encouraging savings, investing, and the establishment of more family-run businesses, the economic benefits for average Americans would be tremendous. There are many average Americans out there losing their jobs every time one of these businesses has to close or have assets sold off. So it disrupts many people, not just the owners of the business, but many who rely on the business for a livelihood to support their families. 
   Research shows that repeal of death taxes will create more than 275,000 jobs in the next 10 years. It will create 275,000 jobs if we can get rid of the death tax. We heard one claim that somehow there would be a reduction in charitable giving. So, somehow, if the Government takes less, you are not going to give as much to your favorite charity. I think if you had more money in your pocket at the end of the year, you might give more. 
   Americans are the most charitable people in the world, giving tens of billions of dollars a year. But the Government wants to take some of that because the Government, again, can be more benevolent or charitable with your money. 
   I wrote this point down, too. The Democrats said, ``We want to help.'' Who? How? By taking money from some people so they can decide how to disburse it to others, rather than letting the individuals who own the assets make the decisions on charitable giving, whether to their schools, or their alma mater, churches, groups in their community, the Boy Scouts. Billions of dollars a year are distributed this way in charitable giving. 
   I don't think we need the Government to step in and say: No, we can do that better. 
   Again, research shows that repeal of death taxes will create more than 275,000 jobs in the next 10 years; that it will increase the gross domestic product by more than $1 trillion; and it could increase capital stock by $1.7 trillion. 
   It sounds to me as if there is another side of this argument --that getting rid of this unfair, unjust, and immoral tax would actually be an economic benefit to millions of Americans and to the Federal Government, for one. With such economic growth, Federal revenues would grow higher as well. Even Washington would benefit if we could get rid of this tax. But they can't see past the blinds. They say: No, we have to continue to penalize these people; we have to continue to take their money; we dare not to do that. 
   Congress can and should help working Americans keep their family assets by eliminating the damaging estate tax. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote to repeal this tax. 
   In the next few weeks, the Senate will be considering other important legislation to provide meaningful tax relief for working Americans, such as marriage penalty tax relief. I believe all of these efforts are critical to help ease the tax burden on American families against the marriage penalty. 
   Why do they call it a penalty? It is an unfair tax because, if a couple decides to get married, the Government wants to take more money unfairly. It is unjust. The estate tax is not different. 
   I know President Clinton said one time at a news conference a couple of years back, well, it might be an unfair tax but Washington needs the money--something in that respect. I am not quoting him word for word. But that was the gist of it; that somehow Washington needed the money even though it was unfair to take it, or it wasn't the right means of extracting more money from Americans, but somehow Washington needed it. Now we need even more because Washington can do better. 
   I believe all of these efforts, however, are critical. If we can get rid of the death tax and help to ease or eliminate the marriage penalty tax, it would help ease the tax burden on American families. 
   I again quote these numbers. It says here that research shows the repeal of the death tax will create more than  275,000 jobs in the next 10 years. It will increase our gross domestic product by more than $1 trillion. It will increase capital stock by $1.7 trillion. There would be a lot of financial advantages. 
   I also hope in the second reconciliation legislation Congress can consider and pass tax relief for American seniors by repealing all of the taxes on their retirement benefits. 
   Again, this administration and this President decided to increase taxes on the senior citizens receiving Social Security. They increased their taxes in 1993. That is another tax that I think we should repeal. 
   We talk about seniors not having enough money; that they have to decide between meals and medicine. They have to do that because Washington has decided to take more of their money. We need to repeal that tax on our senior citizens as well. 
   I challenge President Clinton to sign these tax relief measures into law so the American people can keep a little more of their own money for their own priorities and so they can make the decisions on how that should be done. 
   Again, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in support of repealing the estate tax--the death tax--along with these other taxes to give Americans the ability to keep a little more of their hard-earned money. 
   I thank the President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the devastating storms of last week that are affecting much of northwestern Minnesota. We are experiencing some of the worst flash flooding in over 100 years. These storms dumped more than 7 inches of rain in the Moorhead, Minnesota and Fargo, North Dakota area in an eight-hour period, swamping hundreds of basements, and streets, and acres of farm land. 
   This past weekend, I had the opportunity to see first hand the effects of the storm when I visited the communities of Ada, Borup, Perley, Hendrum, and Moorhead. Actually, I had originally planned before the storm on being in the area to celebrate the grand opening of the Ada Hospital following its destruction during the Floods of 1997. Just three short years ago, Ada was hit with the worst flooding in 500 years. They are still recovering from that flood. 
   How do you explain floods like these? They don't just happen once in a while contrary to reports of 100 or even 500-year floods, they've been happening every year in northwestern Minnesota. Last year, Ada experienced severe hail storms and a Labor Day flood. In 1998, there were three floods in February, May and June. In 1997, of course, there was the huge flood in the Red River Valley. 
   Swollen from the heavy rains, the Wild Rice River became a huge pool of water 25 miles wide and 30 miles long that flowed steadily overland through northwestern Minnesota, drowning millions of dollars worth of crops in its path. The pool developed as heavy runoff collected at higher elevations in Becker and Mahnomen counties, then flowed into the Red River Valley toward Ada. You have to realize that this land is very flat, dropping only about one foot per mile, so the water moves slowly, but causes severe crop damage. Several rivers converge and flood prevention measures have failed to funnel excess water into the Red River. I intend to work with representatives from the watershed districts, and the Army Corps of Engineers to see whether past flood control measures have resulted in what has become constant flooding in this area of northwest Minnesota and what can be done to alleviate this problem in the future. I saw fields with three or four feet of water that had been planted with wheat, soybeans, and sugar beets earlier this year. Now, these crops are all destroyed, and the stench of rotting crops has begun. 
   Earlier this week, Governor Ventura declared this area a state of emergency so that federal, state and local emergency management officials can work together to assess the damage and see whether federal assistance will be required. As if this wasn't enough, eight counties in southeastern Minnesota were declared emergency areas and Governor Ventura has asked the federal government for money to help with their recovery following rainstorms of May 17th. I was happy to support the Governor's request and to learn that President Clinton has declared this region a disaster so that they are eligible for federal funding. This region of Minnesota received 5 to 7 inches of rain on May 17th, followed by another heavy storm May 31. Since then, even small rainfalls have resulted in overflows and drainage problems. 
   It's too early to tell the extent of the damage in northwestern Minnesota. Preliminary estimates include damage to 430 houses, primarily in the Moorhead area, and $10 million damage to crops in Becker and Mahnomen counties. 
   But losses will go much higher. The greatest crop damage appears to be in Clay and Norman counties. There, crops have been damaged or destroyed on more than 500 square miles of land, according to county officials. That could mean $50 million in lost crops, and half that again in out-of-pocket planting costs. 
   Flooding remains a serious blow to farmers in Minnesota. There are about 300 commercial farmers left in Norman County in northwestern Minnesota. They've been losing 20 or 30 farms every year recently. It's too late to plant any cash crops in that part of the state. Some farmers will plant a ``cover crop'' to control erosion; others simply will try to control weeds and start planning for next year. 
   As in every disaster that my state has faced, I've been inspired once again by the people of Minnesota, who rally together for their communities when tragedy strikes. It's during critical times such as these that we finally understand the importance of neighbor helping neighbor. At a time when we all too often fail to make the effort to get to know and appreciate our neighbors, Minnesotans in a great many of our communities have formed lasting bonds over this past week and found their civic spirit has been restored. 
   Mr. President, I intend to work with Governor Ventura to examine the need for federal funding to help those Minnesotans devastated by this most recent flooding. I also want to work with the Governor, the Farm Services Administration, and the Department of Agriculture in anticipation of federal funding needs for farmers who have had severe crop losses. I stand together with my colleagues in the Minnesota delegation, and with our colleagues from North Dakota who are facing destruction in their states equal to our own. When disaster strikes, we are not Republicans or Democrats. We are representatives of the people, and we will do whatever we must to protect our citizens when their lives, homes and property are threatened.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to discuss an issue that has become increasingly important to many in Congress. As an early sponsor of legislation to provide prescription drug coverage under Medicare, I am pleased there has been progress in reaching an agreement among many proposals to provide prescription drug benefits to seniors. 
   Medicare recently celebrated its 35th anniversary. As with most things in life this program is now starting to show its age. Still being administered under a model developed in 1965, Medicare is quickly becoming antiquated and blind to the many advances in modern medicine. We all know prescription drugs play an increasingly important role in the health of our nation. 
   There are countless examples of drugs which now allow us to live longer, more productive lives. Drugs to control blood pressure, lower cholesterol, or mitigate the effects of a stroke are a few which demonstrate the measurable impact research and development can have on improving our lives. Unfortunately, the Medicare program has not progressed as rapidly as medicine. 
   To that end, I introduced the Medicare Ensuring Prescription Drugs for Seniors Act, or MEDS. My bill was an early attempt to heighten the debate surrounding prescription drugs, and at the same time provide a plan that would address the needs of the nearly one third of senior citizens in this country who currently lack any form of prescription coverage. We have all heard the frightening stories of the choices that many seniors are forced to make when it comes to paying for prescription drugs. Unfortunately, many of these stories have been politicized and used to stir the political cauldron over the past several months. But the reality is that decisions between food, shelter, and medicine are all too common among our neediest seniors. MEDS was introduced to help these people. 
   My plan would add a prescription benefit under the already existing Part B of Medicare, without creating or adding any new overly bureaucratic component to the Medicare program. It works like this: The part B beneficiary would have the opportunity to access the benefit as long as they were Medicare eligible. Those with incomes below 135 percent of the nation's poverty level would be provided the benefit without a deductible and would only be responsible for a 25 percent co-payment for all approved medications. 
   My bill also provides relief for seniors above the 135 percent income threshold who may face overwhelming drug costs because of the number of prescriptions they take or the relative costs of them, by paying for 75 percent of the costs after a $150 monthly deductible is met. Most importantly, this voluntary benefit does not have a treatment cap. Unlike both the President's plan and others currently being debated in Congress, MEDS covers all participating beneficiaries no matter what level of monthly or annual drug expenditure they incur and does not abandon seniors when they need help the most. 
   The House of Representatives narrowly passed a prescription drug bill that subsidizes the insurance industry and attempts to ensure coverage in all areas of the country--a difficult if not impossible task. The biggest problem with this approach is that the insurance industry has stated that it wouldn't be able or willing to provide these types of ``stand alone'' policies no matter how much of a subsidy they receive. Trying to establish an enormously expensive and administratively difficult plan built on the mere hope that the insurance industry will change its mind, is simply too big a risk to take when it comes to our nations seniors. 
   The House bill would establish a new outside agency through the Department of Health and Human Services to administer the plan. Not only will this compound the problem of administration, implementation and increasing federal bureaucracy, but it also actually delays benefits that will help our seniors today. There is no way a major new bureaucracy can be created and become effective in time to provide the help our seniors need now. At a minimum, based on similar initiatives in the past, it would take two years to gear up this kind of new government agency, which again, only duplicates existing federal bureaucracy and slows progress toward meaningful reform. 
   It's important these facts are understood as we continue discussing emerging plans for a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. How a plan is structured could have dramatic consequences for future innovations in treatments which can enhance quality of life and in some cases save lives. If done right, we'll enable all senior citizens to access the best health care system in the world and receive the latest technology and treatment for their conditions--and do it in a way that is both responsible and expedient. MEDS accomplishes both of these goals. 
   In closing Mr. President, let me say, as I have in the past, the challenge before us today is to enable Medicare to shape and adapt itself to reflect the realities of an ever changing health care system. After 35 years of endless tinkering, we have a real opportunity to make it more responsive, more helpful, and more attuned to the needs of current and future retirees and disabled persons in this country through the provision of a prescription drug benefit. This is a goal to which I am wholly committed.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I come to the floor to recognize the birthday of one of the most important programs known to the American people today: Medicare. Thirty-five years ago this week, the Medicare program was established in order to provide timely, quality health care coverage for America's retirees and the disabled. Today, the Medicare system still serves this country well, and I believe issues relating to its modernization, long-term solvency, and improvement should be among our top priorities in this legislative session. 
   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 had a tremendously detrimental effect on provider payments under Medicare and on the organizations that deliver daily care to our seniors. The provisions in the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) relating to Medicare were designed to gradually help control costs to the program. Instead, the result has been an affront to organizations fighting for their existence. As a Member of the Senate, I meet with people daily from Minnesota who come to detail their concerns, their frustrations, and the impact the BBA continues to have on their institutions. These are institutions serving all segments of the healthcare industry, including inpatient and outpatient hospital care, skilled nursing facilities, home health care and emergency medical services. 
   Prior to the BBA, my state of Minnesota already experienced one of the lowest capitation, or reimbursement rates, in the country, so the BBA and additional reductions in Medicare payment strategies have taken an enormous toll in my state. In fact, the situation has become so dire for so many institutions, providers and patients that the Minnesota Attorney General and the Minnesota Senior Federation have filed a lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services in an effort to restructure payment schedules and capitation rates under Medicare Part C, or Medicare +Choice. 
   As I was working on my statement for today, I glanced across my desk and came across an advertisement that I think is relevant. The advertisement reads: ``Where Will Our Patients Go?'' It cites a new study conducted by Ernst & Young showing that between 1998 and 2000, hospital operating margins in the United States declined from 5.5 percent to 2.6 percent, a reduction of more than 50 percent in 2000. During that same period, hospitals' operating margins on services to Medicare patients declined from 2.5 percent in 1998 to negative 0.5 percent in 2000. Negative 0.5 percent. Translation: every Medicare patient that walks through the door of our hospitals and clinics cannot continue down this path of payment reduction while continuing to provide timely, quality health care services to our seniors and the disabled. 
   I raise these issues to emphasize the measurable consequences of legislative efforts to date, and to outline the challenges we face when attempting to add a prescription drug benefit onto an already ailing Medicare system. That is why during the budget process, I, along with Senator ABRAHAM and several of our colleagues, sent a letter to the budget resolution conferees requesting that language be included in the final report ensuring that any Medicare reforms, including the addition of a prescription drug benefit, would not be implemented at the expense of the provider 
   payment rates that are in drastic need of restoration. 
   The simple fact is that Medicare does require reform. What form that will ultimately take is really the question. Clearly, Congress has taken steps to reinvigorate Medicare since passage of BBA including: the Balanced Budget Refinement Act, which in a broad sense returned funds to hospitals for outpatient services; the Hatch bill, which reduced the arbitrary caps on complicated cases in skilled nursing facilities; and the American Hospital Preservation Act, which currently addresses the other half of the hospital equation inpatient services. But these are only band-aids applied to a system that needs comprehensive reform or modernization, including a prescription drug benefit. 
   As you know, the Bipartisan Commission to Reform Medicare, under the direction of Congressman BILL THOMAS, and Senators BREAUX and FRIST, advocated dramatic reform in order to better position Medicare in the future and enhance the benefits offered under the program. Their plan relied heavily on  the injection of private-sector competition in managing benefits. My sense is, whatever additional reforms we pursue in Congress need to incorporate this kind of private-sector approach. By allowing the private sector to compete for the business of Medicare beneficiaries, both the Medicare system and the beneficiaries under it would stand to benefit from greater choice and greater flexibility when it comes to meeting their health care needs. 
   In fact, Senators BREAUX and Senator FRIST have recently drafted a new proposal: Breaux-Frist 2000, the Incremental Bipartisan Medicare Reform and Prescription Drug Proposal. The proposal calls for a new Medicare agency outside of the Health Care Financing Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services, which would administer the competitive relationship between traditional Medicare Fee for Service plans and private plans, and would include a prescription drug benefit. 
   Is this ultimately the approach we should take? I do not know. However, I am committed to exploring efforts like these that place a premium on reform or modernization, while attempting to improve benefit levels for beneficiaries through private-sector competition. 
   One of the important improvements that has received a lot of attention lately is the provision of a prescription drug benefit. I think most of us would agree that were Medicare to be developed today, it would include a benefit of this type. Now, I am not a pharmacologist, nor am I a medical doctor, so when I first introduced my own prescription drug plan for Medicare over a year ago, I was amazed at the discoveries that have taken place in this area. The most remarkable thing to me is that not only do many of these new, innovative products slow the rates of disease progression, but they often create measurable differences in the number of emergency room visits, expensive and invasive procedures, and even deaths. Prescription drugs today have an enormous financial impact in terms of reducing overall health care costs over the long term and should be incorporated into the Medicare system. 
   To that end, I introduced the Medicare Ensuring Prescription Drugs for Seniors Act, or MEDS. My bill was an early attempt to heighten the debate surrounding prescription drugs, and at the same time provide a plan that would address the needs of the nearly one third of senior citizens in 
   this country who currently lack any form of prescription coverage. We have all heard the frightening stories of the choices that many seniors are forced to make when it comes to paying for prescription drugs. Unfortunately, many of these stories have been used to stir the political cauldron over the past several months. But the reality is that making choices between food, shelter, and medicine is all too common among our neediest seniors. MEDS was introduced to help these people. 
   My plan would add a prescription benefit under the already existing Part B of Medicare, without creating or adding any new overly bureaucratic component to the Medicare program. It works like this: The Part B beneficiary would have the opportunity to access the benefit as long as they were Medicare eligible. Those with incomes below 135 percent of the nation's poverty level would be provided the benefit without a deductible and would only be responsible for a 25 percent co-payment for all approved medications. I think the neediest American seniors who are Medicare eligible should be able to access the benefits of medical technology like everyone else, and while they will be responsible for 25 percent of the costs, I believe the benefit will reduce the necessity for tough decisions between food and medicine. Most important, MEDS has no benefit cap. This allows seniors to access the care they need when they need it, for as long as they need it. 
   My bill also provides relief for seniors above the 135 percent threshold who may be facing overwhelming prescription drug costs because of the number of medications they take, or the relative expense of them, by paying for 75 percent of the costs after a $150 monthly deductible is met. A provision of this type, in addition to the fact that there is no cap on the benefit, is necessary for those who confront high monthly prescription costs. 
   An important part of my plan is that it is not universal and will not displace anyone from the private insurance coverage that they currently have and probably prefer. Rather, it is offered to provide prescription coverage to those who really need it. 
   Is MEDS perfect? Will it appeal to everyone? Maybe not. But it includes principles that I believe must be included in order for any prescription drug bill to hit its mark. 
   In closing, Mr. President, let me say that the challenge before us today is to enable Medicare to shape and adapt itself to reflect the realities of an ever-changing health care system. After 35 years of endless tinkering, we have a real opportunity to make it more responsive, more helpful, and more attuned to the needs of current and future retirees and disabled persons in this country. I can think of no better birthday gift for a program that has served so many--and for the aging, baby-boom generation--than a reinvigorating shot in the arm to Medicare that will deliver it into the twenty-first century and keep it healthy for years to come. This is something to which I am wholly committed.

   Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, fifty-five years ago, the members of the United Nation's founding delegation met in San Francisco for the signing ceremony that created the U.N. There was great anticipation and a collective enthusiasm for this new, global institution. Delegates spoke of hope, of expectation, of the promise of peace. President Truman echoed the thoughts of those founding members when he told the delegates they had, ``created a great instrument for peace and security and human progress in the world.'' Fifty-five years later, the United Nations is struggling to meet its potential. 
   As Chairman of the International Operations Subcommittee which has U.N. oversight responsibilities and having been appointed by the President to  serve two terms as a Congressional Delegate to the U.N., I have focused significant attention on the United Nations. On the anniversary of the signing of the U.N. Charter, I think it is appropriate to take time for us all to reflect on that important institution.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today, on the 66th anniversary of the National Credit Union Act being signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, to salute the Nation's credit unions and acknowledge their important contributions. 
   Prior to 1934, collective pools of employees gathered their assets to assist them in acquiring credit and improving their financial futures. The first credit union in the United States was established in 1909, as the only financial institution available to low-income workers who wanted to save their wages and receive short-term consumer loans. 
   In the spring of 1925, the Minneapolis postal employees collectively began Minnesota's first credit union with 15 workers attending the initial meeting. Started with a total of $146.25 in assets, the Minneapolis Postal Employees Credit Union, now called the US Federal Credit Union, has survived through times of economic hardship such as the Depression of the 1930s and World War II. 
   Today, the Federal Credit Union System has well over $300 billion in assets, and some 67 million Americans enjoy membership in credit unions nation-wide. Credit unions bring together people with common employers, ethnic backgrounds, or geographic areas. They have positively impacted economic growth in the United States by increasing Americans' access to credit through a system of cooperative organizations which have helped stabilize America's credit structure. 
   The credit union philosophy of ``people helping people'' continues to provide many rural and economically depressed areas with the financial tools and confidence necessary for success. In my state of Minnesota, more than 195 credit unions not only provide mortgages, loans, and financial savings opportunities, but also bring their communities together to raise money for programs such as ``Credit Unions for Kids.'' This effort is a collaboration of credit unions and business partners benefitting 170 Children's Miracle Network-affiliated hospitals serving 14 million kids nation-wide. 
   Minnesota credit unions also provide funds for the Minnesota Credit Union Foundation, a non-profit corporation organized to serve charitable, scientific and educational purposes with special emphasis on credit union-related activities. Funds are used to provide disaster relief efforts for credit union members, develop credit unions in emerging nations, and supply scholarships to educational training programs. 
   Mr. President, as a member of a credit union myself, I would like to thank America's credit unions on this anniversary for their constant and continuous efforts to assist the men and women of their communities overcome life's financial obstacles and build a more secure future for themselves and their families.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as hate-crimes legislation was recently debated and voted on by the United States Senate, I would like to briefly explain my vote on this issue. I believe that all victims of crime, and most certainly victims of violent crime, are deserving of special status. After due process has been afforded and guilt determined, perpetrators of crimes should be punished speedily for the peace of the community and to bring some measure of resolution for the victim. However, creating different classifications of victims, and rendering punishment based upon such classifications threatens the notion of ``Equal Justice Under Law,'' the principle that adorns the United States Supreme Court building and should suffuse our entire legal system. 
   Violence itself, whether motivated by hate, revenge, greed, lust, envy, or some other evil motivation, threatens the peace of our communities and our citizens' sense of security. The Kennedy amendment would include minor crimes against property within the definition of hate crimes, but would not have included such heinous acts as the Oklahoma City federal building bombing, or the school shooting at Columbine High School, both of which left lasting, painful memories for the local communities in Oklahoma and Colorado, and even the Nation as a whole. 
   Rather than focusing on the particular motivation of the criminal, Congress and the states should provide law enforcement officials the resources necessary to fully prosecute all crimes. The diligent enforcement of existing laws will serve as an effective deterrent against criminal acts motivated by bigotry and hate, or any other distasteful compulsion. A more comprehensive strategy than what is embodied in the Kennedy amendment is warranted in light of the fact that in 1998 there were 16,914 murders committed in the United States (an average of 46 every day), and of the 16,914, only thirteen were deemed to be hate crimes. 
   I supported the Hatch amendment, which studies how extensive the hate crimes problem is and whether these heinous crimes are being fairly and aggressively prosecuted in the same manner as other similar crimes. I also welcome the Justice Department technical and financial assistance to states which need help in pursuing and identifying hate crimes. This is a far better role for the federal government than moving to federalize all state actions against hate crimes. 
   The Kennedy amendment also raised concerns by experts about constitutionality. Ultimately, it threatened to create more problems in the criminal justice system than it purported to solve, and I consequently voted ``no'' on the amendment and yes on the more reasonable Hatch amendment. I pledge to my constituents that I will support aggressive state prosecution of hate crimes, and I will continue to work to maintain safe communities, including actively supporting legislation that furthers that end.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I will take a few minutes this morning to talk about an industry that is very important to the State of Minnesota, and that is our dairy industry. 
   June is National Dairy Month, and I come to the floor today to pay tribute to the family farmers who rise early every morning to supply fresh milk to our Nation. We as consumers assume there will always be dairy products in our grocery stores, without considering the hard work that is a daily requirement to get them there. 
   I grew up on a dairy farm myself, and I can remember those early morning milkings before going to school and again, of course, when I got home. I don't take for granted the hard work required of dairy farmers to make a living. Unfortunately, for Minnesota dairy producers, it is becoming harder  and harder just to make a living. The dairy compact in New England, which sets a price floor for that region, is spurring overproduction that is spilling over into the Midwest and is depressing the price received by Minnesota farmers. 
   Previously, I have come to the floor to address the false claims that dairy compacts somehow are necessary to ensure a consistent supply of milk to certain areas of the country, and also the assertion that dairy compacts save small family farms. Today, I want to turn to the claim that the overproduction that results from dairy compacts does not impact producers in noncompact regions of the country. 
   It is basic economics that if you want more of a particular commodity produced, then you should subsidize its production. And it follows that if you want more milk produced, you set a floor price for it, and the volume of production will predictably expand. This may initially sound somewhat harmless, but the overproduction from dairy compact States has to go somewhere. It is currently going into noncompact markets for milk, cheese, butter, and powder, and that is mainly the Midwest. Dairy producers within the Northeast Compact currently receive a floor price of $16.94 per hundredweight for beverage milk, and you could never run enough ``Got Milk?'' commercials to increase beverage consumption in the Northeast Compact region sufficient to offset the excess production that results from this minimum price. So the consequence is that the excess flows into the markets traditionally served by noncompact producers--or, basically, dairy farmers in the Midwest--driving down the prices that our dairy farmers receive because of the oversupply of milk. 
   To provide some context, upper Midwest dairy farmers largely produce for cheese markets. Approximately 86 percent of the milk produced in the Midwest goes into the production of cheese. I come from a State that has a comparatively small population and, thus, only a small portion of the milk produced by dairy farmers in Minnesota is consumed as a beverage. Our dairy farmers' livelihood depends on the income they receive in the cheese markets. The current price they receive is being, again, driven down, depressed by the influx of milk coming in from New England, again, because of the compact and the floor price for milk there that results from an artificially high compact price. 
   Following implementation of the compact back in 1997, New England milk production and milk powder production has increased 
   rapidly in response to these higher prices--just, again, basic economics. New England milk production actually rose more than three times the rate of growth in production in the United States as a whole. So dairy farmers in New England were producing milk at a rate three times faster in growth than the rest of the country. This increased production in New England, combined with falling milk consumption in the region due to the higher consumer prices--again, basic economics; you drive the price up, you get less purchases--set in place by the compact, again, resulted in regional surpluses that have been converted to milk powder. 
   In fact, in the first year of the compact, New England powder production soared by 43 percent, which accounted for most of the increase in U.S. powder production during that year. The combination of increased production and lower milk consumption in the compact States due to higher prices, again, has created milk surpluses. That drives down milk prices for farmers outside of the New England compact. So it is directly hurting farmers in the Midwest. It also floods national markets with nonbeverage dairy products that compete with dairy products produced outside of the compact region.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, Valley Forge, Gettysburg, Normandy, Pusan, Panama, and Kuwait are well-known names in our nation's history. I proudly rise to honor an American institution that has proven its unparalleled greatness time and again in battles such as these. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing today as the 225th anniversary of the U.S. Army. 
   When the Second Continental Congress established the U.S. Army on June 14, 1775, it set forth an organization that has repeatedly faced adversity straight in the eye and never backed down. From fulfilling the promises of the Declaration of Independence to countering Saddam Hussein's aggression in Kuwait, the Army's dedication to our nation's bedrock values and its protection of our cherished freedoms has been exemplary. For more than two centuries, Army personnel have rallied to both defend our American shores and ensure the rights of citizens around the world. 
   The role of a soldier has changed drastically over the Army's rich, 225-year history. Technological and political changes have altered the battlefield landscape, but the core principles the Army consistently upholds have not changed. Those principles were captured by General Douglas MacArthur in his 1962 address at West Point:  
   Duty, honor, country: Those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can be, what you will be. They are your rallying point to build courage when courage seems to fail, to regain faith when there seems to be little cause for faith, to create hope when hope becomes forlorn.  
   While many of the Army's accomplishments have been in battle, others have come during pivotal moments of peace. Since its inception, the Army has been instrumental in humanitarian and disaster relief efforts that have helped countless citizens in their greatest time of need. By helping tornado victims throughout the American Midwest or assisting in the flood-ravaged areas of Mozambique, Army personnel serve honorably. 
   The Army has a long history of turning ordinary men and women into distinguished soldiers. Currently, there are about 480,000 soldiers on active duty, comprising the premier fighting force in the world. Whether it is the most senior Army general or the soldier standing guard at the North Korean border, the quality of our soldiers is unsurpassed. It is consistently proven that the investment we make in our military personnel today reaps the leaders of tomorrow. 
   One of my highest priorities here in Congress is maintaining the strength of that important investment, because it is crucial to our future. At the very root of our national security is the well-being of our soldiers. This includes supplying the best technologically advanced equipment in the world and ensuring our Armed Forces are funded at levels that adequately compensate our dedicated servicemen and women. 
   The dedication and sacrifices demonstrated by millions of Army veterans must never be forgotten, nor should their needs be neglected; honoring the commitments this nation has made to its veterans is vital. 
   As we celebrate the Army's 225th anniversary today, I encourage all Americans to reflect on the blanket of freedoms we are blessed with, thanks to the sacrifices made by those who valiantly heed the call of duty by serving in the United States Army, both in war and peacetime. I am proud to join my colleagues in congratulating the Army on this impressive milestone.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr President, I would like to pay tribute today to Special Agent Donald (Dee) Levin on his retirement from the Federal Bureau of Investigation after 29 years of service. In 1967, shortly after graduating from the University of Minnesota, Dee joined the Marine Corps, where he served in Vietnam. Dee began his career with the FBI in 1971, starting out in the Indianapolis and Detroit offices before moving to Minnesota in 1980. Since then, he has worked in the Minneapolis field office as the technical coordinator. 
   The FBI is a worldwide leader in crime investigation and crime solving. The respect commanded by the FBI is due in large part to the individual agents, like Dee, who serve with honor and integrity in their duty to make the United States a safer place to live. 
   Dee will be very busy in his retirement. As new grandparents, Dee and his wife Judy look forward to spending time with their family and remaining active in their church, Galilee Lutheran. 
   I admire Dee's dedication to the FBI and on behalf of all Minnesotans, I thank him for his service.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I thank Chairman WARNER for his help and leadership in accepting my amendment to help our National Guard and Reserves. Without his steadfast support for our military personnel, the changes being endorsed in my amendment would not be possible. 
   In an attempt to maintain a strong national defense despite budget cuts, the President has increasingly asked the Guard and Reserves to make up the difference. Work days contributed by reservists have risen from 1 million days in 1992, to over 13 million days last year. If you look at the Armed Forces personnel participating in the Bosnia and Kosovo operations, 33 percent are members of the Guard and Reserves in Bosnia and 22 percent in Kosovo. The National Guard can provide many of the same services as the active duty personnel at a fraction of the cost. But what impact does this have on Guardsmen, Reservists, and their families? 
   I support the total force concept, but I don't believe we can afford to balance DoD's budget on the backs of our citizen soldiers and airmen. That's why I introduced this amendment to the Defense Authorization bill, along with Senators MCCAIN, ALLARD, SESSIONS, ASHCROFT, WARNER, and LEVIN. 
   My amendment addresses quality of life issues. It extends space required travel to the National Guard and Reserves for travel to duty stations both inside and outside of the United States. It also provides the same space available travel privileges for the Guard, Reserves, and dependents that the armed forces provides to retired military and their dependents. My amendment gives them the same priority status and billeting privileges as active duty personnel when traveling for monthly drills. It raises the annual reserve retirement point maximum, upon which retirement pensions are based, from 75 to 90. Finally, it will extend free legal services to Selected Reservists by Judge Advocate General officers for a time equal to twice the length of their last period of active duty service. 
   I believe the dramatic increase in overseas active-duty assignments for reserve members merits the extension of military benefits for our Nation's citizen soldiers. It is only fair to close these disparities. This amendment would restore fairness to Guard and Reserve members, and it would strengthen our national defense and increase our military readiness by alleviating many of the recruitment and retention problems. 
   These are difficult days, without clear and easy answers. But I'm glad that, as we often have during trying times, we're able to turn to the men and women of the National Guard and Reserves to help ease the way. We must not forget their sacrifices. For in the words of President Calvin Coolidge, ``the nation which forgets its defenders will itself be forgotten.''

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to take time today to again talk about what I think is one of the most important issues facing Americans this year, and probably in the next few years; that is, what is the future of Social Security? How are we going to make sure we have a safe and sound retirement system not only for those on retirement today and those about to retire, but also for our children and our grandchildren? 
   I have held around the State of Minnesota more than 50 townhall meetings trying to outline the problems facing Social Security today, and a plan I have introduced called the Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act, which would move from a pay-as-you-go system to a fully-funded, market-based personal retirement accounts. 
   When you look back at the last 65 years of Social Security, it has basically done the job we have asked it to do; that is, to provide retirement benefits for millions of Americans. But if you look ahead to the next 30 years, the system has problems. It is facing some real problems. It is being strained to the limit. In fact, there will not be enough dollars collected in the system to pay the benefits the Government has promised. If the Congress does nothing, Social Security benefits will have to be reduced as much as one-third or more over the next 25 years. 
   The biggest risk to Social Security is to do nothing. And there are those who are willing to stick their heads in the sand maybe to get by another election and to ignore the problems facing Social Security. 
   Let me go through some of these things very quickly. 
   When Franklin Delano Roosevelt introduced Social Security in 1935, he had concerns that it would only be run by the Government. He wanted part of it to be private accounts. In fact, there was many Americans who were allowed to stay outside of Social Security. In fact, there have been a number of state and local governments over the years--as late as 1981--that saw this loophole, opted out of Social Security, and created their own personal retirement accounts. None of them, by the way, has failed; all have been successful. By that I mean they are paying better benefits to their retirees than Social Security is paying to our retirees today. 
   President Roosevelt also said that there should be a three-legged stool for Americans' retirement: personal savings, pension, and Social Security. Social Security is just one of the legs. It was never meant to be the sole source of retirement benefits. But for millions of Americans today--when they are paying an average tax bill of nearly 40 percent of their wages in taxes, then they try to raise their family; buy food, clothing, shelter; put a little money away for vacations, and for education for their kids, et cetera--they do not have money left to save for their retirement. If you work for an employer that doesn't have a pension or 401(k), your only source of retirement is Social Security. Clearly, Social Security has stretched to its limit. 
   Right now, 78 million baby boomers are ready to hit the system by the year 2008. The majority of Americans--nearly 90 percent--retire at the age of 62, not at 65. We are going to see baby boomers bumping into the system beginning as early as 2008. Social Security spending will exceed tax revenues by 2015. 
   We hear about all of these surpluses in Social Security and the trust fund. 
   But the truth is there is nothing in the trust fund but IOUs. Senator FRITZ HOLLINGS of South Carolina says there is no trust, and there are no funds in the Social Security trust funds. He is right. 
   By 2015 there will be no more surpluses. In other words, if we are collecting $100 today and only spending $90, the other $10 is put into this trust fund. Of course, the Government borrows the surplus and spends it. By the year 2015, we will be bringing in $90 and paying out $100 or more. Where do we get the extra money? We are going to have to get it from the taxpayers. By 2015, taxes are going to have to be raised to cash in these IOUs in order to pay the benefits at that time. 
   You hear a lot of Senators and others saying the system is solvent until 2037. That is only if we can raise taxes on workers to pay those benefits. That is the only way it can remain solvent. Congress is going to have to take action. The Social Security trust fund is going to be broke in 2037 unless we have the dollars to cash in those IOUs. The reason is our pay-as-you-go retirement system cannot meet the challenge of the demographic change. 
   In 1940, there were about 100 working for every retiree. Today, there are a little over 2.5. By the year 2025, there will be fewer than 2. In 1940, with 100 people working, you only had to pay $10 a month to pay for a $1,000 benefit. Today, it is over $400. And we are going to ask our grandchildren to pay $500 or more in order to meet this obligation of retirement benefits. 
   If you look over the next 75 years, it is going down like a rock. There is $21.6 trillion in unfunded liabilities. In other words, the benefits the Government has promised to pay--$21.6 trillion--are short of revenues we need to pay those benefits. 
   How are we going to make them up? There are a couple of choices. We can raise taxes and tinker a little bit with the system. But you cannot tinker with $21.6 trillion deficit. They can cut benefits by a third of what retirees can expect to get. Or they can raise the retirement age. But that will not be enough to make up the $21.6 trillion in deficits over the next 75 years if we don't do make hard choice to save the system. 
   My plan, the Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act, has a transitional cost as well. But it is the cost we have to pay anyway. It would cost about $13 trillion for us to make the transition to go from the Social Security system we know today to total personal retirement accounts. In other words, we are moving to a system where you have control over your retirement--not Washington--you decide when to retire, how much you want save and where you want to invest and how you want to control over your account. 
   In reality, we have signed our name to a long-term contract that says we are going to guarantee retirement benefits for Americans forever. There is a cost because we have dug ourselves into a hole. Somehow we have to dig ourselves out. There is no free lunch. People around here can ignore it, but there is no free lunch. We are going to have to find a way to finance ourselves to reach our goals to have a safe, solid, and solvent Social Security system.  The biggest risk is doing nothing at all. 
   Social Security has a total unfunded liability of $21 trillion-plus. The trust fund has nothing but IOUs. Vice President Gore said let's pay down the debt and let's put the interest we save into the trust fund. But all he is talking about is adding more IOUs, not building assets in the Social Security trust funds. Instead, today, we have over $800 billion of IOUs, but in 15 years, he wants to have $3.5 trillion worth of IOUs--no real assets, but IOUs. 
   Again, the only way you can get those IOUs cashed in is to go to the taxpayers and get more taxes from them. 
   To keep paying Social Security benefits, we are going to probably have to look at least at doubling the FICA tax--the withholding tax--within the near future; not 15.3 percent. By the year of 2025 or 2030, we could see our payroll tax rates increase to 25 percent to 30 percent of wages--nearly doubling the FICA tax in order to maintain the current benefits we promised. 
   I ask many of our senior citizens at our town meetings to raise their hands if they think they have good retirement benefits from Social Security. If you talk about a $700 check a month, or a $680 check a month, or $1,100 a month, this is not good retirement. This is not the retirement I want. I don't think this is the retirement we want to leave to our children. But in order to maintain even that system, we are going to impose taxes on the next generation. If you have 25 percent in FICA taxes, then you add on the average Federal Government tax of 28 percent or 53 percent, and then add in Minnesota sales tax of 8.5 percent, you are at 62 percent. Then add in sales taxes, property and excise taxes--I mean every tax you can think of--our kids are going to be paying taxes that approach 70 percent of their income. 
   Mr. President, is this the kind of future we want to leave our kids because we stick our head in the sand and do not want to face our problems? 
   Why is Social Security a bad investment today? If a taxpayer retired in 1960, they probably got back all the money they paid in in 18 months. It was a tremendous return for the early retirees. Today, an average person retiring will get less than 2 percent return on his or her money paid into the system. Our minority population is actually getting a negative rate of return today. They are in fact subsidizing the rest of us. The markets have paid back nearly 11 percent, but when we filter out inflation, it is better than a 7 percent annual return in the market. 
   What would any person rather have? If an investment counselor said: I can up a plan, but it will not pay very good, less than 2 percent, so anyone 50 or younger, by the time they retire, it will be a negative; or we can put taxpayers in a new plan paying 7, 8, 11, 12 percent, what will you do? There will not be many at the desk signing up for a plan paying zero or giving a negative return on the money. 
   Mr. President, there is no Social Security account with your name on it. A lot of people don't realize that. After a lifetime of working, taxpayers think there is an account in Washington that has their name on it. There is not. You don't have one dollar set aside for your retirement today. The only thing you can hope, in our pay-as-you-go system, is that when you retire there are people working so we can deduct money from their check to pay your benefit. It is a pay-as-you-go system. The money we bring in the first of June will be paid out in benefits by the end of June. It is a pay-as-you-go system, with no accumulation of wealth, no real assets, no compounding of interest. 
   By the way, we talk about these IOUs in the trust fund that will make the system solvent. In the President's own budget, he included this paragraph: These balances are available to finance future benefit payments and other trust fund expenditures. 
   The IOUs are there to pay for the funds or payments to other expenditures, ``but only in a bookkeeping sense.'' 
   In other words, they are not real. Members on the floor will say: We have the IOUs. That is great, ``but only in a bookkeeping sense.'' There is nothing there. 
   You can place a million-dollar IOU in your checking account and see how many checks your banker allows to be written against the IOU. None, until you put money in the account. 
   ``They are claims on the Treasury, that, when redeemed, will have to be financed by raising taxes, borrowing from the public, or reducing benefits or other expenditures.'' 
   Do we want to reduce Social Security benefits or cut education, transportation, or health care? If we don't make some hard choices now we will be faced with tougher decisions later. 
   We have these IOUs because the government spent all the surplus in the Social Security Trust Funds. The first step to save Social Security is to stop the government spending Americans' retirement dollars for nothing but their retirement, to keep the dollars outside the hands of the big spenders in Washington and to make sure we set aside the surplus funds today. We have not done it in the past. It needs to be done. I have introduced a second lockbox that says if our estimates are wrong--best faith estimates on what we spend and what we bring in--if we are honest and do not want to spend a dime of Social Security, if the estimates are wrong and we overspend, we need to go back and lower everybody's budget across the board. Perhaps take a .003-percent reduction so we don't have to go into the trust fund, and we will not spend a dime of Social Security. 
   Mr. President, I have six principles for saving Social Security. I began working on this 7 years ago. I introduced this plan 3 years ago. I said then it would be a major issue in this 
   Presidential debate. It is. I am glad governor George W. Bush has announced his plan to allow at least some privatization for improving and saving the system. And Vice President AL GORE has made a statement--he doesn't want to do anything. He wants status quo, he wants to tinker with the system. That means, again, raise your taxes even more. 
   We need to make sure we protect current and future beneficiaries. Anyone on Social Security, about to retire, or who wants to stay with it, should be able to so do. It is your option; we will guarantee those benefits. Don't be concerned about it. We will hear scare tactics that somehow this plan is not going to work, we are only going to rob the elderly, and we will not have a safe Social Security. That is hogwash. We will always guarantee those benefits. 
   Allow freedom of choice. If you want to have a personal retirement account, you should have that option as well. The Government should not stand in your way and say, no, we are going to keep you locked up in a system that will pay you little or nothing on your return. 
   Preserve the safety net. Again, I have heard the scare tactics that there are no safety nets in the PRAs. That is a lie. Under our plan we have the same safety nets as Social Security. We have survivors benefits, disability benefits, built into the program. It is the same thing, but our plan pays dividends and higher returns than Social Security. The bottom line is we have the same safety nets. 
   Make Americans better off, not worse off. Today, nearly 20 percent of Americans, when they retire, retire into poverty, because Social Security is all they have--or very little else--and it is not enough to keep them off the poverty. Our system says when you retire you will have a minimum of 150 percent of poverty. Right now, the poverty for single individuals is about $8,400 a year. Our plan says you have to have at least $12,800 a year to retire. We make sure you don't retire into poverty. The people most affected are elderly women and widows. The Social Security system today discriminates against women. Again, we will hear stories that PRAs discriminate against women. That is not true. The current system is the culprit. Changing the system will improve retirement for millions of Americans today, including our elderly ladies. 
   Create a fully funded system. Make sure if you have an option for private retirement accounts, you can do that. Most importantly, no tax increases, no tinkering with the system. 
   I introduced my plan, the Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act, in the last Congress and the 106th. I will keep introducing this plan until we do something on it. 
   How does the plan work for retirement options? Workers may divert 10  percent of their income into a personal retirement account to be managed by Government-approved but private investment companies, similar to 401(k)'s and IRAs and FDIC accounts. We make sure they are safe and sound. 
   Somebody making $30,000 a year now pays $3,720 into Social Security. Our plan says $3,000 goes into a personal retirement account. At the end of the year, you don't just have a promise, you actually have a savings book that has $3,000 cash, plus interest. The other 2.4 percent, $720, goes into the SSA, Social Security Administration, to help fund part of the financing plan for those who want to stay on Social Security, to guarantee their benefits. 
   Right now in personal retirement accounts, someone earning $36,000 a year pays in the maximum to Social Security, and receives $1,280 a month as a maximum benefit. Take just 10 percent of that income, put it into an average market account, you will have a benefit of $6,514 a month. That is a big difference, five times better under the private retirement account than what Social Security would pay. In addition, the safety nets are there for survivor and disability benefits. Don't let anybody say that somehow this isn't as good or better. 
   Looking at the returns, people are talking about maybe 2 percent of your Social Security. After 40 years at 2 percent, you will have $171,000 in the account, plus reduced benefits from Social Security. So at least with partial reform plan, a citizen is better off and would have a little bit of reduced benefit from Social Security but will have $171,000 in the bank. Under my plan, you would have $855,000 based on a $36,000 income; $855,000 would have been put away for your retirement. 
   The family with median income of $58,000, putting away 2 percent has $278,000 in the bank, and a reduced Social Security benefit. Again, better than what we have now. But you could have $1.4 million in a savings account in your name, cash, estate money, if you could put aside 10 percent of your salary. 
   It is being done across the country. I discussed people in Galvaston, TX, with private retirement accounts who got the OK from Social Security to have their own retirement accounts in 1981. 
   Social Security death benefits? My dad died at 61, we got $253. That is what Social Security offers. 
   Galveston County that has their own private retirement accounts, receive an average $75,000 death benefit. 
   Disability benefits for Social Security is $1,280; and Galveston, TX, is $2,749. 
   What about retirement benefits? Social Security, a maximum on this average income is $1,280; Galveston County, nearly $4,800. 
   By the way, Galveston has a conservative retirement plan, they invest very conservatively and they still pay those much better returns. 
   One lady, by the way, named Wendy Cohill, her husband died at 44 of a heart attack. She was 42. She received $126,000 in death benefits plus what was in the account plus the survivors benefit that she used to pay to finish a college education. She was able to care for her family in her own home. If she would have had Social Security, she would have been under the poverty level. She said: Thank God, some wise men privatized Social Security here. If I had regular Social Security, I would be broke. 
   The city of San Diego also has PRAs, a government employee, 35 years old, contributes 6 percent into the PRAs. After 35 years, they would receive a $3,000-per-month retirement benefit. 
   Under Social Security, he would receive only $1,077 a month in benefits. 
   I know the Senator from California said on the floor recently that personal retirement accounts are too risky and we cannot damage the foundation of Social Security. But last year, and I want to read this, the Senator from California--this is Senator BARBARA BOXER along with Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN and Senator TED KENNEDY, sent a letter to the President saying: 
   ``Millions of our constituents will receive higher retirement benefits''--They are talking about the city of San Diego--``higher benefits from their current public pensions than they would under Social Security.'' 
   In other words, they were telling the President to leave San Diego alone because the President's plan for saving Social Security included taking 1 percent, pooling the investments, but he also would take all these with private accounts off the table and put them all into Social Security. She did not like that. She says:  
   Mr. President, millions of our constituents who will receive higher retirement benefits from their current public pensions than they would under Social Security, are appealing to their elected Representatives in Washington and we respectfully urge you to honor the original legislative intent underpinning the Social Security system--  
   That was to exclude these people from Social Security, exclude this provision from your reform and leave San Diego alone, they were saying. 
   My question is, if the retirement accounts in San Diego are better than Social Security, why can't you and I enjoy a similar system? But if Social Security is better, as Senator BOXER, Senator FEINSTEIN, and Senator KENNEDY will support, then why don't they want the citizens who work for the city of San Diego to have that same benefit? A good question. 
   I know I do not have much time left. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. GRAMS. I will go through this quickly. I know we have others wanting to speak. 
   As I said, this is not an experiment. This is being done around the world. Eleven countries now have privatized their retirement; 30 others are considering it. We like to think we are 
   in the forefront of this. But when it comes to retirement benefits, we are behind the curve. 
   Chile, 18 years ago, privatized their system because their system was much like ours. Franklin Delano Roosevelt and the brains in Washington did not create Social Security. It was modeled and copied from something that Otto Von Bismark put out in 1880. We adopted it almost exactly. So did Chile and just about every other country around the world. Chile, had the same problems or worse than what we are facing today. It went to bankrupt. They had to privatize their plan. 
   By the way, 95 percent of the Chilean workers have opted into the personal retirement accounts. Their return last year was 11.3 percent. Ours, again, were less than 2 percent. 
   British workers have chosen to go into PRAs. They have what they call their second tier Social Security, where they can opt from the Social Security System, like we have, into personal retirement accounts. In Britain, so far two-thirds of all British workers have opted into personal retirement accounts. They have enjoyed, over the past 5 years, a better than 10 percent return on their money. By the way, the pool of retirement in their retirement accounts in Britain exceeds $1.4 trillion. That is how much now they have put away in their accounts. That is more than the total GDP of Britain, and it is more than all other private investments in all the other European countries combined. So it shows you the power of private retirement accounts, and the accumulation of wealth. 
   Many people say: I have worked for 30 years. I can't give up what I have paid into Social Security. 
   We have a recognition bond. The Government knows exactly how much you have paid in. If you have paid in $20,000, if you paid in $40,000, if you paid in $90,000, we know. We would give you a recognition bond, plus interest upon retirement. 
   Mr. President, we must take care of today's Social Security recipients. If an individual chooses to remain in the current system, we must guarantee their benefits. There is no increase in age of retirement, no cuts in benefits, no ifs, ands, or buts, and no raising of taxes. 
   The plan preserves the safety net, as I said, for survivors benefits and disability benefits. Poverty, as I said, recognized that $8,240 a year--you have to have $12,400, so you would not retire into poverty, again, as nearly 20 percent of our Americans do. Funds that manage PRAs are required to buy the life and disability insurance to provide the safety nets I have talked about. 
   For those who would come up short--and those would be very few--if you could not get $12,400 a year, we would come in and say we will fill your glass  full so when you retire, you would retire with less than that. This is the only entitlement portion of our bill. Again, this is an important safety net of this system. 
   Rules similar to those that apply to IRAs today would apply to PRAs. Also, a Federal personal retirement investment board would oversee it for safety and soundness to make sure your retirement funds are there, and are safe. Investment companies that manage PRAs would be required to have an insurance plan to pay at least a minimum of 2.5 percent. That would be a floor. Again, that is much better than Social Security, but at least it is a guarantee if something would go wrong you would at least have that as your investment. 
   In addition, you decide when you want to retire. As I said, right now the Government controls your retirement. They tell you exactly how much they are going to take out of your check, they tell you exactly the day you can retire, and then they tell you what they are going to give you in benefits. 
   In our plan, you have those controls. You make your retirement decisions. As soon as you can buy an annuity that will 
   keep you 150 percent over poverty, you have met your requirement. You are not going to be a ward of the state. You ensured your future. You can stop. You can do what you want. You can arrange regular withdrawals, for the amounts that are above that requirement. To buy this minimum benefit, you would need about $125,000 in your account. If you are an average worker with earnings of $30,000, you would have $855,000 in your account, so you can use that other $750,000 any way you want. 
   If you have a family, you could have $1.4 million. What are you going to do with the other $1.2 million. You can do whatever you want with that money; that is yours. You decide how you withdraw it. If you want to go to Europe? Write a check. Buy a new car? You can do it. Give it to your kid. You can do it. 
   In divorce cases, PRAs are treated as common property. Upon death, PRAs go to heirs without estate taxes; no capital gains, so that at least you have created an estate, and this $1.2 million or $700,000 or whatever you had in your account is your money. 
   Going back to Social Security, when you die, you get a $253 death benefit. Under this, you get a death benefit in our plan, a minimum, plus you would get what is left in your estate, whatever it might be. You can pass it on to your heirs, your spouse, your kids, your church--wealth that you cannot pass on today because the Government takes all those benefits. 
   Again, the bottom line is, no new taxes for this system. We do have a responsibility to bail ourselves out, but we are not taxing the system. Retirement income is going to be there whether you stay with Social Security, or if you choose to build a personal retirement account. You can decide the options, you decide how you want to invest it, and you decide when you want to retire. Let's make sure we give you choices. 
   Just in concluding, despite our colleagues, our Democratic colleagues bashing Governor Bush's reform plan, its popularity is increasing among workers. 
   I heard one say: I don't come out here and bash it. I want to study everything and I want to look over all of these plans. 
   He hasn't even seen the Governor's plan. He doesn't really know what Vice President AL GORE has got. But yet he favors AL GORE over Governor Bush. 
   Recent polls show most Americans support the idea of personal retirement accounts. In fact, if you are under 40 years old, more young people believe in UFOs than that they are going to get Social Security; 90-some percent of young people under 30 would opt into personal retirement accounts. 
   I believe a national consensus can be reached on ways to save and strengthen Social Security. There will always be a retirement system in this country. What kind of system are we going to leave for our children and grandchildren? For many of us, if we are 50 years old, 55 years old, or older, we might have been condemned to the current system without time left in our working lives to change or take the option in the personal retirement accounts. We can tell our children and grandchildren we want to leave a 70-percent tax system for them, we want to leave them a plan that might guarantee they will get less benefits, pay more into it, and will have to wait longer to retire, or we can leave them an option for them to invest in their own retirement and have personal retirement accounts. 
   The numbers show Americans overwhelmingly say: I am smart enough to handle my future. 
   There are many in Washington who believe you are not smart enough; you may be smart enough to earn your money, but you are not smart enough to put it aside for your retirement and only Washington can step in and help you out. That's wrong. Our plan empower working Americans and offers better options and gives you control over your retirement. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to briefly express my support for the crop insurance reform package that is being considered today, and the additional emergency assistance that was appended to the bill. 
   This crop insurance reform is critically needed in the heartland of America. As the sponsor of the first crop insurance reform legislation introduced in the 105th and 106th Congress, I have worked hard on crop insurance reform and on keeping this issue at the forefront of congressional priorities, so it is gratifying to finally see this measure completed by conferees and the Congress. 
   I worked with a committee of Minnesotans representing producers, lenders, agriculture economists, and other stakeholders to build a consensus on solutions to the current discontentment in rural America with the federal crop insurance program. I am pleased that the final bill contains the expansion of pilot programs I worked for, expansion of the dairy options pilot program that I cosponsored, and higher premium subsidies at the higher levels of coverage that was the critical portion of my original legislation. 
   The premium subsidies will be crucial to help farmers manage their risk, and possibly reduce the need for ad hoc disaster assistance. Many producers believe that the current crop insurance program is too costly to take part in, and this reform measure should increase participation and thus spread risk more widely. 
   I am also pleased that the crop insurance package includes an additional $7.1 billion in emergency aid to producers, which includes AMTA payments and oilseed producer assistance payments. This will hopefully give rural economies and farm families the financial boost they need until commodity prices start to rise again. While I have concerns about AMTA, this is the best way to quickly distribute these funds to farmers. I agree AMTA should be revisited in the next farm bill.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to promote awareness of missing children and honor those who work to search and rescue the thousands of children who disappear each year. As my colleagues may know, today is recognized as National Missing Children Day. 
   In proclaiming the first National Missing Children Day in 1983, President Ronald Reagan noted, ``Our children are the Nation's most valuable and most vulnerable asset. They are our link to the future, our hope for a better life. Their protection and safety must be one of our highest priorities.'' Since that time, National Missing Children Day has been a reminder that we must strengthen our resolve to keep children safe. 
   I believe that the Federal Government can help state and local law enforcement agencies reunite missing and runaway children with their families. In particular, the Missing, Exploited, and Runaway Children Protection Act enacted by Congress last year is an example of an effective federal and state partnership that reduces crime and prevents missing children cases. This law reauthorized the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program through fiscal year 2003 and provides local communities with the resources to find missing children and prevent child victimization. 
   In my home state, the Jacob Wetterling Foundation and Missing Children Minnesota have worked effectively to locate missing children and raise public awareness about ways to prevent child abduction and sexual exploitation. Additionally, the Minnesota Association of Runaway Youth Services, comprising eighteen nonprofit agencies in Minnesota, has been instrumental in providing services to runaway and homeless youth and their families. Their efforts have been guided by the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program, which provides resources to community-based organizations to provide outreach, temporary shelter, and counseling each year to thousands of Minnesota's homeless young people. 
   I am also working to secure federal funding to support the State of Minnesota's development of a statewide criminal justice information sharing system that would allow police, judges, and other criminal justice professionals to communicate quickly about the criminal histories of violent offenders. My proposal will help to provide local communities with the technology to identify criminals and protect our communities from sexual predators and violent offenders. 
   As chairman of the Minnesota House Crime Prevention Committee, Representative Rich Stanek recently led the effort to pass ``Katie's Law''--legislation that will provide state funding for an integrated criminal justice system. I greatly appreciate Representative Stanek's dedication to improving the Minnesota criminal justice system and the opportunity to work with him on this very important public safety initiative. 
   Mr. President, I again commend the numerous volunteers, organizations, businesses, state legislators, and government agencies who all work on a daily basis to find missing children. I look forward to our continued work together.

   Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much. Mr. President, I have a lot to go through in a very short period of time. But I wanted to come to the floor this morning to make a few remarks on a vitally important issue facing our Nation, which is how we are going to strengthen and save Social Security. 
   But, first, I would like to commend George W. Bush for bringing Social Security reform to the forefront by proposing to allow workers to invest a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes in personal retirement accounts. I believe this is the best solution to the fast approaching insolvency of Social Security. 
   Governor Bush's vision of courage and leadership is greatly appreciated by all of us who are concerned about saving this Nation's retirement programs, including the Senator from Pennsylvania, who is in the chair this morning, who has also worked very hard and tirelessly to find a way to save Social Security in the future. 
   In contrast to the efforts by Governor Bush to explore solutions to fix our retirement system, his opponent, Vice President AL GORE, offers no workable plan and only politicizes the issue. He accuses Governor Bush of being too willing to take risks with the nation's retirement program. He also believes that younger workers should not be allowed to invest some of their payroll taxes because they would not be capable of managing their own investments. 
   Besides the usual scare tactics, Vice President GORE has taken the same approach as President Clinton in dealing with Social Security problems--basically, they refuse to make hard choices and use double counting and other budget gimmicks to mask the threat to Social Security. 
   Under current law, Social Security will begin running a deficit by 2015.  The Clinton/Gore proposal would not extend this date by a single year. 
   They simply put more IOUs in the Social Security trust fund which will significantly increase the national debt, and then claim they have saved Social Security. 
   But their numbers simply do not add up. Between 2015 and 2036, the government will have to come up with $11.3 trillion from general revenues to make up the annual shortfall in the Social Security system. This is nearly three times the amount the government will save from paying down the publicly held debt during that period. 
   Worse still, the Clinton/Gore plan does not trust the American people to manage their own money, and they instead propose government investment of Americans' Social Security surplus--this despite Vice President GORE's recent denial that their plan called for the government to invest payroll taxes in the stock market. ``We didn't really propose it. We talked about the idea,'' he said. 
   Vice President GORE obviously has a short memory. He forgot their government investment proposal was included in their budgets for FY 1999, FY 2000 and FY 2001. 
   I remember that when the Clinton administration first proposed the government investment scheme, I asked Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan whether we should allow the government to invest the Social Security Trust Funds in the markets, and whether or not this was the right approach. Here are his exact words:  
   No, I think it's very dangerous ..... I don't know of any way that you can essentially insulate government decision-makers from having access to what will amount to very large investments in American private industry....... 
   I am fearful that we are taking on a position here, at least in conjecture, that has very far-reaching, potential danger for a free American economy and a free American society. It is a wholly different phenomenon of having private investment in the market, where individuals own the stock and vote the claims on management (from) having government (doing so). 
   I know there are those who believe it can be insulated from the political process, they go a long way to try to do that. I have been around long enough to realize that that is just not credible and not possible. Somewhere along the line, that breach will be broken.  
   Mr. President, Chairman Greenspan was among the first to raise the issue of Social Security's unfunded liabilities and warned Congress a few years ago about the consequences if we fail to fix Social Security. 
   Mr. President, we should never venture out onto what Chairman Greenspan calls ``a slippery slope of extraordinary magnitude.'' We must move from a pay-as-you-go system to a fully funded retirement system, which he supports. This is the only way to save Social Security. 
   The recently released annual report of the Social Security Trust Fund's Board of Trustees shows it is even more urgent for us to find a solution to Social Security's approaching insolvency. The report shows some short-term improvement but continued long-term deterioration. The inflation-adjusted cumulative deficit between 2015 and 2075 is not projected to be $21.6 trillion, up nearly 7 percent from last year's projection. If the economy takes a turn for the worse, or if the demographic assumptions are too optimistic, the Trust Fund could go bankrupt much sooner. 
   Clearly, Vice President GORE is just plain wrong about Social Security, about government investment, and the ability of working Americans to manage their own money. His use of scare tactics dodges the real issue: that we must solve the insolvency problem. Americans' retirement should be above politics, and we should have an honest debate on the best way to avoid the fast approaching Social Security crisis, and to ensure retirement security for all Americans. 
   Mr. President, to achieve this goal, we must understand how we got here, what problems we are facing and what options we have to save our retirement system. Now, Mr. President, let us take a look back in time to see what we can learn and also what I believe is the best plan to achieve retirement security. 
   Clearly, Vice President AL GORE is just plain wrong about Social Security, and I am glad that he and Governor Bush have framed the debate in what we are going to be talking about as far as Social Security over the next 5 months of a very important campaign and into the 107th Congress. 
   I have been doing a series of town meetings in Minnesota, trying to outline the problems that we find with Social Security. Social Security has done the job we have asked it to do over the last 65 years; that is, to provide minimum retirement benefits to millions of Americans. But a public Social Security system was even questioned by Franklin Roosevelt back in 1935. He thought at one time during part of the debate that we should have included a private retirement account as part of the options. He even said when the Social Security program was created that he wanted the feature of a private sector component to build retirement income. It was not included. In fact, it was taken out in conference after being approved here on this Senate floor with the promise that a private investment concept would be brought back the next year to be debated as part of the Social Security program. That never happened. It was one of the first big lies dealing with Social Security. 
   Why are we having problems today? Social Security is now a system being stretched to its limits. Seventy-eight million baby boomers will begin retiring in the year 2008. Social Security spending will exceed tax revenues by the year 2015. In other words, the surpluses we hear about today will not exist past 2015. In fact, at that time the system will be bringing in less money than the demand will be for those benefits, and the Social Security trust funds would go broke in 2037; that is, if we could turn the IOUs between now and the year 2015 into cash and be able to use them to supplement the system. Without it, the American taxpayer is going to be asked as early as 2015 to begin paying higher taxes to redeem those IOUs which exist today with the pay-as-you-go system. 
   Why are we in trouble? Why is it being stretched to the limit? 
   In 1940, there were about 100 workers for every person on retirement. You remember the old Ponzi system, the pyramid scheme, where you had a lot of people at the bottom and you could support a few at the top. That is the way the system was. It worked then because of the pyramid style of 100 workers and 1 retiree. Today there are about three workers for every retiree. By the year 2050, there will be about two workers for every retiree. 
   So you can see the strain that we are going to put on the system. But what is the system? That system is going to be your children, your grandchildren, and your great-grandchildren. They are going to be put under a tremendous financial strain in order to support an outdated system. 
   As I mentioned, right now we are in a surplus mode. But by the year 2015, we are going to begin accumulating deficits, and this is going to continue on a very downward pattern over the next 70 years. This is what we are going to accumulate. The Government is coming up short with more than a $20 trillion shortfall between the year 2015 and the year 2070. That means these are the benefits the Government has promised to pay and this is what we are going to come up with, and we will be short of revenues from the current FICA tax or withholding tax in order to pay these benefits. 
   From where is this $20 trillion-plus going to come? As I said, it will come from paying back the IOUs that have already gone out. It is the American taxpayer who is going to see tax increases of at least twentyfold in order to do this. 
   My plan, which is a totally funded retirement system, is going to cost--our estimate--at least $13 trillion, and it is going to take a little bit shorter curve in over to attain by the year 2050. We need to solve this problem, and we will be in the black in a system that will pay for itself by the year 2015. But if you look at the current system, in the year 2070, it is $20 trillion in debt, and it is heading downhill at an ever increasing rate. 
   I am going through these a little fast because we don't have a lot of time this morning. But I will try to get in all of this information. 
   The biggest risk we have facing Social Security today is doing nothing at all. 
   Again, this is the way Vice President AL GORE has framed the debate. Let's  do nothing. Let's just put our arms around this. Let's put a Band-Aid over the real problem dealing with Social Security or our retirement future. Let's put a Band-Aid over it and do nothing, despite the fact there is over $20 trillion in unfunded liabilities. 
   The Social Security trust fund is nothing but IOUs. If this is how the system will remain solvent, I say why not write an IOU to yourself? Make it for $1 million; put it in your checking account. How many banks will allow you to write a check? Not one, until you redeem the IOU. 
   To pay promised Social Security benefits, the payroll tax paid today, which is one-eighth of everything taxpayers make, will have to be increased by at least 50 percent or benefits will have to be reduced. We are leaving our kids and grandchildren a future of paying more for retirement, getting less, and they are talking of raising the retirement age further. Is that the kind of system we want to leave our children? I don't think so. 
   Payroll taxes keep rising. Today, in the year 2000, 15.4 percent of your income is deducted in FICA taxes to pay for Social Security and Medicare. By the year 2030, that will be about 23 percent, according to low estimates; it will be about 28 percent according to even higher projections. Somewhere in between there is what we are going to see our children paying in FICA taxes. If they are paying nearly 30 percent in FICA taxes, and thrown on top of that is an average of 28-percent Federal taxes, we are now up to 48 percent. My home State of Minnesota has an 8 1/2 percent State tax, so now we are 57 percent. Add in your sales tax, estate tax, property taxes, and everything, and our children are going to be paying taxes that could be in the range of 65 to 70 percent of their income. Again, is this the future we want to leave our children? 
   Diminishing returns of Social Security is another problem. Right now, Social Security is paying less than a 2 percent return. If someone retired in 1950 or 1960, they got back all the money paid into Social Security within 18 months. Today's workers are getting back less than 2 percent on their investment. Many of the minority groups in our society are now getting a negative return. In other words, they are supporting Social Security with their dollars because they are receiving less because of life expectancy. For those today under 50 years old, when they retire they will actually receive a zero return or less, a negative return. I don't know how many people will stand in front of a window to invest their money when they are promising to pay you 2 percent and, in the future, less than 0 percent on the investment. I don't think many people want to do that. 
   I compare this with the market return over the last 75 years. The markets have paid back better than 7 percent real return. This is after inflation adjusted. And this is 75 years, including the crash of 1929, the Great Depression and everything else. The markets have been a better source of revenue than what we can expect from Social Security in the future. 
   There is no Social Security account with your name on it. I know a lot of people think: I have paid into Social Security all my working life; surely, there has to be an account in Washington in my name. 
   There is not. There is not an account in your name. There is not one dollar set aside for your retirement. It is a pay-as-you-go system. All one can hope is when retiring there are people working yet so we can take money from their check and give it to you as a benefit in retirement. The money we collected the first of May will go out in benefits at the end of May. It is a pay-as-you-go system. No investments, no cash, no 
   accumulation of wealth, no assets--nothing for your retirement, just the hope there will be workers. 
   When they talk about solvency and Social Security until 2037, because of the IOUs, the President has actually had to put into his budget certain words so he is legally correct in dealing with the IOUs. The statement begins ``These [trust fund]''--and the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. HOLLINGS, says there is no ``trust'' and there is no ``funds'' in trust funds.  
   These [trust fund] balances are available to finance future benefit payments and other trust fund expenditures--but only in a bookkeeping sense. They are claims on the Treasury, that, when redeemed, will have to be financed by raising taxes, borrowing from the public, or reducing benefits or other expenditures.  
   In their own budget, they had to very clearly spell out that the IOUs we are talking about in the Social Security trust fund are nothing but paper. 
   The Social Security lockbox is very important. The moneys we are taking in now, the surplus in Social Security, needs to be locked away. We need to save the Social Security trust fund dollars for Social Security and keep Washington's big spenders from using trust fund dollars for other Government functions. I introduced a Grams Social Security lockbox concept that takes care of this. 
   The Grams lockbox offers a double lock on Social Security. It triggers an automatic reduction in all Government discretionary spending, including Congressional Members' pay, if any of the Social Security surplus is spent, returning it to the Social Security trust fund. In other words, in Washington, we are always at ``best guess'' estimates. We have an estimate on what our revenues will be, we have a best guess on estimates on what spending will be. My lockbox says we have promised not to take one dime from Social Security. If the estimates are off, even if only off a million dollars, all other spending would be reduced so Social Security would not pay one dime. 
   Right now, any deficit spending has to come out of the surplus, and that is out of Social Security funds. If we are honest about not taking a dime out of Social Security, we should do that. 
   My plan, the six principles for saving Social Security, protects current and future beneficiaries. Anyone on Social Security today or planning on retiring and staying with this system--that is your option--we guarantee protection of future benefits. That is a guarantee we have to make. Seniors today and those who want to retire should not be afraid of allowing their children or grandchildren to have options. We guarantee your benefits today. This is an agreement I believe the Government has made with you. Taxpayers have said: I will pay into the system, and I expect a retirement benefit in return. That is the agreement. I think we need to make sure that happens. 
   Allow freedom of choice--your kids, your grandchildren to have the chance to have a private retirement account. 
   Preserve the safety nets for disability and survivor benefits as the system today. Make sure that is included. 
   Make Americans better off, not worse. My plan says you cannot retire with less than 150 percent of poverty. That is your income. Today, nearly 20 percent of Americans retire into poverty because Social Security is so low. The majority of those are women. Social Security is a system that discriminates against women. 
   Create a fully funded system. And no tax increases in the future. 
   The Grams plan, the Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act I introduced in September last year, and in the 105th Congress, my staff says, is the third rail of politics. Members cannot talk about retirement or Social Security or they will never get reelected. I thought it was so important we had to talk about it I said then it would become an important issue of this Presidential campaign. As I mentioned earlier, Governor Bush and Vice President AL GORE have now framed this debate and it will be an important part of the elections in 2000. 
   Right now, 12.4 percent of workers' income goes into Social Security, one-eighth of everything they make. My plan says you can take 10 percent of your income and put that into a personal retirement account. That would be managed by Government-approved private investment companies. Safe and sound. We hear the scare tactics; we will invest your money and lose it. Some do better than others. They say you are too dumb to manage your own money. You don't know how to save for your future. 
   Our plan says we have faith in you. Under Government-approved guidelines as those used in your IRAs and the FDIC account at your banks, provisions are made for safety. These plans are the same. Your retirement would be safe, sound, and secure. The only difference is it would accumulate and grow much faster, and taxpayers receive much better returns than Social Security.  
   For those who say: I have paid into Social Security for so long, first, if your wage is $30,000, under Social Security today, $3,720 is put into the Social Security account. Under my plan, $3,000 goes into your account. A passbook shows assets of $3,000 plus interest at the end of the first year. The other $720 is part of our financing plan, to make sure there are benefits for those who stay in Social Security. The $720 goes into that system. Hopefully, that would be absolved in 20 years and would then be a tax cut. Ten percent of your salary would go into your account to begin to grow assets for you and your family. 
   If you make an average of $36,000 a year, after your lifetime of work, $1,280 a month is your maximum benefit from Social Security. Take 10 percent, put it into an average return market account, and your retirement would be $6,514 a month, a much better return for your retirement than the $1,280. These are average returns, 
   nothing spectacular, as we have seen in the markets as of late. Based on an income of $36,000--we have heard of everything from taking just 2 percent of the 12.4, maybe taking 6 percent or about half of the Social Security. My plan would put it all into private accounts, and these are what we could expect as the differences. 
   After 20 years at 2 percent, you would only have $33,000 in a separate account. Under our plan, you would have, after 20 years, $168,000. But after a lifetime at an average income of $36,000, if you could take 10 percent of your wages and put it into a personal retirement account, you would have, not $171,000 but $855,000 cash money in an account for you and your family for your retirement benefits and part of your estate as well. That is for a single worker. 
   An average family in the United States right now has an income of about $58,500. If we could take these same scenarios, after a lifetime of work, under 2 percent, you would set aside an additional $278,000 for your retirement--better than Social Security, granted, because this will be a supplement to that. But if you could put 10 percent away, you would have nearly $1.4 million put away for your retirement--$1.4 million put away for your retirement. That is after 40 years at 10 percent, with an average salary of $58,000 a year: $1.4 million on which you can retire. 
   We look at Galveston County, TX. When Social Security was implemented in 1936, one part of the law said if you were a public worker and had a private retirement account, you did not have to go into Social Security. We have something like 5 million Americans who are public employees today who have their own private retirement accounts and are not in Social Security. Galveston County, TX, was one of those. They just entered in 1980, by the way, because an administrator found a loophole in the law. Of course, that was closed after Galveston County got out. 
   But this is a comparison between Social Security and what Galveston County pays. They are very conservative, investing only in annuities, not necessarily in the market. This is what they paid: 
   Social Security death benefit? My father passed away at 61 and received zero from Social Security, except for a $253 death benefit after a lifetime of work, investing in Social Security--$253. In Galveston County: A minimum death benefit of $7,500. 
   Disability benefits under Social Security--maximum $1,280; for Galveston it is now $2,800 dollars. 
   In retirement benefits per month: Social Security, $1,280 maximum; in Galveston, $4,790--much better returns. 
   One lady's husband was 42; she was 44. He passed away suddenly from a heart attack. All she could say was, ``Thank God that some wise men privatized Social Security here. If I had had regular Social Security, I'd be broke.'' She would have been in poverty with her three children. After her husband died, Wendy Colehill was able to use her death benefit check of $126,000 to pay for his funeral and enter college. Under Social Security, she would have received $255. So she got a death benefit of $126,000 plus a survivors benefit to which Social Security never would have come close. She said, ``Thank God for Galveston.'' 
   In San Diego, a 30-year-old employee who earns a salary of $30,000 for 35 years, contributing--in San Diego they only contribute 6 percent, not 12.4--6 percent, so they pay less 
   than half into their retirement system than you do--would receive about $3,000 a month in their retirement compared to $1,077 under Social Security. They pay in less than half and get three times more. 
   The difference between San Diego's system of PRAs and Social Security is more than three times better under their private plan. Even those who oppose PRAs--and there are many in this Senate who say, as Vice President GORE says, you just cannot handle your own retirement--agree that the system in San Diego is better. 
   This is a letter written from Senators BARBARA BOXER, DIANNE FEINSTEIN, and TED KENNEDY, among others, to President Clinton. Under the President's plan for privatizing any part of Social Security, he wanted to take all these employees and bring them into Social Security. Take Galveston County, San Diego, take all of them, and they would have had to become part of Social Security. But Senators BOXER, FEINSTEIN, and KENNEDY, among others, wrote to the President and said:  
   Millions of our constituents will receive higher retirement benefits from their current public pensions than they would under Social Security.  
   So they said leave San Diego alone. 
   My question is, If Social Security is so much better, why don't the residents of San Diego, or the workers, get to enjoy that? But if private retirement accounts are better, why don't you and I get to enjoy the same thing as these three Senators speak of for San Diego? 
   The United States trails other countries in saving its retirement system. For nearly 19 years Chile offered PRAs; 95 percent have opted into the system, and their average return last year was 11.3 percent. They have had much higher than that, but last year it averaged 11.3 percent. Among other countries that are going to private retirement accounts--and I am talking totally private retirement accounts--are Australia, Britain, Switzerland, and there are 11 others. Thirty countries today are considering doing that. 
   We like to think we are ahead of the game on a lot of things here in the United States, which we are in most cases, but when it comes to Social Security, we are behind the curve of what other countries are doing. 
   British workers chose PRAs with 10-percent returns. The question is, Who could blame them? Two out of three British workers are now enrolled in the second-tier; that is, private parts of their social security system. They chose to enroll in PRAs. British workers have enjoyed a 10-percent return on their pension investments over the last 5 years--a 10-percent return. I said our numbers are based on a conservative 7 percent. The pool of PRAs in Britain exceeds nearly $1.4 trillion today. That is how much they have accumulated in that account. That is larger than the entire economy of Britain, and it is larger than the private pensions of all other European countries combined. This is what the British workers have set away for their retirement. 
   Say you are 45 year old. You say: I have worked 20 years; I paid into the system; How am I going to let that go? 
   A lot of young people who are 45 say: If you just let me out of the system, you can keep everything I paid in. But we said, again, it is a contract with the Government. 
   We need to have a recognition bond. This is a sample. But 
   if you have paid in $47,000 or $91,000, we should recognize that in a bond--put that into your private account as seed money and pay you interest on it, due and payable when you reach the age of 65. If you choose to remain within the current system, the Government will guarantee your benefits--again, part of that contract. If you stay with Social Security, we are going to guarantee your benefits. If you are on retirement today, we are going to guarantee those benefits, preserve the safety net so no American will be retiring into poverty. 
   Again, the poverty level today is $8,240 a year. That means in the United States, you would have to retire with at least $12,400 a year. This is again for a single individual. But you would not retire into poverty--providing safety and soundness. Again, they say this is risky. This is not risky. We have similar rules that apply to IRAs, and they would apply to the PRAs. A Federal Personal Retirement Investment  Board, an independent agency, will oversee the PRAs. Investment companies that manage it would have to have an insurance plan to have survivors benefits, disability benefits, and also a floor that says you would never get less than 2.5 percent of your investment that year. By the way, you choose the company with which you want to put your money. If it is better somewhere else, you can move your money. 
   Chile has 16 companies that do this with a population of under 20 million people. In our country, we would probably have 100 firms. Just look at the numbers of mutual funds you can choose from today. 
   You also decide when to retire. This is an important part. Under the current system, the Government tells you how much you are going to pay into the system; the Government tells you when you are going to retire; you have no choice, and the Government tells you what you are going to get as a benefit. They determine everything. You have nothing to say about it. You are being led along like sheep into this system. 
   Ours says when you reach this 150 percent of poverty, if you can buy an annuity that will pay you the rest of your life at that, you can stop paying into the system. You can retire at that time. I don't care if you are 40 years old. Once you have met that requirement, you can get out of this system. You will no longer be considered a ward of the State; you will have enough to provide for your retirement. Some choices: In divorce cases, PRAs are treated as community property. Upon death, a PRA benefit will go to the heirs without estate taxes. 
   Think, if you had that $1.4 million in your account when you die--not like my father who got $253, but 
   whatever you had accumulated in your account, up to $1.4 million or more, that would be your money that would go to your heirs without estate taxes, without capital gains. Workers could arrange PRAs for nonworking children. They could put $1,000 in their account, and when they reached the age of 65, it would be $250,000. 
   There will be no new taxes for this system. Retirement income would be there for everybody, whether you stayed within Social Security or chose to build a personal retirement account. In Minnesota, workers can decide when to retire and which options work best for them. With PRA, average returns would be at least three to five times better. 
   This is the system. I hope when we continue these debates, and when people hear these scare tactics, remember, that is all they are, rhetoric and scare tactics. We can develop a system that will be safe, sound, and will preserve better retirement benefits than we have today. 
   We should have that chance for our children, just as other countries. When hearing this debate, set aside the rhetoric and scare tactics and look at the numbers. I hope we can continue this debate because this is a very important part of America's future. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, our nation's prosperity and continued success are directly related to the education of our citizens. As the price tag of higher education continues to rise, the importance of financial aid programs has never been greater. To recognize those who help students achieve their goal of a higher education and to promote the accessibility of higher education to everyone, May has been designated as National Scholarship Month. 
   I would like to draw attention to one organization in particular that deserves accolades for its efforts to provide financial aid to students. The Minnesota-based Citizens' Scholarship Foundation of America (CSFA) is the nation's largest private sector scholarship and educational support organization. Since its founding in 1958, CSFA has distributed over $561 million to more than 572,000 students. Through more than 800 ``Dollars for Scholars'' chapters, the Foundation has established a grassroots network, with proven results. 
   I applaud the Foundation's tireless efforts to increase private sponsorship of scholarships to our nation's youth. I also congratulate and thank the dozens of Minnesota companies, organizations, and foundations that work with CSFA to help ensure that a higher education is an affordable education. Additionally, I join in CSFA's challenge to the communities, organizations, businesses, and individuals that already sponsor scholarships to double the number of awards, and I invite others to establish scholarship programs this year. 
   Mr. President, it is my hope that CSFA's leadership in the multitude of National Scholarship Month activities around the nation will broaden the support for private scholarship dollars and increase the level of participation. Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating the generosity of our nation's scholarship sponsors during this National Scholarship Month.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the anniversary of the founding of the American Red Cross by Clara Barton 119 years ago. This year's theme, ``We Touch the World,'' describes the compassionate direction the Red Cross is taking locally, nationally, and internationally. 
   After the brutal battle of Solferino near Verona, Italy, Jean Henry Durant, a Swiss citizen, formed the International Red Cross in 1863 with the intent to alleviate suffering and promote public health. The first Geneva Convention was signed by 16 nations a year later, adopting the red cross as a symbol of neutral aid. Clara Barton recognized the importance of the humanitarian efforts of the International Red Cross in Europe, and cultivated the fundamental principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence, voluntary service, unity, and universality into what we know today as the American Red Cross. In addition to alleviating suffering and promoting public health, Ms. Barton also envisioned a need for disaster relief and battlefield assistance. 
   Founded on May 21, 1881, in Washington, DC, the American Red Cross was able to lobby the U.S. Congress to ratify the Geneva Convention, providing an official basis to associate with the International Red Cross. The U.S. was the 32nd nation to sign the document, agreeing to protect the wounded during wartime. Ms. Barton then continued to serve the Red Cross as its volunteer president until 1904. Over the last 119 years, the American Red Cross has not only served Americans and our allies during wartime, but has brought help to anyone in need of aid. 
   Its thousands of volunteers provide the American Red Cross with the tools to carry out its vitally important task in times of need. Behind the scenes, in preparation for disaster situations, local Red Cross chapters provide their communities with CPR and First Aid classes and information on health issues, and promote blood donations to provide the medical field with an adequate supply should a crisis arise. 
   Just a few years ago, in my home state of Minnesota, the Red Cross left its mark by touching the lives of those affected by the floods of 1997 and the tornadoes that tore through towns in the southern part of the state. And during it all, the Minneapolis chapter was without a permanent home to help in the disaster relief. Last month, they opened their doors, the first permanent location since 1996, to a new facility that includes a blood-donor center, space to shelter and feed people in case of a disaster, and an emergency operations center with its own communications and power systems. 
   Mr. President, ninety-one cents of every dollar spent by the American Red Cross goes directly to programs and services that help people in need. All of the disaster assistance is free, thanks to the generosity of donors and volunteers alike. The ratio of volunteer Red Cross workers to paid staff is nearly 41 to one. I am honored to have this opportunity to commemorate the dedicated work of the late Clara Barton and the contributions of all those who continue to carry out her legacy in the American Red Cross.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to America's small businesses--the backbone of our Nation's vibrant economy. As my colleagues may know, the week of May 21-27 is recognized as ``National Small Business Week.'' 
   Small businesses have always been one of the leading providers of jobs in our country. According to the Small Business Administration, small businesses employ 52 percent of the private workforce and account for 35 percent of federal contract dollars. Small businesses produce 38 percent of jobs in high-technology industries, and small- and medium-sized companies comprise 96 percent of all exporters and 30 percent of all exports. These statistics underscore the important role the small business community will have toward developing a 21st century economy that is global and technologically driven. 
   In particular, I am very pleased with the tremendous growth in women-  owned businesses over the last several years. According to the National Foundation for Women Business Owners, there are more than 9.1 million women-owned businesses in the United States, employing more than 27.5 million people and generating $3.6 billion in sales. Between 1987 and 1999, the number of women-owned firms increased dramatically, by more than 103 percent. 
   During ``National Small Business Week,'' I am proud to share with my colleagues the special recognition granted by the Small Business Administration to two of Minnesota's small business persons: the 1999 Minnesota Small Business Person of the Year, Nancy L. Fogelberg, President of American Artstone in New Ulm, Minnesota; and the Financial Services Advocate of the Year, Iric Nathanson, Project Coordinator for the Minneapolis Community Development Agency. 
   To be named a recipient of the Small Business Person of the Year award is not an easy task. The Small Business Administration has selected Nancy for this unique recognition based on her personal achievements and important contributions to our economy. Nancy has demonstrated growth in the total number of company employees; innovative products and services; growth in sales and financial position; an ability to effectively address problems confronting the company; and community service. 
   In 1993, Nancy Fogelberg became President of American Artstone, an 86-year-old manufacturer of architectural stone castings. Nancy quickly modernized her plant through financing provided by the Small Business Administration, and quickly made American Artstone more competitive and profitable. I also congratulate Nancy on recently being named president of the National Cast Stone Institute. 
   I am also proud to recognize the important achievements of Iric Nathanson, who has worked to provide financing opportunities for small businesses. Among his many achievements, Iric developed a capital-loan program that uses city-backed guarantees to help small businesses access revolving credit lines and working capital loans. Iric also coordinated the development of a micro-enterprise loan program in Minneapolis though the establishment of a partnership between the Minneapolis Community Development Agency and the Minneapolis Consortium of Community Developers. Small businesses in Minneapolis have been well served by Iric's efforts on their behalf. 
   I again congratulate the National Small Business Week winners from Minnesota and every small business owner who helps make our communities better places to work and live. I look forward to working with them on small business public policy issues during the 106th Congress.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am pleased that two important Minnesota projects are being funded in this bill, Phase II of Camp Ripley's Combined Support Maintenance Shop (CSMS) and a new Army National Guard Training and Community Center (TACC) in Mankato, Both of these projects were included in the Department of Defense Future Years Defense Program. They are recognized as being good for the Nation, as well as good for Minnesota. 
   First, in regard to Camp Ripley, the existing CSMS was constructed in 1949 and has been expanded to three additional warehouse-type facilities. All four facilities are undersized and fail to comply with modern construction criteria. The configuration and site restrictions of the current facilities make it difficult for the personnel to produce the quality and volume of work expected at Camp Ripley. 
   Due to budget pressures, Congress divided the new CSMS project into two phases. Phase I received 1993 authorization and appropriation of $7,100,000 and includes administration, storage and allied trade shops. Phase II will provide general maintenance workbays, specialty workbays, military vehicle parking, service and access areas, and flammable materials storage. Without the completion of Phase II, the Minnesota Army National Guard's equipment readiness will be degraded and the costs of operating multiple facilities will overwhelm Camp Ripley's operating budget. Funding Phase II of the CSMA at a level of $10,368,000 will allow this project to be completed. I have championed this project from the outset, and I am pleased it is coming to fruition. 
   Second, a new Army National Guard Training and Community Center (TACC) in Makato, MN is certainly needed. The 2/135th Infantry's current facility was originally built in 1914, although it was torn down and rebuilt in 1922. Since that time, the only major modifications have been the replacement of the windows and the roof. The condition of the facility has deteriorated to such an extent there is approximately $246,200 in backlogged maintenance and another $80,000 in construction would have been needed just to bring the building up to code. Due to health and safety concerns, the Guard currently cannot park its military vehicles on location; most are parked at the nearest National Guard facility 60 miles away. The current facility's limitations are so great the only practical course of action is to build a new TACC. The $4,681,000 for the Mankato Training and Community Center (TACC) will enable this to happen, and I have no doubt it will increase the recruiting and retention abilities of the local Guard unit. Congressman GIL BUTKNECHT has shown leadership on this project, and did a stellar job sheparding it through the House. 
   Mr. President, once again, I am proud to have worked to gain the support necessary to fund these projects. I have no doubt the funding the Camp Ripley and the Mankato TACC will be good for the readiness of the National Guard, and that means it will be good for the people of Minnesota and our Nation as a whole.

   Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, I rise today to honor Federal, State and local law enforcement officers who work to protect and serve the public on a daily basis. I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. Res. 247, which designates today as ``Peace Officers Memorial Day'' and recognizes law enforcement officers killed or disabled in the line of duty. 
   During National Police Week, law enforcement officers in all fifty states will pay tribute to their fellow officers who lost their lives in the line of duty. According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, approximately 130 law enforcement officers lost their lives in 1999 while protecting the public. In my home state, 187 Minnesota law enforcement officers have died in the line of duty since 1914. Most recently, the name of Minnesota State Patrol Corporal Timothy Bowe was added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Sadly, more than 14,000 law enforcement officers paid this ultimate sacrifice during the 20th Century. I am honored to pay tribute to the men and women who demonstrated extraordinary bravery while caring for our families and communities. 
   I would also like to note the extraordinary sacrifice of families who have lost a son, daughter, spouse, parent, or relative who was slain while performing their police duties. We honor the memory of these officers by providing for the families that they have left behind. When I think about these families, I am reminded of the inscription on the wall of the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial--``In valor there is hope.'' 
   I am very pleased that the Senate is continuing its efforts to provide support for the families of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. Specifically, I have cosponsored S. 1638, legislation introduced by Senator JOHN ASHCROFT that would retroactively provide financial assistance for higher education to the spouses and children of federal, state, and local law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. Current law provides that the dependants of federal law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty after May 1, 1992, are eligible for this assistance. Dependants of state and local law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty after October 1, 1997, are also eligible. This legislation would change these dates to May 1, 1978, for federal law enforcement officers and October 1, 1978, for state and local law enforcement officers. 
   This important legislation, endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police and the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, builds upon police benefits legislation that passed the 104th and 105th Congress with my strong support. Since 1995, we have enacted the Federal Law Enforcement Dependants Assistance Act of 1996, the Public Safety Officers Educational Assistance Act of 1998 and the Care for Police Survivors Act of 1998. These laws help to support the families of our law enforcement officers and keep alive the memory of these brave and heroic men and women. 
   During National Police Week, I join all Minnesotans in honoring the memory of slain law enforcement officers and their contributions to promoting public safety throughout our communities.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, the State of Minnesota has truly been blessed with a wide array of remarkable gifts. Few places on Earth can boast such diversity amongst its abundant natural resources, prosperous industries, and exceptional people. Today marks the 142nd anniversary of Minnesota's admission as the thirty-second state of the Union, and I want to take this opportunity to reflect on a few of the things that make my state special. This is a difficult speech to make in such a short amount of time, as I am sure I could break Senator THURMOND's twenty-four hour and eighteen minute  filibuster record by talking about Minnesota's contributions to America but I will stick to just a few of the highlights and try to finish up by sundown. 
   Minnesota's natural beauty has been photographed and documented time and time again. License plates may proclaim Minnesota to be ``The Land of 10,000 Lakes,'' but in reality, our vast lakes number in excess of 12,000, and we have more than 63,000 miles of natural rivers and streams. But there is something about sitting on the shore of Mille Lacs Lake at dawn on a Saturday in July that even a two-page spread in National Geographic cannot capture. 
   Minnesotans have a unique relationship with their great outdoors. Many take advantage of our pristine environment through a large assortment of activities, such as taking a week to canoe through the Boundary Waters or going for a walk along the Mississippi River over a lunch hour. Minnesota is a true sportsman's paradise. Our unique habitat creates some of the best hunting and fishing in the country. We are proud of our outdoor heritage, and take seriously our commitment to maintaining the delicate balance between protecting the environment and the responsible use of our resources. 
   Nor are we shy about sharing our bounty with others. Minnesota welcomes more than 20 million vacationers every year, who support 170,300 tourism jobs and return $9.1 billion to the local economy. Yet, for all those visitors, our state offers places of such solitude that a camper or canoeist can travel for a week and spot any number of deer, bears, and bald eagles, but never see another person. 
   The influence of agriculture on Minnesota life and traditions cannot be overstated. Even as family farms struggle in today's difficult market, the resilience and dedication of our farmers establishes the backbone of the Minnesota economy. One in every four Minnesota jobs is tied to the agriculture industry in some way. Minnesota has become a national leader in international exports, as our producers export billions of dollars worth of grains, meats, and other products every year. I am proud of my ongoing efforts to ensure that even more world markets are opened to Minnesota agriculture products--they are among the best products in the world, and they should be shared. Many of the nation's top job providers call Minnesota home. Well-known names like General Mills, Pillsbury, 3M, Target, and Cargill have deep roots within our communities. Aside from the economic impacts made by our corporate community, there is an impressive philanthropic presence in the state. For example, Cargill's generous contributions to causes such as education, environment, and youth programs total in the tens of millions of dollars. 
   Firms such as Medtronic and St. Jude Medical are national leaders in the bio-medical industry. Their products have given hope to those who previously faced a bleak medical outlook. Other Minnesota organizations are searching for answers to tomorrow's problems--today. The world-renowned Mayo Clinic not only treats over half a million patients a year, but is leading the charge against the mysteries of mankind's deadly diseases through its ongoing research. 
   Of all the successful companies, natural beauty, and bountiful resources Minnesota plays host to, the real treasures are the people of my state. Successful Minnesotans come from all walks of life. Some of the most prolific writers of the past century have hailed from the North Star State. The first American to be awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature was Sinclair Lewis, a native of Sauk Centre, Minnesota. F. Scott Fitzgerald, Jon Hassler, and Garrison Keillor are all writers we are proud to call our own. 
   Something about the fresh air in Minnesota inspires us to do bigger and better things. Charles Lindbergh must have gotten a big whiff of that air; so did Judy Garland, Kevin McHale, and Bob Dylan, just to name a few. Our state and nation recently mourned the loss of one of our most beloved natives. Charles Schulz captured the hearts of young and old alike with his long-running Peanuts comic strip, and we will miss him each and every Sunday. 
   There are many Minnesota celebrities who have contributed to the richness of our nation, but the people who really deserve the applause and recognition are the men and women who day in and day out strive to make their communities, state, and nation a better place to live. The farmer who harvests our nation's corn, the policewoman who patrols the streets, the stay-at-home mom who supervises a household of kids, and the volunteer who takes the time to visit a disabled veteran rarely receive the accolades they deserve. These people are as indispensable to the growing, bustling community of St. Michael-Albertville as they are to the thriving metropolis of Minneapolis-St. Paul. I applaud them and am proud to represent each of them here in the United States Senate. 
   The quality of life in Minnesota is outstanding for a reason. Ideals such as hard work, dedication, personal responsibility, and a true passion for life are all essential to my state's success. Growing up on a Minnesota dairy farm, I was fortunate enough to witness these qualities and their importance at a very young age. 
   And for any of my colleagues who may be wondering, you don't have to be a native to spread the ``Minnesota Nice'' spirit. For example, some of the most outstanding Minnesota citizens are those from its many ethnic communities. Their devotion and contribution to Minnesota's way of life is commendable, and representative of the way our state seems to bring out the very best in its people. 
   I am deeply proud of my state, Mr. President, and representing her and her citizens is a great honor. So, on this 142nd anniversary of our statehood, I encourage Minnesotans to take time to discover something new about our state and ponder some of the many treasures with which we have been blessed. Visit one of our sky-tinted lakes, the Mall of America, Split Rock Lighthouse, Fort Snelling, or even the world's largest ball of twine. Take pride in our state and continue the efforts to make Minnesota an even better place to call home.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of ``Be Kind to Animals Week.'' This week is a time to draw attention to how important animals are to our lives and to make sure they receive the treatment and protection they deserve. 
   The American Humane Association was founded in 1877 with a goal to unite a few groups to give a national voice to those who could not speak for themselves: animals. The Association established Be Kind to Animals Week in 1915, the first national week specifically for animals and now the oldest week of its kind in existence in this country. 
   This is the 85th year ``Be Kind to Animals Week'' will be celebrated. The leader of the American Humane Association in 1915 was Dr. William O. Stillman, who foresaw this week continuing on ``as annual events to stimulate and revive human thought.'' 
   The three main goals of the first Be Kind to Animals Week were to encourage the clergy to spread the message about kindness to animals by observing Humane Sunday, to visit schools and teach children the message of being humane, and to publicize the good works of our nation's humane societies. These noble goals continue on today through the American Humane Association. 
   Mr. President, I would like to recognize the many Humane Societies in my home state of Minnesota. These organizations are on the front lines of standing up for and protecting animals across Minnesota. By visiting a local animal shelter, I know many citizens have bettered not only the lives of countless animals through adoption, but surely their own lives in the process. The staffs and volunteers of Minnesota Humane Societies continue to make this possible for all citizens--and their efforts to teach people the importance of spay-neuter programs have also been extremely helpful. 
   Animals certainly have a tremendous effect on our lives. Domesticated animals are considered family members to many of us. Farm animals provide nourishment to families here at home and around the world. And wild animals provide a balance to our overall ecosystem. 
   I am sure Dr. Stillman would be extremely pleased to see his plan of having an annual week to remember the important role of animals continuing on in its 85th year. I want to urge everyone to use this week to take a minute and reflect on what animals mean to our lives, and how we can continue to give animals the protection and care they deserve every day.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to talk about the Department of Interior's recent decision to ban snowmobiling in most units of the National Park System. 
   While the Interior Department's recent decision will not ban snowmobiling in Minnesota's Voyageurs National Park, it will impact snowmobiling in at least two units of the Park System in my home state--Grand Portage National Monument and the St. Croix National Scenic Riverway. In addition, this decision will greatly impact Minnesotans who enjoy snowmobiling, not only in Minnesota, but in many of our National Parks, particularly in the western part of our country. 
   When I think of snowmobiling in Minnesota, I think of families and friends. I think of people who come together on their free time to enjoy the wonders of Minnesota in a way no other form of transportation allows them. I also think of the fact that in many instances snowmobiles in Minnesota are used for much more than just recreation. For some, they're a mode of transportation when snow blankets our state. For others, snowmobiles provide a mode of search and rescue activity. Whatever the reason, snowmobiles are an extremely important aspect of commerce, travel, recreation, and safety in my home state. 
   Minnesota, right now, is home to over 280,000 registered snowmobiles and 20,000 miles of snowmobile trails. According to the Minnesota United Snowmobilers Association, an association with over 51,000 individual members, Minnesota's 311 snowmobile riding clubs raised $264,000 for charity in 1998 alone. Snowmobiling creates over 6,600 jobs and $645 million of economic activity in Minnesota. Minnesota is home to two major snowmobile manufacturers--Arctic Cat and Polaris. And yes, I enjoy my own snowmobiles. 
   People who enjoy snowmobiling come from all walks of life. They're farmers, lawyers, nurses, construction workers, loggers, and miners. They're men, women, and young adults. They're people who enjoy the outdoors, time with their families, and the recreational opportunities our diverse climate offers. These are people who not only enjoy the natural resources through which they ride, but understand the important balance between enjoying and conserving our natural resources. 
   Just three years ago, I took part in a snowmobile ride through a number of cities and trails in northern Minnesota. While our ride didn't take us through a unit of the National Park Service, it did take us through parks, forests, and trails that sustain a diverse amount of plant and animal species. I talked with my fellow riders and I learned a great deal about the work their snowmobile clubs undertake to conserve natural resources, respect the integrity of the land upon which they ride, and educate their members about the need to ride responsibly. 
   The time I spent with these individuals and the time I've spent on my own snowmobiles have given me a great respect for both the quality and enjoyment of the recreational experience and the need to ride responsibly and safely. They've also given me reason to strongly disagree with the approach the Park Service has chosen in banning snowmobiles from our National Parks.  
   I was stunned to read of the severity of the Park Service's ban and the rhetoric used by Assistant Secretary Donald J. Barry in announcing the ban. In the announcement, Assistant Secretary Barry said, ``The time has come for the National Park Service to pull in its welcome mat for recreational snowmobiling.'' He went on to say that snowmobiles were, ``machines that are no longer welcome in our national parks.'' These are not the words of someone who is approaching a sensitive issue in a thoughtful way. These are the words of a bureaucrat whose agenda has been handwritten for him by those opposed to snowmobiling. 
   The last time I checked, Congress is supposed to be setting the agenda of the federal agencies. The last time I checked, Congress should be determining who is and is not welcome on our federal lands. And the last time I checked, the American people own our public-lands--not the Clinton Administration and certainly not Donald J. Barry. 
   In light of such brazenness, it's amazing to me that this Administration, and some of my colleagues in Congress, question our objections to efforts that would allow the federal government to purchase even larger tracts of private land. If we were dealing with federal land managers who considered the intent of Congress, who worked with local officials, or who listened to the concerns of those most impacted by federal land-use decisions, we might be more inclined to consider their efforts. But when this Administration, time and again, thumbs its nose at Congress and acts repeatedly against the will of local officials and American citizens, it is little wonder that some in Congress might not want to turn over more private land to this Administration. 
   I can't begin to count the rules, regulations, and executive orders this Administration has undertaken without even the most minimal consideration for Congress or local officials. It has happened in state after state, to Democrats and Republicans, and with little or no regard for the rule or the intent of law. I want to quote Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt from an article in the National Journal, dated May 22, 1999. In the article, Secretary Babbitt was quoted as saying:  
   When I got to town, what I didn't know was that we didn't need more legislation. But we looked around and saw we had authority to regulate grazing policies. It took 18 months to draft new grazing regulations. On mining, we have also found that we already had authority over, well, probably two-thirds of the issues in contention. We've switched the rules of the game. We're not trying to do anything legislatively.  
   In other words, an end run of Congress, which is an end run of the American people. 
   That is a remarkable statement by an extremely candid man, and his intent to work around Congress is clearly reflected in this most recent decision. Clearly, Secretary Babbitt and his staff felt the rules that they've created allow them to ``pull the welcome mat for recreational users'' to our national parks. 
   As further evidence of this Administration's abuse of Congress--and therefore of the American people--Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner was quoted in the same article as saying:  
   We completely understand all of the executive tools that are available to us--And boy do we use them.  
   So it is handy for them to avoid the legislative route, to avoid coming through Congress; they do it through executive orders and mandates. 
   While Ms. Browner's words strongly imply an intent to work around Congress, at least she did not join Secretary Babbitt in coming right out and admitting it. 
   I for one am getting a little sick and tired of watching this Administration force park users out of their parks, steal land from our states and counties, impose costly new regulations on farmers and businesses without scientific justification, and force Congress to become a spectator on many of the most controversial and important issues before the American people. 
   It's getting to the point where I'm not sure what to tell my constituents. I've been on the phone with snowmobilers in Minnesota and they ask what can be done. I start to explain that because of the filibuster in the Senate and the President's ability to veto, it will be difficult for Congress to take any action. I've found myself saying that a lot lately. Whether it's regulations on Total Maximum Daily Loads, efforts to put 50 million acres of forests in wilderness, or new rules to regulate a worker's house should they choose to work at home, this Administration just doesn't respect the legislative process or the role of Congress. Nor does this Administration respect the jobs, traditions, cultures, of lifestyles of millions of Americans. If you're an American who has yet to be negatively impacted by the actions of this Administration, just wait your turn because you were evidently at the end of the list. Sooner or later, if they get their way in the next few months, they're going to kill your job, render your private property unusable, and ban you from accessing public lands that have been accessible for generations. 
   Regrettably, many of us in Congress are now left with the proposition of telling our constituents that we must wait for a new Administration. I have to tell them that this Administration is on its way out the door and they're employing a scorched earth exit strategy. And I have to warn them that the situation could get worse if a certain Vice President finds himself residing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue next year. 
   I have to admit, there's nothing pleasurable about telling your constituents to wait until next year. I think it's important to remember that, as Senators, we are the representatives of every one of our constituents. When I have to tell a constituent that Congress has lost its power to act on this matter, I'm actually telling that constituent that he or she has lost their power on this matter. When I have to tell a snowmobiler that the Administration doesn't care what Congress has to say about snowmobiling in national parks, I am really telling him or her that the Administration doesn't care what the American people have to say about snowmobiling in national parks. Congress did not get a chance to debate it or to represent the people back home. I doubt any of us could've said that any better than Donald J. Barry said it himself. 
   When forging public policy, those of us in Congress often have to consider the opinions of the state and local officials who are most impacted. If I'm going to support an action on public land, I usually contact the state and local officials who represent the area to see what they have to say. I know that if I don't get their perspective, I might miss a detail that could improve my efforts. I also know that the local officials can tell me if my efforts are necessary or if they're misplaced. They can alert me to areas where I need to forge a broader consensus and of ways in which my efforts might actually hurt the people I represent. I think that is a prudent way to forge public policy and a fair way to deal with state and local officials. 
   I know, however, that no one from the Park Service ever contacted me to see how I felt about banning snowmobiling in Park Service units in Minnesota. I was never consulted on snowmobile usage in Minnesota or on any complaints that I might have received from my constituents. While I've not checked with every local official in Minnesota, not one local official has called me to say that the Park Service contacted them. In fact, while I knew the Park Service was considering taking action to curb snowmobile usage in some Parks, I had no idea the Park Service was considering an action so broad, and so extreme, nor did I think they would issue it this quickly. 
   I do not think any local officials thought this would happen. I know those involved in the snowmobile industry had no idea, while talking with this administration, this was going to come down. It was a shot out of the blue. 
   I believe this quick overreaching by the Park Service was unwarranted. It did not allow time for Federal, State, or local officials to work together on this issue. It did not bring snowmobile users to the table to discuss the impact of this decision on them. It did not allow time for Congress and the administration to look at all of the available options or to differentiate between parks with heavy snowmobile usage and those with occasional usage. This decision stands as a dramatic example of how not to conduct policy formation and formulation. It is an affront to the  consideration American citizens deserve from their elected officials. 
   I would like to repeat that. This decision stands as a very dramatic example of how not to conduct policy formulation and is an affront to the consideration that I believe American citizens deserve from their elected officials. 
   I hope we take a hard look at this decision and call the administration before Senate committees for hearings. I believe there has been one scheduled. Senator CRAIG THOMAS, I believe, will be holding such a hearing on May 25 to try to bring some administration officials before Congress and to ask some very simple questions: Why was this action taken? I have long believed we can have an impact on these matters by holding strong oversight hearings and by forcing the administration to be accountable for their actions. We cannot, however, simply stand by and watch as this administration continues its quest, in its final, waning days, for even greater power, power that will come at the expense of the deliberative, legislative process envisioned by the founders of this country. 
   Secretary Babbitt, Administrator Browner, and Donald J. Barry may believe they are above working with this Congress. But only we can make sure that they are reminded, and we can do it in the strongest possible terms, that when they neglect Congress they are neglecting the American people. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, almost one year ago today, I came to the floor of the Senate to recognize a very important group of individuals: Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel. 
   I would like to take some time again this year to applaud the selfless efforts of the men and women who dedicate themselves to such a worthy cause day in and day out. For most of us, it is hard to imagine going to work every day not having any idea what kind of tragic situations we may encounter or what kinds of dangers we might face. These dedicated individuals overlook these challenges every day and often imperil themselves to help those in need of medical attention. 
   Unfortunately, especially given the important work they do, this group often goes unrecognized. I rise today in support of National EMS Week and want to recognize EMS personnel by celebrating their selfless efforts with thanks and gratitude. My praise comes early; while National EMS Week is observed during the third week in May, I felt it necessary to make these remarks today, as many EMS personnel will be honored this evening at a special reception held here in Washington, DC. 
   Mr. President, this year's National EMS Week theme, ``New Century, New Hope,'' encourages a forward-looking, optimistic approach to identifying and meeting newly emerging community challenges. EMS is a complex, integrated system of personnel in both ambulances and hospitals that provides excellent care in emergency medical situations by affecting safe and efficient transport and treatment until more advanced medical care can be delivered. Importantly, EMS also includes the person who recognizes an emergency and summons help through a phone call to 9-1-1. This is the beginning of a very important chain of communication and care, which results in saved lives. 
   During both the 105th and 106th Congresses, I have come to the floor of the Senate to introduce the Emergency Medical Services Efficiency Act, S. 911. This bill was a product of the Emergency Medical Services Advisory Committee that I formed in 1997 to evaluate some of the problems facing EMS providers. Because I believe there is an overriding public health interest in ensuring a viable and seamless EMS system, I continue to pursue passage of S. 911. 
   This legislation attempts to create acceptable government standards for EMS providers and allows expansion in the next century to enable providers to better serve their local communities. A first priority included in my bill is for ``prudent layperson'' language to accompany the approval of EMS services under many medical plans, especially Medicare. One of the most fiscally disruptive forces is the denial of emergency transport due to a physician's reevaluation of what ``seemed'' critical and is later labeled as being ``medically unnecessary.'' Portions of this legislation have already been approved by the Senate. In addition, S. 911 calls for EMS providers to play a role in the process of providing recommendations on how federal regulatory policy is made. I think this makes sense, and most importantly, it gives EMS providers a clear voice in identifying and finding a solution to the most challenging aspects of critical care delivery. 
   On an annual basis, the American Ambulance Association recognizes EMS personnel from around the country for their selfless contributions to their profession, and presents them with the Star of Life Award. This year, 94 individuals were chosen by their peers to receive this prestigious award. I would like to personally thank those honorees for their service, and commend them on the respect they have generated for themselves and their profession amongst their peers and the public. 
   Again, I would like to applaud the efforts of all EMS personnel. They have the sometimes unenviable task of cleaning up the messes that life affords every community, but they do it with pride and they do it well. I plan to do everything in my power to provide these individuals with the additional tools and loud voice that they have earned through their devotion to our local communities.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to praise the work of Minnesota's hospitals and those across America as we recognize National Hospital Week. This year's theme, ``Touching The Future With Care,'' focuses on the heart of the hospital system: its people. For those Minnesota doctors, nurses, administrators, and volunteers who consistently provide the highest level of quality health care in America, I commend your selfless efforts. You are very deserving of our recognition here today. 
   Hospitals are open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, providing their communities with around-the-clock health care services. In my own state of Minnesota, 142 hospitals and 22 different health care systems provide Minnesotans with one of the most efficient and effective health care systems in the United States. This is not a result of mere chance. Rather, it is the combined efforts of our health care professionals--those men and women who devote themselves to the delivery of timely, quality health care, when and where it is needed. 
   As we all know, American hospitals have faced severe challenges over the last several years due to rapidly declining reimbursement rates under Medicare. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 made dramatic changes to the payment rates to hospitals, clinics, nursing homes, and individual providers. In fact, Medpac, Congress' Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, reported that profit margins for hospitals across the country dropped nearly 40 percent between 1998 and 1999. This is the lowest level in 20 years. And to add insult to injury, the Congressional Budget Office reported that Medicare payments, which serve as one of the largest revenue sources to hospitals, would realize a 62% decrease over the next five years. Clearly, in an industry that is already running on fumes, we cannot afford to cut deeper into the margins of hospitals and simply hope that they will be able to absorb the added losses and continue to provide the quality health care that we expect. 
   Last year, in an effort to reduce some of this burden, Congress attempted to address the problem with the 1999 Balanced Budget Refinement Act. This legislation restored some of the drastic cuts called for in 1997, and provided relief in payments for outpatient services. This effort has already made a measurable difference and has enabled many hospitals and other providers to remain in business. Yet, this is only half the problem. 
   The Balanced Budget Refinement Act addressed outpatient care provided by hospitals, and now, through legislation  I cosponsored earlier this year called the American Hospital Preservation Act, we are addressing inpatient services. This is the other half of the equation. The American Hospital Preservation Act will help restore the scheduled 1.1 percent reduction in the inflation rate adjustment for in-patient services for years 2001 and 2002. Most importantly, this legislation will allow hospitals to better keep up with rapid increases in health-related costs. 
   Mr. President, we in Congress have a big task ahead of us. We need to remain steadfast in our commitment to these institutions and complement the efforts of the people who devote so much of themselves to saving and preserving the lives of others. National Hospital Week exists so that we may remember and recognize the efforts of these organizations, and more importantly, the people who work within them. I am proud of the level of quality health care that is provided through our city and rural hospitals in Minnesota, and I am going to continue to do all I can to help preserve the integrity of these institutions on which we all rely.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate Goodwill Industries Week and call attention to a leader in job training and employment services for people with disabilities and other barriers to employment. 
   Nearly a century ago, Reverend Edgar Helms, a Methodist minister from Boston, founded Goodwill on the premise of reusing household goods and clothing from wealthy neighborhood homes to create a system that provides the poor with training, jobs, and self-esteem. The Goodwill philosophy of ``a hand up, not a hand out'' was born, and has blossomed into a $1.5 billion non-profit organization. Dr. Helms' own words described Goodwill Industries as both an ``Industrial program as well as a social service enterprise ..... a provider of employment, training and rehabilitation for people of limited employability, and a source of temporary assistance for individuals whose resources were depleted.'' 
   Just a few of the programs offered include retail skills training through a partnership with Target stores, service technician training on-site at Valvoline Instant Oil Change locations, and construction skills training at Habitat for Humanity building sites. These programs, matched with Goodwill employment services, prepare people to enter the workforce in high-demand fields. 
   Goodwill Stores funnel nearly 84 cents of every dollar spent at Goodwill towards employment and training programs for people faced with barriers to employment. This includes individuals with disabilities, people with limited work history, those who have experienced corporate downsizing, and recipients of government support programs. By operating autonomously, each of the 182 Goodwill member organizations adapts its services to meet the needs of its local community. This allows them to design specific programs and services that give Goodwill graduates the appropriate skills they need to find work close to home. 
   Goodwill programs may not be for everyone, but Goodwill Industries International, through its employment and training efforts, provided necessary services for nearly 321,000 people worldwide in 1998, people who now have the tools to accomplish the goals in life that were once beyond their grasp. 
   For this week of May 7-13, I commend those who have made a difference in someone's life through the services of Goodwill Industries and those who accomplish new heights in their careers thanks to these much-needed programs.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to talk about the Department of Interior's recent decision to ban snowmobiling in most units of the National Park System. 
   While the Interior Department's recent decision will not ban snowmobiling in Minnesota's Voyageurs National Park, it will impact snowmobiling in at least two units of the Park System in my home State--Grand Portage National Monument and the St. Croix National Scenic Riverway. In addition, this decision will greatly impact Minnesotans who enjoy snowmobiling, not only in Minnesota, but in many of our National Parks, particularly in the western part of our country. 
   When I think of snowmobiling in Minnesota, I think of families and friends. I think of people who come together on their free time to enjoy the wonders of Minnesota in a way no other form of transportation allows them. I also think of the fact that in many instances snowmobiles in Minnesota are used for much more than just recreation. For some, they're a mode of transportation when snow blankets our state. For others, snowmobiles provide a mode of search and rescue activity. Whatever the reason, snowmobiles are an extremely important aspect of commerce, travel, recreation, and safety in my home state. 
   Minnesota, right now, is home to over 280,000 registered snowmobiles and 20,000 miles of snowmobile trails. According to the Minnesota United Snowmobilers Association, an association with over 51,000 individual members, Minnesota's 311 snowmobile riding clubs raised $264,000 for charity in 1998 alone. Snowmobiling creates over 6,600 jobs and $645 million of economic activity in Minnesota. Minnesota is home to two major snowmobile manufacturers--Arctic Cat and Polaris. And yes, I enjoy my own snowmobiles. 
   People who enjoy snowmobiling come from all walks of life. They are farmers, lawyers, nurses, construction workers, loggers, and miners. They are men, women, and young adults. They are people who enjoy the outdoors, time with their families, and the recreational opportunities our diverse climate offers. These are people who not only enjoy the natural resources through which they ride, but understand the important balance between enjoying and conserving our natural resources. 
   Just 3 years ago, I took part in a snowmobile ride through a number of cities and trails in northern Minnesota. While our ride didn't take us through a unit of the National Park Service, it did take us through parks, forests, and trails that sustain a diverse amount of plant and animal species. I talked with my fellow riders and I learned a great deal about the work their snowmobile clubs undertake to conserve natural resources, respect the integrity of the land upon which they ride, and educate their members about the need to ride responsibly. 
   The time I spent with these individuals and the time I have spent on my own snowmobiles have given me a great respect for both the quality and enjoyment of the recreational experience and the need to ride responsibly and safely. They have also given me reason to strongly disagree with the approach the Park Service has chosen in banning snowmobiles from our National Parks. 
   I was stunned to read of the severity of the Park Service's ban and the rhetoric used by Assistant Secretary Donald J. Barry in announcing the ban. In the announcement, Assistant Secretary Barry said, ``The time has come for the National Park Service to pull in its welcome mat for recreational snowmobiling.'' He went on to say that snowmobiles were, ``machines that are no longer welcome in our national parks.'' These are not the words of someone who is approaching a sensitive issue in a thoughtful way. These are the words of a bureaucrat whose agenda has been handwritten for him by those opposed to snowmobiling. 
   The last time I checked, Congress is supposed to be setting the agenda of the Federal agencies. The last time I checked, Congress should be determining who is and is not welcome on our Federal lands. And the last time I checked, the American people own our public-lands--not the Clinton administration and certainly not Donald J. Barry. 
   In light of such brazenness, it's amazing to me that this administration, and some of my colleagues in Congress, question our objections to efforts that would allow the Federal Government to purchase even larger tracts of private land. If we were dealing with Federal land managers who considered the intent of Congress, who worked with local officials, or who listened to the concerns of those most impacted by Federal land-use decisions, we might be more inclined to consider their efforts. But when this administration, time and again, thumbs its nose at Congress and acts repeatedly against the will of local officials and American citizens, it is little wonder the some in Congress might not want to turn over more private land to this administration. 
   I cannot begin to count the rules, regulations, and executive orders this administration has undertaken without even the most minimal consideration for Congress or local officials. It has happened in state after state, to Democrats and Republicans, and with little or no regard for the rule or the intent of law. I want to quote Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt from an article in the National Journal, dated May 22, 1999. In the article, Secretary Babbitt was quoted as saying:  
   When I got to town, what I didn't know was that we didn't need more legislation. But we looked around and saw we had authority to regulate grazing policies. It took 18 months to draft new grazing regulations. On mining, we have also found that we already had authority over, well, probably two-thirds of the issues in contention. We've switched the rules of the game. We are not trying to do anything legislatively.  
   That is a remarkable statement by an extremely candid man, and his intent to work around Congress is clearly reflected in this most recent decision. Clearly, Secretary Babbit and his staff felt the rules that they've created allow them to ``pull the welcome mat for recreational users'' to our national parks. 
   As further evidence of this administration's abuse of Congress--and therefore of the American people--Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Carol Browner was quoted in the same article as saying:  
   We completely understand all of the executive tools that are available to us--And boy do we use them.  
   While Ms. Browner's words strongly imply an intent to work around Congress, at least she did not join Secretary Babbit in coming right out and admitting it. 
   Mr. President, I for one am getting a little sick and tired of watching this  administration force park users out of their parks, steal land from our States and counties, impose costly new regulations on farmers and businesses without scientific justification, and force Congress to become a spectator on many of the most controversial and important issues before the American people. 
   It is getting to the point where I am not sure what to tell my constituents. I have been on the phone with snowmobilers in Minnesota and they ask what can be done. I start to explain that because of the filibuster in the Senate and the President's ability to veto, it will be difficult for Congress to take any action. I have found myself saying that a lot lately. Whether it is regulations on Total Maximum Daily Loads, efforts to put 50 million acres of forests in wilderness, or new rules to regulate a worker's house should they choose to work at home, this aAdministration just doesn't respect the legislative process or the role of Congress. Nor does this administration respect the jobs, traditions, cultures, of lifestyles of millions of Americans. If you are an American who has yet to be negatively impacted by the actions of this administration, just wait your turn because you were evidently at the end of the list. Sooner or later, if they get their way in the next few months, they're going to kill your job, render your private property unusable, and ban you from accessing public lands that have been accessible for generations.Regrettably, many of us in Congress are now left with the proposition of telling our constituents that we must wait for a new administration. I have to tell them that this administration is on its way out the door and they're employing a scorched earth exit strategy. And I have to warn them that the situation could get worse if a certain Vice President finds himself residing at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue next year. 
   I have to admit, there is nothing pleasurable about telling your constituents to wait until next year. I think it is important to remember that, as Senators, we are the representatives of every one of our constituents. When I have to tell a constituent that Congress has lost its power to act on this matter, I am actually telling that constituent that he or she has lost their power on this matter. When I have to tell a snowmobiler that the administration doesn't care what Congress has to say about snowmobile in national parks, I am really telling him or her that the administration doesn't care what the American people have to say about snowmobiling in national parks. Well, I doubt any of us could've said that any better than Donald J. Barry said it himself. 
   When forging public policy, those of us in Congress often have to consider the opinions of the state and local officials who are most impacted. If I'm going to support an action on public land, I usually contact the state and local officials who represent the area to see what they have to say. I know that if I don't get their perspective, I might miss a detail that could improve my efforts. I also know that the local officials can tell me if my efforts are necessary or if they're misplaced. They can alert me to areas where I need to forge a broader consensus and of ways in which my efforts might actually hurt the people I represent. I think that is a prudent way to forge public policy and a fair way to deal with state and local officials. 
   I know, however, that no one from the Park Service ever contacted me to see how I felt about banning snowmobiling in Park Service units in Minnesota. I was never consulted on snowmobiling usage in Minnesota or on any complaints that I might have received from my constituents. While I've not checked with every local official in Minnesota, not one local official has called me to say that the Park Service contacted them. In fact, while I knew the Park Service was considering taking action to curb snowmobile usage in some Parks, I had no idea the Park Service was considering an action so broad, and so extreme, nor did I think they would issue it this quickly. 
   This quick, overreaching action by the Park Service, I believe, was unwarranted. It did not allow time for federal, state, or local officials to work together on the issue. It didn't bring snowmobile users to the table to discuss the impact of the decision. It didn't allow time for Congress and the Administration to look at all of the available options or to differentiate between parks with heavy snowmobile usage and those with occasional usage. This decision stands as a dramatic example of how not to conduct policy formulation and is an affront to the consideration American citizens deserve from their elected officials. 
   I hope we take a hard look at this decision and call the administration before Senate Committees for hearings. I have long believed that we can have an impact on these matters by holding strong oversight hearings and by forcing the Administration to account for its actions. We cannot, however, simply stand by and watch as the Administration continues its quest for even greater power at the expense of the deliberative legislative processes envisioned by the founders of our country. Secretary Babbit, Administrator Browner, and Donald J. Barry may believe they're above working with Congress, but only we can make sure they're reminded, in the strongest possible terms, that when they neglect Congress they're neglecting the American people. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the National Day of Prayer, Thursday, May 4. Today is a special and exceptional opportunity for all citizens of our country to join together in prayer. 
   Days of prayer have been a fundamental part of our American heritage since 1775, when the Continental Congress, recognizing the need for guidance as it undertook the enormous challenge of forming a new Nation, designated a time for prayer. President Abraham Lincoln continued this tradition. In 1863, in the midst of the Civil War, he proclaimed a day of ``humiliation, fasting, and prayer.'' 
   The National Day of Prayer has been celebrated formally since its enactment by Congress in 1952. In 1988, President Reagan signed a bill setting the  National Day of Prayer on the first Thursday of every May. Now, each year, the President signs a proclamation encouraging all Americans to pray on this day. 
   The theme for this year's National Day of Prayer is ``PRAY2K: America's Hope for the New Millennium.'' During the times of both triumph and adversity that surely lie ahead, I know prayer will help America's leaders and citizens to direct our country on the right path for the new millennium. 
   In the 1st Century A.D., the apostle Paul wrote to the Philippians, telling them, ``Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.'' 
   It is my hope the citizens of my home state of Minnesota, and people across this Nation, will take that advice and present the concerns of the country in prayer not only on May 4, but every day of the year. I know many thousands of students will gather today at the State Capitol in Minnesota, to pray for their leaders and their peers in an event entitled ``Share the Light 2000.'' I applaud their efforts and commend them in their commitment to this important day. 
   I thank everyone involved in making this day possible year after year and all those who will take part in the National Day of Prayer. May the spirit that fills our hearts this day remain strong always.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today is Tax Freedom Day, the day on which working Americans stop working just to pay their State, Federal, and local taxes and actually begin keeping their earnings for themselves. 
   This is an important day for American taxpayers, but it is certainly not a happy occasion because every year--since 1913--Tax Freedom Day has arrived later and later. This means that Americans are working more hours and more days every year just to pay their tax bill. This year, Americans had to work 124 days for their local, State and Federal governments before they could finally start working for themselves and their families on May 3. 
   What is even more troubling is that in 13 States--including my home State of Minnesota--Tax Freedom Day will arrive 2 or more days later than the rest of the Nation. That means Minnesota taxpayers have to wait longer before they can start working for themselves, not for the Government. 
   Despite the fact that Americans work so long for the Government, we have recently heard a lot of talk on the Senate floor and in the media that the Federal tax bite is the smallest in 40 years and that the era of big government and high taxes is over. If that is true, why hasn't Tax Freedom Day arrived earlier than last year? 
   The stark truth is that the Federal Government's tax collecting--and spending--are still too high. 
   The facts speak for themselves. Although the total Federal tax burden is slightly lower thanks to our tax-relief initiatives, particularly the bill I authored to provide a $500 per-child tax credit, the combined burden of Federal personal income and payroll taxes is well above the figures of both World War II and 1980 prior to the Reagan tax cut. Federal taxes consume 20.4 percent of GDP, compared to 17.5 percent of GDP when President Clinton took office. Since 1993, federal taxes have increased by 54%, which for the average taxpayer translates into a $2,000 tax hike. 
   The combined personal income and payroll tax soared to 16.3% of GDP in 1999, up from 14.2% in 1992. Measured as a share of GDP, the personal income tax rose from 8% in 1981 to 9.6% in 1999. The payroll tax now takes 6.8% of GDP, up from 4.5% in 1970. 
   On average, each American is paying $10,298 this year in Federal, State, and local taxes. A typical family now pays more of its income in total taxes than it spends on food, clothing, transportation, and housing combined. More and more middle-income families are being pushed into higher tax brackets each year. 
   Even for most low- and middle-income families, federal payroll taxes take a huge bite of their income, and it keeps growing. For example, in 1965, a family earning wages of $10,000 paid $348 in payroll taxes. Today, that family would pay $1,530 in payroll taxes--an increase of 340 percent. 
   According to the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan group that tracks the government tax bite at all levels, the total tax burden has grown significantly since 1992. While State and local taxes have grown somewhat, Federal taxes account for the largest share of the increase. 
   Federal, State and local taxes claim 39.0 percent of a median two-income family's total income and 37.6 percent for a median one-income family, according to a Tax Foundation study. 
   During the Clinton administration, Tax Freedom Day has leap frogged almost 2 weeks from April 20 in 1992 to May 3 this year. The Clinton Presidency means working Americans have to spend an extra 13 days working for Government. Not since the era of the Vietnam War and President Johnson's ``Great Society'' programs has Tax Freedom Day been pushed back so far in such a short period of time--and this is from an administration that claims it has put an end to ``big government.'' 
   The Government is getting bigger, not smaller. Some people claim that big Government is over because Government spending as a percentage of GDP is shrinking. The real question is how do we measure the size of the Government? Is it the number of employees, the number of dollars spent, the tax burden, the hidden costs of regulations, or all of the above? I believe it should be all of the above. The growth of the economy does not have to be linked to the growth of Government. In fact, I have always said that we can streamline the Government and still provide all the Government services we need. 
   A more meaningful way to measure Government spending is to look at the number of dollars spent. Since President Clinton took office in 1993, Government spending has increased from $1.40 trillion to $1.83 trillion in 2000, a 30-percent rise. During the same period, Government revenue increased from $1.15 trillion to $2.08 trillion, a 75-percent increase. 
   The growth for domestic nondefense spending was 6.3 percent between 1990 and 1995. In the last 2 years alone, nondefense spending grew by 5.3 and 6.8 percent. President Clinton has proposed a 14-percent increase in his last budget. If this is not big Government, what is? 
   If President Clinton's spending frenzy continues, it will wipe out the entire $1.9 trillion non-Social Security surplus in less than 3 years, leaving none of these tax overpayments to return to taxpayers in the form of debt reduction, tax relief and Social Security reform. But our colleagues on the other  side of the aisle do not say this increased spending is risky. They instead claim that our tax relief efforts to let the people keep a little more of their own money is risky. 
   People today work hard, and then are penalized for their work. With punitive taxes, Washington makes the American dream of working hard for a better life more difficult, and for some, impossible. How can anyone call the elimination of the marriage tax penalty for 21 million American families risky? 
   It is clear that the American people are still overtaxed despite the progress we have made to reduce taxes. Congress must provide meaningful tax relief to help alleviate the tax burden on working Americans. 
   But the only way we can effectively push back Tax Freedom Day is to terminate the tax code and replace it with one that promotes tax freedom and economic opportunity. We must repeal the 16th amendment and abolish the IRS. We must create a new tax system that's fairer, simpler, and friendlier to taxpayers. 
   Tax Freedom Day--it should be more than just another reminder of the high cost of Government. We owe it to the American taxpayers to work together to fix the system. Only when we begin to shorten the number of days that Americans work for Government, and allow them to own the fruits of their labor, can we truly celebrate Tax Freedom Day.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to take just a few minutes today to speak about the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act and the President's recent veto of this legislation. 
   Throughout the past 5 years, I have repeatedly come to the Senate floor to discuss this important issue and its impact on my home State of Minnesota. I have, on countless occasions, laid out for Members of the Senate the history of the nuclear energy program and the promises made by the Federal Government. Every time I sit down to discuss this matter with stakeholders, I am reminded that the Federal Government not only allowed, but strongly encouraged, the construction of nuclear power plants across the country. 
   This point needs to be clearly understood by the Members of this body. Our Nation's nuclear utilities did not go out and invest in nuclear power in spite of Federal Government warnings of future difficulties. Instead, they were encouraged by the Federal Government to turn to nuclear power to meet increasing energy demands. Utilities and states were told to move forward with investments in nuclear technologies because it is a sound source of energy production. 
   It is important to note that the Federal Government's support for nuclear power was based on some very sound considerations. First, and I believe most important, nuclear power is environmentally friendly. Nothing is burned in a nuclear reactor so there are no emissions released into the atmosphere. In fact, nuclear energy is responsible for over 90% of the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that have come out of the energy industry since 1973. Between 1973 and 1996, nuclear power accounted for emissions reductions of 34.6 million tons of nitrogen oxide and 80.2 million tons of sulfur dioxide. 
   Second, nuclear power is a reliable base-load source of power. Families, farmers, businesses, and individuals who are served by nuclear power are served by one of the most reliable sources of electricity. In Minnesota, nuclear power accounts for roughly 30% of our base-load generation. 
   Third, nuclear energy is a home-grown technology and the United States led the way in its development. We have long been the world leader in nuclear technology and continue to be the world's largest nuclear producing country. Using nuclear power increases our energy security. 
   Finally, much of the world recognizes those same values and promotes the use of nuclear power because of its reliability, its environmental benefits, and its value to energy independence. 
   Because of those reasons, the Federal Government threw one more bone to our Nation's utilities. It said if you build nuclear power, we will take care of your nuclear waste. We will build a repository and take it out of your States. In response to those promises, over 30 States took the Federal 
   Government at its word and allowed civilian nuclear energy production to move forward. 
   Ratepayers agreed to share some of the responsibilities, but were promised some things in return. They agreed to pay a fee attached to their energy bill to pay for the proper handling of the spent nuclear fuel in exchange for an assurance that the Federal Government meet its responsibility to manage any waste storage challenges. Because of these promises and measures taken by the Federal Government, ratepayers have now paid over $15 billion, including interest, into the Nuclear Waste Fund. Today, these payments continue, exceeding $600 million annually, or $70,000 for every hour of every day of the year. In Minnesota alone, ratepayers have paid over $300 million into the Nuclear Waste Fund. 
   In summary, the Federal Government promoted nuclear power, utilities agreed to invest in nuclear power, states agreed to host nuclear power plants, and ratepayers assumed the responsibility of investing in the long-term storage of nuclear waste. And still, nuclear waste is stranded on the banks of the Mississippi River in Minnesota and on countless other sites across the country because the Department of Energy has a very short-term memory and this administration has virtually no sense of responsibility. 
   We can argue all day long in this Chamber on the merits of nuclear power. But we cannot deny that the Federal Government promoted nuclear power and promised to take care of nuclear waste. 
   The Clinton administration, however, would have you believe that they do not have a responsibility to deal with nuclear power. I have been working with Senator MURKOWSKI and many other Members over the roughly 5 years that I have been in the Senate to establish an interim repository for nuclear waste and move forward with the development of a permanent repository. We have brought a bill to the floor that accomplishes those objectives in each of the past two Congresses. Each time, we passed the bill in both the House and the Senate with overwhelming, bipartisan support. Just over 2 years ago, we passed a bill that would have removed nuclear waste from States by a vote of 65-34 and the House passed the bill with 307 supporters--a veto-proof majority. We have had extensive debate with the opportunity for anyone to offer amendments. We have thoroughly addressed most issues related to nuclear waste storage, including the transportation of waste across the United States. Yet every time we have passed a bill that fulfills the Federal Government's commitments, President Clinton has issued his veto threat and stopped our efforts in their tracks. 
   Here we are again. The President has vetoed the legislation before us today and apparently taken great pride in doing so. Time and again, when confronted with making the tough decisions about the future of our Nation's energy supply, this President has ``punted,'' and refused to take any responsibility for the energy needs of our growing economy.  
   If it were not such a serious matter, I would have to say that the President's approach to energy policy is comical. When was the last time anyone here heard the President speak in any great detail about energy issues? He does not. I do not think he cares or at least his policies reflect a great degree of indifference to the energy needs of our Nation's consumers. 
   He has turned over the reins of the Energy Department not just to Secretary Richardson, but to AL GORE, and Bruce Babbitt, and Carol Browner, and anyone else who has an agenda with an aspect of the energy industry. 
   As many of my colleagues know, I have been a strong critic of the Department of Energy since coming to Congress in 1992. I have long argued that the Department has failed miserably on its most basic mission of increasing our Nation's energy independence. The Department was created in the late 1970's in response to that decade's energy crisis. Since that time, our reliance on foreign oil has increased from 35% to almost 60% today. In the 1970s, we were looking to increase our use of nuclear energy, today we are looking at closing down plants before their licenses have expired. In the 1970s, much like today, hydro power was a very popular form of electricity generation among the American public. Even still, this Administration wants to rip apart hydro dams in the Northwest and, I guess, replace them with fossil fuels. 
   Therein lies the great irony of the Clinton administration's approach to energy and the environment. This administration had the vision to agree to legally binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions while at the same time failing to take even the most basic steps to protect emissions free nuclear power plants from shutting down. I asked the administration's chief Kyoto negotiator, Stuart Eizenstat, about nuclear energy during a Foreign Relations Committee hearing and he said that we absolutely needed nuclear energy to meet the demands of the Treaty. In fact, he said that he believed his own administration ought to have done more and ought to be doing more to promote nuclear power. Mr. Eizenstat, the President's signature on this bill would have been a great first step. Instead, this President has taken an action which I argue is harmful to the environment and contradicts his statements and actions that he wants to improve air quality in our country. 
   Nuclear energy, however, is not the only example of this administration's hypocrisy on energy and the environment. Hydro power, as well, is an emissions free form of electricity generation. Yet this administration is engaged in at least two separate activities that undermine the future of hydro power and its environmental benefits. As I mentioned earlier, this administration wants to rip open hydro dams in the northwest and, I guess, replace that electricity with fossil fuels. Second, this administration, in its electricity restructuring proposals, wants to require a certain usage of renewable energy but refuses to include hydro power as a renewable energy source. These are all perfect examples of how this administration isn't truly interested in results oriented clean air goals. Instead, they want to deeply involve themselves in the process of achieving environmental goals, regulate like crazy, and predetermine winners and losers. Unfortunately, the only real losers in the Clinton energy circus are the American consumers. 
   I want to touch on one last Clinton administration energy and environment contradiction. As my colleagues know, this administration has been opposed to new oil and gas development on public land. In fact, Vice President GORE recently stated that he would do everything in his power to stop offshore oil and gas leasing. Both President Clinton and Vice President GORE tout these stances against oil and gas development as part of their legacy of environmental protection. I ask my colleagues, do you think other nations on whom we rely for our oil supplies are employing the environmental protections and reviews that we require? Do you think Iran, Libya, 
   or Iraq are going the extra mile to protect the environment? Do you think the OPEC nations are holding themselves to the stringent environmental standards to which we hold companies on U.S. soil? We all know the answer is an emphatic no. Yet this administration is opposing virtually any exploration of oil and gas reserves on public land for environmental reasons, while at the same time, it employs its ``tin cup diplomacy'' that relies upon countries like Iran, Iraq, Libya and others to increase their production for us. I ask my colleagues, if you look at the global impacts of the Clinton administration's actions, who are the real environmentalists? Certainly not the Clinton administration. It is clear to me that this administration's policy against exploration and development, when compared against its policy of begging for increased oil production abroad, is a net loss for American jobs, family checkbooks, domestic energy security, and the environment. 
   I am getting a little off track, but I believe this point needs to be clearly understood when we are talking about a long- term plan to remove, transport, and store nuclear waste. This administration is not concerned about results, nor is it really concerned about the environment. Instead, this administration is concerned solely with its political agenda and keeping the nuclear industry on the ropes. 
   We can, as a nation, move forward now and deal with our nuclear waste. There is simply no scientific nor technological reasons why we cannot move waste from civilian reactors to a central repository. In fact, we ship waste across our Nation right now--including the waste we have accepted from 41 other nations under the Atoms for Peace program. Our Nation's fleet of nuclear powered vessels go from international port to port. They protect the world and our Nation's interests in a way that is only allowed them through the use of nuclear power. There is overwhelming proof that we can transport nuclear waste on ships, roads, and rail without a threat to either the environment or human beings. 
   I am going to support the legislation before us, and I urge my colleagues to do the same. If the President is not going to have an energy policy, then we in Congress had better step forward and forge one of our own. When the brownouts begin increasing in frequency and energy rates rise, President Clinton will be long gone and we will be left to explain to our constituents why their family lost its power, their business lost a days work, or their farm was unable to milk its cows. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to discuss an amendment that I hope to offer later to the proposed Educational Opportunities Act. To get right to the needs of this amendment, it would permit States to fulfill the assessment requirements of this bill by testing students at the local district level, or at the classroom level, and with a nationally recognized academic test, such as the Iowa Test of Basic Skills, and also to provide school districts a choice of State-approved standards from which to teach their students. 
   This is an amendment that seeks to maintain more authority at the local level where decisions are best made. It would provide more flexibility for schools to choose their own assessments to meet State standards without losing any of the accountability needed to ensure students are achieving. Basically, it would offer schools an option on how they want to measure the academic standards for achievements of their students--not to have this cookie-cutter-type proposal out of Washington that says this is the only way it can be done but to allow some flexibility for States that might want to use a different measuring stick. 
   In Minnesota, the Federal requirements to implement a set of State standards and accompanying State assessments have resulted in a highly controversial State content standard called the ``profile of learning.'' Many parents in Minnesota have expressed to me their concern about the vague and indefinite nature of the profile standards and also the consequential decline of academic rigor in the classroom. Parents also object to some of the intrusive test questions that have been asked of the students. A poll taken a few months ago showed that only 9 percent of public school teachers support continuation of the profile as it is currently written in the State of Minnesota. 
   The students who visit my Washington office on school trips almost universally believe the time spent on fulfilling the profile requirements has shortchanged them from obtaining real academic instruction. Some of the assessments, entitled ``performance packages'' in Minnesota, can take from 3 to 6 weeks to complete, sacrificing some very valuable class time for students. The performance packages required under the profile are often assigned to groups of students, and inevitably some students end up pulling more of the weight than others. It is hard to see how this group system ensures that each student is assessed based upon his or her individual performance or effort. 
   I won't get into many particulars of the profile standards, but they, unfortunately, focus too much on politically fashionable outcomes and not enough on transmitting to students a core body of knowledge. For instance, one of the profile ``performance packages''--let me explain this to you--was for a student to ``violate a folkway,'' which means to do something odd or unexpected in a public place; and then they would have their partner come along with them who, in the background, would watch how people reacted and write down that reaction. I think it would be an understatement to say that a school project such as that would be of extremely questionable value, just as an example. 
   The Thomas P. Fordham Foundation, which publishes a review of State standards nationwide, stated that in the English portion of the profile ``a large number of standards are not 
   specific, measurable, or demanding.'' 
   We have another expert, a standards expert, Dianne Ravitch, who wrote the following about the profile:  
   I will be candid because I don't have time to be diplomatic. In the area of social studies, the Minnesota standards are among the worst in the Nation. They are vague. They are not testable. I advise you to toss them out and start over.  
   A professor at one of the Minnesota State universities describing the profile wrote:  
   The detail, the record keeping, the assessment for each individual is enough to make one's head spin. The time that will be devoted to paperwork will, of necessity, distract teachers from planning, preparation, reflection, working with students, and other essential tasks. I pity the poor teacher who tries to bring it off and any nonlinear-thinking student who falls victim to Minnesota-style results-based learning.  
   It is obvious that in Minnesota we have a real problem with education standards. In fact, the Minnesota House of Representatives voted last year to scrap the profiles completely, but unfortunately that bill was not adopted by the full legislature. 
   Our children's education is too important to be the subject of experimentation with the latest politically correct instructional fad. I want Minnesota students to excel, and I want to make sure Minnesota school districts have a choice of standards--again, not a cookie-cutter model from Washington or imposed by Washington to qualify for any funding. I believe Minnesota will adopt new standards and assessments, if not this year, then in the near future. I want to help ensure school districts are not forced to follow a fad, but that they have some options in how to assess their students' education. 
   Though the profile has not been replaced, there is a strong grassroots movement toward rigorous academic standards in Minnesota which has been embodied in legislation that creates an alternative academic standard that emphasizes very clear, rigorous standards, local control, and accountability to parents. 
   This State legislation has been entitled the ``North Star Standard,'' and it is the intent of the bill's sponsors to implement this standard as a local option so that local school districts can choose between the North Star Standard or the profile. They can stick with the new politically correct system or they can go to an academically rigorous system that allows students to learn more. 
   My amendment would clarify that there can be two sets of standards and assessments from which local school districts can choose. Again, that is all my amendment asks for. It says it would clarify that there could be two sets of standards and assessments from which local school districts could choose--again, not the one dictated standard of how to get it done but leaving some options and allowing at least  a second set of standards that parents and teachers could choose. 
   For districts choosing the North Star Standard, students may be assessed at the classroom or local district level, not the State level. To ensure true accountability, the North Star Standard sets up strict reporting requirements. Teachers would have to provide parents a complete syllabus, information on the curriculum, homework assignments, and testing. Thus, the parents would know what their students are learning and what their children are being tested on, protecting against the temptation to ``dumb down'' any of the tests to make things look better. 
   While academic rigor is currently being compromised in Minnesota through a system of standards and assessments that aren't challenging and involve time-consuming projects that take valuable time away from classroom instruction, it would be returned through local ``full disclosure'' requirements to parents. Local testing would be tied to the curriculum, and the testing would also include a nationally recognized test such as the Iowa Test of Basic Skills. 
   The North Star Standard would also create an alternative, State-level set of academic standards that are clear, unambiguous, and present what a student should know, without dictating a specific curriculum or how teachers are to teach that body of information. In other words, we don't want tests written and then teachers teaching to the tests. I believe this standard is closer to what was intended under the ESEA of 1994. 
   The theme of this reauthorization bill has been more State and local flexibility in exchange for accountability. I believe we can maximize that accountability if we leave it to local school boards and parents. The North Star Standard is an appropriate response to the shortcomings of the State-level standards and assessments experiment in Minnesota. 
   I firmly believe that nothing we do here in Congress should inhibit the efforts of citizens to reform their school systems in a manner they choose, and that they know what is best for their children. 
   Parents are the moving force behind development of the North Star Standard. These parents, some of which are current and former local school board members, feel passionately about the education of all children, and have carefully crafted a standard and assessment structure that they believe, and I believe, will improve the education of Minnesota students. 
   Again, this amendment is designed not to create a mold for one size fits all, but to allow states to have two sets of standards and assessments and to allow a local school district and teachers the opportunity to choose their own assessment that meets the outcomes we all want. I urge my colleagues to help my constituents restore the proud history of excellent educational achievement in the Minnesota public schools by supporting this amendment when I have the opportunity to offer it later this week. 
   Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, the true spirit of Americanism cannot truly be captured in the pages of history. It is not found in our vast acquired lands, nor is it printed in our two-century-old Constitution. Americanism is felt and entrenched deep in our soul. It is the goose bumps we get when hearing the Star Spangled Banner and the emotional chills that run through our veins when witnessing the changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The undying passion and loyalty we have for our nation is Americanism. 
   John Adams understood this loyal, patriotic, American spirit when he wrote, ``Our obligations to our country never cease but with our lives.'' In fulfillment of that obligation, many lives have been sacrificed to guarantee our liberties for ourselves and our posterity. The loyalty and devotion demonstrated by the veterans of our Armed Forces must never be forgotten or discounted. 
   Every year on May 1, our country takes the opportunity to celebrate that passionate allegiance and pay tribute to those before us who unselfishly ensured the continued success of America and strength of our democracy. Thanks to the efforts of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Congress mandated in 1958 that May 1 of each year shall be recognized as ``Loyalty Day.'' Across the nation, VFW posts express their steadfast commitment by sponsoring parades, hosting banquets and replacing worn flags in their communities. 
   While Loyalty Day is an occasion to reminisce about past achievements, we should also take this opportunity to focus on our future. As history has repeatedly shown, challenges to our ideals of democracy are imminent. Each previous generation has shown valor in rising to face those challenges. Now the continued success of our nation relies on instilling in our young people an ardent appreciation for our American ideals, so they may be prepared to face future obstacles. 
   Each of us in our own unique way can show our commitment to the ideals upon which this nation was founded. Whether flying the flag, visiting a monument, teaching a child the Pledge of Allegiance or simply thanking a veteran, I ask that you join me today in celebrating Loyalty Day. I encourage everyone to discover the passion of our forefathers and experience the pride of true Americanism.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I proudly rise today in recognition of National Science and Technology Week. Since 1985, the National Science Foundation has used this opportunity to celebrate and bring awareness to the scientific and technological wonders that encompass our lives. 
   American spirit and determination have created advancements our society could not have imagined a mere 50 years ago. As the world embraces the new information age, our quality of life has been the benefactor. Telecommunications and the Internet have brought billions of people together, while biotechnology research gives hope to solving many of our world's medical mysteries. Environmental technology allows increased sustainability of our precious natural resources and space sciences open up new and exciting worlds. 
   Science, education, and community organizations all over the U.S. are participating in National Science and Technology Week. Clearly, promoting the awareness of science and technology to the public benefits everyone. In particular, piquing the interest of children has been proven to instill a lifetime of learning. The importance of a strong scientific education is indisputable, for the skills we learn as children prove invaluable on a daily basis in adult life. Here in Congress, the legislative process utilizes scientific reasoning methods to pinpoint problems, research solutions, experiment, and choose the best course of action. 
   I am proud of my efforts during the 106th Congress to secure $5 million in funding for improvements to the Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge and National Park Services operations in the new Science Museum of Minnesota. Our state-of-the-art museum allows all Minnesotans the opportunity to experience wonders of science ranging from a face-to-face encounter with a polar bear to navigating a virtual towboat down the Mississippi River. I encourage all our citizens to plan a visit soon. 
   As National Science and Technology Week activities are conducted across the country, it is my hope that all Americans reflect on the significance of science and technology in our society. In science, as in all of life, the only barriers we cannot overcome are those we do not attempt. Please join me this week in celebrating our achievements and potential.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Minnesota members of the National Grange. This week is Grange Week, which celebrates the oldest U.S. rural community service, family-orientated organization with a special interest in agriculture. In recognition of its members in Minnesota, and across the United States, I want to take this time to reflect on the accomplishments of the National Grange during the past 133 years. 
   Organized in 1867, the National Grange assisted farmers who were trying to dig out of financial troubles that plagued them after the Civil War. Today, this organization continues to advance the best interests of agriculture and promote the family values that are rooted so deeply in rural America. 
   This commitment is easily seen in the Grange's involvement in many local service projects, such as organizing community response teams to cope with disasters, assisting in community development revitalization, volunteering at local schools, and promoting farm and home safety, along with other important activities. 
   In my home state of Minnesota, the State Grange has been influential in the development of many key projects and services since 1867. Around the turn of the century, the State Grange played a crucial role in helping farmers and people in rural areas get home delivery of their mail and take part in rural electrification projects. They also helped form the University of Minnesota School of Agriculture. 
   Mr. President, because its members understand the importance of the family farm and the communities they reside in, it is easy to see why the Grange has been so successful in its many endeavors. I am pleased to make this statement on behalf of the Minnesota Grange, and I wish them well and commend them for their many hours of volunteer service--service that is vital to all our communities.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, on May 6-8, 2000, more than 1200 students from across the United States will be in Washington, D.C. to compete in the national finals of the We the People.......The Citizen and the Constitution program. It is an honor for me to announce that a class from Stillwater Area High School will represent the state of Minnesota in this national event. These young scholars have worked very hard to reach the national finals and through their experience have gained a deep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles and values of our constitutional democracy. 
   The names of the students are: Chad Anderson, Ellen Andersen, Luke Anderson, Sara Apel, Rob Cole, Alexis DuPlessis, Melissa Ellis, Kim Garvey, Elissa Green, Kyle Knoepfel, Joey Korba, Amy Kruchowski, Kirsten Lindquist, Beth Manor, Emily Michnay, Alex Nelson, Steve Peterson, Chris Richter, Chris Siver, Stefan Tatroe, Melissa Zanmiller. 
   I would also like to recognize their teacher, Kathleen Ferguson, who deserves much of the credit for the success of the class. 
   The We the People.......The Citizen and the Constitution program is the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The three-day national competition is modeled after hearings in the United States Congress. These hearings consist of oral presentations by high school students before a panel of adult judges. The students testify as constitutional experts before a panel of judges representing various regions of the country and a variety of appropriate professional fields. The students' testimony is followed by a period of questioning by the simulated congressional committee. The judges probe students for their depth of understanding and ability to apply their constitutional knowledge. Columnist David Broder described the national finals as ``the place to have your faith in the younger generation restored.'' 
   The program provides students with a working knowledge of our Constitution, Bill of Rights, and the principles of democratic government. Members of Congress and their staff enhance the program by discussing current constitutional issues with students and teachers and by participating in other educational activities. 
   I am confident the class from Stillwater High School will represent Minnesota well and I wish these young ``constitutional experts'' all the best.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. J. Res. 3, the proposed constitutional amendment to establish certain rights for victims of violent crime. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislative proposal introduced by Senators KYL and FEINSTEIN. 
   I have always cherished the basic freedoms established by the United States Constitution. This precious document provides important rights to every American--rights which have encouraged their active participation in the functions of our Republic. For example, the First Amendment encourages free speech and association, while the 19th and 26th Amendments were ratified to protect the voting rights of women and eighteen-year-old citizens. 
   As we debate the merits of the proposed Crime Victims Constitutional Amendment, I am reminded of the constitutional rights guaranteed to persons accused of crime. These include the right: to a speedy and public trial by jury; to know the nature of the accusation; to confront witnesses; to counsel; and rights against excessive bail, fines, or cruel or unusual punishment. These rights promote the involvement of the accused in court and should not be diminished by Congressional action. 
   In recent years, Congress has enacted legislation that seeks to establish certain rights for victims of crime, including the 1990 Victims Rights and Restitution Act, which required federal law enforcement agencies to make their best efforts to ensure that crime victims are treated with fairness and respect. Most recently, we enacted the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 and the Victims Rights Clarification Act of 1997, which sought to allow crime victims to observe court proceedings even if they were expected to testify during the sentencing hearing. Additionally, all fifty states now have either constitutional amendments or statutes that seek to protect the rights of crime victims. 
   Despite these efforts by Congress and the States, I am very concerned that the United States Constitution does not protect the rights of victims and promote their involvement in the criminal justice process. In my view, the Crime Victims' Rights Amendment is the most effective way to address the current imbalance between the rights of defendants and victims within the Constitution. As a constituent from St. Paul recently wrote, the proposed amendment will, ``Prevent victims from being victimized twice. First, by the crime, then by the judicial system when they learn that those accused have all the rights.'' These concerns are shared by the Department of Justice, constitutional scholars, and various victim advocates such as the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. 
   The proposed constitutional amendment to protect the rights of crime victims is not a new concept. As my colleagues may know, it was first recommended in 1982 by President Reagan's Task Force on Victims of Crime. Since its initial introduction during the 104th Congress, Senators KYL and FEINSTEIN have worked tirelessly to improve this proposal and preserve the rights of defendants and the authority of prosecutors. Importantly, the Crime Victims' Rights Constitutional Amendment received strong, bipartisan support upon its passage by the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month. 
   I would not support a proposal to change the fundamental character of the Constitution or eliminate the basic freedoms that it provides to Americans. However, I also believe that the rights of crime victims are not trivial to the needs of our nation and are worthy of protection under the Constitution. Passing additional laws or state constitutional amendments that may be ignored by federal and state court comes at the expense of those who have fallen victim to violent crime and who expect equal justice from the criminal justice system. 
   In addition, we must not forget that many crime victims are afraid of being victimized again and face retaliation by criminal offenders. We must ensure that victims feel respected throughout the criminal justice process. I believe establishing certain constitutional rights for crime victims will help to encourage greater reporting of crimes and cooperation with law enforcement. The Crime Victims' Constitutional Amendment would allow for greater participation in the criminal justice system in a manner completely consistent with constitutional amendments that have established a citizen's right to participate in other government processes. 
   I respectfully disagree with those who suggest that the Crime Victims' Constitutional Amendment conflicts with the principle of federalism. As someone who has worked to maintain the distinction between federal and state responsibility, I am pleased that this amendment provides an appropriate level of flexibility to the States. Specifically, this amendment would allow the States to pass legislation to define ``victims of crime'' and ``crimes of violence.'' It would also allow States to determine the degree of ``reasonable'' notice to public proceedings or the release or escape of a criminal offender that will be provided to crime victims. 
   Ultimately, it will be three-quarters of the States that must decide whether to consider and ratify this amendment. Passage of this amendment will not impose any rights upon the States without careful and lengthy consideration by the State legislatures. In fact, this amendment has been endorsed by 49 of our nation's Governors, the elected officials who are most concerned about unnecessary federal mandates being imposed upon the States. Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has indicated that this amendment will not impose additional costs upon the States. 
   I also understand the concerns of those who suggest that the Crime Victims' Rights Amendment will disadvantage defendants during court proceedings. However, the amendment does not deprive the accused of any of their constitutional rights. It would ensure respect and basic fairness for crime victims through a constitutional right to be notified of court proceedings; to attend all public proceedings; to be heard at crucial stages in the process; to be notified of the offender's release or escape; to consideration for a trial free from unreasonable delay; to an order of restitution; to have the safety of the victim considered in determining a release from custody; and to be notified of these basic rights. 
   In proclaiming the first ``Victims Rights Week'' in 1981, President Reagan stated, ``For too long, the victims of crime have been the forgotten persons of our criminal justice system. Rarely do we give victims the help they need or the attention they deserve. Yet the protection of our citizens--to guard them from becoming victims--is the primary purpose of our penal laws. Thus, each new victim personally represents an instance in which our system has failed to prevent crime. Lack of concern for victims compounds that failure.'' 
   Mr. President, I firmly believe that the Crime Victims' Rights Amendment will help to restore public confidence in the criminal justice system and give crime victims the protection they deserve. The high number of crime victims in our society underscores the need to pass this amendment and send it to the States for their careful consideration. I urge my colleagues to support passage of this important public safety initiative.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak for a few minutes about National Park Week and the value of National Parks to our nation's citizens. 
   As families and individuals throughout our nation know, America's national parks are the envy of the world and considered by many to be our national treasures. In our nation's parks, wildlife flourish, scenic beauty remains abundant, and families escape the pressures of everyday life. Our parks are truly one of our nation's best investments--an investment that will provide generations of Americans with the same recreational and educational opportunities we now enjoy. 
   President Clinton has designated April 17-23, 2000, as National Park Week. The National Park Service now estimates that over 285 million Americans visit our 378 national parks every year. At each site, visitors find themselves confronted with important moments in our nation's history, wonderful natural scenic sites, and cultural treasures which remind us of our distinguished, and sometimes difficult, past. Our parks, in many ways, are a microcosm of our nation and of ourselves, and they continue to document for future generations those qualities about America which must be preserved for eternity. 
   In the 105th Congress, I was proud that Congress took a significant step forward in updating the management of our Nation's parks and improving visitor services by passing the ``Vision 2020 National Park System Restoration Act,'' a bill I cosponsored. The Vision 2020 Bill, authored by Senator CRAIG THOMAS of Wyoming, is a commonsense approach to improving both the management and facilities of national parks by bringing everyone to the table and seeking consensus. The passage of the Vision 2020 bill was an important first step toward bringing accountability to park management, addressing the tremendous backlog of park projects, and improving visitor services. 
   I was also proud to obtain $2 million in last year's appropriations bills for the National Park Service's portion of the Mississippi River National Center in Minnesota's new Science Museum. The exhibit will include information on the importance of the Mississippi River to Minnesota's array of interests. This is a partnership between the Park Service and the Science Museum that will give Minnesotans a greater appreciation for all aspects of recreation and commerce on the Mississippi River. 
   My home state of Minnesota is home to five units of the National Park Service. They are Voyageurs National Park, which on April 8 celebrated its 25th anniversary, Pipestone National Monument, Grand Portage National Monument, the Mississippi National River and Recreation Area, and the Saint Croix National Riverway. I've urged Minnesotans to visit these sites during this week and to gain a greater appreciation for opportunities they offer. 
   Mr. President, our parks remain one of America's most important legacies for future generations and a constant reminder of the progress, splendor, and triumphs of our past.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I proudly rise today to pay tribute to the University of Minnesota women's hockey team on their recent national championship victory. This is truly an accomplishment of which all Minnesotans can be proud. 
   In only its third season, the Golden Gopher program has become a national powerhouse. In 1998, the Gopher's inaugural year, the team finished fourth in the nation. Last year, they crept closer to the national title with a third-place finish. This season's 32-6-1 record was the best in the nation. 
   Under the leadership of coach Laura Halldorson, the Gopher women defeated instate rival University of Minnesota-Duluth in the semifinals, 3-2, after being down 2-0. This come-from-behind victory gave the Golden Gophers a berth in the American Women's College Hockey Alliance National Championship game versus top-seeded Brown University. 
   The March 25 championship game at Boston's Matthews Arena proved to be a tough-fought contest. The Gopher women fell behind by a score of 1-0 in the first period, but once again made a strong comeback. Led by goalie Erica Killewald's 34 stopped shots, in the Gophers held off Brown for a 4-2 victory. 
   While this incredible season was clearly the result of phenomenal teamwork, there are individual efforts that should be recognized. Gopher goalie Erica Killewald's spectacular performance earned her the tournament MVP  honors. Also awarded all-tournament honors were Nadine Muzerall, Winny Brodt and Courtney Kennedy. 
   As the popularity of women's hockey spreads throughout the nation, Minnesotans have embraced the sport--and their Golden Gophers. Now the program is poised to lead the charge towards greater advancements in women's athletics. I commend the women's dedication and relentless hard work. With only one graduating senior on this year's Gopher squad, I am hopeful for many more national championships.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to submit a concurrent resolution designating Hermann Monument and Hermann Heights Park in New Ulm, Minnesota, as national symbols of the contributions of Americans of German Heritage. I would like to thank Congressman DAVID MINGE and the other members of the Minnesota Congressional Delegation for introducing a similar resolution in the House of Representatives. 
   Mr. President, I'd be surprised if anyone in this chamber has heard of Hermann Monument, but I would like to take a few minutes to explain its significance to the City of New Ulm, the State of Minnesota, and Americans of German Heritage across the United States. 
   The Hermann Monument was erected in 1889 as a tribute to German immigrants to the United States. It honors Hermann the Cheruscan, who forged the creation of a united Germany by defeating three Roman Legions who had occupied the area now known as Germany. Hermann remains a symbol of German history, culture, dedication, and perseverance. 
   The Hermann Monument, made of copper sheeting riveted to a steel interior frame, was dedicated in New Ulm, Minnesota, on September 25, 1897. It stands 102 feet tall and is the second largest copper statue in the United States, behind only the Statue of Liberty. The Hermann monument remains the only memorial in the United States dedicated to German heritage and the contributions to American culture, arts, industry, and government. 
   I believe it's also important to note that there are now almost 58,000,000 individuals of German heritage living in the United States, comprising nearly 25 percent of our nation's population. That number makes German-Americans the largest ethnic group in the United States. In Minnesota, the number doubles to roughly 50 percent of Minnesotans being of German heritage. 
   Today, however, the Hermann Monument faces a serious threat from over 100 years of rain, wind, heat, humidity, hail and other challenges that have rendered the monument in need of restoration. Thankfully, the people of New Ulm have formed the Hermann Monument Renovation Project to raise the roughly $1.75 million needed to restore the monument and construct an Interpretive Center at its base. 
   Mr. President, the legislation Senator WELLSTONE and I are introducing provides no funding for the restoration of the Hermann Monument. In fact, the Resolution costs the Federal Government nothing. Instead, our Resolution simply recognizes the Hermann Monument as a national symbol of the contributions of German Americans and gives the restoration project a boost in the arm. Our Resolution is a way for every member of the Senate to recognize the contributions of German Americans across the country. It doesn't preclude another such designation in the United States nor does it designate the Hermann Monument as the only National symbol for German Americans. 
   Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me, Senator WELLSTONE, the Minnesota Congressional Delegation, the Society of German-American Studies, the Steuben Society of America, the City of New Ulm, and the people of Minnesota in supporting this Resolution recognizing the contributions of German Americans and the national significance of New Ulm's Hermann Monument.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to follow the Senator from Texas and talk about one of the most important issues we are going  to be considering this week. Especially for young families, this could be one of the most important issues we are going to vote on maybe this year. That is the question of waiving the marriage tax penalty. 
   The Senator from Texas has done an excellent job in laying out some of the concerns, some of the questions, and some of the boundaries of how this is imposed and who is paying this tax. 
   Is it a fair tax? When you make a commitment to somebody to get married, should you also have to somehow make a commitment to Uncle Sam? And that commitment is to pay higher taxes. That is not fair. It would be like going into a store and buying a suit. The suit is $100. And they ask: Are you married? You say yes. They say: Well, that will be $150. 
   Why would we pay more? Why would we penalize someone just because they are married or if they are single? 
   I also want to give a lot of credit to Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON, the other Senator from Texas, for all the work over these last couple of weeks--working with her and others to highlight the problems with the marriage penalty, whom it affects, and how much money it really means to those couples. 
   We just held a news conference outside the Capitol. Among those speaking were, of course, representatives of a number of groups that represent working families across this country that are there supporting it, along with the Senators who were there to support it; but I think most importantly there were three couples who also came to tell their story, why they thought getting rid of this marriage tax penalty was so important, how they urged Congress to pass this bill, and not only urged the Congress to pass it but urged President Clinton to sign this into law. 
   Their stories were about young couples with one child and expecting another and how, after they are married, they look at the tax forms and find because they are married--young families not making a lot of money--their tax this year is going to be about $1,100 more because they are married--nearly $100 in penalty every month for this young couple. 
   Another couple from Maryland talked about the penalty they have--well over $1,400 a year. Again, why? Because they are married. 
   Go to the Tax Code, to the page referring to you, and look down the lines, and if you are married, there is a penalty. 
   As one man said, at many weddings across the country today there is an uninvited guest. That uninvited guest is the tax man. He says: Good, you are getting married; when you fill out your tax forms this year, you will pay more to Washington in taxes. 
   Some in the Senate who say we don't need to repeal this marriage tax penalty. As Senator GRAMM of Texas says, some say they are rich people; they can afford to pay this tax. Don't give them this break. They are rich. 
   They are the ones who are advocating somehow Washington needs these dollars more than the couples. 
   There are over 21 million couples across the country penalized at an average of $1,400 a year just because they are married. A young couple Senator CRAIG and I will talk about, when Senator CRAIG comes back to the floor, has a story I have heard a number of times; that is, the couple planned on marrying toward the end of the year, but after filling out their taxes and comparing it to what they would pay in taxes next year because they were married, they have decided to put the wedding off at least for a couple of weeks beyond the December 31 date so as a couple they will not be penalized because they are getting married. This is a young couple who have made a decision based on economics that because Uncle Sam wants to take a bigger bite out of their wallet, they are going to have to put off their plans to get married for at least several weeks just to get around the corner. 
   We have heard stories of friendly divorces where people have actually decided to have a friendly divorce so they save some money. Or the story of the 78-year-old man who called his wife of over 50 years and said: Do you want a divorce? She said: What are you talking? He said: I am at the tax man's office and if we get a divorce we could save a lot of money. 
   They didn't do it, but it is unfair that the couple is having to pay more dollars in taxes because they are married. 
   There are going to be stories during this debate, as the Senator from Texas pointed out, that somehow there is a marriage bonus, many people on one side are getting this bonus because they are married; or the couple on this side who is being penalized. Somehow that is supposed to wash out and be fair and even. I don't think that is true. These families should not be overtaxed, incur a tax penalty, only because they have decided they are going to get married. 
   I hope, when we consider this legislation this week, we consider these millions of families across the country who are paying on average about $1,400 a year. Nearly $30 billion will be collected for Washington this year from these families. There is a belief that Washington needs this money more than the families do to raise their kids, to buy the clothes, to buy the food, to pay for the mortgage, to put away money for the education of their children. All this is so important, but Washington needs it more. 
   Several years ago, President Clinton was asked at a news conference if he thought the marriage tax penalty was fair. He said, no, it is not really fair, or something to that effect. But the underlying message from the President was, even if it is not fair, Washington can use this money a lot more than the families can. Washington needs these dollars more than the families need these dollars. 
   I hope, when we get a chance to vote on this, we remember these families struggling to make ends meet, families looking for that extra dollar they can put into a savings account for their child's education, or just maybe buying something extra, maybe putting money away for a vacation or a night out for pizza, whatever is important to them. I think $1,400 a year speaks loudly for them. 
   As I said, Washington might believe it needs the money more than these families. However, if we have the families on the floor of the Senate, and one by one ask them if this is an important bill, are these dollars important to your family, could these dollars help out in your budget decisions, or should we give the money to Washington and hope and pray that Washington will give a few of the dollars back? I think if we leave the dollars in the pockets of the families to begin with, they will make the best decisions and they will not have to look to Washington or ask Washington or beg Washington for a few of the dollars to help them raise their families. 
   I defer to my colleague from Idaho.

   Mr. GRAMS. The Senator from Idaho is correct. Two young people who we care deeply about, one a dedicated employee in my office and one an employee in the office of the Senator from Idaho, are among the latest victims of this insidious provision of the Tax Code. 
   One of my legislative assistants is a young man from Minnesota. He worked for me in Minnesota and also here in Washington, DC, for over 5 years. He is engaged to be married to a young woman in the office of the Senator from Idaho, a native of Idaho who has worked in my colleague's office for almost 3 years. 
   This young couple, very much similar to other couples all around the Nation, is moved by faithful affections, shared values, common life goals to become a family. But the Federal Tax Code is saying something different to this young couple.

   Mr. GRAMS. I answer the Senator from Idaho by saying it does not. Again, if there are those in the Senate who believe this is one of those rich families who can afford to pay this tax, believe me, these are not rich young people. They are a hard-working young couple but by no means rich. They will work hard and probably will get there someday but right now they are not. 
   It is the furthest thing from fairness. That is the Federal Tax Code. Even if this couple escapes the marriage tax penalty this year, they will still have to pay next year and the next year and the year after, for most of the rest of their lives, unless we change that, as we are trying to do this week with the legislation before the Senate. 
   We are not talking about abstract tax policy. We are not talking about economic theory. We are talking about average families, real families, who are hurt every year by the marriage tax penalty. In many cases, we are not talking about a delay of a wedding. We are talking about a Tax Code that says do not get married if your family may need that second income because the IRS has first claim on that income. 
   I asked that member of my staff why they felt they needed to postpone their wedding a few weeks. He told me it did not make any sense for him and his fiance to fork over another $1,400 to the Federal Government. 
   Some might think that is cheating the Government, but he didn't think so. He said they already pay too much in taxes, and they simply cannot afford to give the Government even more of what is rightfully theirs. My staff member said they can use that money for their wedding, they can use it to help take a trip, or to plan for their family's future, rather than giving it to the Federal Government at a time when the Government simply does not need it. I think he made an excellent point. 
   Washington is taking this money from young couples at a time when it doesn't need the money and these young couples do. I think it is not only wrong but a disgrace that Washington has the large appetite for the hard-earned money of people across America who simply want to get married, start a family, and to begin their lives together.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, to wrap up, our staff's story is not uncommon. There are many young couples who are forced to make similar decisions. 
   The marriage penalty tax has discouraged women from marriage. It even has led some married couples to get friendly divorces. They continue to live together, but save on their taxes. 
   Dr. Gray Burtless of the Brookings Institution recently found that the decline in marriage may be a major reason why income inequality has increased across families. He believes that many poor unmarried workers suffer because they do not have a spouse's income to help support their family. 
   The Economist magazine offered a possible implication of this finding:  
   Mr. Burtless's research suggests that the Clinton administration, rather than fretting about skills and trade, would do better to encourage the poor to marry and make sure their spouses work.  
   The family has been, and will continue to be, the bedrock of our society. Strong families make strong communities; strong communities make for a strong America. We all agree that this marriage penalty tax treats married couples unfairly. Even President Clinton agrees that the marriage penalty is unfair. 
   Contrary to these American values, the Federal tax code contains 66 provisions that can penalize married couples and force them to give more of their income to Washington. The Government's own study shows that 21 million American couples or 42 percent of couples incurred marriage penalties in 1996. This means 42 million individuals pay $1,400 more in tax than if they were divorced, or were living together, or simply remained single--more taxes than they should have. 
   This was not the intention of Congress when it created the marriage penalty tax in the 1960s by separating tax schedules for married and unmarried people. 
   If we do not get rid of this bad tax policy that discourages marriage, millions of married couples will be forced to pay more taxes simply for choosing to commit to a family through marriage. 
   The marriage penalty is most unfair to married couples who are both working, it discriminates against low-income families and is biased against working women. As more and more women go to work today, their added incomes drive their households into higher tax brackets. In fact, women who return to the work force after raising their kids face a 50-percent tax rate--not much of an incentive to work. 
   The good news is, Congress is working hard to provide marriage penalty relief to married couples. American couples may finally get a congressional blessing this year to eliminate the unfair marriage penalty taxes if our colleagues from the other side cooperate and join in our effort. 
   The marriage penalty repeal legislation which we currently debate would eliminate the marriage penalty in the standard deduction; provide broad-based marriage tax penalty relief by widening the 15-percent and 28-percent tax brackets; allow more low-income married couples to qualify for the earned income credit; and preserve the family tax credits from the bite of the alternative minimum tax which allow American families to claim full tax credits such as the $500 per child tax credit, which I authored. 
   Millions of American families are still struggling to make their ends meet. Repealing the marriage penalty will allow American families to keep an average of $1,400 more each year of their own money to pay for health insurance, groceries, child care, or other family necessities. 
   Elimination of the marriage penalty tax brings American families one step closer to the major tax relief they deserve. It is particularly important to note that this repeal will primarily benefit minority, low- and middle-class families. 
   Studies suggest the marriage penalty hits African-Americans and lower-income working families hardest. Repeal the penalty, and those low-income families will immediately have an 8-percent increase in their income. 
   It is unfair to continue the marriage penalty tax. There is no reason to delay the passage of the legislation. I urge my colleagues in the Senate pass the marriage penalty relief legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize National Library Week and pay tribute to those dedicated individuals who, through their passion for books and learning, make our libraries places of great discovery. 
   If a child wants to know everything there is to know about space, you could send them up there in a rocket ship. If they're interested in tornadoes, you could send them out after one with a crew of storm chasers. If they'd like to meet George Washington, you could even send them back in time. You could--if you just knew how. 
   Or, you could send them to the library instead. 
   National Library Week is April 9-15, and there's no better place than our libraries for bringing the world and the events that shape it--past and present--to life. Fortunately, a child doesn't need any special gadgets to experience all the library has to offer; they just need a library card. 
   As Congress debates important issues like the federal budget and how to save Social Security, the library is also an excellent place for young people to learn more about government and what's happening in Washington. And of course, the librarians are always there to help. 
   On the occasion of National Library Week, I urge all Americans to check out a book--and ``check out'' all the riches their local library has to offer.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, boxer Muhammad Ali once said, ``Service to others is the rent you pay for your room here on earth.'' Minnesota's volunteers exemplify that philosophy, and during National Volunteer Week, April 9-15, we celebrate their passion for their communities. 
   National Volunteer Week offers an opportunity to salute the millions of dedicated men, women, and young people for their efforts and their commitment to serve. Volunteers are one of this nation's most valuable resources, making this year's Volunteer Week theme--``Celebrate Volunteers!''--very appropriate. 
   Minnesotans can be proud that our state has one of the highest rates of volunteerism in the nation. While 56 percent of Americans volunteer nationally, two-thirds of all Minnesotans give back to their communities through volunteering. According to state officials, this show of strength returns $6.5 billion a year in donated hours to Minnesota communities. 
   Thanks to the many Minnesota volunteers who help make our communities better, more compassionate places to live. For those who have yet to discover the joy that comes from serving others, I invite them to get involved--and remember the words of Henry David Thoreau: ``One is not born into the world to do everything but to do something.'' Volunteering is truly your opportunity to do something.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I've come to the Senate floor on a number of occasions in recent weeks to express my concern with rising fuel costs and the lack of an energy policy by this Administration. I don't have to remind my colleagues how the rising cost of oil threatens almost every aspect of our economy and communities. Senior citizens on fixed incomes cannot absorb extreme fluctuations in their energy costs. Business travelers and airlines cannot afford dramatic increases in airline fuel costs. Families struggling to feed and educate their children cannot withstand higher heating bills, increasing gasoline costs, or the domino effect this crisis has on the costs of goods and services. To be sure, this problem is impacting virtually every facet of American life and may only get worse as we approach the high energy demand of the summer months. 
   I look at the situation we're now facing with high oil prices and limited supply and have a hard time understanding why it's such a surprise to so many people. I've heard Secretary Richardson refer to the fact that the Energy Department may have been caught ``napping on the job.'' Since coming to Congress in 1993, I've been saying the Energy Department is asleep at the wheel. We have an Energy Department that spends less than 15% of its budget, and even less of its time, on the core energy issues within the Department. I dare say that energy consumers are the last thing they think about over on Independence Avenue--certainly not the first. 
   With all due respect to Secretary Richardson, I don't think he was necessarily caught napping on the job, but flat out neglecting the energy needs of this country. Under the tenure of the last three Secretaries of Energy, this Administration has done nothing but weaken our energy security, increase our reliance on foreign oil, shut down domestic oil and gas production, and ensure the closure or removal of many of our primary means of electricity generation--coal, nuclear, and hydropower. I think it's time that policy-makers in Washington come to the realization that we are now a nation with no energy policy and no ability to respond to even the most limited energy supply disruptions. 
   Consider the recent effort of the Administration to address the oil price crisis. We've all witnessed this Administration's ``tin-can diplomacy'' over the past few weeks. Instead of planning for the energy needs of our country, this Administration waits for a crisis and then responds by sending its appointees to grovel, plead, or otherwise beg other nations into helping us out. The United States, thanks to this Administration, is a nation running around the world looking for a handout from friend and foe alike. 
   It's embarrassing that the economy of our nation hinged on the decision of a few oil ministers sitting in a room in Vienna just a couple of weeks ago. Do we realize that Iran was blocking an OPEC increase of 1.7 million barrels of oil a day? The strength of our economy now may rest on the ability of OPEC oil ministers to convince countries like Iran to help us out in the future. That is quite a statement on the viability of the Clinton Administration energy policy. 
   But still, this Administration maintains its steadfast opposition to doing anything here in the United States to dramatically decrease our reliance on foreign oil and increase our domestic exploration and production. ANWR is off-limits. They don't want to discuss off-shore drilling. They claim they're open to looking at some activity on public lands, but at the same time they're on a blitz to lock up every last acre of land they can find into some type of new, restrictive designation before President Clinton and Secretary Babbitt leave office. 
   Well, the farmers of Minnesota can't wait for President Clinton or Secretaries Babbitt or Richardson to leave office before our country places a renewed emphasis on a sound, long-term energy policy. Truckers across America cannot wait for President Clinton to leave office to get some relief at the fuel pump. And energy consumers far and wide cannot stand by while this Administration begs countries like Iran and Libya to ``feel our pain.'' 
   Regrettably, I fear the oil supply and price crisis we're now experiencing is only an early warning of the pain the Clinton Administration's neglect of energy policy is going to level on American energy consumers. It won't be that far into the future before this Administration's appetite for closing down nuclear and coal-fired power plants and destroying hyrdopower facilities will bring similar price increases for electricity consumers. 
   Many of us have suggested that we need to look closely at both short- and long-term approaches to easing the pain of the current oil crisis on American energy consumers and reducing our nation's reliance on foreign oil. I've spoken at length about how we need to focus our efforts on developing a long-term energy policy that puts American jobs and productivity first, instead of last. Doing so, however, will take time and produce few immediate results to help consumers in the coming months. 
   In the short-term, I believe Congress must consider temporarily suspending some or all of the federal fuel taxes, which, along with state excise taxes, account for an average of 40 cents per gallon of gasoline. That is why I've joined Majority Leader TRENT LOTT, Senator LARRY CRAIG and a number of my colleagues in offering S. 2285--The Federal Fuels Tax Holiday Act of 2000. Our legislation would temporarily suspend the 4.3 cent tax on gasoline, diesel fuel, and aviation fuel while protecting both the Highway Trust Fund and the Social Security surplus. The bill will suspend the 4.3 cent tax starting on April 16 through January 1, 2001. For farmers, truckers, airlines, and other large energy consumers, this action will have an even greater positive impact on the large amounts of fuel they consume. 
   This legislation reflects the leadership of a number of our colleagues. Senator BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL from Colorado has championed legislation to suspend the diesel fuel tax. Once a trucker himself, Senator CAMPBELL has led the way in assisting truckers and their families who are suffering as a result of the rising price of diesel fuel. And Senator MURKOWSKI, as Chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, has been a leader in calling attention to the growing energy needs of our nation and the Administration's energy policy failures. 
   I want to add that I'm very aware that many of my colleagues have argued that 4.3 
   cents a gallon has a negligible impact on consumers. To them, I say look at the amount of fuel a farmer or trucker consumes during an average week. Look at the diesel fuel required to operate a family farm or deliver products across this country. Or look at the tight profit margins that can make the difference between going to work and being without a job. I'm convinced this action is going to help farmers, businesses, truckers, and families in Minnesota and that's why I strongly support it. 
   I firmly believe that federal gas taxes should go to the Highway Trust Fund for road, highway and bridge improvements. That's why we're restoring revenues being provided to energy consumers by the 4.3 cent gas tax suspension. The Highway Trust Fund will be reinstated with non-Social Security budget surplus funds from the current fiscal year as well as fiscal year 2001. In addition, no highway projects or airport projects will be delayed or jeopardized, because funds going into the trust fund are fully restored by the surplus. There will be no impact on these projects. 
   If gas prices reach a national average of $2 a gallon for regular unleaded gasoline, federal excise gas taxes would be suspended, again without impacting the Highway Trust Fund in any way. This would suspend, until the end of the year, the 18.4 cents per gallon federal gasoline tax, the 24.4 cents per gallon tax on highway diesel fuel and kerosene, the 19.4 cents per gallon for noncommercial aviation gasoline, the 21.9  cents per gallon for noncommercial jet fuel, and the 4.4 cents per gallon for commercial aviation fuel. 
   Let me make this very clear: we are not going to raid the Highway Trust Fund with this legislation. In fact, we've ensured that the non-Social Security budget surplus will absorb all of the costs of the gas tax reduction. I also want to assure my colleagues and my constituents that this legislation walls off the Social Security surplus. We will not spend any of the Social Security surplus to pay for the gas tax reduction. 
   Our legislation is quite simply a tax cut for the American consumer at a time when it's needed most. We're going to use surplus funds--funds that have been taken from the American consumer above and beyond the needs of government--and give them back to consumers every day at the gasoline pumps. This legislation takes concrete steps toward more reasonable fuel prices, helping to serve as a buffer for consumers who are already feeling the impact of the high cost of gasoline and other fuels. 
   In closing, I want to say that I look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming days, weeks and months in forging a number of both short-term and long-term responses to the needs of farmers, truckers, the elderly, and all energy consumers. I've been a strong supporter of renewable energy technologies and increased funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program or LiHEAP. I strongly support the efforts of my colleagues to increase domestic oil and gas exploration and production. I remain committed to finding a resolution to our nation's nuclear waste storage crisis--a crisis that threatens to shut down nuclear plants and further weaken our nation's domestic energy security. And I'll continue to be one of the Senate's strongest critics of the Department of Energy's unconscionable neglect of the long-term energy needs of our nation.

    Mr. GRAMS. Madam President, Galileo understood the importance of mathematics when he said, ``Mathematics is the alphabet with which God has created the universe.'' I proudly rise today in recognition of Mathematics Education Month. Additionally, I take this opportunity to applaud the tireless efforts of our nation's math teachers. 
   The importance of a strong mathematical education is indisputable. Our math skills prove invaluable on a daily basis. Without them we could not perform simple tasks such as buying groceries, following a recipe, or balancing our checkbooks, much less plan for our retirement or buy a home. Here in Congress, mathematical skills are essential to comprehending the incredibly complex issues of Social Security reform, taxes, and the federal budget process. 
   My home state of Minnesota boasts some of the best math educators in the country, dedicated men and women who have inspired a lifetime of learning in countless students. This has been proven time and again by Minnesota's status as a national leader in ACT and SAT math scores. Nevertheless, we should continue to make improvements and not be satisfied with our success. 
   One organization in my state deserves special accolades for its ongoing efforts to initiate those improvements. The Minnesota Council of Teachers of Mathematics is dedicated to the constant betterment of mathematical education at the elementary, secondary, and college levels. The Council's advocacy results in an ongoing effort to raise the bar for better education. I commend its members for their devotion to creating an awareness and interest in mathematics among young people. 
   As classrooms across America labor over long division, tangents and derivatives this month, it is my hope that students, parents, and teachers alike will reflect on the significance of mathematics in our society and join me in celebrating Mathematics Education Month.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support Senator ASHCROFT's amendment to the budget resolution. I commend his leadership on this vitally important issue. This amendment reassures the American people that Congress will not spend a penny of their Social Security and Medicare money. It will put the Senate on record that we honor our commitment. 
   This is a crucial step to truly protect the Social Security and Medicare surpluses and save them exclusively for American's retirement and health care needs, not for tax relief, not for government spending. 
   Beginning in 2008, 78 million baby-boomers will become eligible for retirement, and without immediate action taken by the Congress the system will begin to collapse. From that point on, we will have more retirees than ever before, and fewer workers paying into the system. 
   Washington has made the situation even worse because it keeps raiding the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. In 1998, American workers paid $489 billion into the Social Security system, but most of that money, $382 billion, was immediately paid out that same year to 44 million beneficiaries. That left a $106 billion surplus. The total accumulated surplus in the trust fund is more than $750 billion. 
   Unfortunately, this surplus exists only on paper. The government has consumed all that $750 billion for non-Social Security related programs. All it has are Treasury IOUs. 
   Even the Clinton administration admits that the trust fund does not actually exist. Here is what the President's last budget stated:  
   These trust funds balances are available to finance future benefit payments and other trust fund expenditures--but only in a bookkeeping sense. These funds are not set up to be pension funds, like the funds of private pension plans. They do not consist of real economic assets that can be drawn down in the future to fund benefits. Instead, they are claims on the Treasury, that, when redeemed, will have to be financed by raising taxes, borrowing from the public, or reducing benefits or other expenditures.  
   That's not acceptable. We must say no to anyone who wants to spend even a penny of the Social Security surplus because we promised the American people we would save it. There is no excuse in an era of budget surplus to continue raiding the Social Security trust funds. Washington has done enough damage to America's retirement system. 
   The just-released annual report of the Social Security Trust Fund's Board of Trustee's shows short-term improvement but continued long-term deterioration. The government will have to come up with $11.3 trillion from general revenues between 2015 and 2036 to make up the annual shortfall in the Social Security System. The inflation-adjusted cumulative deficit between 2015 and 2075 is now projected to be $21.6 trillion, up nearly 7 percent compared with last year's projection. If the economy takes a turn for the worse, or if the demographic assumptions are too optimistic, the trust fund could go bankrupt much sooner. 
   This makes our work to save and reform Social Security and Medicare even more urgent. 
   The Ashcroft amendment will bring us one step closer to protecting Social Security and Medicare. Unlike the previous Social Security lockbox, which locks up only the Social Security surplus, this amendment would extend that protection to the Medicare surplus as well. The Medicare part A surplus will be about $20 billion a year. This surplus should be preserved only for the medical expenses of senior Americans, not the general government spending. 
   If enacted, the Ashcroft amendment would, in effect, prevent anyone, whether it is the Congress or the administration, for raiding the Social Security and Medicare surplus. I believe this is absolutely the right thing to do. 
   Mr. President, the American people demand that we truly protect the Social Security and Medicare surplus, and they want to stop the federal government's practice of so-called ``borrowing'' from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. They are very worried that retirement funds will not be there for them, and they are concerned that the government will not be  able to return the more than $750 billion ``borrowed'' and spent by the government. 
   Over the next 10 years, American workers will put more than $2.3 trillion into the Social Security system. We must do everything we can to prevent the government from spending this Social Security and Medicare surplus under any circumstances. We need an enforcement mechanism to keep our promise to the American people. 
   The Ashcroft amendment provides the protection for Americans' retirement and health care money. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the YMCA organization and Ys across America as they celebrate Healthy Kids Day this April 8. 
   Every year on Healthy Kids Day, Ys focus their attention on children as they organize and provide an opportunity for the whole family to spend time together while improving their health. Last year, more than 1,200 YMCAs participated in Healthy Kids Day events. In Minnesota, some 100 Ys have developed their own activities for this year's Healthy Kids Day to serve their local needs. From cookouts to mentoring programs, this Saturday is for the children's benefit as well as their families. 
   Of course, the good work of the nation's YMCAs extends beyond Healthy Kids Day and into every day of the year. YMCAs promote healthy living habits and provide Americans of all ages with the tools to develop good character, empathizing respect and responsibility. Ys are for people of all faiths, races, abilities, and incomes. No one is turned away for inability to pay, as YMCA is the largest not-for-profit community service organization in America. The strength of America's YMCAs is in the people they bring together. 
   More than half of YMCA members are under the age of 18. Ys involve more than 8 million children in programs to help them build lasting habits of good health, including regular exercise, healthy eating and avoidance of substance abuse. YMCA volunteers and staff act as role models for these children to expose them to all facets of life. Local Ys allow kids to have a place to call their own, and the programs they take part in allow them to develop a community with their peers. 
   Instead of taking a cookie-cutter approach to community service, YMCAs adjust their programs to fit the needs of their local communities. Whether through day camps, the Black Achievers Program, swimming lessons, family literacy programs, job training, transitional housing, or any number of other important efforts, the nation's YMCAs are reaching out to our communities and offering individualized service. 
   Not merely an American institution, YMCAs stretch around the globe, serving more than 30 million people in 120 countries and helping to foster strong kids, families and communities world-wide. 
   Mr. President, this April 8 will build on that impressive record of service. I commend those involved in this year's celebration of YMCA Healthy Kids Day for their tireless efforts and wish continued success to every YMCA for making a difference in not only a child's life, but the lives of people of all ages.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of International Astronomy Day. This event seeks ``to promote the forerunner of all scientific endeavors and to provide information, resources, and encouragement in all facets of astronomy.'' 
   Astronomy has played a central role in human history and development. It was somewhere around 4000 B.C. when the first astronomical observations were recorded, and what has followed has been nothing short of amazing. In 240 B.C., Eratosthenes of Cyrene used the stars to calculate the circumference of the earth. Astronomy as we know it today certainly owes Galileo a debt of gratitude for being the first to use a telescope to view the stars, bringing an end to naked-eye astronomy and advancing the science of optics. More recent astronomers include Edwin P. Hubble and Jocelyn Bell. The collective work of the world's astronomers has brought the heavens closer, while offering us great insights into our own life on Earth. 
   To continue these advances of science, it is vital that we encourage our nation's youth to pursue careers in the fields of astronomy, astrophysics, and mathematics. I look upon the success of the NASA space camps and how they have encouraged our youth to pursue careers in the sciences. Since 1989, NASA has administered the ``Space Grant'' program to enhance aerospace research and education in the United States. This program is an effective partnership among universities, the aerospace industry, and federal, state, and local government that assists in the recruitment and training of professionals in aerospace science, engineering, and technology. 
   In my home state, the Minnesota Space Grant Consortium is comprised of 13 academic institutions along with the Minnesota Department of Transportation, Honeywell, Boeing, and three community-based entities: The Bakken, Science Museum of Minnesota, and SciMathMN. The 13 academic institutions are: Augsburg College, Bemidji State University, Bethel College, Carleton College, College of St. Catherine, Fond du Lac Community College, Leech Lake Tribal College, Macalester College, Normandale Community College, Southwest State University, University of Minnesota-Duluth, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, and the University of St. Thomas. 
   For the last several years, this consortium of local talents has worked effectively to promote aerospace science through fellowships and scholarships, the development of new courses in Physics and Geology, the establishment of a new Space Studies minor among the members, and public lectures relating to space science and engineering. 
   The scientists, engineers, administrators, and astronauts of NASA have guided this nation to the forefront of aeronautical expertise. I am proud that Minnesotans have been central to NASA's achievements throughout its history. My state has a well-deserved reputation as a high-technology giant, making our job creators a perfect match with NASA, and the space agency has come to depend upon Minnesota ingenuity and expertise. Dozens of Minnesota firms currently work under NASA's space shuttle program; I was honored to witness their accomplishments first-hand in 1997 when I toured NASA's Florida facilities and viewed the launch of the space shuttle Columbia. 
   None of these achievements would have been possible without modern astronomy, and our astronomers will no doubt be at the center of space research for years to come. In Minnesota, we are fortunate to have many groups that are determined to keep the interest in astronomy high for all generations. I would like to draw your attention to the Minnesota Astronomical Society, whose members are active in the growing movement to generate interest in astronomy. I commend them  for their enthusiasm and their success in turning our attention to the skies. 
   Mr. President, I would be remiss if I neglected to note the great work being done at the University of Minnesota Department of Astronomy. Department Head Leonard Kuhi directs a staff of more than 30 scientists and professors busy working on a wide variety of research projects that are at the cutting edge of astronomic research. These include projects in space physics, cosmology, computational astrophysics, and others. 
   We in Minnesota also have the distinct pleasure and privilege of being home to the great Minneapolis Planetarium, a top-rate facility that provides an avenue of discovery for everyone who comes to visit. The Minneapolis Planetarium offers visitors a wide variety of programs for all to enjoy. 
   I again recognize International Astronomy Day and commend all those in my state--the backyard astronomy clubs that offer many their first glimpse into the cosmos; the planetariums, observatories, and museums that bring the richness of space down to Earth for all; and the Minnesota organizations and companies that are putting our fascination with space to practical use--who are helping to keep the interest in astronomy running high.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to take just a few minutes to address the assumption in the budget of oil leasing revenues from activities within the Section 1002 area of Alaska. 
   First, however, I think it's important to understand just a few of the facts surrounding the current state of the Clinton energy policy. In 1977, the Carter Administration and Congress responded to the energy crisis by creating the Department of Energy and  charging it with increasing U.S. energy security and reducing our reliance on foreign oil. In the early 1970's, our Nation relied upon foreign oil to meet roughly 35 percent of our needs. Today, after investing billions of dollars into the Department of Energy, our Nation is now reliant upon foreign oil to meet almost 60 percent of our needs. That reliance will increase to 65 percent by 2020. 
   Those numbers are real, they're tangible, and everyone has been able to see it happening. The Clinton Administration has had seven years to respond to our growing reliance on foreign oil and to increase our domestic energy security. So you might ask, what have they done to improve the situation? I regret to say they've done very little. Since 1992, U.S. oil production has decreased by 17 percent while at the same time our energy consumption has increased by 14 percent. In 1990, U.S. jobs in oil and gas exploration and production were roughly 405,000 today those jobs have been reduced to roughly 290,000, a 27 percent decline. And in 1990, the U.S. was home to 657 working oil rigs. Today, there are only 153 working oil rigs scattered across the Nation a 77 percent decline. 
   Likewise, since coming to office, President Clinton has known that the U.S. Department of Energy was obligated by contract to pick up and remove spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear reactors across the country. In my home state of Minnesota, the Department's failure to remove nuclear fuel could force the shutdown of two nuclear reactors and the loss of 20 percent of Minnesota's generation capacity. Again, not only has this Administration failed to respond, I believe they've made the situation even worse by rejecting legislation that has passed both Houses of Congress with overwhelming, bipartisan majorities. Those bills would have not only moved waste from states, thereby fulfilling the Department's obligation, they would have helped ensure the continued use of emissions-free nuclear power well into the future. 
   As if that weren't enough, the Clinton Administration has taken a very hostile approach to coal-fired generation, they've termed hydropower a non-renewable resource and are now working to breach dams in the Northwest, and they've closed vast areas of land to exploration for natural gas reserves. 
   When confronted with the truth about high oil costs and increasing reliance on foreign oil, the only thing this Administration can say is that they support renewable energy sources. Well, I too, am a strong supporter of renewable energy technologies. I've been a strong proponent of the development and promotion of ethanol and biodiesel as a means of reducing our reliance on 
   foreign oil and improving the environment. I was a cosponsor of legislation signed into law last year extending the tax credit for electricity generated from wind and expanding that tax credit to electricity generated from poultry waste. I have written letters in each of the past two years to Senate appropriators supporting significant increases in renewable energy programs, and I was one of 39 Senators to vote in support of a $75 million increase for renewable energy programs last year. I wrote to President Clinton this year asking him to include more money for renewable energy programs in his budget. However, I know that simply calling for increased funding for renewable energy can't even approach the loss of generation in hydropower, nuclear, coal, and other sources that this Administration has pursued through its energy policies. 
   I think it's clear that, since coming to Washington in 1993, this Administration has been asleep at the wheel in developing a coherent energy policy. They're more interested in pursuing the limited agenda of a few interest groups than in planning for the energy needs of a growing economy. 
   Instead of strapping on the same blinders that narrowly guide the Clinton Administration, I believe Congress must put all of our options on the table and begin to plan for the long-term energy needs of our nation's consumers. One of those options is clearly the topic we're discussing today, our nation's tremendous oil reserves in the Section 1002 area of Alaska. 
   Mr. President, history shows that for two decades, Congress has placed special consideration upon this area because of its potential for significant oil and gas reserves. In 1980, Congress passed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act--or ANILCA. In addition to setting aside over 100 million acres of Alaska for National Parks, Refuges, and Wilderness, the ANILCA legislation specifically left open the future management of a 1.5 million-acre area on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The legislation also required the Department of Interior to undertake geological and biological studies of the Section 1002 area and report back to Congress. 
   After more than five years of conducting these studies, the Department of Interior, in 1987, recommended to Congress that the Section 1002 area be made available for oil and gas exploration and production, and that it be done in an environmentally sound manner. 
   Congress has responded to this recommendation a number of times since receiving it from the Department of Interior. In fact, both Houses of Congress passed an authorization for oil and gas leasing in the Section 1002 area as part of the 1995 budget reconciliation legislation, but it was eventually vetoed by President Clinton. 
   Today, as a result of increasing prices for oil and decreasing domestic oil and gas production, we find ourselves again debating some decades-old questions. Do we move forward in an environmentally sound manner to develop domestic oil and gas reserves, or do we ask other nations to produce oil for us without similar environmental safeguards? Do we keep American jobs and investments inside our borders, or do we ship our jobs and industries to foreign nations? Do we increase our energy and national security while we have a chance to do so, or do we run around the world begging friend and foe alike to ``feel our pain'' every time we have an oil supply disruption? For me, the answer is simple. 
   This budget resolution assumes that we're going to move forward to develop oil and gas reserves in the Section 1002 area of Alaska--our nation's most promising deposit of recoverable oil and gas. In 1998, the U.S. Geological Survey produced an assessment of estimated in-place oil resources reaffirming previous studies that showed the tremendous potential of the Section 1002 area. In fact, it showed that Section 1002 contains as much as 16 billion barrels of recoverable oil--enough to offset 30 years worth of Saudi Arabian imports. Clearly, this area has great potential for easing the growing vulnerability we have to oil supply disruptions abroad. 
   I think it is important to note that we're not talking about turning the Section 1002 area over to oil companies and then walking away forever. If we're going to allow oil and gas exploration and production, it will be done in an environmentally sound manner and with due consideration to the needs of fish and wildlife populations. Senator MURKOWSKI has introduced legislation that accomplishes those very goals. S. 2214--The Arctic Coastal Plain Domestic Energy Security Act--contains a number of provisions to protect the environment. The bill directs the Secretary of Interior to issue regulations that protect fish and wildlife, their habitat, subsistence resources, and the environment of the Coastal Plain of Alaska. The bill provides the Secretary with the authority to close areas of the Coastal Plain, on a seasonal basis, to protect caribou calving and other fish and wildlife species. The bill would also require those obtaining federal leases to comply with federal and state environmental laws, reclaim leased lands to the condition in which they were found, and ensure the protection of fish, wildlife, and the environment. To ensure these actions are done, the Secretary will require bonds to any lands and surface waters affected and conduct semi-annual inspections of every facility to ensure compliance with all environmental regulations. 
   To my colleagues who oppose exploration of the Section 1002 area, do you think other nations on whom we rely for our oil supplies are employing similar protections? Do you think Iran, Libya, or Iraq are going the extra mile to protect wildlife? Do you think the OPEC nations are holding themselves to these stringent environmental standards? We all know the answer is an emphatic NO. Yet this Administration is opposing any exploration of the  Section 1002 area for environmental reasons, while at the same time begging Iran, Iraq, Libya and others to increase their production for us. I ask my colleagues, who are the real environmentalists here? Certainly not the Clinton Administration. It's clear to me that this Administration's policy against exploration in the Section 1002 area, when compared against its policy of begging for increased oil production abroad, is a net loss for American jobs, family checkbooks, domestic energy security, and the environment. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to take a hard look at the intellectual dishonesty of refusing to explore our domestic oil and gas reserves for environmental reasons, while asking other nations to find and produce more oil with significantly fewer environmental protections than we require. I support the inclusion of this assumption in the budget resolution and I hope we vote to maintain it. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, April 5th marked the 232nd anniversary of the founding of the first Chamber of Commerce in the United States. A full eight years before the colonies declared their ``independence'' from English rule, New York City business owners banded together to create a unified voice. Today, there are thousands of local Chambers from Anchorage, Alaska to Zumbrota, Minnesota. 
   Over the past eight years, I have had to honor to work with these grassroots organizations on a wide variety of issues. Whether its been estate tax relief or permanent normalized trade with China, Minnesota's chambers have been there, working for Minnesota's job providers, every step of the way. That is why I was so proud to receive the Chamber's Spirit of Enterprise award earlier this year. 
   When Washington talks about our strong economy, debating what to do with the billions in federal surplus dollars, it sometimes appears as though Congress wants to take all the credit. Policy makers focus on the innovations, the increased productivity, the ``globalization'' of today's marketplace as proof of their good work. I don't need to remind my colleagues that the only thing Government can do is to remove the barriers to competition and provide a level playing field. The rest is a direct result of the entrepreneurial spirit of the men and women who've sacrificed to build businesses around Minnesota and around the country. Employers and employees, working hand in hand and with their chamber of commerce, have helped to turn this nation around. 
   So Mr. President, while our chamber members are taking care of business back home, we must recognize they are looking to the Congress for leadership to stem the tide of burdensome regulations and oppressive taxes. I believe working together, we can create an environment where all can thrive. And as we mark the anniversary of the first chamber of commerce, let us celebrate the contributions of all our chambers.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support Senator ALLARD's amendment, which would protect Social Security and eliminate the federal debt held by the public. I believe this is a fiscally responsible amendment and it will help us to maintain fiscal discipline in an era of budget surplus. 
   If enacted, this amendment would stop Washington's spending spree and eliminate the entire $3.6 trillion debt owed to the public, save over $3 trillion in interest, and protect the Social Security program from annual discretionary appropriations raids. 
   Mr. President, thanks to our strong economy, we will have a $1.9 trillion non-Social Security surplus and a $2.3 trillion Social Security surplus over the next 10 years. 
   Yet there are many proposals to spend this surplus. If we spend it, rather than save it, we will confirm the public's worst fears about the irresponsibility of their elected leaders. 
   This budget surplus didn't just fall from the sky. It is working Americans who generated the surplus--not Congress, not the President, but Americans' hard work. And it should be returned to taxpayers in the form of debt reduction, tax relief, and Social Security reform. 
   If we don't lock in the budget surplus and return it to the taxpayers in these ways, Washington will spend it all. Last year's appropriations spending has proven that my fears are well founded. 
   Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan has repeatedly advised the Congress and the administration that we should use the surplus for debt reduction or tax relief, rather than increasing government spending. Here is what he said:  
   Saving the surpluses--if politically feasible--is, in my judgment, the most important fiscal measure we can take at this time to foster continued improvements in productivity.  
   The Allard amendment would achieve this goal by dedicating some of the non-Social Security surplus to retire the debt. It also locks up the entire Social Security surplus for debt reduction, so we can have more cash reserves to save and reform Social Security, and to ensure Social Security will be there for our seniors, baby boomers, and future generations. 
   I am pleased that under this budget resolution, we dedicate the $1.1 trillion budget surplus to reduce the debt. This is a move in the right direction. We should now accelerate and continue the debt repayments. 
   The Allard amendment will just do that. Starting in fiscal year 2001, this amendment requires Congress to use $15 billion of non-Social Security surplus receipts to pay down the debt. Thereafter, in every succeeding year, the amount of debt payment must increase by $15 billion. Under this amendment, we will do more to pay down the debt. 
   Futhermore, the Allard amendment leaves plenty of room to provide tax relief for working Americans, while protecting the Social Security surplus.  
   Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle talk about debt reduction, but what they really want is to use debt reduction as an excuse to deny working Americans tax relief and to increase government spending. When I offered an amendment in the Budget Committee to dedicate this fiscal year's $26 billion on-budget surplus to retire the national debt, all of the Minority party members voted against my amendment, claiming that it would cut government spending too much. 
   Mr. President, our economy has greatly improved our short-term fiscal situation, and we will have a significant budget surplus over the next 10 years. However, our long-term fiscal condition, such as the insolvency of Social Security, still constitutes the primary threat to the health of our future economy. 
   We must seize the opportunity presented by this budget surplus to address our long-term fiscal imbalances caused by the astronomic unfunded liability of Social Security. Without reform, the long-term financial imbalances will crowd out all of our discretionary spending. It will create fiscal hardship for millions of baby boomers and impose a heavy burden on future generations. 
   The Allard amendment offers us the opportunity to fix the problem. 
   The Allard amendment maintains the fiscal discipline we need in an era of budget surplus. It requires Congress to budget for a surplus that will be dedicated to the repayment of the publicly held portion of the debt, while maintaining a balanced budget. 
   As I have repeatedly warned, without returning this budget surplus to the taxpayers in the form of debt reduction and tax relief, Washington will spend all of it. Let's pass the Allard amendment to stop that.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes this afternoon to talk, not of the budget in general but about a particular part of the budget. I wish to speak in support of the amendment of Senator KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON of Texas. I commend her efforts and leadership on a very important issue; that is, the marriage penalty tax that is part of this overall budget. I know we are still working on an agreement dealing with this amendment but, because of other commitments, I wanted to take time to come to the floor and speak on this issue, the marriage penalty tax, a little bit out of order. I want to at least voice my strong support for the issue. I support, strongly, the elimination of the marriage penalty entirely and I believe that Congress should pass this legislation and we should do it as quickly and as early as possible. 
   There is compelling reason to repeal the marriage penalty tax: The family has been and will continue to be the bedrock of our society. Strong families makes strong communities; strong communities make for a strong America. We all agree that this marriage penalty tax treats married couples unfairly. Even President Clinton agrees that the marriage penalty is unfair, although he said--well, we just can't help it; we need the money here in Washington. 
   If we do not get rid of this bad tax policy that discourages marriage, millions of married couples will be forced to pay more taxes simply for choosing to commit to a family through marriage. 
   In fact, the Tax Code contains 66 provisions that can affect a married couple's tax liability. 
   Let me give a real example of how average Americans have been hit by the marriage penalty. Newly wedded Alicia Jones from my state of Minnesota and her husband graduated from college and had just begun working full-time 2 years ago. In 1998, Alicia and her husband both worked full time in professional careers. They had no children and were renting an apartment, saving to buy a house. They had to pay at least an additional $1,400 for simply being married. As a result, on top of the over $10,000 tax they already paid, they had to take an additional $700 from their limited savings account to pay for Federal taxes--taxes that they wouldn't have had to pay if they weren't married.--The marriage penalty. 
   She wrote to me:  
   I am frustrated by this, I'm frustrated for the future--how do we get ahead, when each year we have to take money from our savings to pay more for our taxes. I hope that you will remember my concern.  
   Alicia's story is not uncommon. There were 21 million American families in the same situation. 
   A 1997 study by the Congressional Budget Office entitled For Better or Worse: Marriage and the Federal Income Tax, estimated 21 million couples or 42 percent of couples incurred marriage penalties in 1996. This means 42 million individuals paid $1,400 more in tax than if they are divorced, or were living together. It has grown to even more in the year 2000. 
   But marriage penalties can run much higher than that. Under the current tax laws, a married couple could face a Federal tax bill that is more than $20,000 higher than the amount they would pay if they were not married. 
   This is extremely unfair. This was not the intention of Congress when it created the marriage penalty tax in the 1960s by separating tax schedules for married and unmarried people. 
   The marriage penalty is most unfair to married couples who are both working, it is discriminative against low-income families and is biased against working women. 
   The trend shows that more couples under age 55 are working and the earnings between husbands and wives are more evenly divided since 1969. As a result, more and more couples have received, and will continue to receive, marriage penalties and fewer couples benefit under the Tax Code. 
   The marriage penalty creates a second-earner bias against married women under the Federal tax system. The bias occurs because the income of the secondary earner is stacked on top of the primary earner's income. As a result, the secondary earner's income may be taxed at a relatively higher marginal tax rate. In many cases it even forces the whole family budget into a higher tax bracket so the whole family faces this marriage penalty. Married women are often the victims of the second-earner bias. 
   As more and more women go to work today, their added incomes drive their households into higher tax brackets. In fact, women who return to the work force after raising their kids face a 50 percent tax rate--not much of an incentive to work. 
   The marriage penalty tax has discouraged women from marriage. It even has led some married couples to get friendly divorces. They continue to live together, but save on their taxes. 
   Repealing the marriage penalty will allow American families to keep an average of $1,400 more each year of their own money to pay for health insurance, groceries, child care, or other family necessities. 
   This is what we hear all the time, whenever we want to cut a tax or reduce the tax burden on average Americans--it is a windfall for the rich. No one else is going to benefit. This is completely false. The fact is, the elimination of the injustice of the marriage penalty will primarily benefit minority, low- and middle-class families. Studies suggest the marriage penalty hits African-Americans and lower-income working families hardest. 
   Couples at the bottom end of the income scale who incur penalties paid an average of nearly $800 in additional taxes which represented 8 percent of their income. Eight percent, Mr. President. Repeal the penalty, and those low-income families will immediately have an 8 percent increase in their income. They would be able to keep it to spend on what their families need, rather than shipping it off to Washington. 
   It is unfair to continue marriage penalty tax. It is time now to end it. I strongly support Senator HUTCHISON of Texas and her efforts to repeal the marriage penalty too. I yield the floor.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to salute the work of the 3,072 county governments nationwide, and in particular the work of the 87 counties in my home State of Minnesota. Counties are often an invisible, but extremely important part of our intergovernmental system. As we enter the new millennium, it is important to review our past as we look to the future. 
   County governments began as a response to the needs of the early settlers of our country, tracing their beginnings to the roots of the Anglo-Saxon local government 1,000 years ago. Counties first appeared in colonial America, making them older than the Republic itself. 
   Traditionally, counties performed state-mandated duties which included assessment of property, record-keeping, such as property and vital statistics, maintenance of rural roads, and administration of election and judicial functions. Today, counties are moving rapidly into other areas, undertaking programs relating to consumer protection, economic development, employment training, planning and zoning, and water quality, to name just a few. 
   During the week of April 9-15, counties across the country are celebrating National County Government Week. This celebration is an annual event for counties. First held in 1991, the goal of National County Government Week is to raise public awareness and understanding about the roles and responsibilities of the Nation's counties. 
   More than 1,000 counties annually participate in National County Government Week by holding a variety of programs and events at the national, State and local levels. These include tours of county facilities, presentations in schools, meetings with business and community leaders, recognition programs for volunteers, briefings on environmental projects, and the adoption of proclamations. 
   There is a theme each year for National County Government Week. This year, the theme is ``Honoring Volunteers.'' The National Association of Counties will recognize the top county volunteer programs in the country at a ceremony April 13 in Washington, D.C. Counties will receive awards for their ``Acts of Caring'' efforts that they undertook using volunteers to improve their country's quality of life. 
   I know that NACo has encouraged counties to hold a town meeting this week during National County Government Week or launch a series of community-wide dialogues to solicit citizen participation in identifying the community's most pressing issues and establishing a comprehensive vision for the future. I hope many Minnesota counties will participate in these activities. 
   NACo has also suggested that, as we enter the new millennium, counties reflect on the past and prepare for the future. As part of that process, counties may want to apply for the designation of Millennium Community. This designation, presented by the White House Millennium Council, is given to counties and cities that have established programs that ``Honor the Past--Imagine the Future.'' 
   One of NACo's priorities for this year is economic development. The organization is encouraging counties to create and expand businesses, noting the fact that businesses not only provide jobs, but also keep taxes in check. Therefore, counties have been encouraged to promote economic development programs. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to support the efforts of our county governments not only in Minnesota, but throughout the country. National County Government Week will again be successful in raising pubic awareness of the good work of our nation's county governments and how they help improve the lives of their residents.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to express my strong support for S. 2097, the Launching Our Communities Access to Local Television Act of 2000. I also commend Senator CRAIG THOMAS and Senator TIM  JOHNSON for the work they have done. They have been on the floor today talking about this bill; more important, they have been working for days, weeks, and even months trying to put this bill together. I really thank them and commend them for all the work and effort they put into getting this bill to where it is today. 
   During the 106th Congress, few issues have generated as many phone calls, letters, and e-mails to my office as those opinions expressed by rural Minnesotans concerned about the future of their satellite television programs. 
   In recent months, Federal district court decisions terminating the satellite signals of thousands of satellite subscribers and the uncertain status of the Satellite Home Viewer Act have caused unnecessary frustration and inconvenience for Minnesotans who depend upon satellite television for informational, education, and entertainment programming on a daily basis. For these reasons, I am very pleased to have supported the enactment of legislation last year that reauthorized the Satellite Home Viewer Act. 
   The Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act has begun to encourage greater competition between the satellite and cable industries while also providing consumers in the top television markets with the benefit of ``local-into-local'' television programming. Additionally, this law has protected existing satellite subscribers from having their distant network signals terminated and reduced the copyright fees paid by satellite providers. This reduction in copyright fees has helped to make satellite service more affordable to consumers, particularly in rural areas. 
   I also recognize that millions of Americans in small, rural areas have not begun to enjoy the local-into-local programming because satellite carriers do not have the capability to provide this service into small, rural areas immediately. In fact, two of the largest satellite providers, DirecTV and Echostar, have testified that their companies will initially provide local-into-local service to households in the top 50-60 television markets. Thus, approximately 150 television markets such as the Duluth-Superior, Rochester, and Mankato television markets in Minnesota will not receive this programming as quickly as urban markets. 
   I firmly believe that Congress should ensure that rural America receives the benefits of this technology and local-into-local programming. For these reasons, I have been working with my colleagues on the Senate Banking Committee, industry groups, and consumers to pass the ``LOCAL TV Act.'' This legislation would establish a $1.25 billion loan guarantee program to facilitate access to local television programming in rural Minnesota communities and throughout the country. Importantly, the LOCAL TV Act will help to facilitate local-into-local programming without mandating a specific technology to provide this service and thereby encouraging competition and innovation by independent cable companies and satellite providers. 
   I was very concerned that this legislation excludes several private lenders from providing the financing to ensure local-into-local programming throughout rural communities. Specifically, the LOCAL TV Act provides that the federal government will guarantee 80 percent of any loan that is provided by FDIC insured depository institutions. So far, so good. 
   Mr. President, limiting the guarantee to 80 percent assures that whichever lending institution provides the financing will have very good reason to give the loan request extensive scrutiny to justify the 20 percent of the loan which is not guaranteed and perhaps decide not to lend. This careful scrutiny would be less assured if we allowed 100 percent government loan guarantees. 
   I also support authorizing the FDIC insured lenders to have the opportunity to participate in the loan guarantee programs. However, the bill currently excludes certain private sector lenders which have substantial experience providing multi-million dollar loans in a coop environment and which have a track record of support for projects of this size in rural areas. 
   For this reason, I have joined with Senators JOHNSON and THOMAS to introduce an amendment to this bill which will expand the list of eligible lenders. Specifically, the Johnson-Thomas-Grams amendment requires eligible lenders to have at least one issue of outstanding debt that is rated in one of the three highest rating categories by a national statistical rating agency. This provision will ensure that our expanded list of lenders will have been subjected to rigorous marketplace scrutiny. The process of achieving one of the three highest investment grade ratings involves an intense review of the lender's capital strength, lending expertise, and loan loss experience. 
   The wording for this amendment is almost identical to wording which this body utilized last fall when we passed S. 900, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley bill. In that landmark legislation, the test of marketplace scrutiny was used to determine which of the top 50 national banks could conduct expanded activities in a bank subsidiary. 
   The theory we used was that marketplace discipline is an important threshold in sorting the qualified from the unqualified. That same approach is being put in place here. 
   Lastly, our amendment also requires an eligible lender to have provided financing with outstanding debt from the Rural Utilities Service. This provision is important because the underlying bill authorizes the Rural Utilities Service to be the administrator of the loan guarantee program. 
   The second part of this provision states that the approved lender must demonstrate to the loan guarantee board that it has the expertise, capacity and capital strength to provide financing pursuant to the act. 
   Mr. President, I believe the Johnson-Thomas-Grams amendment will strengthen the LOCAL TV Act and ensure that rural Americans will soon enjoy the benefits of local television programming. I am pleased that Chairman GRAMM has been working to accommodate our concerns and strengthen this legislation. 
   Mr. President, again, I commend and thank very much Senators CRAIG THOMAS and TIM JOHNSON for all their hard work in making this legislation possible. I urge everybody's strong support of this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor ARC Minnesota, and the men and women who volunteer countless hours to improve the quality of life for children and adults with mental retardation and their families. March is officially this nation's ``Mental Retardation Awareness Month''--but the efforts of these individuals should be celebrated year-round. 
   As legislators at the federal level, our support tends to come in the form of funding. It would be an understatement to say that children and adults with mental retardation and their families are faced with unique challenges. Needs differ from family to family. For some, it may be specialized education needs, and for others health care access. And as a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I realize the vast array of programs we've created to address the broad spectrum of needs--all of which compete for tax dollars. 
   That is why I have strenuously supported initiatives which provide greater flexibility and control by individuals. Programs such as A+ accounts that help families meet unique educational needs that federal, state and local programs cannot. Legislation like the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act that expands medical savings accounts, ultimately providing more flexible health care access--particularly benefitting those that are uninsured. 
   Mr. President, while Mental Retardation Awareness Month is coming to a close, it doesn't mean that Congress cannot move forward with policies which provide unique solutions to the unique challenges faced by individuals with mental retardation and their families. I would urge my colleagues to join me in commemorating the work of the 1,000 chapters of the ARC, in Minnesota and across this nation, with their pledge to work towards this goal.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Loan Deficiency Payment Flexibility Act. The idea for this legislation came from Peter Kalenberg, a producer from Stewart, MN, and is an example of how a good idea can be transformed into sound public policy. It is supported by such organizations as the Minnesota Corn Growers, the Minnesota Farm Bureau Federation, and the Minnesota Wheat Growers Association. These and many other groups have recognized the need for this legislation. 
   As you know, Loan Deficiency Payments, otherwise known as LDPs, were a key component of the 1996 Farm bill and have helped cushion the blow of low commodity prices and restricted demand. However, producers in Minnesota and other northern states have questioned the fairness of how the LDP is administered. States farther south are able to begin harvest before farmers in states such as Minnesota and are therefore able to ``lock in'' a more favorable LDP. This has the potential of impacting market signals and driving down the futures price before harvest has begun in northern states. 
   Mr. President, by taking the approach I am about to outline, I have ensured that regions of the country that are currently able to utilize an earlier LDP are not placed at a disadvantage. The components of this legislation are simple, yet provide a common-sense approach to a problem faced by producers in states such as Minnesota. 
   My ``Loan Deficiency Payment Flexibility Act'' would correct this inequity by directing the Secretary of Agriculture to announce that harvest has begun on a particular commodity (i.e. corn or soybeans) and that producers throughout the United States may now utilize the Loan Deficiency Payment. Essentially my bill does two things: 
   It establishes an earlier, more flexible starting date when all producers would have the option of ``locking in'' that day's LDP. They would be able to do so once throughout the duration of the harvest season. 
   Allows a producer to lock-in an LDP for up to 85% of his or her actual yield. Because the LDP is ``locked in'' on paper, no payments are actually made until the crop is harvested and we avoid the problems posed by the old deficiency payment system due to unanticipated high or low yields. 
   Although there is no guarantee that the LDP will be better in the early summer versus the fall, my legislation will afford farmers the opportunity to evaluate the markets and base their decision on what best fits their management plan. 
   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and support this legislation.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss our long-term energy needs and the energy problems we are currently facing in this country and to express my dismay with the Clinton administration last week because of the neglect of the long-term energy needs of our Nation's economy and its energy consumers. 
   I spent a great deal of time outlining my concern with the administration's failure to develop a coherent plan for reducing our reliance on foreign oil and for increasing our nation's energy security. I outlined my disgust for how this administration has ignored our nuclear waste storage crisis, moved to breach hydropower dams in the northwest, forced regulation upon regulation on other energy production technologies, and displayed a complete disregard for the men and women who find and produce domestic supplies of oil and natural gas. 
   In fact, this administration has virtually ensured that the oil price crisis we're now facing will pale in comparison to the electricity price and supply problems that are just around the corner for our nation's electricity consumers. I know both the energy producers and consumers of Minnesota are astutely aware of the generation and transmission problems that will grip our state in the not-too-distant future. Those problems are not confined to Minnesota. Many States in the upper Midwest face generation and transmission shortages, as do States across the country. Those problems are rooted in the failure of this administration to comprehend the generation needs of a growing economy and the transmission requirements of that growing demand. 
   While I strongly believe that, in the absence of a coherent administration energy policy, Congress needs to step in and forge its own path for meeting the long-term energy needs of our economy, I've come to the floor today to talk about the need for some short-term measures to address high oil prices. 
   In Minnesota, farmers are preparing to enter the fields for spring planting. They're trying to budget for the year and put in place a business plan that will put food on the table and put their children through school. As everyone knows, doing these most basic things is no easy task when commodity prices are low, the weather is uncooperative, and government regulations eat away at the ability to show a profit. This year, however, farmers have a new worry that threatens to make matters even worse--the growing price of diesel fuel and gasoline. Farming is an extremely energy intensive industry. Everything farmers do require energy; from plowing the field to milking the cows, energy is an essential part of a farm's bottom line. 
   Likewise, truckers throughout America are essential to delivering the products we use in our everyday lives to markets across the country. Without truckers, we wouldn't have access to most of the things we all take for granted on a daily basis. Even the internet becomes virtually worthless to consumers if truckers can't deliver to our doorsteps the products we buy. Like farmers, truckers rely heavily upon stable energy costs to make a living and run their businesses. When fuel prices go up, truckers feel the impact first. Too often, they have to absorb the increases in fuel prices, but it's not long before everything from fruits and vegetables to our 
   children's school supplies begin to rise in price as a result of climbing fuel costs. We need look no further than the surcharges now being placed on delivery services to see the compounding negative impacts of increased transportation costs.  
   Many of us in the Senate have witnessed the stream of truckers from across the country who have descended upon Washington, DC, in recent weeks. They have come to their Nation's Capitol not because they want government to give them something, but because they cannot make a living when the Department of Energy is caught napping on the job. They expect, demand, and deserve an Energy Department that comprehends the importance of energy costs to our economy and has a long-term plan for meeting the needs of energy consumers. 
   Mr. President, I know I do not have to remind my colleagues of how the rising cost of oil threatens almost every aspect of our economy and communities. Senior citizens on fixed incomes cannot absorb wild fluctuations in their energy costs. Business travelers and airlines cannot afford dramatic increases in airline fuel costs. Families struggling to feed and educate their children cannot withstand higher heating bills, increasing gasoline costs, or the domino effect this crisis has on the costs of goods and services. 
   To begin addressing this problem, I have joined Majority Leader TRENT LOTT, Senator LARRY CRAIG, and a number of my colleagues in offering legislation to repeal the 4.3-cent gas tax while protecting the Highway Trust Fund and not spending any of the Social Security surplus. Our legislation is aimed at getting some short-term relief directly into the hands of energy consumers. Our bill will eliminate 4.3-cent tax on gasoline, diesel, and aviation fuel so the American consumer can see some relief at the pump when they fuel up for a day on the road, in the field, or traveling to and from school or work. Our bill will eliminate the 4.3-cent tax starting on April 16 through January 1, 2001. For farmers, truckers, airlines, and other large energy consumers, this action will have an even greater positive impact because of the large amounts of fuel they consume. 
   I have heard some of my colleagues argue that 4.3 cents a gallon has a negligible impact on consumers. To them, I say look at the amount of fuel a farmer or trucker consumes during an average week. Look at the thousands of gallons of diesel fuel required to operate a family farm or deliver products from California to Maine. Or look at the tight profit margins that can make the difference between going to work and being without a job. I'm convinced this action is going to help farmers, truckers, businesses, and families in Minnesota and that's why I strongly support it. 
   For those who are concerned that eliminating the 4.3-cent gas tax is going to deplete important highway and infrastructure funding, we've included language in this legislation that will ensure the Highway Trust Fund is completely protected. The Highway Trust Fund will be restored with on-budget surplus funds from the current fiscal year as well as the fiscal year 2001. 
   If gas prices reach $2 a gallon, on-budget surplus funds will allow additional reductions in the gas tax without impacting the Highway Trust Fund in any way. Depending on the size of the on-budget surplus, our legislation could provide a complete reduction of federal gas taxes until 
   January 1, 2001 if prices rise to, and remain above, the $2 mark. Let me make this very clear: we are not going to raid the Highway Trust Fund with this legislation. In fact, we've ensured that the on-budget surplus will absorb all of the costs of the gas tax reduction. I also want to assure my colleagues and my constituents that this legislation walls off the Social Security surplus. We will not spend any of the Social Security surplus to pay for the gas tax reduction. 
   Our legislation is quite simply a tax cut for the American consumer at a time when it's needed most. We're going to use surplus funds--funds that have been taken from the American consumer above and beyond the needs of government--and give them back to consumers every day at the gasoline pumps. 
   For me, this legislation boils down to a very simple equation. Are we going to sit by and do nothing as farmers prepare to enter the fields this spring, or are we going to take whatever short-term actions we can to support our farmers and provide them with a needed boost? Are we going to help those most impacted by high fuel costs, or are we going to ignore their needs and let them absorb thousands of more dollars in fuel costs this summer? There is overwhelming proof that the Clinton administration's complete rejection of a national energy policy has caused this mess, so I believe the Congress must step in and help get them out of it. 
   I joined my colleagues in the Senate earlier this year in requesting and receiving emergency releases of Low-Income Home Energy Assistance funding. We did so on at least three separate occasions, and I've supported the President's request for $600 million in additional funding this year. This crucial funding for Minnesota and many other cold weather States was a vital short-term approach to mitigating the impact high fuel costs have had on senior citizens and low-income families. Our constituents were in need, and we responded exactly as we should have. Right now, even more of our constituents are in need, and by responding with a reduction in the Federal gasoline tax, Congress can again act in a way that is expected, even demanded, by our constituents. 
   As I started earlier, the gasoline crisis requires that Congress act now to stem rising energy costs in the near term. It also requires that elected officials and bureaucrats across Washington take a serious look at the direction in which our Nation is headed with its energy policy. I am prepared to take a hard look at any options that might help my constituents right now, and I demand that this administration explore options to ensure that our nation reduces its reliance on foreign oil and establishes a much more sound energy policy for decades to come, 
   to make this country energy independent and not so dependent on foreign sources of energy that when they turn them on or off, it can have dramatic impact on our economy. While those solutions will not happen overnight, I believe a reduction in the gas tax will help. It is going to help now, and it is going to help when that help is needed the most. 
   I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, the Constitution begins with the ringing words--``We the People''--for a reason. In our great nation, the people are empowered to decide the manner in which we are to be governed and the values we are to uphold. I join 80 percent of the American people in the belief the flag of the United States of America should be protected from physical desecration. And I am blessed to live in a nation where the will of the people can triumph over that of lawyers and judges. 
   In light of the U.S. Supreme Court decisions Texas v. Johnson (1989) and United States v. Eichman (1990), which essentially abrogated flag desecration statutes passed by the federal government and 48 states, a constitutional amendment is clearly necessary to protect our flag. This would take the issue of flag protection out of the Courts and back to the legislatures where it belongs. As Chief Justice Rehnquist stated in his dissent, ``Surely one of the high purposes of a democratic society is to legislate against conduct that is regarded as evil and profoundly offensive to the majority of people--whether it be murder, embezzlement, pollution, or flagburning.'' 
   Mr. President, the fight to protect ``Old Glory'' is a fight to restore duty, honor, and love of country to their rightful place. As Justice Stevens noted, ``The flag uniquely symbolizes the ideas of liberty, equality, and tolerance.'' These are the values that form the bedrock of our nation. We are a nation comprised of individuals of varying races, creeds, and colors, with differing ideologies. We need to reinforce the values we hold in common in order for our nation to remain united, to remain strong. 
   Sadly, patriotism is on the decline. That's dangerous in a democracy. Just ask the military recruiters who can't find enough willing young people to fill the ranks of our military during this strong economy. What happened to the pride in serving your country? Where are the Americans willing to answer the call? 
   Protecting the flag reflects our desire to protect our nation from this erosion in patriotism. It signals that our government, as a reflection of the will of the people, believes all Americans should treat the flag with respect. The men and women of our armed forces who sacrificed for the flag should be shown they did not do so in vain. They fought, suffered, and died to preserve the very freedom and liberty which allow us to proclaim that desecrating the American flag goes too far and should be prohibited. 
   To say that our flag is just a piece of cloth--a rag that can be defiled and trampled upon and even burnt into ashes--is to dishonor every soldier who ever fought to protect it. Every star, every stripe on our flag was bought through their sacrifice. 
   The flag of the United States of America is a true, national treasure. Because of all that it symbolizes, we have always held our flag with the greatest esteem, with reverence. That is why we fly it so high above us. When the flag is aloft, it stands above political division and above partisanship. 
   Under our flag, we are united. 
   Most Americans cannot understand why anyone would burn a flag. Most Americans cannot understand why the Senate would not act decisively and overwhelmingly to pass an amendment affording our flag the protection it deserves. 
   This simple piece of cloth is indeed worthy of Constitutional protection. I urge my colleagues to follow the will of ``We the People'' and accord the American flag the dignity it is due by supporting Senate Joint Resolution 14.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend an organization that has given consistently to our communities over the past 89 years. I am proud to honor the National Exchange Club--an organization that can be characterized by the word ``service''--as it celebrates the anniversary of its founding. 
   The National Exchange Club is a volunteer group of men and women dedicated to serving their communities. Founded in 1911 by Charles A. Berkey, the organization has grown from a single group in Detroit, Michigan to nearly 1,000 clubs and 33,000 members throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. in my home state of Minnesota, there are more than 20 clubs committed to making our state and nation a better place to live. 
   In keeping with its rich history of helping others, the Exchange Club has established Child Abuse Prevention as its national project. By utilizing a wide array of educational programs, local clubs work to create public awareness of child abuse and develop relationships with parents to counter abuse. This program has helped more than 140,000 children since 1979. 
   Exchange members participate in a variety of other services, such as Youth Programs and Americanism. The Exchange Club's variety of youth programs encourage and recognize students who display good citizenship, community involvement, and scholastic achievement, and serve as volunteers. Clearly, its efforts are shaping the citizens of the future. Exchange's Americanism efforts spread pride in our nation and work to foster an awareness of the wonderful freedoms with which our country is blessed. 
   The numerous other community service activities the National Exchange Club undertakes are focused on helping the largest number of citizens as possible in their respective communities. All individuals in a community benefit from the club's crime and fire prevention efforts, its Book of Golden Deeds Award, and the Service to Seniors program. 
   For 89 years, the volunteers of the National Exchange Club have dedicated themselves to the betterment of our communities. I applaud them on their achievements and wish them a prosperous future.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to talk this afternoon about this country's overall energy policy or, more truthfully, to talk about the lack of this country's overall energy policy. 
   With fuel prices continuing their rise to levels that threaten farmers, truckers, families, and, in fact, our entire economy, I felt I needed to come to the Senate floor for a few minutes to discuss this very important issue. 
   As my colleagues know, I come from a rural State that is heavily dependent on agriculture. When farmers in Minnesota are hurting, it has an impact on businesses, on families, and individuals far removed from the fields of our family farms. Because Minnesota is a large State and so heavily reliant upon agriculture, it is also reliant upon truckers to move products to market and to bring products to communities. It is also important to note that Minnesota is well known as one of our Nation's coldest States, a State where many residents rely on fuel oil to heat their homes. These realities are a few examples of why crude oil prices and supplies are so important to the people of my State. They are also examples of why, since coming to the Congress in 1993, I have been a strong critic of the Department of Energy's failure to strengthen our Nation's energy policies. 
   In the late 1970s, our Nation responded to the energy crisis by creating the Department of Energy and charging it with developing a stable energy policy that would decrease our reliance on foreign sources of energy. At the time, our Nation was reliant on foreign oil for about 35 percent of our needs. When DOE was created, with its charge to create an energy policy to make us more energy independent, our reliance on foreign fuels was 35 percent. Despite the countless billions of dollars taxpayers have invested in the Department of Energy over the past two decades, our Nation is now roughly 60 percent reliant on foreign energy sources, and that reliance is growing and growing rapidly. 
   That's one of the reasons why I'm an original cosponsor of S. Res. 263, which calls on both the administration and Congress to undertake steps which will lead to a long-term reduction of our reliance on foreign sources of energy. Among those steps, the resolution calls on the administration to review all programs, policies, and regulations that place an undue burden on domestic oil and gas producers. I believe this is an important aspect of the DOE's failure to reduce reliance on foreign energy sources. Sadly, this administration's opposition to virtually all exploration and production activities on public lands has rendered our nation's domestic producers incapable of responding to supply shortages. That is why we are in the position we are in today. In fact, since 1992, U.S. oil production has been reduced by 17% while our consumption of oil has increased by 14%. In 1990, U.S. jobs in oil and gas exploration and production were roughly 405,000--today those jobs have been reduced to roughly 290,000 a 27% decline in jobs in energy-related fields. In 1990, the United States was home to 657 working oil rigs. Today, there are only 153 working oil rigs scattered across the Nation--a decline of 77 percent; again, a reason the United States did not respond to shortages in supply. During a recent hearing before the Senate Budget Committee, I asked Energy Secretary Bill Richardson if he would consider supporting the exploration of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), which is estimated to hold enough oil to offset 30 years of imports from Saudi Arabia. In his response, he indicated that he believes we have sufficient areas for exploration on federal lands without developing ANWR. We have opportunities, he says, to go onto other Federal lands and do the exploration. If we do, the question is, Why haven't we? If that is the case, then why has the Clinton administration failed to move forward in allowing expanded exploration and production activity on those Federal lands instead of leaving us vulnerable to the OPEC nations? 
   Why has this administration waited until an oil price crisis has gripped our nation before suggesting increased development of domestic oil and gas reserves on public lands? Why does this administration still maintain it's opposition to exploring our nation's most promising oil reserves like ANWR? And why does this administration maintain opposition to exploration in the United States based on environmental considerations but has no reservations about calling on other nations to do so? 
   For some reason, this administration seems to believe that it is an environmentally friendly proposition to expect other nations to produce our oil for us. The United States has some of the most stringent environmental standards for oil exploration and production--standards that aren't embraced by many of the oil producing nations of the world. I simply cannot see how sending our nation's energy secretary across the world to beg for increased oil production every time we have a supply problem is sound energy, economic, or environmental policy. I do not connect the two. 
   I believe it's also important to note that this administration is currently engaged in a number of other activities that severely limit our nation's ability to increase our energy independence. First, this administration's failure to remove nuclear waste from civilian nuclear reactors threatens to shut down nuclear power plants across the country. In Minnesota, the DOE's inaction may force the premature closure of the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Facility. If it should close, Minnesota will lose 20% of its generation capacity. At the same time, this administration is attempting to breach hydropower dams in the Pacific Northwest--dams that are crucial to the energy needs of that region. In each of these situations, consumers will be forced to rely more heavily upon fossil fuels to replace the loss of clean energy technologies. As if that weren't enough abuse of America's energy consumers, the Clinton administration has undertaken a number of activities that have severely impacted the ability of utilities to turn to coal-fired plants to meet the energy demands of consumers. And I need not remind any of my colleagues of the lack  of infrastructure in our nation to dramatically increase our use of natural gas as a reliable, base-load source capable of replacing hydropower, nuclear, and coal-fired generation. 
   What continues to amaze me is how this administration sends its ``yes men'' in front of Congress to pledge support for each of these generation technologies. I do not hear the administration telling Congress they want to eliminate coal-fired generation. But the EPA is doing its best to regulate coal plants out of business. I have never heard the administration say they want to close down nuclear plants, but I have yet to see them lift a finger to keep them operating. When anyone in this body confronts the administration with the impending brown outs and energy price increases its policies are going to force, all its representatives can say is that they're working on it and they support renewable energy technologies. 
   Well, I too, am a strong supporter of renewable energy technologies. I've been a strong proponent of the development and promotion of ethanol and biodiesel as a means of reducing our reliance on foreign oil and improving the environment. I was a cosponsor of legislation signed into law last year extending the tax credit for electricity generated from wind and expanding that tax credit to electricity generated from poultry waste. I have written letters in each of the past two years to Senate appropriators supporting significant increases in renewable energy programs, and I was one of 39 Senators to vote in support of a $75 million increase for renewable energy programs last year. I wrote to President Clinton this year asking him to include more money for renewable energy programs in his budget. However, I know that simply calling for increased funding for renewable energy can't even approach the loss of generation in hydropower, nuclear, coal, and other sources that this administration has pursued through its energy policies. 
   I'd like to believe that this administration has a grasp on the long-term energy needs of our nation and has plans for meeting those needs, but the actions of the administration and the DOE's failures on the spectrum of energy challenges prove otherwise. 
   That's why, in a letter to Secretary Richardson last week, I urged him to take immediate actions to allow for both on and offshore oil and gas exportation and production in states that want to do so. I urged him to take immediate steps to ensure that nuclear power plants such as Minnesota's Prairie Island Facility are not forced to shut down due to DOE inaction. I urged him to work with the Department of Interior to resist attempts to reduce the use of hydropower. And I urged him and the administration to undertake an immediate review of all regulations that impose undue burdens on the development of domestic energy sources that could reduce our reliance on foreign oil. 
   Long ago, the Congress charged the U.S. Department of Energy with the job of reducing our nation's reliance on foreign oil and establishing a long-term, stable energy policy to guide our economy for decades to come. It goes without saying that the Department has failed miserably in that, its most basic mission. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues in the coming days, weeks and months in enacting a number of both short-term and long-term responses to the needs of farmers, truckers, the elderly, and all energy consumers. I've been a strong supporter of renewable energy technologies and increased funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program--or LiHEAP. I strongly support the efforts of my colleagues to increase domestic oil and gas exploration and production on public lands, including offshore reserves and the tremendous potential of ANWR. I remain committed to finding a resolution to our nation's nuclear waste storage crisis--as crisis that threatens to shut down nuclear plants and further weaken our nation's domestic energy security. And I'll continue to be one of the Senate's strongest critics of the Department of Energy's unbelievable neglect of the long-term energy needs of our nation.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support HR 5, the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act. This very important legislation would help millions of American seniors who choose to, or must work after retirement. 
   Under current law, the Social Security benefits of those seniors ages 65 though 69 who continue to work will be reduced by $1 for each $3 of earnings over $17,000. In other words, they will be taxed at 33.3 percent of their earnings above the threshold. 
   However, the onerous tax burden on our seniors does not stop there. These seniors are also subject to a 15.3 percent payroll tax, and a 15 percent income tax. Combined with the earnings test, these seniors are paying taxes of over 60 percent on their earnings from working. If their earnings bump up their income, their Social Security benefits are then taxed. The tax bite could take 68 to 91 percent of their additional earnings. 
   Mr. President, this is absurd. We must correct this unfair tax burden on our seniors. 
   When Social Security was set up 65 years ago during the Great Depression,  jobs were scarce, workers were younger and many could not find work to support their families. One of the intentions of the Social Security program was to encourage older workers to retire, so that younger workers could find a job. 
   Today, our situation is dramatically different. The economic and demographic conditions in the U.S. are not what they were when Social Security was established. Our strong economy has created a tight labor market. After filling over 20 million new jobs during this economic expansion, we still have a job shortage, particularly skilled workers. It is projected that this shortage will continue for the next 5 to 10 years. 
   Lower birth rates and a longer life expectancy mean that the number and relative size of the older population is growing rapidly. The number of Americans over age 65 has grown from 8 percent in 1950 to 14 percent in 1990 and is projected to reach 22 percent in 2030. 
   This demographic change has triggered a serious Social Security crisis. In 1940 there were 100 workers to support 1 retiree. Today that ratio has dropped to 3 workers supporting 1 retiree. In less than 20 years, that ratio will decrease to 2 to 1. As a result, we have a $20 trillion unfunded Social Security liability. 
   The earnings test penalty has worsened this situation. It discourages seniors from working, even though their skills are much needed in the labor market. If allowed to work without penalty, they will continue to pay payroll taxes into the Social Security system which will help us work toward solvency of the system. 
   Another important reason we must get rid of the earnings test is that Social Security is a very poor investment for Americans. Americans pay a significant amount of payroll taxes through their working life but face low and declining returns from Social Security, and some receive less in benefits than they have paid in payroll taxes. Their Social Security benefits cannot even begin to meet their pre-retirement standard of living. Many seniors have no choice but to continue to work--and others want to work for the joy of it. 
   Over the past 15 years, goods purchased mainly by seniors increased 6 percentage points more than goods purchased by the general public. Their medical costs skyrocketed 156 percent. 
   As inflation on medical and pharmaceutical goods continues to rise, older Americans' hard-earned Social Security benefits are worth less and less. Their purchasing power will continue to diminish. 
   I believe the earnings test on Social Security benefits is wrong and unfair because Social Security benefits are earned benefits for many senior citizens. The Social Security benefits which working seniors are losing due to the earnings test penalty are benefits they have rightfully earned by contributing to the system throughout their working years before retiring. 
   These are benefits they should not be losing just because they are trying to survive by supplementing their Social Security income. Reducing Social Security benefits upon additional earnings is just double taxation. 
   As health care and other costs continue to grow, the incomes of more and more senior citizens are falling along with their standard of living. This earnings test hurts seniors who choose, or must work after retirement to maintain their standard of living or to pay for costly health insurance premiums, medical care, prescriptions and many other expenses which increase in retirement years. This is particularly true for seniors with lower-incomes who must work and depend on their earned income for survival. 
   Mr. President, we cannot let this practice continue. 
   Eliminating the earnings test on Social Security benefits would reverse this trend, and help responsible senior citizens. The federal government has entered into a sacred covenant with the American people to provide retirement benefits once contribution commitments are made. It is the government's contractual duty to honor that commitment. The government cannot and should not take money from seniors that is rightfully theirs. 
   Mr. President, I'd like to briefly discuss the health of our Social Security system. Social Security benefits will exceed payroll taxes by 2014 or soon. 
   President Clinton claims he is saving Social Security by using the interest savings that will result from paying down the government debt held by the public. However, his proposal does not push back the date that Social Security will run a deficit by a single year, and the transfer from the general fund to Social Security does not cover a fraction of the shortfall. 
   Mr. President, without reform, the unfunded liability of Social Security will crowd out all of our discretionary spending. It will create financial hardship for millions of baby boomers and impose a heavy burden on future generations. We must address this vitally important issue as quickly as we can. 
   I believe the best way to fix Social Security is to move it from the current pay-as-you-go system to a fully funded one, and the immediate step we should take is to lock in every penny of the Social Security surplus safe from government spending, and put it toward Americans' retirement. My lockbox would sequester spending if re-estimates result in spending any of our Social Security surplus. 
   In addition, we need to tell Americans the whole truth about Social Security since payroll taxes are the largest tax that many families will ever pay, accounting for up to one-eighth of the total lifetime income they will make. 
   That's why I also support the Gregg amendment which would require the government to provide information on the financial status of the program. This amendment is along the same line of my legislation, S. 1104, the Social Security Information Act. Reliable information on Social Security is crucial to enable Americans to better understand the value of their Social Security investment and to help them determine exactly how much they should supplement their expected Social Security benefits with other savings in order to have a certain level of retirement security. 
   Mr. President, let me close by saying it is critical that we repeal the earnings test penalty. We owe our seniors nothing less than to remove this senseless provision and give them the opportunity to sustain and hopefully improve their standard of living by allowing them to work without additional tax penalties. It is equally important that, by continuing to pay into the Social Security system, our seniors will actually give us more time to reform it--which ultimately benefits everyone.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to address the crop insurance reform proposal. I thank you for the opportunity to address this legislation that I think is so crucial to the economic health of farmers in Minnesota and across the country. I have appreciated the hard work and effort put into this bill, and I believe it is one of the key reform issues the Congress must address this year to create an economic climate that will enable America's farmers to thrive. 
   As a sponsor of crop insurance legislation in both the 105th and 106th Congress, I am certainly no stranger to this issue. Working with producers, rural lenders, economists, and other stakeholders, I think we have fashioned a bill that would encourage more participation in the program, help encourage producers to buy higher levels of coverage, and will also reduce the instances of ``moral hazard'' to keep everybody's premiums lower, and also help maintain the integrity of the program. 
   Mr. President, I first introduced my crop insurance bill in the 105th Congress, and I am pleased that much of my own legislation has now been incorporated into the Roberts-Kerrey measure, including pilot programs that would offer farmers premium discounts for using whole farm units or one crop units of insurance, and allowing producers to cross State and county boundaries to form insurable units, plus a pilot program permitting producers to ensure their crops are based upon a future price. Also, I am pleased that this bill will now also include an expansion of the dairy options pilot program. I think this is also a very important tool for producers who are attempting to weather the ups and downs in the dairy market. So I think it is great that we have included this provision that is going to help dairy farmers in the Midwest and across the country as well. 
   Participation in the Federal Crop Insurance Program has increased from 10 percent of the eligible acres in 1980 to about 70 percent of eligible acres last year, 1999. I think that is encouraging, but we still need higher levels of participation if our farm is to successfully manage its risk in the face of ever-changing global markets. Like almost no other form of employment, producers are subject to a host of variables that impact their bottom line, including weather, disease, production levels in other countries, foreign trade, increasing production costs, and changing consumer demand. All are out of the control of the producer. 
   As most of you know, America's farmers are fiercely independent and ever optimistic and were glad to get the freedom to make their own production decisions that came with the 1996 farm bill. However, part of the promise of Freedom to Farm was that there would be accompanying efforts to bring about trade negotiations to reduce barriers, regulatory reform, and improvements to the Crop Insurance Program to help producers manage the risk in open markets. Unfortunately, the administration has not eased the regulatory burden on farmers, and we have not initiated new WTO talks or negotiations. I am confident this crop insurance reform legislation remains one of the most important pieces of the farm prosperity puzzle. Tax relief and tax reform for our farmers across the board is also very important because it directly impacts the bottom line, the net income of our farmers and the ability of our farmers to pass farms from one generation to another. 
   Again, I am proud to be one of the early advocates for reform and that the basic concepts of my proposal again were carried into this reform bill.  
   I strongly urge my colleagues to speedily approve this bill so it can be reconciled with the House bill and be completed as soon as possible. 
   Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of President Clinton's trip to India. For too long, the cold war, and India's leadership of the non-aligned movement, strained what should have been the natural bond between our two great democracies. The end of the cold war has now brought us together. India is a true friend to the United States in a region where respect for democracy is rare. 
   India has made great strides since achieving independence. Literacy has doubled, life expectancy has doubled, and infant mortality has been more than halved. However, India recognizes that commitment to democracy must be accompanied by free-market principles in order for prosperity to flourish. India's initial pursuit of socialist economic policies, including nationalizing production, subsidizing industries, and raising tarriffs and other trade barriers, while imposing high taxes, caused its economy and its people to suffer. 
   With the end of the cold war, India's experiment with a centralized economic system is waning. India is starting to liberalize the economy, prompting foreign investment and reducing barriers to trade. The results are encouraging: India's growth rate, which had been stuck at 3 percent, is now exceeding 6 percent, and the outlook is promising for further improvement. While a commitment to socialism may still be enshrined in its Constitution, the economic reforms India is embracing are clearly leading the nation in a positive, new direction. For example, India's prowess in the high-technology sector makes it an able partner in that area. The recent decision to open its insurance and telecommunication sectors to foreign investors is emblematic of the kind of changes that will enable India to achieve its potential. 
   Mr. President, the only shadow over President Clinton's visit is the eruption of violence in Kashmir. Indian and Pakistani troops started exchanging  heavy artillery fire along the disputed border a day ahead of his arrival in the region. While Kashmir has been a source of conflict between India and Pakistan for nearly a half century, the recent nuclear and ballistic missile tests by India and Pakistan have compelled the international community to increase pressure on the parties to resolve this dispute. There has been a recognition of the very real danger that Kashmir could become the ``flashpoint'' which sparks a wider regional war. I hope President Clinton uses this visit to encourage officials of India and Pakistan, and representatives of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, to begin an official dialogue. 
   Mr. President, there is an Indian saying that, ``it is the spirit of the quest that determines its outcome.'' The President's trip is an important symbol of the renewed spirit of cooperation between the United States and India. I look forward to the achievements we will reach together, as both partners and friends, in the next half century.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Irish-American Heritage Month and take this occasion to salute the generations of Irish descendants who have helped my home state of Minnesota grow and prosper. 
   When millions of Irish men, women, and children fled their homeland and the great potato famine that gripped Ireland beginning in the 1840s, they looked to America as a place of abundant food, freedom, and opportunity. 
   Most came here with little, yet the riches they have given back to this country and our state cannot be measured. 
   At the urging of Archbishop John Ireland, early leader of the Minnesota Catholic Church, many of those first immigrants became employees of the Great Northern Railroad and settled in Minnesota, along the railroad lines heading toward Montana. Since then, our Irish-American population has flourished; surveyed for the 1990 census, 574,183 Minnesotans claimed at least some Irish ancestry. 
   During Irish-American Heritage Month, and on the occasion of Saint Patrick's Day, I salute Minnesota's ``sons and daughters of Ireland'' and offer to our large and enthusiastic Irish community the heartfelt words of the familiar Irish blessing: 
 May the road rise up to meet you, May the wind be always at your back, May the sun shine warm upon your face, And the rains fall soft upon your fields, And until we meet again, may God hold you in the palm of His hand.

   Mr. GRAMS. Recently, I came to the floor to address Federal dairy policy, specifically focusing on an erroneous but often repeated claim that dairy compacts are necessary today to guarantee a supply of fresh, locally produced milk to consumers. During that time, I dealt with how this is a myth similar to urban legends that are assumed to be true because they are repeated so often. Another dairy myth that you may hear a great deal is that dairy compacts preserve small dairy farms. Mr. President, this is simply not true, and this afternoon I want to point out the reasons why it is untrue. 
   The Northeast Dairy Compact sets a floor price that processors must pay for fluid milk in the region. Ostensibly, this is supposed to provide small farmers with the additional income necessary to help them survive during hard times. In its practical effect, it doesn't work that way at all. In fact, It has provided financial incentives for big dairy farms to get even bigger. 
   Consider the cases of Vermont and Pennsylvania. Vermont is in the Northeast Dairy Compact and Pennsylvania is not. Before the formation of the compact in 1997, Vermont had 2,100 dairy farms with an average herd size of 74 cows per farm. By 1998, the number of farms had fallen nearly 10 percent to 1900 dairy farms, but the average herd size had increased to 85 cows per farm. That is a 15-percent increase. 
   Meanwhile, during the same period of time in 
   Pennsylvania--again, without the compact--the number of dairy farms fell 3 percent, from 11,300 to 10,900, but the average herd size increased only from 56 cows to 57 cows. Thus, in a compact State such as Vermont, the number of dairy farms fell significantly while the average herd size per farm increased significantly. And then compare that to the noncompact State of Pennsylvania during the same period. Their number of dairy farms dropped by a smaller number, and farm herd sizes increased by an even smaller percentage. So this does not appear in any way to be a compact to protect small dairy farms. 
   The extra income that the compact provides to large farms accelerates their domination of the industry by helping them get larger and stronger. Since the amount of compact premium a producer receives is based entirely on the volume of production, the small amount of additional income a small farmer receives is often inconsequential and does nothing to keep small farms from exiting the industry. In fact, during the first year of the compact, dairy farms in New England declined at a 25 percent faster rate than the average rate of decline during the previous 2-year period. 
   The assertion that dairy compacts do not protect small farmers is not just something that this Minnesota Senator claims but compact supporters themselves have acknowledged as much. In the latter part of 1998, the Massachusetts commissioner of agriculture declared that the compact, after 16 months, had not protected small dairy farms. The commissioner consequently proposed a new method for distributing the compact premium to class I milk, capping the amount of premium any one dairy farm could receive and redistributing the surplus. Farms of average size or smaller would have seen their incomes increase by as much as 80 percent. However, large farm dairy interests were predictably able to kill this proposal because the assistance to small dairy farmers would have come, of course, out of their pockets. So while compact supporters perpetuate a sentimental picture of compacts enabling small family farmers to continue to work the land, the bottom line is that compacts hasten the demise of the small farmer while enriching the bigger producers. 
   This claim that compacts save small dairy operations is often made in conjunction with the claim that compacts are being unfairly opposed by large-scale Midwest dairy farms that want to dominate the market. Well, this, too, is untrue because the average herd size for a Vermont dairy farm is 85 cows per herd, while the average herd size for a Minnesota dairy farm is only 57 head. Thus, Vermont dairy farms average in size almost 50 percent larger than Minnesota dairy farms. 
   Similarly, the South, which has also sought to have its own compact, also has larger farms than the Midwest. The average herd size of a Florida dairy farm is 246 head. That is almost four times larger than the upper-Midwest average. Incidentally, Minnesota producers would love to be getting the mailbox price that farmers in Florida and the Northeast are getting. 
   In November of last year, the mailbox price--which is the actual price farmers receive for their milk--in the upper-Midwest was $12.09 per hundredweight. In the Northeast, it was $15.02. And in Florida, due to the milk marketing order system, it was $18.72 per hundredweight. So in the Midwest it was $12; in the Northeast it was $15--that is $3 per hundredweight more--and again, in Florida, it was $18.72, or nearly $7 a hundredweight more, or 50 percent more for milk produced in Florida than in Minnesota. How are you going to compete against this type of unfairness in the compact system and in the milk marketing orders? 
   So the Northeast price is 24 percent higher than Minnesota's, and Florida's price is almost 55 percent higher. Again, Minnesota farmers would love to get those kinds of mailbox prices, but our Government program--and again, the larger farmers in these areas unfairly benefit from this program--ensures that they don't and that these other regions do. 
   While dairy compacts are again not saving small dairy farms in compact States, they are impacting the bottom line of small-scale producers in non-compact States; in other words, those dairy farmers outside the compact. Compacts are a zero-sum game that shifts producer markets and income from one region of the country to competing regions. They don't have small family farms, and they certainly don't deserve the continuing sanction and the support of the Congress. 
   Again, there are other dairy myths that must be exposed, and the truth must be told. I will be back on the floor soon to take another look at a misleading claim, try to dissect it a little bit, and put some fairness into what we often hear in the dairy debates. 
   If we look at this system and why it is unfair, again to look at the prices farmers receive for the milk they produce, why is it fair that if you are in the Midwest, you get $12.60 or $12.70  per hundredweight, but if you are in New England in the compact States, you get $15.20, and if you are a farmer in Florida, that somehow you can receive $18.72 per hundredweight? I don't know. We don't sell computers that way. We don't sell oranges that way. We don't sell automobiles that way. Why is it milk is different? Why is the Government picking winners and losers among those who are in the dairy industry? 
   If you are in the Midwest, the Government says, well, you are going to be a loser, and if you are in Florida or in the compact States, our Government programs say you are going to get more so you can be a winner. I don't think we should have this type of competition and unfair playing field with the Government picking dairy winners and losers. 
   I hope we bring some sanity into our dairy program. I will be back on the floor to take on another misleading claim we often hear in these dairy debates. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the Camp Fire Boys and Girls as it celebrates its 90th birthday. Founded in 1910 as the Camp Fire Girls, it focuses on educational and leadership programs to mentor America's young women, and at the time was the nation's only organization specifically for girls. My own state of Minnesota was one of the first states to develop a local chapter for Camp Fire Girls, with a small group of eight and their 21-year-old leader. 
   Minnesota Governor John Lind purchased 63 acres on Lake Minnewashta in 1924 to provide Camp Fire members with a permanent campground. This concept caught on, as two years later, 1000 feet of shoreline on Green Lake was purchased for the St. Paul council. Many of the early camping ventures were for girls in high school. But many councils, like Minnesota, developed a Blue Bird program to provide younger girls with activities all their own. This additional age group completed the support Camp Fire brought to girls up to age 18. To better serve all of America's youth, Camp Fire opened its doors and allowed boys to become members in 1975. In 1994, the St. Paul and Minneapolis councils merged and now serve not only the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, but most of Southern Minnesota. This partnership has provided Camp Fire the opportunity to maintain its flexibility and remain responsive to the changing needs of children. 
   That Camp Fire has consistently adapted to the changes necessitated by changing times is perhaps the organization's strongest asset in reaching out to America's youth. 
   Camp Fire was not intended to solve the problems of the world, but rather provide the right tools to the children who will. From the beginning, Camp Fire has used the ideals behind Work, Health, and Love (Wohelo) to guide our youth in developing self-esteem and responsibility. Wohelo was the name of the organization's first camp in Vermont and more than 50 years later, in 1962, the Wohelo medallion was created to bestow the highest honor to those who personify the meaning of the Camp Fire organization. 
   Today, there are 125 local councils in 41 States serving some 629,000 young Americans. Camp Fire provides direct access to youth through development programs in three areas: club programs, self-reliance programs, and outdoor programs. 
   Club programs provide children with regular, informal educational meetings in local communities led by volunteers or paid leaders. In elementary schools, self-reliance courses are led by trained, certified teachers who educate children about personal safety and self-care. Last year, more than 6,000 children were involved in this program in Minneapolis alone. And in St. Paul, teens are involved in the teaching process to broaden their community involvement. The outdoor programs provide an outdoor setting for children to better understand the world we live in while developing vision, commitment, and participation skills in team and individual activities. 
   I am honored to wish the Camp Fire Boys and Girls across America a happy 90th birthday. I wish it continued success in reaching our youth by inspiring individual potential while having fun.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor the Volunteers of America on the occasion of its Founders' Week Celebration. 
   Volunteers of America was founded in 1896 by Christian social reformers Ballington and Maud Booth in New York with the mission of ``reaching and uplifting'' the American people. Soon afterwards, more than 140 ``posts'' were established across the nation. One of these posts sprang to life in my home state of Minnesota. 
   Volunteers of America serves people in many ways, with a special emphasis on human services, housing, and health services. The organization is noted for being the nation's largest nonprofit provider of quality, affordable housing for low-income families and the elderly. Currently, more than 30,000 people reside in Volunteers of America housing. Along with its commitment to providing homes, Volunteers of America also focuses on helping the homeless, through emergency shelters, transitional housing, jobs training, and counseling. 
   In Minnesota, Volunteers of America is one of the most important providers of social services and workers with  children, adults, and seniors. Children are provided residential treatment, shelter, and foster care. Adult services include help filling housing needs and skills training for individuals with developmental disabilities. Senior services include home-delivered meals and home health care assistance. 
   None of this would be possible without the more than 11,000 employees and 300,000 volunteers who work with the Volunteers of America. Volunteers of America of Minnesota is home to more than 350 employees and over 1,000 volunteers. Volunteerism is a community necessity, and I extend my utmost thanks and appreciation to those who are providing our country and my state with such an invaluable resource through their participation in Volunteers of America. 
   I again applaud the Volunteers of America during this Founders' Week for its extraordinary record of service. For more than 100 years, Volunteers of America has been there for countless Minnesotans; given its good work and record of success, I am confident this vital organization will be with us for many years to come.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation addressing a very important issue-fairness for the Guard and Reserve members in our armed forces. 
   Le me begin with a February 3rd report from the Washington Post titled ``A Tough Goodbye: Guard Members Leave for Nine Months in Bosnia.'' It reads ``Sgt. Deedra Lavoie was alone, after leaving her two young children with her ex-husband. Sgt. Bill Wozniak, hugging his 3-year-old daughter, was worried about not having the same job when he returns in nine months. Staff Sgt. Stephen Smith won't have a home to come back to: Movers have cleared out his Annapolis apartment, which he can't afford to keep while overseas.'' 
   This brings home, Mr. President, the real hardship that thousands of Guards and Reservists, and their families, are facing today. 
   The traditional duty of the National Guards and reservists was to keep domestic peace or fight in wars. But as the number of our Armed Forces has fallen by more than 1 million personnel since 1988, increasing numbers of our Guards and Reserve members are being pulled out of the private sector and into what amounts to at times to be full-time military service. 
   They are often called on to carry out overseas peacekeeping, humanitarian and other missions. Their deployment time is longer than ever before in peacetime. Today we rely heavily on our Guardsmen and Reservists to support overseas contingency operations. Since 1990, they have been called to service in Operation RESTORE HOPE in Somalia, Operation UPHOLD DEMOCRACY in Haiti, Operation JOINT ENDEAVOR/JOINT GUARD in Bosnia, Operation STABILIZE in Southeast Asia and Operation TASK FORCE FALCON in Kosovo. 
   Mr. President, the statistics speak for themselves: 
   Work days contributed by Guardsmen and Reservists have risen from 1 million days in 1992, to over 13 million days last year. Without the service of these citizen soldiers, we would need an additional force of 35,000 soldiers to do the job. 
   43,000 Guardsmen and Reservists have served in Bosnia and Kosovo from December 1995 through March 1, 2000. This is 33 percent of the total Armed Forces personnel participating in that region during that period. 
   Mr. President, Guardsmen and Reservists are willing to do their duty and serve when they are called, but increasingly frequent overseas deployments create tremendous hardship for them, and their families, as well their employers. We need to give our reserve forces fair treatment by improving the quality of life both for them and their dependents. We must help their employers adjust as well. 
   That's why I am introducing the Military Guard and Reserve Fairness Act of 2000. This bill would do the following: 
   First, my legislation would exempt federal tax on the base pay for enlisted Guardsmen and Reservists and exempt federal tax on the base pay of Guard and Reserve officers up to the highest level of that if enlisted Guardsmen and Reservists' base pay during their overseas deployment. 
   The majority of Guardsmen and Reservists take pay cuts when called up for involuntary overseas deployment, and sustain a huge financial loss. Our active duty military personnel enjoy federal tax exemption on their base pay, why not our Guardsmen and Reservists who perform the same duty as full-time military personnel? 
   Secondly, my legislation would provide a tax credit to employers who employ Guardsmen and Reservists. The tax credit would be equal to 50 percent of the amount of compensation that would have been paid to an employee during the time that the employee participates in contingency operations. However, the credit is capped at $2000 for each individual Reservist employee and a maximum of $30,000 for all employees. This provision would apply to the self-employed as well. 
   Despite the fact that most businesses are fully supportive of the military obligations of their employees, studies show that the increasingly long overseas deployments have created a new strain on Guard/Reserve-employer relations. One of the reasons is that the unplanned absence of Guard/Reservist-employees creates a variety of problems for employers. Employers have to hire and train temporary employees, budget for overtime, or reschedule work and deadlines. As a result, it increases employer costs, reducing revenue and profits. This is particularly problematic for small business and the self-employed. 
   The Defense Department acknowledges the increased use of the Guard and Reserve and that unplanned contingency operations do create problems for employers. DOD suggests that a financial incentive may help to correct some of the problems. 
   The tax credit included in my bill would offset at least some of the expense that Guard and Reserve employers face, and help reduce tension with employees. 
   Third, the Military Guard and Reserve Fairness Act would provide federal income tax deductions for transportation, meals and lodging expenses incurred in performance of Guard and Reserve military duty. 
   Mr. President, many Guardsmen and Reservists have to travel to a Reserve center, such as a National Guard Armory, far away from their home areas for drills or training. 
   Often Guardsmen and Reservists incur expenses for transportation, meals, lodging and other necessities. Before 1986, members of the Guard and Reserve could deduct these costs as business expenses. But the Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated this deduction. 
   This is not fair. This nation requires our Guard and Reserve members to perform their duty but also expects them to bear the expense. Restoring the deductibility would help restore fairness for Reservists. 
   The Military Guard and Reserve Fairness Act would also include a number of provisions that would give our Guard and Reserve members fair treatment by improving their quality of life. 
   It would extend space-available travel (``Space-A'') to Reservists and the National Guard, to travel outside of the United States--the same level as retired military, and gives the Guardsmen and Reservists the same priority status as active duty personnel when traveling for their monthly drills. 
   It would grant so-called ``gray area retirees'' the right to travel Space-A under the same conditions as the retired military receiving retired pay as well. 
   In addition, my legislation would provide Guardsmen and Reservists, when traveling to attend monthly military drills, the same billeting privileges as active duty personnel. 
   The bill would also remove the annual Guard and Reserve retirement point maximum--upon which retirement pensions are based--and allow retirement pensions to be based upon the actual number of points earned annually. 
   Finally, my legislation would extend free legal services to Guardsmen and Reservists by Judge Advocate General officers for a time equal to twice the length of their last period of active duty service. 
   Mr. President, our Guard and Reserve members are being called upon to perform more overseas active duty assignments to keep pace with the rising  number of U.S. peacekeeping and humanitarian missions. I believe that this increase in overseas active-duty assignments for Guard and Reserve component members merits the extension of military benefits for our Nation's citizen soldiers. It is only fair to close these disparities. 
   The passage of my Military Guard and Reserve Fairness Act would restore fairness to our Guard and Reserve members, and it would greatly increase morale and the quality of life for our National Guard and Reserves and prevent problems of recruitment and retention in the future. Hence, it would strengthen our national defense and increase our military readiness. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of our military Guard and Reserves.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I proudly rise today to pay tribute to the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. on the occasion of the 88th anniversary of its founding. To honor an organization that gives back so much to our communities, Congress has established March 12-18 as National Girl Scout Week. 
   Created in 1912 by Juliette Gordon Law, the first Girl Scout group consisted of only 18 girls. Since then, the Girl Scouts have evolved into the largest voluntary organization for girls in the world. Nearly 3.5 million active members strive toward excellence in character, conduct, patriotism and service--attributes that are vital to a young person's development. The Girl Scouts have given direction to over 40 million American women throughout its rich 86-year history. 
   Girl Scouting empowers young women from every background with the tools they will need to be the outstanding leaders of the future. For example, we all know about those famous Girl Scout cookies. I have certainly enjoyed my fair share. Through their annual cookie sales, girls learn valuable life lessons in goal setting, money management, and community involvement. 
   Of course, there is much more to scouting than the sale of cookies, such as the organization's long tradition of serving others without the expectation of reward. Girls are encouraged to incorporate service into their lives, whether it takes the form of common, everyday acts around the house or community service work outside the home. Instilled with compassion for others, Girl Scouts head into the world as caring, valuable members of society. 
   Additionally, I take this opportunity to commend the 850,000 adult volunteers who serve as leaders for the Girl Scouts. Their devotion to providing opportunities for girls to meet their potential is unparalleled. In my home state of Minnesota, nearly 20,000 volunteers devote their time and energy to over 60,000 Girl Scouts. Clearly, without these dedicated volunteers, the Girl Scouts would not provide the effective leadership it offers today. 
   For 88 years, the members and adult volunteers of the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. have worked tirelessly for the betterment of this nation. I congratulate them on their achievements and wish for them a prosperous future as the Girl Scouts continue to nurture the lives of America's young women.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, 87 years ago today, the Federal Government began collecting income tax. I rise not to celebrate the anniversary, but to condemn the occasion. What began as a simple flat tax on the revenue of a few has turned into a Pandora's box that devastates many. And so I take this opportunity today to strongly urge Congress to begin repealing the process of the constitutional amendment granting the Federal Government the power to tax, abolish the income tax, and replace it with a tax that is fairer, simpler, and friendlier to the taxpayers. 
   The reasons for abolishing the Federal income tax are compelling. To begin with, the income tax has clearly violated the fundamental principles upon which this great Nation was founded. 
   Mr. President, our country was born out of a tax revolt--a tax revolt built upon freedom and liberty. To preserve liberty, our Founding Fathers crafted an article in the Constitution unequivocally rejecting all direct income taxes that were not apportioned to each state by its population. 
   During the following 100 years, this provision brought enormous economic opportunities and prosperity for America. Although Congress attempted to enact income taxes in the late 19th century, the Supreme Court repeatedly declared the income tax unconstitutional. As a result, between 1870 and 1913, before the income tax was levied, the U.S. economy expanded by over 435 percent in real terms. This was an average growth rate of more than 10 percent per year, without inflation. 
   Congress has passed many ill-advised laws, but nothing has been more disastrous than the passing of the 16th amendment in 1909, which allowed the Federal Government to begin levying and collecting income tax as of March 8, 1913. 
   This shift in policy represented the efforts of those liberal elements who believes and promoted the ideology that society has a claim on one's capital and labor. They suggested that the redistribution of private income would increase equality among people. Their strategy was simple: they claimed this income tax was to ``soak the rich'' and was not supposed to provide a mechanism for Washington to reach into most Americans' pockets--the argument we still hear again and again on the Senate floor. 
   Initially, less than 1 percent of all Americans paid income tax. Only 5 percent of Americans paid any income tax as late as 1939. But today, nearly every American is subject to the income tax. The Federal tax burden is at an historic high. A median-income family can expect to give up nearly 40 percent of its income in Federal, State, and local taxes--more than it spends on food, clothing, transportation, and housing combined. 
   More Americans are working harder and are earning more today. But a large share of the higher incomes of hard-working Americans aren't being spent on family priorities, but are instead being siphoned off by Washington. 
   They are working harder, but they are taking home less money because the Government is taking a bigger bite out of their paychecks. Then there is ``bracket creep.'' I think everybody knows what that is. It means a large share of revenues goes to taxes as inflation pushes you into another income level, or another tax bracket, so Washington can get a bigger bite out of your paycheck. 
   Mr. President, is this what our Founding Fathers fought for? Even the sponsor of the 16th amendment, Congressman Sereno E. Payne of New York, later realized his mistake and denounced direct taxation as ``a tax upon the income of honest men and an exemption, to a greater or lesser extent, of the income of rascals.'' 
   T. Coleman Andrews, a former commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service said:   
   Congress [in implementing the 16th Amendment] went beyond merely enacting an income tax law and repealed Article IV of the Bill of Rights, by empowering the tax collector to do the very things from which that article says we were to be secure. It opened up our homes, our papers and our effects to the prying eyes of government agents and set the stage for searches of our books and vaults and for inquiries into our private affairs whenever the tax men might decide, even though there might not be any justification beyond mere cynical suspicion.  
   To my colleagues who would brush off that statement as an exaggeration, I remind them of the horror stories we heard from many of our constituents 2 years ago, when the Senate Finance Committee held hearings into abuses carried out by the IRS. Those poor taxpayers whose lives were shattered thanks to the unwarranted excesses of an overeager tax collector were not exaggerating. 
   The income tax must be abolished because it has become so complicated and inefficient. The Federal Tax Code today stretches on for more than 7 million words, and is made up of 4 huge volumes, another 20 volumes of regulations, and thousands of pages of instructions. Not even tax accountants or lawyers fully understand it. What chance does the average taxpayer have of getting it right? 
   The government publishes 480 separate tax forms and mails out 8 billion pages of forms and instruction each year. The IRS employs over 10,000 agents to collect taxes, more agents than the FBI and the CIA combined. 
   The income tax must be abolished because it keeps enlarging the government. In Washington, taxing and spending always go hand in hand. As the income tax rate goes up, government spending explodes. Between 1913 and 1999, inflation-adjusted federal government spending increased by more than 16,000 percent. 
   The income tax must be abolished because even in an era of budget surplus, it allows the government to continue overcharging Americans as we see today with our surpluses. According to the Congressional Budget Office, working Americans' tax overpayments will be as high as $1.9 trillion in the next 10 years. After the biggest tax increase in history, President Clinton has repeatedly denied working Americans a tax refund and refuses to return tax overpayments to the American people. His last budget again increases taxes instead of cutting them. In a time of surplus, this President is out with a proposal to again increase your taxes. 
   How is this possible? We would all agree that if a customer is overcharged for a service he receives, the right thing for the merchant to do is to return the extra money--not keep it because the merchant has other things he'd like to spend it on. The same principle holds true for tax overpayments. I strongly believe we should return tax overpayments to their rightful owners--the taxpayers--rather than spend them on new government programs. Not only does this money belong to them, but the American people will spend it far more intelligently than Washington politicians ever could. 
   Mr. President, on this somber income tax anniversary, I argue that we have no choice but to repeal the income tax and abolish the IRS. I urge my colleagues to join me in a pledge that we will dedicate ourselves to replacing the Tax Code with a better system early next Congress, as we continue to do everything we can to reduce the existing tax burden on the overtaxed American people.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to take time this morning to talk about one of the most important issues I think is facing American society today; that is, the future of the retirement system in this country--not only for those who are on Social Security today or for those who are going to be on Social Security very soon, but basically to look down the road to our children and our grandchildren at what kind of Social Security or a retirement system we are going to leave the next generation. I think that is very important. 
   I am very pleased this morning that President Clinton has finally accepted the Republican Social Security lockbox which would lock in every penny of the Social Security surplus, not for tax relief and not for Government spending but for the retirement program of millions of Americans. 
   However, what most concerns me is that the President appears to be abandoning his ``Save Social Security First'' pledge. It was one thing to lock in Social Security surpluses last year and in the future and to further attempt to devote interest savings on a lower public debt to Social Security, but that alone will not save Social Security because we have spent too many years of the Social Security surplus prior to the year 2000. 
   The President's budget does not address the future solvency of Social Security to ensure retirement benefits will be there for the baby boomers and also future generations. All he has proposed is to credit Social Security with more IOUs that do nothing but increase taxes on future generations. 
   So my point is, the President's Social Security proposal does not push back the date that Social Security will run a deficit by a single year, and the transfer from the general fund to Social Security does not cover a fraction of the shortfall the system is going to face. 
   Without reform, the unfunded liability of Social Security will crowd out all discretionary spending. It will create financial hardship for millions of baby boomers. It will impose a heavy burden for our future generations in the form of higher taxes. We must address this very vitally important issue and do it as quickly as we can.  
   Just another note. Recently, a Social Security advisory panel found that the Social Security economic and demographic assumptions the Government uses to project the program's future economic status underestimate the unfunded liability. What that means is, if the panel's recommendations were adopted, Social Security projections would show a financial imbalance in the system that is much greater than currently forecast. In other words, the system is more likely to be in worse shape today financially than previously even thought. This means Social Security could go broke much sooner than we actually expect today. 
   What I want to do is to look at the system itself and then look at a plan I have introduced called the Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act, which is personal retirement accounts, which I believe is the direction in which we should go in order to save Social Security and to have a safe, sound, and good retirement system for the future. 
   In doing this, I have been across the State of Minnesota, holding many town meetings, talking to hundreds and thousands of Minnesotans, trying to explain to them what the problems are. 
    I think everybody agrees there are some problems in Social Security. In fact, more young people today believe Elvis Presley is still alive or believe in aliens than they believe that Social Security is going to be there for them. So there is a problem of perception. 
   What Americans are looking for--and I found this out traveling across Minnesota--what they want is some information on what is happening and what are some of the options we are going to have in order to address this problem. That is why I have traveled across the State of Minnesota doing a number of town meetings, talking to Minnesotans about this. 
   When we look at Social Security over the last 65 years, Social Security has basically done what we have asked the program to do; that is, to provide retirement benefits for millions of Americans over 65 years. It has done the job. In some cases, if one looks at their Social Security check today, they will say it is not very good because it is only $700 a month, $600 a month, $800 a month. That is not the kind of retirement we want to leave to our children. 
   If we look ahead to the next 30 years, the system is facing some real problems. We are going to strain the system to the point it will not be able to meet the benefits that have been promised. In fact, if we look out about 30 years, without any changes in Social Security, we will see a reduction in the benefits of about one-third. We might have to raise taxes; that is another option. We might have to raise the retirement age. 
   If those are the options on the table, I don't think they are what we want to leave our children, that they are going to have a retirement system that is going to cost them more, going to give them less in benefits, and they are going to have to be older to retire. Is that what we are promising or hoping for our kids? I don't think it is. That is why I have gone across Minnesota holding town meetings and talking about this issue. 
   When Franklin Roosevelt created the Social Security program over six decades ago, he wanted it also to feature a private sector component to build retirement income. In other words, he did not think only Social Security alone should do that. Social Security was supposed to be one leg of a three-legged stool: Social Security, pensions, and savings accounts. 
   But Franklin Roosevelt did have some concerns. In fact, there was a Senator--I think from Missouri--who had passed on the floor of the Senate a proposal to include private retirement accounts as well as the public. When it got into conference, it was stripped out. They promised him they would bring it back on the floor again the next year, but they said: We have to pass this bill now. We are right at the height of the Depression, with all the problems the country is facing. They promised him they would bring this aspect back the next year. They never did. I always say that is one of the first big lies dealing with Social Security. 
   Social Security is a system that is stretched to its limits. We have 78 million baby boomers who are going to begin retiring by the year 2008. The average is going to be around 2011 or 2012, but 80-plus percent of Americans retire at the age of 62, not at the age of 65. So we can push back when it is going to hit that limit by a couple of years to 2008. Social 
    Security spending will begin to exceed tax revenues by the year 2014. 
   We have all heard about the Social Security surplus and why we are bringing in these surpluses every year. In 1983, a blue-ribbon panel, chaired by Alan Greenspan, decided the way to extend the life of Social Security was to begin overcharging for the FICA taxes. That excess overcharge would be put into a trust fund or a savings account, and we would then draw on that after the surpluses evaporated so we could meet the shortfall from the savings account which would extend the life of the program to the year 2032. 
   We hear everybody in debates saying: Social Security will be here until the year 2032. Well, it will be here, but it won't be paying benefits to the max after the year 2014 unless we raise taxes somehow to retire some of the debt. 
   To give a quick example: It is as if we were paying out $100 in benefits today. By the way, our Social Security system is a pay-as-you-go system. In other words, the money brought in at the first of February went out at the end of February. There is not one account with your name on it with $1 in it in Washington for your retirement. You have been paying in all these dollars, but you do not have an account in Washington that has $1 for benefits for your retirement. All you can rely on or hope for is that there are people working when you retire so they can pay that benefit at the first of the month that you will collect at the end of the month. That is the way this system works. It is a pay-as-you-go system--no investments, no compound interest, no assets, only the hope that there are going to be enough workers paying into the system when you want to retire. 
   So if we are paying out $100 in benefits, we are bringing in $110 today. We put that $10 in the savings account. But by the year 2014, we will bring in $100 and pay $100. So we are going to be even. By the year 2015, estimates are we are going to bring in $98; we are going to have to pay out the $100. That is when we were going to go to the savings account or the trust fund to draw out $2 to make sure those benefits are paid. 
   Then by the year 2020, for instance, we will only be bringing in $90 and we will pay out $100. We will have to borrow $10. Between 2014 and 2032, we would have evaporated that savings account. Then we will be facing the problem we were hoping to deal with at that time. 
   The problem is, all that is in the trust fund today are IOUs. In other words, every time $1 has been collected from you to go into the trust fund, Washington has borrowed that money, put it into the general fund and spent it for other Government programs. They have spent your future retirement dollars. They have put in notes, IOUs, that say they will pay back. It would be similar to going to your kid's piggy bank, taking out 10 bucks and putting in an IOU. You are going to have to have future revenues to pay back that IOU. So the money you have already put in is gone. To replace it, we will have to go to current taxpayers and raise more taxes to pay it off. All the money has been used to increase Government spending. It hasn't gone for your retirement security at all. 
   The Social Security trust fund goes broke in the year 2033. That is when all the IOUs will be gone. I always like to say, if you think these IOUs are good, go put a million-dollar IOU into your checking account and find out how many checks your banker allows you to write against that IOU. None. You are 
   going to have to find additional revenues. I have $1 million in my checking account. It looks good on paper, but in reality there is nothing there to back it up but the good word and faith of the Federal Government to some day go back and collect more taxes to pay off this debt. So by 2014, we are going to have to begin raising taxes or cut spending in other areas to pay off an IOU. If we need $1 billion in the year 2014 and it is not in the budget, where do we go to get it? We are going to have to go out and get it from the taxpayers. So we are going to have to have a tax increase beginning as early as 2014 to pay the benefits being promised.  
   Why is the system now being stretched to the limit? Back in about 1940, there were 100 workers for every retiree. Today, there are about 2 1/2 workers for every retiree. In 25 years, there are going to be less than two for every retiree. Why does this put a strain on the system? Say if you were going to have a $1,000-benefit in 1940. One hundred workers would only have to put $10 a month into the system to make sure it was solvent. Today, we are asking that you put nearly $500 a month into the system in order to maintain the benefits for this retiree. In 2025, our grandchildren will have to pay more than $500 apiece in order to maintain those benefits. So $10 compared to over $500 shows the strain that will be put on the Social Security system if we do nothing to improve it. 
   Where are we today with the system? The numbers say the system is probably more in debt than we expected it to be. If we look at this chart, on this line is zero; this line shows the continuing surpluses we will be bringing in until about the years 2012 to 2014. But after that, we see the red line as it goes down. This is the debt the system is going to incur, and it is over $20 trillion of unfunded liabilities. In other words, this is after we have already collected Social Security taxes from your paychecks. This is what we are going to run short if we are to pay the benefits the Government promises. So if we are going to continue paying just today's level of benefits--adjusting this for inflation, of course--in today's dollars, we are going to be $20 trillion short over the next 70 years. 
   Again, others would say: Well, if we can't do that, we will lessen the retirement age, and that will lessen the debt; cut benefits by a third. That will lessen the debt even more, or we are going to raise taxes, which could eliminate it. But that is the plan they have proposed. 
   The biggest risk to our Social Security system today is to do nothing. There are a lot of people who say we can't really touch it, or maybe we should raise taxes a little bit. Right now, proposals are floating around to raise your FICA taxes by another 2.2 percent in order to maintain these benefits. That is like putting a Band-Aid over cancer; you can wait 5 years, but when you pull that Band-Aid off, the cancer is probably going to be much worse than it is today. So that is no cure. 
   In fact, to support Social Security we have raised taxes 52 or 53 different times. People like to say they want to ``tinker'' with Social Security. If you get out the Washington dictionary and you open it up to ``tinker,'' it means a tax increase. They say, if we can only raise it 2.2 percent more, we can solve this problem. Well, if you believe that, why have they done it 52 or 53 times? This would be 54. 
   How many more tax increases would have to be imposed in order to do that? To keep promising Social Security benefits, the payroll tax would have to be increased, some say, a minimum of 50 percent--a minimum of 50 percent--not the 2.2, but a minimum of about 6.5 percent. Others say that could be more than double in order to maintain it. 
   In fact, here are the payroll taxes on this chart. This is where we started in 1950. It was under 3 percent at that time. It started out, by the way, at 1 percent of the first $1,000 of earned income. It has grown now. So it is 12.4 percent on $70,200, or somewhere in that neighborhood. 
   You can see how taxes have continued to increase to where we are today. But this red line shows the intermediate projections. These are the best-guess estimates of what could happen. By 2030, our children could be paying about 23.5 percent just for Social Security--not Medicare, just Social Security. You can add Medicare and then you are at about 28 or 30 percent. Then add in Federal taxes and it is 56 percent because that averages 28 percent. Then add in local taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, excise taxes, and everything else, and in 30 years our children are going to be looking at tax rates as high as 70 percent or maybe even higher because high-cost projections show that this amount probably would not be 25 but it could actually be somewhere closer to 28 or 29 percent. That would put our children well over the 70-percent mark. 
   Is that what we want for our children, where, for every $100 they make, they will take $30 or $35 home and the Federal Government gets the remainder of it? I don't know how many children will vote in the year 2030 for a politician who will keep a system such as this. 
   The diminishing return of Social Security: If you retired in 1960 or 1955, you probably got back everything you had put into Social Security within the first year. It was a good investment for that generation. But today, the average return on Social Security is less than 2 percent. If you are a young person today, by the time you retire, there is actually going to be a negative return. In other words, they 
   would be better off to put their retirement money in a tin can and bury it in the backyard, and they would have more buying power in retirement than if they invested it in Social Security. 
   For many of the minority groups today, they are already in a negative cash-flow for Social Security because of age expectancy. So already it is beginning to hurt that portion of our population. To compare it, what if we invested it in the markets? The markets traditionally, over the last 80 years, including the crash of 1929 and all the ups and downs of the markets over the last 80 years, averaged a little over 7 percent in real rate of return. That is after inflation and all of the adjustments. It averaged over 7 percent in real rate of return. I don't know how many people would line up at the window to invest in an account that said: We are going to pay you less than 1 percent; in fact, it may be a negative percent. Right now, that is the only option you have. You have no choice as to where your money is going. 
   What have we done in Washington? Everybody now agrees--the President, Democrats and Republicans, the Senate and the House--that we need to lock it away to make sure all money collected for Social Security goes to pay for Social Security. We have introduced the lockbox. That means all the additional surpluses now are going to be set aside for Social Security retirement. That is very important. We need to continue to do that. 
   Stop raiding the trust fund. The Social Security Protection Act, which I introduced, would automatically reduce nonentitlement spending of Social Security dollars. Our spending and revenues now are based on the best estimates we can put together. The question is, Are we really serious about making sure we don't spend Social Security surplus money, even by accident? 
   We should have a protective mechanism in place. So if we estimate we are going to spend $1.8 trillion and we bring in a billion dollars less than that, right now, the only option is to go to the trust funds to make up the difference in spending. My bill would say we don't do that. We would reduce spending across the board evenly by that amount to make sure we did not take any money from the Social Security trust fund. 
   Again, if that is our promise, if we are serious about doing that, we should not say ``except to'' or make an exception. If we made an exception for $1 billion, you know there would be exceptions for $50 billion. So we have to be honest in what we are doing. It might only be .0003 percent; it might be .01 percent. If instead of getting $100 we would get $99, if that is what we need to do to protect Social Security funds, I think we should do that. If that is our top priority, we should live up to that priority. 
   When I was putting together the six principles of saving Social Security, I asked, what do we need to do if we are going to at reforming our securing retirement benefits for the future? First and foremost, we have to protect current and future beneficiaries. That means if you are on Social Security today, or plan to retire in the near future, you should be assured that the Government is not going to reduce the promises it has made. In other words, you can retire at the same age the Government says now, and your benefits will be there and protected, and we are not going to raid your taxes between now and then in order to do this. 
   You basically made a contract with the Government when you 
   started working and you said, all right, I am going to put money into the system, and I expect to get the benefits when I retire. It is a contract. You said you were going to do this, and the Government said you are going to have the  benefits. Late in the game, when you sit down and plan for retirement, in Washington they say: We don't have enough money in the budget anymore. We are going to have to make changes here and raise your retirement age, or cut your benefits, or maybe we need to raise your taxes a little more. That is not the fair way to do that. 
   Allow freedom of choice. If you want to stay with the current system of Social Security, you have the option to do that. But also if you want to move into a personal retirement account, be in control of your retirement and your investments and maximize those dollars, you should have the freedom of choice to do that. Today, the Government gives you no choice. Washington knows better. Washington tells you what you have to do with your retirement. Somehow Washington doesn't believe you are smart enough to plan for retirement. You might be smart enough to make the money but not smart enough to put it away for yourself. 
   Preserve the safety net. That means you have to have a net there for disability and survivor's benefits. Let's make Americans better off, not worse off. So when you retire, you are going to have at least the benefits promised, but even better if we can. My plan does that. 
   Create a fully funded system. We have proposed personal retirement accounts in the Private Security and Wealth in Retirement Act. Bottom line: No tax increases in order to do this. The easiest way is always to raise taxes. The hardest way is to make real reforms. The Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act provides for personal retirement accounts. I introduced it in the 105th Congress and last May 24. It is S. 1103; the Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act allows for personal retirement accounts. 
   The plan provides for retirement security. I think it offers better options for you. In other words, right now you have no options. The Government tells you what you are going to do. They tell you what you are going to pay in from your check. They tell you what your benefits are going to be when you retire. 
   You don't have an option on that. They also tell you at what age you can retire. They give you more options. 
   Workers under my plan would pay 10 percent of their income. Right now they are paying 12.4. That goes to Social Security. My plan would take 10 percent of your income and put it into personal retirement accounts. The other 2.4 percent we still have to collect. 
   That is part of the funding mechanism for those who wish to remain on Social Security. That 2.4 percent, plus other means of financing, is going to have to go into the current Social Security Administration in order to fund that. We are going to talk about taking 10 percent of your money and putting it into a retirement account, or a PRA, that will be managed by a government-approved private investment company. 
   Firms will set up these retirement accounts--whether it is U.S. banks, whether it is Citibank, Travelers, whether it is Lutheran Brotherhood, whether it is Norwest Bank, or whatever. They would set up these retirement accounts based on safety and soundness--such as the FDIC account in which you put your savings accounts in a bank. 
   There would be very rigid safety and soundness measures to make sure the money put into this account is going to be there when you retire. So safety and soundness is first and utmost. 
   A couple of examples: On $30,000 of income, you are putting $3,720 a year in to support Social Security. Under my plan you would put $3,000 of that into your personal retirement account, and the rest of it would then go to the Government. 
   Just to show you the difference on this, they would be taking $3,720 and putting it into Social Security and then being allowed to take $3,000 and put it into a personal retirement account based on the market and what you could then hope to receive at retirement. 
   Under this example, this is what you would do. If you made $30,000 a year for a lifetime and went to draw your benefits from Social Security, you would get about $10,668 a month. But if you could take that $3,000 and put it into a personal retirement account and get the average market return, you would have about $54,500 per year in benefits. Compare 10.6 to 54.5. That is a big difference in what retirement accounts invested in the market could do compared to pay as you go. 
   Let's take a couple of other income examples. This would be for an average income family which has $42,000 or $43,000 a year in average income. This is one spouse earning the average income in a household, one spouse not employed outside the home, a one-worker family. If you paid in a lifetime the average earnings into Social Security, you could expect to get about $29,000 a year in benefits. If you would have invested these same dollars from the personal retirement account into a private mixed stock and bond market--in other words, more conservatively and maybe not the highest returns but more conservative investments--you would get at least $66,000 in return. If you had invested in the market, you would have a return of nearly $140,000 per year compared to $30,000 a year in return. 
   Let's take the same for a two-income, low-income family with both spouses working with an average low income over their lifetime. They would get about $18,400 in benefits. But if they could put the dollars into the personal retirement 
   account and invest it in, say, the market, they could get over $100,000 a year in benefits, or about $45,000--if they put it into a mixed type and more conservative investment account. But, either way, they are still much better off. 
   The reason Albert Einstein was labeled as ``the man of the century'' by Time magazine was because Albert Einstein at one time said the most powerful force on Earth is compounded interest. 
   That is what we are trying to show, because if you are working and doing a pay-as-you-go system, you are getting $18,500. But if you use this most powerful force on Earth--compounding interest--you can see how it would compound. So your benefits would increase fivefold over your lifetime in order to draw better Social Security benefits. 
   Is this a pipe dream or is this just speculation or whatever? No. This is actual. Galveston County, TX, has a personal retirement account, as does the entire country of Chile, as does about 120 other countries in the world. Thirty other countries are doing this. 
   If you had a little history on our Social Security system, it is all based or duplicated off of one that was started in Germany in 1880. Bismarck at that time designed the system we have adopted as the model that Chile had, and many other countries. In fact, in 1880, Bismarck set the retirement age at 65 years. The average worker in Germany in 1880 was 49.5 years. When we adopted the Social Security system in this country, we set the retirement age at 65. The average life of a worker in this country was 59.5 years. 
   You can see what happened because as we have extended the life line, as people now enjoy 20-plus years of healthy retirement. The system was never designed to do that. That is why so many limits are being placed on it. 
   Let's look at Galveston County, TX, and how the employees there are reaping the benefits of a private retirement account instead of Social Security. 
   In about 1980, one of the administrators in Galveston County saw the loophole in the law. At that time, if you were a public employee and you already had a retirement system, you did not have to join Social Security. You could remain with your own private retirement account. 
   By the way, the President's plan to reform Social Security is to make sure that all those accounts are closed, and everybody would be drawing from Social Security. 
   But in Galveston County, they saw this loophole and opted out of Social Security, although the Government quickly closed that door so nobody else could. But that is what happened in Galveston County over the last 20 years. 
   According to today's schedules, under Social Security a death benefit is $253. 
   My father died at the age of 61. For all of the money he paid in over his lifetime, when he passed away his heirs received $253. That was all. In Galveston County the minimum death benefit is $75,000. 
   Disability benefits per month, if you are disabled under Social Security,  total about $1,280. In Galveston County, the disability benefits are $2,750 a month. 
   Retirement benefits per month: Social Security--again, currently we are basing this on average income--$1,280 a month would be about the best you could get out of Social Security. 
   In Galveston County, you are at nearly $4,800 a month--nearly four times greater in benefits in Galveston County than if you are on Social Security today. 
   There was a young woman who wrote an editorial to the Wall Street Journal about 2 years ago. Her husband passed away suddenly of a heart attack at 44. She was 42. They had three children. She received the death benefit, plus the benefits she receives from Social Security and from her private retirement account, which allows her to maintain her home. If she had been on Social Security, her family would have been in poverty with the payments she would have gotten. Today, she can maintain the home as she did before. In the article, all she could say was: Thank God for Galveston County and the system they have. 
   What about moving to this new retirement account? If we move to the personal retirement account, somebody 45 years old would say: I have worked now for 40 years. What happened to all that money I paid into Social Security? What am I going to do? I can't afford to lose that--although you hear some people say: You can keep everything I have paid in; let me out of the system. 
   We have said those are dollars the Government has collected with the promise of paying you benefits. We know exactly how much we have collected in Washington from you for Social Security. If it is $20,000, we would give you a $20,000 recognition bond. That would be deposited into your private account. Adjusted for inflation and interest over the years, you could then cash this bond when you are 65, because that is the way everything is based right now. If it is $30,000, you get a $30,000 bond. If it is $44,220, we would give you that as a recognition bond. But it would be one of your options to say: I am going to have this credited to my account, and then I am going to begin my personal retirement system. 
   Again, taking care of today's Social Security recipients means that if an individual chooses to remain within the current system, the Government should and will guarantee the benefits--no age increase, no reduction in benefits, no tax increase, no ifs, ands, or buts. 
   If one decides to stay within the current system, this is what to expect your government to do at the minimum, to guarantee your benefits, and not hear 5 or 20 years from now: I am sorry, we don't have the funds; we will have to reduce your benefits. 
   We need to rely on this in order to make sure the system is well. 
   Preserving the safety net is my plan. The Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act preserves the safety net for disadvantaged Americans, so that no covered person is forced to live in poverty. Today, poverty is recognized at about $8,240. My plan says workers cannot retire with less than 150 percent of poverty. They have to have income of at least $12,400--that is what workers receive in retirement. 
   We don't want anybody retiring in poverty. In fact, today about 18 to 20 percent of Americans who retire--mostly women--retire into poverty. We think we should have at least a safety net. Retirees have to have at least 150 percent in order to retire so they don't go into poverty. 
   Funds that manage PRAs are required to buy life and disability insurance to cover those minimum benefits. As with Social Security today, they are the safety nets for survivor and disability benefits, as I showed earlier with Galveston benefits. The Federal Government will make up the difference for those who fall short of the minimum benefits. 
   Perhaps someone has been in and out of the workforce or doesn't have enough money in that account, or they have had a minimum-wage job all their life and they cannot come up with the money to buy an annuity to pay the $12,400 a year. For those individuals, which we believe is a very small percentage, the Government will, in the only part that is any kind of entitlement or involvement by the Government at all, fill that glass full so benefits are paid. 
   Perhaps a worker only had the dollars to buy an $11,000 benefit plan. The Government would put in the additional dollars to make sure when they retire their minimum benefit would be $12,400 a year. 
   Providing a safety net and soundness: The rules are similar to those who apply to today's IRAs or 401(k)s and would apply to personal retirement accounts, as well. As banks operate under very strict rules of safety and soundness, the same type of rules are applied to the personal retirement accounts to make sure the money in their account is going to be there at retirement, don't worry about it. 
   By the way, workers can't invest their money into a gold mine that evaporates and then be left with no retirement benefits. Again, this is the safety net, the Government-sponsored plan, to guarantee retirement benefits so you are not a ward of the State, you have the wherewithal to pay your way in retirement. 
   Now, workers can still have other IRAs, other savings accounts, they can still have a stock portfolio. Only this narrow area will have the safety net or the Government set-aside to make sure individuals have a retirement. 
   Investment companies that manage PRAs are required to have an insurance plan to ensure at least a minimum of a 2 1/2 percent return on each account. That is not much, but compare that to today's less than 2 percent and a growing number of less than zero in 20 or 30 years. This maintains at least a floor for the return on your investment. That also would be written into the 
   law. 
   Workers decide when to retire and when to withdraw their retirement. As I said earlier, today workers don't have the choice or the options; they have to do what the Federal Government says. They cannot retire until they reach a certain age. Benefits are determined by the Federal Government. The Government says what each person is going to receive as a benefit. They have decided over the years what your contributions to this package has been. 
   With our retirement plan, when one can buy an annuity to provide income of 150 percent of poverty, anyone can retire anytime once that obligation is met. Once you have met the obligation to be able to buy an annuity that pays at least 150 percent of poverty, anyone can retire, or stop paying into the system and use that 10 percent of income to do what you want, use it for other investments, or spend it. Once an individual has met the threshold, they do not become a ward of a State. Anyone can arrange regular, periodic withdrawals of money in the account. 
   An individual 21 today making an average income--about $42,000 a year today--their whole life, tucking away those dollars, would have about $1.5 million in a bank account when they decided to retire. Annuities cost about $100,000 per $1,000 a month of annuity. If one buys an annuity to pay $1,300, one needs $130,000 in order to buy that annuity today. That leaves $1.27 million left in the bank account, in the savings account. You can do whatever you want with that. You can take out periodic withdrawals; you can take a trip to Europe, and write a check to do it. This is your money, not the Government's money. 
   An individual can withdraw the portion of the PRA that is above the minimum retirement benefits, free of income taxes and earning tests. All of these dollars placed into the retirement accounts are taxed before we put them in, as they are today. 
   I don't know if many realize this, but the Government taxes everyone on the Social Security moneys that taxpayers put into the Social Security system today. It is taxed before the Government takes it out of their check. We do the same. The Government today, when an individual withdraws Social Security, much of that is exposed to additional Federal taxes, and it could be exposed to even more taxes as part of an estate. We are saying, once you have it in the account, it is your money tax free. 
   More choices for families with PRAs. In divorce cases, they are treated as community property. Upon death, PRA benefits go to the heirs, without estate taxes. There are no taxes. If you pass away with $1.2 million in your account, that goes to your heirs when you die, not like when my father passed away.  There was nothing after a lifetime of investment into Social Security except a $253 death benefit. 
   Under this plan, all the money remaining in the account goes to heirs--your children, your spouse, your church, wherever desired. That is what happens: Build up an estate that can be passed on to the next generation. 
   Workers may arrange PRAs for nonworking children, with workers able to put up to 20 percent of their income. We say now a minimum of 10 percent, with an option of up to 20 percent can be put into their own account. 
   If one wants to retire at 55, put more money in to make sure you have enough to buy this minimum retirement benefit. Do it quicker and retire earlier. Do what you want, or put it into the account for nonworking children. A parent with five children could put 10 percent aside for himself and 2 percent in each child's account. This gives your children a headstart on retirement benefits. 
   To demonstrate how this money mounts up, by placing $1,000 into an average account when a child is born, by the time that child reaches 65, that $1,000 would be worth nearly $250,000 with just that one investment into the retirement account. For grandparents, that is a good gift for grandchildren. That shows how it can grow. Additional accounts for children give a real leg up on their retirement benefits in the future. 
   No new taxes. Bottom line, we say we do not want to raise taxes. There are things we need to do to finance this transition. As I said, there is $20 trillion in unfunded liabilities out there. Somebody has to pay that. We have made the commitment to them. The question is, How do we do that over the next 70 years so we do not put a tremendous strain on any one generation? As I said, in the next 25 or 30 years alone, we could put a strain on our children or grandchildren of up to a 70-percent tax rate in order to support the system if we don't make some changes now. 
   Again, what this all means, the bottom line, is retirement income will be there for all, whether one decides to stay within the current Social Security system--that is a choice, if that is what you want to do--or whether one chooses to build a personal retirement account. Again, there is a choice. Individuals don't have to do what Washington says; you can have a choice in what you want to do. Citizens can decide which retirement options work for them. 
   How do you want to do this? When the dollars are taken from your check, as they are today, deducted from Social Security, when the dollars are taken from you, you dedicate where you want the dollars to be sent, which retirement fund is going to handle your dollars--whether it be Citibank, Lutheran Brotherhood, Norwest, or whatever it might be. You decide where the dollars go. It goes into your account. 
   Also, you can tell that account holder: I want 65 percent in the market; I want 35 percent in Government bonds and securities. You can do that. Each individual has control over how the investments are handled. 
   Any person visiting the country of Chile, just ride in a taxicab and ask the cabdriver: How much do you have in your retirement account? He will pull out a retirement account passbook and state to the penny how much he has in the retirement account. That is his money. 
   They do not have their hands on it anymore. This takes Social Security out of the control of Washington and it puts it into the people's control. They make the decisions of what to do and how to build their retirement. 
   Everybody is different. Families are different. Everybody's hopes and expectations are different. Right now, Washington gives us that cookie-cutter, one system, and that is it. Our plan gives all the options so the American people can provide and create a retirement system they want. 
   With a PRA, an average Minnesotan could receive at least three times their current projected Social Security income, at least, and some of the projections go as high as 5, 6, maybe even 10 percent. 
   The bottom line is, the system is under tremendous strain and we are going to have to do something to protect retirement benefits in this country. The question is, What type of retirement system do we want to leave our children and our grandchildren? 
   Again, there are going to be those out there and some on the campaign trail today for President who are going to be talking about maintaining the status quo. In other words, let's put a Band-Aid over this cancer, let's raise taxes a little bit, and we will get by for a while. When that Band-Aid is pulled off, that cancer is going to be even worse than it is today. 
   We have an opportunity today to make a decision that is going to be better for retirement; in other words, it is going to cost less and there will be less pain in the transition. The longer we wait, it is going to be harder and more costly to make any kind of decision. We need to do this soon. 
   Are we going to get it done this year? No, there is not 
   enough time this year to do it. It should be on the front burner when we come back in the 107th Congress in 2001, with a new President and the next Congress. It should be one of the first items we should look at: How are we going to save and support future retirement for our kids and grandchildren in the future. 
   I am 52 years old today, but I have very few options. I might be stuck with the plan we have today because by the time we implement it, I will be 55, 56 years old. At that time, will I have the option to move into personal retirement accounts? Maybe not. 
   We have to give our children and grandchildren at least the option to provide a better retirement for themselves than what we have today. For many people on retirement, if they are getting $800 a month and they think that is great, maybe that is what they want their grandchildren to have. But if they have retirement benefits three or four times that, I think that is an option to give our children and grandchildren. 
   I hope to talk about this again in the near future. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a very important bill I introduced yesterday. My Save Our Surplus, or S.O.S. legislation would lock in every penny of the $23 billion non-Social Security surplus which materialized in FY 2000 and return it to working Americans in the form of debt reduction, tax relief and structural Social Security and Medicare reform. 
   The reason for this legislation is simple: Last year the Congress adopted my amendment in the budget resolution to set up a reserve fund for any non-Social Security surplus for tax relief. 
   Unfortunately, this provision in the budget resolution was completely ignored in the appropriation process. As a result, we ended up spending every penny of the project $14 billion on-budget surplus. 
   The Congressional Budget Office estimated early this year that, Thanks to our strong economy, we would have an even higher $23 billion on-budget surplus in the current fiscal year despite that spending spree. 
   Mr. President, this $23 billion non-Social Security surplus does not fall from the sky. It is working Americans who generated the surplus--not Congress, not the President, but Americans' hard work. 
   In fact, hard working Americans have created a strong economy that has turned the ink in Washington's accounting book black for the first time in 40 years. The budget surplus above and beyond Social Security will top $1.9 trillion over the next 10 years. 
   Clearly, the reason we have a surplus is the result of the hard work of working men and women of this country. Washington should not be the first in the line to spend this surplus. 
   Mr. President, the budget surplus above and beyond the Social Security surplus is tax overpayments and should be returned to taxpayers in the form of tax relief, debt reduction and Social Security reform. 
   If we don't return the tax overcharges to the taxpayers in these ways, Washington will spend it all, leaving nothing for tax relief, debt reduction or the vitally important task of preserving Social Security. Last year's appropriations spending has proven my fears are well founded. 
   President Clinton has already proposed spending nearly all of this surplus, and both Chambers of the Congress are preparing to add even more to the President's request in this year's supplemental spending bill. 
   This is not right. Last year's discretionary spending was already increased by over 5 percent, twice the rate of inflation. If Congress spends this additional $23 billion surplus, discretionary spending will increase by over 9 percent. If there is a Supplemental, it should be fully offset by spending reduction. 
   President Clinton also proposes to ``correct the gimmicks'' in the FY 2000 Appropriations bills by shifting payment dates from FY 2001 back to FY 2000, lifting restrictions on obligations, and reversing advance funding. 
   Mr. President, I was the one that spoke repeatedly on the Senate floor last year in strong opposition to budget gimmickry. However, changing the gimmicks now would have the effect of increasing discretionary and mandatory spending in FY 2000 by $10 billion while also allowing for spending to increase in FY 2001 by a corresponding amount. 
   Mr. President, two wrongs don't make a right. Let's leave FY 2000 spending the way it is and pledge to stop the gimmicks this year. 
   The last thing we should do is to spend tax overpayments to enlarge the government. If we cannot give working Americans a tax refund this year due to President Clinton's veto of our tax relief bill, we at least should dedicate this on-budget surplus to reduction of the national debt. 
   It is true that our short-term fiscal situation has improved greatly due to the continued growth of our economy. However, our long-term financial imbalance still poses a major threat to the health of our future economic security. 
   We must also recall that Americans have long been overtaxed, and millions of middle-class families cannot even make ends meet due to the growing tax burden. They still call for major relief. That's why we passed nearly $800 billion in tax relief for them. But President Clinton denied them the tax refund they deserve. 
   FY 2000's spending is the worst example of fiscal irresponsibility. Washington spent far more than it should have. But what concerns me is that if we continue this dangerous trend by spending this $23 billion additional surplus for FY 2000, we will push the spending baseline even higher, leaving an even smaller on-budget surplus for our 5-year or 10-years tax relief or for debt reduction. 
   I understand that we do have emergency spending needs each year. I support true emergency spending, such as disaster relief or agricultural crisis relief. But I believe we should, and can, meet these challenges by prioritizing and streamlining government programs to offset this new spending while maintaining fiscal discipline. 
   Again, my point is, Mr. President, that this non-Social Security surplus is  nothing but tax over-payments. It is the American taxpayers' money and it should be returned in the form of debt reduction, tax relief or Social Security reform. 
   If we don't give the non-Social Security surplus back to the taxpayers in these ways, Washington will soon spend it all. Such spending will only expand the government, making it even more expensive to support in the future, creating an even higher tax burden than working Americans bear today and a higher federal budget. 
   I join Chairman Alan Greenspan who has been advocating using surplus for debt reduction and tax relief rather than increasing government spending. 
   My S.O.S. legislation would achieve this goal by creating a new point of order against any legislation reducing the FY 2000 non-Social Security surplus if it is not used for debt reduction, tax relief or structural Social Security and Medicare reform.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today in support of S. 1134. I would like to make a couple of brief remarks as we consider this very important piece of legislation, the Affordable Education Act. This is a bill that would expand the right for parents to save money for their children's education without incurring a tax liability. Very simply, allowing parents to put some money aside to help their children's education, and do it without incurring tax liability, is a win-win situation. 
   The proposed new education savings account would allow families to contribute up to $2,000 per year in a savings account for a variety of public or private education-related expenses. Current law allows parents to save up to $500 per year for their children's college education without penalty. However, the expanded education savings accounts would allow parents to save more tax-free, and the money could also be used for children's kindergarten through 12th grade education expenses as well as college. These education savings accounts help working families, and deserve the support of this body. 
   I would like to provide a Minnesota perspective on this debate, because we can learn from what has happened in my home state with a similar education initiative. S. 1134 is similar to a tax break for working families instituted in Minnesota by former Governor Arne Carlson. 
   Governor Carlson and grassroots organizations in Minnesota fought for and won an education tax credit, enacted in 1997, which, like Mr. COVERDELL's bill, can be used by parents to offset the cost of certain expenses made in the education of K-12 students in public, private or home schools. Thanks to Governor Carlson's initiative, low and moderate income families in Minnesota can receive up to a $1,000 per child tax credit for qualifying expenses such as tutoring, after-school or summer academic programs, music lessons, textbooks, and instructional materials--to allow the children these educational opportunities. Families with higher incomes are not eligible for the tax credit, but can still claim a tax deduction for similar education expenses.  
   When the legislation was proposed, various polls rated support for the tax credit and tax deduction package between 58 percent and 72 percent of the population of Minnesota. They supported this concept. Support for the tax credit and deduction has remained. In 1999, the law was expanded to raise the income threshold for eligibility for the tax credit to permit even more families to participate. The 1999 bill to expand the tax credit eligibility was passed with bipartisan support--in fact, you could even call it ``tripartisan'' support, since Governor Ventura signed it into law. About 150,000 families are expected to take advantage of the tax credit and deduction this year. 
   So in Minnesota, families have simultaneously been provided real tax relief and real opportunities to expand the education opportunities for children. And 3 years after the initiative was passed into law, the sky has not fallen in Minnesota, it is not a mortal wound to public education--in fact it helps students in public schools as well as private schools--and again, it became popular enough that the legislative subsequently expanded eligibility for the tax credit. 
   Today in the Senate, we have the opportunity to enact similar legislation that helps parents help save money to ensure that their children will get a quality education. Parents should always be in the driver's seat when it comes to education decisions, and this bill simply empowers them to do more to help their kids get ahead. S. 1134 deserves our support. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Boy Scouts of America on the occasion of the 90th anniversary of its founding. 
   From its beginning in 1911, the Boy Scouts has grown in size to more than five million active members in 1999. In the 90 years since its origination, the Boy Scouts has influenced more than 100 million boys, young men, and women. Minnesota scouting officials estimate that in my home state, more than 100,000 young people participate in the program today. 
   Using goal setting and team building, Boy Scouts develop skills to overcome obstacles through trial and error. Whether earning their next merit badge or learning how to properly interact with the environment, Boy Scouts are able to translate what they have learned through the program into their families, churches, and communities. 
   Let me also take a moment to commend the almost 500,000 adult volunteers, including 24,000 Minnesotans, who serve as leaders for the Boy Scouts. Both men and women serve the Boy Scouts in various capacities ranging from unit leaders to merit badge counselors. The Boy Scouts of America would certainly not be possible if it were not for the efforts of these stalwart volunteers. 
   Although times have changed, fads come and go, the Boy Scouts continue to be an effective tool in training our nation's youth. Through the Scouts' core values of helping other people at all times and keeping themselves physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight, scouts impact our communities in many ways. Students who have been through the Boy Scout program and have adopted these values as their own are needed now more than ever before. 
   Over the years, the Boy Scouts have produced many of the country's most respected civic, professional, and community leaders. Right here in the Senate, 66 of my fellow colleagues have served as a scout, a leader, or in some cases, both. With all that the Boy Scouts have done for our country, I hope its next 90 years will be as productive as these first 90 have been. 
   On this 90th anniversary of the founding of the Boy Scouts of America, I wish my very best to the Boy Scouts, not only in Minnesota, but to Scouts across our great Nation.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize February as American Heart Month. As its sponsoring organization, the American Heart Association (AHA) plays a major role in advocacy at both the national and local levels through activities to increase public awareness of health concerns. Their messages this month is ``Be an American Heartsaver! Know the warning signs of heart attack. Call 9-1-1. Give CPR.'' 
   These three simple steps are aimed at reducing the number of lives lost every day--nearly 700--because the victims were unable to reach a hospital in time. The harsh fact is that cardiovascular diseases are the number one killer of men and women. In 1997, 34 percent of deaths from cardiovascular disease occurred prematurely, before the victims reached age 75. In total, more than 953,000 deaths were due to cardiovascular disease in 1997; 47 percent of those victims were women and 53 percent men. 
   During American Heart Month, thousands of AHA volunteers across the country canvass neighborhoods to raise funds and provide educational information about cardiovascular diseases and stroke. This is where the AHA makes its mark through its steadfast pursuit to reduce disability and death from cardiovascular diseases and stroke. By educating the American public about the early warnings signs of heart attacks and stroke, the members and volunteers of the AHA know that individuals will be better prepared to save themselves--and others around them.  
   The AHA has produced educational kits for Americans of all ages. Accordingly to the AHA, helping children understand the early warning signs of heart problems can have a tremendous impact when their family is concerned. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation classes provide Americans, regardless of their age, with the tools to assist in cardiac emergencies. 
   With the many advances medical science has experienced, the list of measures we can take in prevention of cardiovascular disease continues to grow. Controlling high blood pressure and cholesterol, becoming active through regular exercise, and stopping smoking are some of the easiest steps to reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease. 
   The AHA has emphasized these measures in the hopes of reducing cardiovascular disease, stroke, and the risk of these diseases by 25 percent over the next eight years. In addition, the AHA runs an Active Partnership program for cardiac patients to help them take responsibility for reducing their cardiovascular risks in the future. 
   My state of Minnesota has long been on the frontline of health care and a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study released last week indicated Minnesota as having the lowest occurrence of cardiovascular disease among women nationwide. We must continue to reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular disease in Minnesota, but the study suggests we are already heading in the right direction. 
   As American Heart Month comes to a close, I commend the American Heart Association and its army of volunteers for putting their hearts to work to see that the hearts of others continue to beat a little bit longer and a little bit stronger. They join a long list of health care-related organizations, professionals, and industries making Minnesota a healthier place to live.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to those men and women who have made the world we live in a better place through advances in engineering. Since 1951, the week that includes George Washington's birthday has been dedicated as National Engineers Week (EWeek) to increase public awareness and appreciation of the engineering profession and technology. Our first president began his career with agricultural, military, and land surveying skills leading to his later recognition as the nation's ``first engineer.'' 
   Last year's EWeek summit on ``The Business of Diversity'' gathered more than 100 business, government, and engineering leaders in Washington to find ways to increase the number of women and minorities in today's engineering workforce. This year, February 20-26 will be filed with activities designed by engineers for future engineers. Through national and local activities, students, women, and minorities are the focus of a campaign designed to interest them in a future in engineering. 
   ``Discover E'' is a program in which engineers visit K-12 classrooms to answer questions and interact with students in designing and building small projects. The Future City Competition is for seventh and eight grade students, and the National Engineering Design Challenge is a high school program involving teams of students, teachers, and engineer mentors. All of these activities are geared toward introducing students in an interactive, hands-on way to engineering basics and open their eyes to the engineering inventions that are part of their daily lives. 
   Hundreds of 3M engineers in Minneapolis/St. Paul and throughout the country will visit local schools. In Minneapolis, 3M is organizing a reception involving some of the minority engineering student groups at the University of Minnesota and other local colleges. There, 3M engineers will talk about career planning and other experiences. Also in Minneapolis, The Works, a museum for the entire family, makes learning about technology interesting, understandable, and fun. The Works was created in 1995 with many hands-on, minds-on exhibits about technology centered on kids ages 5-15. 
   Schools have traditionally focused their teachings on the body of scientific knowledge, oftentimes neglecting the process of discovery that engineers use to help create new advances for our modern world. With the support of sponsors like 3M and NASA, programs during EWeek integrate this process of discovery and the use of technology into mathematics, science, language arts, and other topics. I am a strong supporter of exposing our children to the world around them and hope this awareness will get them involved and spark their interest in the future of engineering. 
   EWeek also recognizes the countless engineers who have influenced nearly every aspect of our lives as a result of their dedicated work and the numerous technological advances they inspired. These contributions were honored at a luncheon in Washington on February 22 naming the 20 Greatest Engineering Achievements of the 20th Century. The winners were chosen for their impact on the quality of life in the 20th Century, and range from the harnessing of electricity to computer, telephones, and even air conditioning. 
   These are just a few of the many events planned across America this week to urge today's youth from all backgrounds to consider a career in engineering. As someone who, early in my career, worked for an engineering firm, I appreciate this effort tremendously. I wish to send out my thanks to everyone who helps make the EWeek events possible, and the field of engineering exciting and entertaining.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a man who spent the first 36 years of his life as a Minnesotan, an artist who through his work--and his work ethic--illustrated the values cherished by the people of my state, and the dreams, ambitions, and even aggravations of nearly everybody else. 
   Today, I pay tribute to Charles M. Schulz. 
   The ``Peanuts'' comic strip that ran in newspapers worldwide on February 13 was meant as a good-bye from the cartoonist to his creation and a thank-you to its legions of fans. Instead, it turned out to be a fitting farewell to the cartoonist himself when Charles Schulz passed away the day before its publication. 
   Mr. President, I regret that I never had the privilege of meeting Charles Schulz, but I felt like I knew him anyway. That is a sentiment the artist understood. ``If you want to know me, ready my comic strip,'' he would say to inquiring journalists. So, the journalists did, along with much of the rest of the planet. 
   At its peak popularity, ``Peanuts'' was published in more than 2,600 newspapers in 20 languages in 75 countries, and had 350 million daily readers. 
   The artist's observations on life from a child's point of view were internationally acclaimed. Charles Schulz twice won comic art's highest honor. He was named International Cartoonist of the Year. Adaptations of his work garnered Emmy and Tonay Awards, even the prestigious Peabody Award. 
   Today, Charlie Brown and his companions can be found everywhere *.*.* populating Camp Snoopy at the Mall of America, starring in books, TV shows, movies, and on the Broadway stage, and gracing everything from pencils and backpacks to sheets, shoelaces, and greeting cards. 
   All this from a private man who was most content in letting has art speak for itself. 
   Charles Schulz was quite simply the best, most honored, and most beloved cartoonist of the entire 20th century. Success, however, never diminished the enthusiasm he brought to his work or his passion for doing it right; up until the day he retired, he insisted on drawing, lettering, and coloring every frame of every cartoon panel himself. 
   ``Why do musicians compose symphonies and poets write poems?'' he once asked. ``The do it because life wouldn't have any meaning for them if they did not. That is why I draw cartoons.'' 
   What most ``Peanuts'' fans--at least those outside of Minnesota--probably do not know is how Charles Schulz came to be a cartoonist. Well, that story begins in the Twin Cities. 
   Charles Monroe Schulz was born in Minneapolis on November 26, 1922, although he spent the majority of his youth across the river in St. Paul. An only child, he grew up in an apartment on the corner of Selby and Snelling Avenues, above the Family Barbershop owned and operated by his father.  Charles Schulz went by the nickname ``Sparky,'' a tribute from his comic-loving father to another popular comic strip character of the day. The young boy's interest in cartooning first took hold about the time Charles was six, and was spurred after his graduation from St. Paul Central High by a correspondence course ad that read ``Do you like to draw?'' His parents paid the $170 tuition in installments, although they may have questioned their investment when the class on drawing children netted Charles a grade of just C-plus. 
   After serving as an army tailgunner in Europe, Charles Schulz returned to Minnesota and earned his first paycheck as a cartoonist by working on a Catholic magazine feature. He also taught art, and sold 15 cartoons to the Saturday Evening Post. He created his first feature for the St. Paul Pioneer Press in 1947. ``L'il Folks'' was brought in 1950 by United Feature Syndicate, christened with a new name, and Charlie Brown and ``Peanuts'' debuted on October 2 in seven newspapers. Two days later, Snoopy was introduced to the world. 
   A phenomenon was born. 
   More than a few books, college theses, and critical essays have tried to dissect the popularity of ``Peanuts.'' Maybe Charles Schultz himself had the best answer when in a 1994 speech he said, ``There is still a market for things that are clean and decent.'' 
   I have always thought that the ``Peanuts'' gang endured because the characters were so strongly developed and so genuine that we saw something we could identify with in each of them. 
   Snoopy was the dreamer, persistently stradding his doghouse in pursuit of the Red Baron. 
   Lucy, dispensing nickel douses of pop psychology, took great pride in her crabbiness. 
   Woodstock was the accident prone one. 
   Peppermint Patty struggled in the classroom, but never struggled on the baseball field. 
   Linus made it all right for us to need a security blanket from time to time. 
   Sally, the loveable younger sister, wanted to believe in Santa Claus and the Great Pumpkin. 
   Schroeder was the unapologetic artist who loved his music. 
   Pig Pen*.*.* well, I think we all know a Pig Pen. 
   And Charlie Brown, ``the little round-headed kid,'' was Everyman. We relate to him because at some point in our lives, we all pined for a little red-haired girl *.*.* were menaced by a kite-Eating Tree *.*.* and faced down a football we were certain would be snatched away at the last moment. Charle Brown's perpetually upbeat search for happiness was our search, too. 
   ``As a youngster, I didn't realize how many Charlie Browns there were in the world.'' Charles Schulz said. ``I thought I was the only one. Now I realize that Charlie Brown's goofs are familiar to everybody, children and adults alike.'' No wonder he considered Charlie Brown his alter ago. ``There is a lot of myself in his character, too,'' he said. 
   In his art, Charles Schulz could be tender, insightful, sometimes sarcastic, heartbreaking, hilarious, and occasionally sentimental. Always, his work was centered in a deep spirituality. Though it occasionally drove his fans mad, there was a practical reason why his comics were frequently tinged with pathos. In his 1980 book, ``Charlie Brown, Snoopy and Me,'' the artist wrote, ``You can't create humor out of happiness. I'm astonished at the number of people who write to me saying, `Why can't you create happy stories for us? Why does Charlie Brown always have to lose? Why can't you let him kick the football?' Well, there is nothing funny about the person who gets to kick the football.'' 
   Mr. President, I am proud to co-sponsor legislation offered by my colleague from California, Senator FEINSTEIN, to award Charles Schulz the Congressional Gold Medal. I am pleased our colleagues in the House have already adopted this resolution. While I wish we had accorded the cartoonist this great honor in his lifetime, I know that Charles Schulz did not need the endorsement of this Congress to be fulfilled in his work, for how can a congressional honor compare with the love shown to him by his millions of faithful fans? 
   Minnesotans have always considered Charles Schulz one of us, even though he eventually moved to Santa Rosa, California, where he made his home with his wife Jeannie. He was blessed with five children, two stepchildren, and several grandchildren, and our prayers are with them all. 
   Mr. President, Charles Schulz fretted that his work as a cartoonist would never be considered great art and would certainly not stand the test of time. 
   With all due respect to the cartoonist I honor today, my two-word response to that is ``Good grief!'' Charlie Brown will undoubtedly live on long after the rest of us are forgotten. And that, I would argue, is exactly the way things are supposed to be.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to express my support for an amendment I was planning to offer, along with Senators SNOWE, COLLINS, and JEFFORDS, to strike the so-called take title provision from S. 1287. I thank Chairman MURKOWSKI for including this in his substitute. We are withholding offering that amendment. 
   For as long as I have been in the Senate, I have argued that the Department of Energy has a legal responsibility to remove nuclear waste from my home State of Minnesota. We all know the DOE was obligated to begin removing waste from civilian nuclear reactors by January 31, 1998. Sadly, the DOE virtually ignored that date and instead has engaged in a protracted struggle to dodge any responsibility it might have to our Nation's ratepayers. 
   As everyone in this Chamber knows, Washington's involvement in nuclear power is not new. Since the 1950s Atoms for Peace Program, the Federal Government has promoted nuclear energy in part by promising to remove radioactive waste from powerplants. Congress decisively committed the Federal Government to take and dispose of civilian radioactive waste beginning in 1998 through the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and its amendments in 1987. It has been on record for 18 years, a mandate by the Congress, to do this. 
   These acts established the DOE Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management to conduct that program. It selected Yucca Mountain, NV, as the site to assess for the permanent disposal facility. It also established fees of a tenth of a cent per kilowatt hour on nuclear-generated electricity, and it provided that those fees would be deposited into the nuclear waste fund. 
   Furthermore, it authorized appropriations from this fund for a number of activities, including development of a nuclear waste repository. 
   Eventually, publication of the standard contract addressed how radioactive waste would be taken, stored, and disposed. The DOE then signed individual contracts with all civilian nuclear utilities promising to take and dispose of civilian high-level waste beginning on January 31, 1998. The DOE signed contracts to do this. 
   Other administrative proceedings, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's waste confidence rule, told the American public they should literally bank on the Federal Government's promises. 
   This point needs to be clearly understood by the Members of this body. Our Nation's nuclear utilities did not go out and invest in nuclear power in spite of Federal Government warnings of future difficulties. Instead, they were encouraged by the Federal Government to turn to nuclear power to meet our increasing energy demands. Utilities and States were told to move forward with investments in nuclear technologies because it is a sound source of energy production, and the Federal Government's support for nuclear power was based on some very sound considerations. 
   First, nuclear power is environmentally friendly. Nothing is burned in a nuclear reactor, so there are no emissions released in the atmosphere. In fact, nuclear energy is responsible for over 90 percent of the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that have come out of the energy industry since 1973. Between 1973 and 1996, nuclear power accounted for emissions reductions of 34.6 million tons of nitrogen oxide and 80.2 million tons of sulfur dioxide. 
   Second, nuclear power is a reliable baseload source of power. Families, farmers, businesses, and individuals who are served by nuclear power are served by one of the most reliable sources of electricity. 
   Third, nuclear energy is a home-grown technology, and the United States led the way in its development. We have long been 
   the world leader in nuclear technology and continue to be the world's largest nuclear-producing country. Using nuclear power increases our energy security. 
   Finally, much of the world recognizes those same values and promotes the use of nuclear power, again, because of its reliability, because of its environmental benefits, and its value to energy independence. For those reasons, the Federal Government threw one more bone to our Nation's utilities. It said: If you build nuclear power, we will take care of your nuclear waste, we will build a repository, and we will take it out of your State. Again, they told the public: You can bank on those promises by the Federal Government. 
   In response to those promises, States across the country took the Federal Government at its word. It allowed civilian nuclear energy production to move forward. 
   As we all know, ratepayers agreed to share some of the responsibilities but were promised some things in return. They agreed to pay a fee attached to their energy bill in exchange for an assurance that the Federal Government meet its responsibility to manage any waste storage facilities. 
   Because of those promises and measures taken by the Federal Government, ratepayers have now paid roughly $16 billion, including interest, into the nuclear waste fund. Today, these payments continue, exceeding $600 million annually or about $70,000 for every hour for every day of the year. For the ratepayers of Minnesota, these contributions have claimed over $300 million of their hard-earned money since the creation of the nuclear waste fund. 
   In summary, the Federal Government promoted nuclear power, utilities agreed to invest in nuclear power, States agreed to host nuclear powerplants, and the ratepayers assumed the responsibility of investing into the long-term storage of nuclear waste. Still nuclear waste is stranded on the banks of the Mississippi River in Minnesota and on countless other sites across the country because the Department of Energy has a very short-term memory and this administration has virtually no sense of responsibility-- 
   --let me say that again--because the Department of Energy has a very short-term memory and this administration has virtually no sense of responsibility. 
   Now we can all argue all day long on the floor of this Chamber on the merits of nuclear power. But we cannot stand here on the Senate floor and deny that the Federal Government promoted nuclear power and that the Federal Government promised to take care of nuclear waste. 
   Taking title to the waste does not fulfill that promise. 
   Unfortunately, if the DOE is allowed to take title to nuclear waste at the plant site, I can't provide the ratepayers of my State with any reason to believe the waste will eventually be moved. 
   Allowing the DOE to take title to waste and to leave it at the reactor site is an invitation to even more ratepayer abuse at the hands of the Department of Energy. I think the record of the DOE has shown that this administration would much rather leave waste where it is than move it to a centralized storage facility. 
   A number of my colleagues in the Senate have suggested the same thing. I don't believe that is a good policy, nor is it the policy in which the ratepayers of Minnesota have so generously invested--again, not only in Minnesota but across this country. 
   I met yesterday with Minnesota's Commerce Commissioner, Steve Minn. He made it very clear to me that for States, the most objectionable aspect of this bill is the take title provision. He indicated that the provision is viewed with extreme skepticism by the State of Minnesota. 
   I understand why. 
   I know Senator MURKOWSKI has read from the letter the Governors, along with Governor Ventura of Minnesota, have written and sent to President Clinton dealing with this problem. It says:  
   We governors from states hosting commercial nuclear power plants and from affected  states express our opposition to the plan proposed by Energy Secretary Richardson in his February 1999 testimony before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Secretary Richardson proposes that the Department of Energy take title, assume management responsibility and pay costs at nuclear plant sites for used nuclear fuel it was legally and contractually obligated to begin removing in January 1998.  
   The Department of Energy says: Oh, we'll pay for it. But where are they going to get the money? They are going to take it from the ratepayers or the taxpayers. So basically this is a punt by the Department of Energy--again, not committed to those contracts that it signed with all the States.  
   This proposed plan would create semi-permanent, federally controlled, used nuclear fuel facilities in each of our states.  
   This letter states some of the objections by the Governors:  
   This plan abridges states rights--it constitutes federal takings and establishes new nuclear waste facilities outside of state authority and control.  
   The Governors went on to say, in their objection to the take title provision offered by Secretary Richardson of the Department of Energy:  
   The new waste facilities would likely become de facto permanent disposal sites [some 100 sites across the country]. Federal action over the last 50 years has not been able to solve the political problems associated with developing disposal for used nuclear fuel. Establishing these federal sites will remove the political motivation to complete a final disposal site.  
   The Governors across the states that are affected are very concerned. Again, I understand why. 
   Quite reasonably, States don't want to see the Federal Government take up permanent residence at these waste sites. It is the nuclear waste equivalent to having the fox guard the hen house. 
   Allowing the Federal Government control of waste sites removes a State's oversight role. It removes the State's authority and control over these sites and it does not--I underline that--it does not remove waste from Minnesota or any other State. 
   In closing, I ask my colleagues to listen to the Governors of our States and to vote to remove the take title provision from this legislation, in other words, support Chairman MURKOWSKI's substitute. 
   With this bill, we need to lock in transportation provisions, protect the ratepayers from increases in their contribution, facilitate a constructive resolution to the radiation standard dispute, and also advance the goal of completing a national repository for the permanent storage of nuclear waste. 
   We do not need to provide the DOE with an excuse to leave waste stranded permanently in Minnesota and across the country. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to take some time today to express my outrage with the way the federal government has handled its responsibility to remove and store nuclear waste from 41 states across the country and to outline my thoughts on the bill before us. I'm also going to speak about my expectations for the future of nuclear energy and the future of nuclear waste storage in the State of Minnesota. 
   First, I hope the Senate will indulge me while I review the process that has brought all of us here today. 
   As everyone in this chamber knows, Washington's involvement in nuclear power isn't new. Since the 1950's  ``Atoms for Peace'' program, the federal government has promoted nuclear energy, in part, by promising to remove radioactive waste from power plants. 
   Congress decisively committed the federal government to take and dispose of civilian radioactive waste beginning in 1998 through the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, and its amendments in 1987. 
   This is nothing new. Eighteen years ago Congress decided that the Federal Government was going to take this waste beginning in 1998, and also by amendments in 1987 reestablish those facts. 
   These acts established the DOE Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management to conduct the program, selected Yucca Mountain, Nevada as the site to assess for the permanent disposal facility, established fees of a tenth of a cent per kilowatt hour on nuclear-generated electricity--and provided that these fees would be deposited in the Nuclear Waste Fund. Furthermore, it authorized appropriations from this fund for a number of activities, including development of a nuclear waste repository. 
   Eventually, publication of the Standard Contract addressed how radioactive waste would be taken, stored, and disposed of. The DOE then signed individual contracts with all civilian nuclear utilities promising to take and dispose of civilian high-level waste beginning January 31, 1998--over two years ago. Other administrative proceedings, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Waste Confidence Rule, told the American public that they should literally bank on the federal government's promise. 
   In other words, take this promise to the bank. 
   I think this point needs to be clearly understood by the Members of this body. 
   Our nation's nuclear utilities didn't go out and invest in nuclear power in spite of federal government warnings of future difficulties. Instead, they were encouraged by the federal government to turn to nuclear power to meet increasing energy demands. 
   Utilities and states were told to move forward with investments in nuclear technologies because it's a sound source of energy production. 
   And the federal government's support for nuclear power was based on some very sound considerations. 
   First, nuclear power is environmentally friendly. Nothing is burned in a nuclear reactor, so there are no emissions in the atmosphere. In fact, nuclear energy is responsible for over 90 percent of the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that have come out of the energy industry since 1973. Between 1973 and 1996, nuclear power accounted for emissions reductions of 34.6 million tons of nitrogen oxide and another 80.2 million tons of sulfur dioxide. 
   Second, nuclear power is a reliable base load source of power. Families, farmers, businesses, and individuals who are served by nuclear power are served by one of the most reliable sources of electricity. 
   Third, nuclear energy is a homegrown technology, and the United States led the way in its development. We have long been the world leader in nuclear technology and continue to be the largest nuclear-producing country in the world. Using nuclear power increases our energy security. 
   Finally, much of the world recognizes those same values and promotes the use of nuclear power because of its reliability, its environmental benefits, and its value to energy independence. 
   Because of those reasons, the Federal Government threw one more bone to our Nation's utilities. It said if you build nuclear power, we will take care of your nuclear waste, we will build a repository, and we will take it out of your State. 
   In response to those promises--again, those promises the Federal Government said you can take to the bank--over 30 States took the Federal Government at its word and allowed civilian nuclear energy production to move forward. 
   As I mentioned earlier, ratepayers agreed to share some of the responsibilities but again were promised some things in return. They agreed to pay a fee, attached to their energy bill, to pay for the proper handling of the spent nuclear fuel, in exchange for assurances that the Federal Government meet its responsibility to manage any waste storage challenge. Again, contracts were made, contracts were signed. 
   Because of these procedures and measures taken by the Federal Government, ratepayers have now paid over $15 billion, including interest, into the nuclear waste fund. Today these payments continue, exceeding $1 billion dollars annually, or about $70,000 for every hour of every day of the year. 
   In summary, the Federal Government promoted nuclear power, utilities agreed to invest in nuclear power, States agreed to host nuclear powerplants, and ratepayers assumed the responsibility of investing in long-term storage of nuclear waste. 
   Still, nuclear waste is stranded on the banks of the Mississippi River in Minnesota and on countless other sites across the country because the Department of Energy has a very short-term memory, and this administration has virtually no sense of responsibility. We can all argue all day long on the floor of this Chamber on the merit of nuclear power, but we cannot stand here today and deny that the Federal Government promoted nuclear power and promised to take care of nuclear waste and that there is nuclear waste piled up around the country. 
   The Clinton administration, however, would have you believe that they do not have a responsibility to deal with nuclear power. I have been working with Senator MURKOWSKI and many other Members over the roughly 5 years I have been in the Senate 
   to establish an interim repository for nuclear waste and to be able to move forward with the development of a permanent repository. We have brought a bill to the floor that accomplishes those objectives in each of the past two Congresses. Each time, we passed the bill in both the House and the Senate with overwhelming bipartisan support. Just over 2 years ago, we passed by a vote of 65-34 a bill that would have removed nuclear waste from States, and the House passed the bill with 307 supporters--a veto-proof majority in the House. 
   We have had extensive debate with the opportunity for anyone to offer amendments. We have thoroughly addressed most issues related to nuclear waste storage, including the transportation of waste across the United States. Yet every time we have passed a bill that fulfills the Federal Government's commitments, President Clinton has issued his veto threat and he has stopped our efforts in their tracks. 
   After years of trying to establish an interim storage site, we are now left with only the ability to make some smaller changes to the nuclear waste program and condition the date for removal of waste on the authorization for construction of the permanent repository. 
   I want to tell my colleagues that I am not overly joyous about the bill before the Senate today. In fact, I don't think this bill does enough. But I don't blame those who support the bill for what the bill does not do, and neither should anyone else across the Nation or anyone here in Congress. If anyone is at fault for the lack of a definite action and definitive action on this issue, it is the Clinton administration. 
   As my colleagues are very well aware, my main concerns with the nuclear waste storage issue have centered on two major issues. First, the ratepayers of Minnesota have paid countless millions into the nuclear waste fund, and they expect nuclear waste to leave Minnesota at a reasonable date. More specifically, Minnesota ratepayers expect nuclear waste to leave our State no later than beginning on January 31, 1998. We all know that it didn't, and we all have known it won't be leaving anytime soon no matter what we do this week in the Senate. 
   Second, because the State of Minnesota recognized in the early 1990s the Federal Government would not meet its obligation to remove spent nuclear fuel from the State by January 1998, it placed a limit on the amount of onsite waste storage at Northern States Power Company's Prairie Island Facility. Northern States Power agreed to that limit. But it now appears the State-imposed limit for this onsite storage will be reached sometime in the year 2007, and then two nuclear reactors that produced 20 percent of Minnesota's electricity will be forced to shut down.  
   At a time when we are trying to reduce carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and other emissions across the country, Minnesota will be losing 20 percent of its emissions-free electricity generation, and it will be replaced with fossil fuels. The loss of those two reactors also means increased costs to ratepayers, as Minnesotans will continue to pay in their rates for the operation of the nuclear facility even after it is shut down. Security will be needed, people will have to remain onsite to monitor both the waste in casks and the spent rods and the storage pool. 
   Water systems will have to remain working, as will any emergency response teams. In fact, the costs of operations may not reduce much at all. The ratepayers will pay the bill and 
   they will get nothing for it. So there are some big problems that need to be addressed in my State, and it will require the participation and also the leadership of the Federal Government. 
   While this bill does not immediately fix either of these concerns, it does make some progress that I believe is important to move forward. First, while this legislation doesn't move waste from Minnesota or any other State on a specific date, it does advance the removal date by allowing the construction of an early acceptance facility upon approval of construction for the permanent repository. Right now, that would mean sometime in late 2006 or sometime early 2007. 
   Under the current situation, we won't move waste until the permanent repository is built and operating--and no one is quite sure when that will be. We thought we had a date certain for the removal of waste--again, going back to the old contracts, bills passed in 1982, that it would begin no later than January 31, 1998. Again, the Department of Energy ignored it as if it didn't exist, that the contracts they signed didn't matter, and had no bearings. They continue to do the same yet today. 
   This bill tries to establish a reasonable threshold for the construction of an early receipt facility. I think that is something that is achievable. The bill protects ratepayers by requiring that only Congress can undertake actions which would raise the fee paid by energy consumers into the nuclear waste fund. The Secretary of Energy will not be able to act unilaterally to raise that rate. 
   He says he would like to take control, or take title to the nuclear waste, and they would pay for the facility and all the storage. But the only way they would do that is to go back to the ratepayers, or the taxpayers, for more money to take care of a problem they have ignored. 
   Third, this bill will put in place transportation provisions for nuclear waste that are similar to those now in the place for the transport of low-level waste to the Waste Isolation Pilot Project in New Mexico. 
   Fourth, this bill tries to establish a mechanism by which we can avoid unreachable regulations governing the radiation standard for the permanent repository. The EPA should not be allowed to unilaterally set an unreasonable radiation standard aimed solely at ensuring the permanent repository is never built. 
   The radiation standard should protect long-term human health and should be based on the best science available--but it should not be a bullet aimed at the heart of the permanent repository. 
   Fifth, this bill addresses the problems just across the Minnesota border with Dairyland Power Cooperative. They have been requesting and needing some relief from their specific problem and have tremendous support in Minnesota. 
   In fact, the Minnesota Rural Electric Association strongly supports this bill for that very reason. 
   Sixth, I believe this bill is a step forward for nuclear power. There are provisions in the bill that allow for additional research into the transmutation of nuclear waste and the viability of reprocessing. Senator DOMENICI and I traveled to France and examined their waste program and reprocessing facilities. 
   France has taken our technology and used it to create an amazingly integrated and well planned program that allows them to derive over 80 percent of their electricity from nuclear power. For them, our fascination with nuclear waste is perplexing. They can deal with their waste. 
   I stood on the floor under which all of their nuclear waste is now stored. We need to take another look at how we think about both nuclear power and nuclear waste storage and this bill allows for that to happen. 
   Seventh, this bill does not include everything I believe it should. I have tried to address the situation with Northern States Power but right now we do not have a perfect answer. I believe keeping Prairie Island open and operating will require the cooperation of NSP, the Secretary of Energy, the States of Minnesota, and those of us in Congress. 
   I will be pushing Secretary Richardson to come to Minnesota to sit down with the state legislature, the Governor's Office, NSP, and me to see if we can find some common ground. 
   I have also received the assurance of Senator MURKOWSKI that the Energy and Natural Resources Committee will not forget about Minnesota and that he will continue to work with me on this important matter as well. 
   I am also pleased that Senator MURKOWSKI agreed to include some language I proposed which will aid in the process of addressing Minnesota's situation. My language has two specific components which will aid decisionmakers in Washington and in Minnesota throughout the coming months and years. 
   The first part of my language requires the DOE to report on all alternatives available to NSP and the Federal Government which would allow NSP to operate the Prairie Island Nuclear Generating Plant until the end of the term of its current NRC licenses, assuming existing State and Federal laws remain unchanged. 
   I want to get the DOE engaged in discussions and cooperation with the State of Minnesota and NSP on this matter. Unfortunately, I have not seen a willingness within federal agencies to work with the State of Minnesota and NSP on what options might exist that would facilitate a resolution of this dispute. 
   I want to get everyone working together on this problem now, not 6 years from now when a shutdown is imminent. 
   Additionally, my language will require the General Accounting Office to issue a report on the potential economic impacts to Minnesota ratepayers should the Prairie Island facility cease operations once it has met its state imposed storage limitation--including the costs of new generation, decommissioning costs, and the costs of continued operation of on-site storage of spent nuclear fuel storage. 
   I am hopeful this information will give both policymakers and ratepayers a clearer indication of exactly what a shutdown of the facility means not only to the reliability of their electric service, but to the checkbooks of Minnesota families as well. 
   Finally, I believe it was vitally important that we removed the take title provision from this legislation. I do not believe we should give the DOE any further opportunities to leave waste where it now sits. Allowing the DOE to take title to waste is a dangerous proposition for ratepayers. 
   I was proud to join Senators COLLINS, SNOWE, and JEFFORDS in offering the amendment to delete the take title provision and I am grateful Senator MURKOWSKI deleted the take title provision from the manager's amendment as well. 
   While these components will certainly be helpful to my State, I know there will be some in Minnesota who'll want me to oppose this bill because it does not go far enough. But I do not believe I would be serving the interests of my constituents by voting against a good bill that might help Minnesota ratepayers because of what is not in it. 
   I should not vote against a good bill because it is not a perfect bill. And I cannot vote against a bill that might move waste out of Minnesota sooner than under current conditions, because it does not move waste out as soon as I would like. I intend to vote in support of this bill because I believe it is an important bill. 
   I intend to vote for the bill because I want to remain part of this process and because I do not believe Minnesota can withdraw itself from this debate. And I intend to vote for this bill because I believe this is part of a process in restoring government accountability in the nuclear waste debate.  
   I may be back asking for more or looking for other opportunities to help my State and my State's ratepayers. I do not consider this matter closed either in Minnesota or in Washington, DC. 
   I want to take just a moment to thank Senator MURKOWSKI for his willingness to work with me and to continue to explore ways in which we can help my State. His staff have remained open to our concerns and willing to work with my staff. 
   They have been honest about what they cannot do--and I appreciate that as well. 
   I also want to issue a warning and a challenge to my colleagues in the Senate. Let us not assume that this is a great victory for ratepayers or for our States. 
   This legislation does not fulfill the Federal Government's commitment to remove nuclear waste. 
   Regrettably, this bill is but a shell of the bills we have passed with bipartisan support in each of the last two Congresses. So we should not go home and tell our constituents that this matter is resolved or that our work here is finished. 
   I am a little biased, but I hope we have a totally new direction in the White House after next year. I hope that translates into a willingness to engage Congress and the States on nuclear waste issues rather than the protracted effort to ignore Congress and the States that this administration has relied upon. 
   I believe we are going to have that new direction and I am going to be back asking that administration to move forward immediately on interim storage. 
   If this administration is unwilling to provide the American people with the services for which they have paid, I hope and expect they will make sure the next administration will do that and live up to the promises it made. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to address concerns about the direction our country is taking in agriculture policy for our Nation. It has been very frustrating to me that our Federal dairy policy has been driven by what I can only describe as urban myths about the supposed benefits of dairy compacts in our country. These myths, just like stories on the street, have been repeated so many times in Congress that they are assumed to be true, despite their total lack of a factual basis. 
   I would today like to discuss the myth that dairy compacts are necessary to provide an adequate supply of fresh, locally produced milk to consumers. As I have said before, I believe this assertion is a deliberate attempt to mislead consumers into believing that if we do not have compacts, there may not be milk in the dairy case the next time they go to the grocery store. Perhaps the statement is not a total deception because it says that the dairy compact is designed to guarantee fresh, locally produced milk. But as we enter the 21st century, we as consumers know that a product in the grocery store does not have to be produced locally to be ``fresh.'' If it is produced locally, all the better, but we regularly go to the grocery store and buy fresh, perishable food that comes from all over the United States, including fruits, vegetables, meats, poultry, and any of a number of other foods. Similarly, fresh milk and dairy products can now be safely and rapidly shipped all over the country in refrigerated trucks--there is no need to restrict interstate trade in our country to guarantee fresh milk to our consumers. 
   One of the reasons that America thrives economically is because we allow individuals to produce what they are most skilled at producing. And this principle extends to geographic regions of the country. As an example, Americans buy most of their citrus products from Florida and California, cotton and rice from the South, and potatoes from the West. Economists call this ``comparative advantage''--regions produce and sell whatever they are most efficient at producing, and everyone benefits because trade and efficiency is maximized. Lower price; better products to the consumer. It all seems very simple, but it is not allowed to work that way in our dairy industry. 
   The upper Midwest, due in part to its climate, low feed prices, and an abundant water supply happens to have a comparative advantage in milk and dairy products. However, unlike the rest of the country, it is not permitted to freely sell the product that it so efficiently produces. Instead, Congress has chosen to protect entire regions of the milk industry against competition from the upper Midwest through dairy compacts and/or outdated milk marketing orders. 
   Basically, in dairy, the Government is picking winners and losers, not who can produce the best, not who can be competitive, what area of the country it is. But under a Government program, the Government is saying who is a winner and who is a loser when it comes to the dairy industry. 
   Dairy compacts require that processors pay a minimum price for the milk they sell for fluid consumption. Compact proponents will claim that producers outside the compact region are not prevented from selling into the region, but for all practical purposes, this is exactly what it does. If you have a floor price, it eliminates the ability of lower cost producers to sell in that region. There is no incentive for processors to buy from producers outside the region because the price they pay is already set. 
   So they are not able to buy at the lower price or more competitive supply, but because of the compact setting the price, that is where they buy it. 
   It is interesting that the argument that compacts are necessary to guarantee a supply of fresh milk to a region was also made to justify the unreasonably high support prices in the 1980s that resulted as you will remember, in massive government purchases of surplus dairy products. The Federal Government spent $2.6 billion on surplus purchases in 1983 alone, more than 12 percent of U.S. milk production. Congress consequently had to begin a dairy termination program which paid dairy farmers not to produce milk for 5 years. 
   Congress today is perpetuating the same myths as in past years, with the same predictable results of producer surpluses and higher milk prices to consumers. Upper Midwest producers could sell cheaper milk to consumers almost nationwide, but instead, not only can they not compete for markets outside the region, but their prices in cheese markets are depressed by the oversupply of production in the compact region that flood into the Midwest. 
   Finally, it appears that not only are dairy compacts not necessary to guarantee a fresh supply of milk to consumers, but they seem to only offer Government protection to dairy farmers within the compact area and guarantee decreased consumption by families due to the high milk prices. If something costs more, you sell less of it, and milk is no different. For example, in 1998, each consumer drank an average of 23.8 gallons of fluid milk products. That is compared to 56.1 gallons of soft drinks, 15 gallons of fruit juices, and 14 gallons of bottled water. Moreover, beverage milk consumption declined from 28.6 gallons in 1975 to 23.9 gallons in 1997. This is not a trend we can ignore. If we went to encourage milk consumption, we cannot do so by artificially raising the price and keeping less expensive, domestically produced milk out of the market. 
   As we begin the second session of the 106th Congress, I ask my colleagues to be truthful in the dairy debate and not perpetuate the falsehood that compacts are necessary to ensure a fresh supply of milk to consumers. There are, unfortunately, other dairy myths to be exposed, so you can look forward to me returning to the Senate floor to make sure Congress and the American people learn the truth about our Federal dairy policy. 
   We need some fairness in our dairy policy. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, shortly before the first session of the 106th Congress adjourned, I introduced, and the Senate passed, a resolution designating January 2000 as ``National Biotechnology Month.'' I rise today to formally recognize National Biotechnology Month here in the Senate. 
   While back in Minnesota, I had the opportunity to meet with some of my constituents who are in the biotechnology industry. Whether it's agricultural, medical, or environmental applications of biotechnology, Minnesota is a leader in the field. 
   Here are some characteristics of the biotechnology industry nationally: 
   Over 200 million people worldwide have been helped by the more than 80 biotechnology drug products and vaccines approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
   There are more than 350 biotechnology drug products and vaccines currently in human clinical trials and hundreds more in early development in the United States. These medicines are designed to treat various cancers, Alzheimer's, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, AIDS, obesity and other conditions. 
   Biotechnology will help us feed the world by developing new and better agriculture commodities that are disease and pest resistant and offer higher yields as well. 
   Environmental biotechnology products make it possible to more efficiently clean up hazardous waste without the use of caustic chemicals. 
   Industrial biotechnology applications have led to cleaner processes with lower production of wastes and lower energy consumption, in such industrial sectors as chemicals, pulp and paper, textiles, food and fuels, metals and minerals and energy. For example, much of the denim produced in the United States is finished using biotechnology enzymes. 
   DNA fingerprinting, a biotech process, has dramatically improved criminal investigation and forensic medicine, as well as afforded significant advances in anthropology and wildlife management. 
   There are 1,283 biotechnology companies in the United States-many in Minnesota. 
   Market capitalization, the amount of money invested in the O.S. biotechnology industry, increased 4 percent in 1998, from $93 billion to (97 billion. 
   Approximately one-third of biotech companies employ fewer than 50 employees. More than two-thirds employ fewer than 135 people.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, for over six decades people have come to rely, expect, and depend on investments made into the Social Security system. However, the very financial structure created with the program in 1935 is about to face some very significant strains placed on it by changes in demographics and also by poor fiscal management by Washington. Basically, we are at a crossroads. Do we let the system wither on the vine or do we work to save Social Security? 
   At the crux of this discussion is how best to serve our Nation's retirees. How can we offer them the most financial security in their retirement? I have some ideas I have shared with Minnesotans and also with the Senate. They are aimed at saving the Social Security system. It is a package of proposals, the Grams Plan for Retirement Security, that encompasses what we expect to do to protect and preserve the existing system, as well as what other steps we might take to offer retirees more security in their elder years. 
   There are several main elements in my package. On Monday, I introduced the Social Security and Medicare Surplus Protection Act which would trigger an automatic across-the-board cut if the Government would happen to spend any of the surpluses, either Social Security or Medicare. 
   In effect, this creates a retroactive lockbox to protect Social Security and Medicare surpluses. Even those in Washington who are fiscally conscious of the commitments made to our Nation's retirees were surprised that last year was the first in over 60 to not dip into the Social Security trust fund to pay for other Washington programs. 
   This all-too-common practice necessitates a retroactive lockbox. My legislation contains the lockbox enforcement mechanism that triggers an automatic reduction in Government discretionary spending, including congressional Members' pay, if any of the Social Security or Medicare surplus is spent on other Government programs, thereby restoring the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. This would lock up the trust funds in case budget forecasts were inaccurate--and surpluses were spent. 
   The Grams lockbox saves Social Security and Medicare from Washington's big spenders and reaffirms our commitment to our Nation's retirees. 
   I have also introduced the Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act. It creates personal retirement accounts and offers every American the opportunity to achieve personal wealth, and also the dignity, freedom, and security that it affords in their retirement years. It also protects seniors by guaranteeing that their benefits won't be cut. The retirement age and taxes will not be raised if they decide to stay within the Social Security system as we know it today. 
   At the heart of the Personal Security Wealth in Retirement Act is the personal retirement account, or a PRA. A PRA allows the option to invest dollars into the market that taxpayers are now forced to surrender to the Federal Government in their withholding for the FICA taxes. Workers would now have the freedom to design their own retirement plans, investing in stocks, in equities, bonds or T-bills, or any combination of these, or any other financial instruments with approved investment firms and approved financial institutions. Taxpayers can invest funds into traditional savings accounts if that is what they want. The result would be maximum freedom to control 
   their resources for their own retirement security. 
   There is no doubt that a market-based retirement system and the power of compounded interest would generate much better returns than under the traditional Social Security system we have to date. Under today's Social Security program, the average annual retirement benefit for a family with two working spouses is about $33,000 a year. Under the Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act, families could receive an annual benefit of more than $200,000 a year by investing the same dollars in a PRA rather than in the current system. Low-income families also would do better under this plan. Where Social Security now provides an annual benefit of about $18,000 a year, my proposal would produce benefits as high as $100,000 a year. 
   Despite the obvious benefits of a PRA, if one chooses to stay within the traditional Social Security system, that is their right, and the Government would guarantee the promised benefits that would not be cut and that Washington could not increase the retirement age and Washington could not increase taxes. 
   Special protections have been built in to keep the PRA safe. Government-approved private investment companies would manage those PRAs to ensure, to guarantee a return higher than what Social Security pays today. Social Security, by the way, today pays them less than a 2-percent return, and in the near future it will be less than 1 percent. That is not the kind of investment most people would make if they could walk up to a window. I don't think they would invest in an account that pays less than 1 percent. That is what happens. Many taxpayers in the future will have a negative rate of return, meaning it is better to put money under your mattress or bury it in a tin can in the backyard than invest in Social Security. 
   Rules similar to those applying to individual retirement accounts would apply to the new personal retirement accounts. If a worker happened to fall short of accumulating the minimum retirement benefits, this is where the Federal Government would step in to make up that difference--in other words, to fill the glass full; to assure a minimum retirement benefit so no one will retire into poverty, so you will not lose if you choose a PRA. 
   The Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act also offers features not found in Social Security because you can choose when you want to retire. Right now the Government tells you how much you pay into Social Security, when you can retire, and what your benefits are going to be. But under our Personal Retirement Account plans, you make those decisions, you choose when you want to retire. As long as you have accumulated the minimum benefits necessary for your lifetime, you are free to retire whenever you want. PRAs could be established early on in life, even before a child is out of diapers. The idea is, when a child was born and given a Social Security number, his or her parents or grandparents will be able to begin putting money into that child's retirement account. 
   As an example, if you put $1,000 into an account for a newborn baby, that account would grow to nearly $250,000 by the time that child would be ready to retire. From $1,000 seed money to $250,000 by the time that child would retire--not a bad start. 
   The Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act ensures that your PRA remains your private property and that you have a right to pass it on. When you die, the remaining funds that are in your account will be transferred, under your estate, to your heirs free of taxes. Right now, as you know, when you die there is no residual Social Security. That is it. So all the money you have paid in you do not get back. The Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act confidently 
   answers the question of whether prosperity in retirement can best be achieved by the Government or by you, the individual. Given the tools and the freedom to put them to work, every American will discover that a successful and secure future is just a PRA away. 
   These proposals are at the heart of the Grams Plan for Retirement Security. In addition to these bills, there are several others in the Grams Plan for Retirement Security. I have introduced the Social Security Benefit Guarantee Act which would create a legal right to Social Security benefits, including an accurate cost-of-living increase. I have also introduced the Fair COLA for Seniors Act, legislation to ensure that older Americans receive accurate cost-of-living adjustments based on their consumption patterns so  they can better achieve retirement security, and the Social Security Information Act, to ensure that hard-working Americans receive adequate information on which they can begin to plan for their retirement, such as the rate of return on their Social Security investment. As I have mentioned, I think if people today would get information on what the return was going to be on their investment, it would play a big part in their decision to have that or turn to a private retirement account. 
   I have introduced the Medicare Ensuring Prescription Drugs Act--that is legislation to ensure seniors do not have to choose between their medicines and their food--and the Tax Relief for Seniors Act, legislation to repeal taxes on our seniors' Social Security incomes. That is unfair, again--that tax on our seniors. 
   These are all components of the Grams Plan for Retirement Security, legislation aimed at helping hard-working Americans receive retirement security. As I close, and as we enter this new session of the 106th Congress, we need to have an honest discussion, not about how best to extend the life of a Government program or how to alter numbers so we might technically fit within spending limits at the expense of our Nation's retirees; instead, we should debate and discuss how to offer hard-working Americans the retirement security they deserve. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, tonight at the very beginning of the second session of the 106th Congress, I rise to talk about legislation that I introduced earlier today--on a vitally important issue: protection of the Social Security and Medicare surplus. 
   My legislation reassures the American people that Congress and the Administration will not spend a penny of their Social Security and Medicare money and it creates a mechanism to enforce our commitment to protecting these surpluses. 
   This ``look-back'' enforcement mechanism is simple and straightforward. It basically says if Congress and the Administration indeed spend any of the Social Security and Medicare surplus in the previous fiscal year, an automatic reduction in Government discretionary spending, including congressional Members' pay, will be triggered. The money will be returned to the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. It would work similarly to the sequester of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, but applies to spending of Social Security and Medicare surplus funds. I stress the sequester could not cut any Medicare or other entitlement programs. 
   Unlike similar legislation I introduced last year, this bill adds the Medicare surplus into the protection. The Medicare part A surplus will be about $20 billion this year. This surplus should also be preserved for senior's medical expenses only, not for any general Government spending. 
   My legislation would in effect prevent anyone, whether it is the Congress or the administration, from raiding the Social Security and Medicare surplus. 
   I believe this is a crucial step to truly protect the Social Security and Medicare surplus and save it exclusively for Americans' retirement and medical needs, not for tax relief, and not for government spending. 
   Let me explain why we need this legislation. 
   First and foremost, the American people do not understand why budget rules do not protect the Social Security and Medicare surplus. I have traveled intensively throughout Minnesota during this congressional recess. Everywhere I went, Minnesotans told me that the Federal Government's practice of so-called ``borrowing'' from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds must be stopped, and Americans' retirement funds must be secured. 
   They are very worried that the retirement funds will not be there for them, and they are concerned that the Government will not be able to return the over $750 billion already ``borrowed'' and spent by the Government. They want me to take every measure possible to protect their retirement security and their future health care needs. 
   Last December, the Congressional Budget Office's end of the session summary estimated that Congress spent $17 billion of the Social Security surplus and exceeded the spending caps by $7 billion in budget authority and $17 billion in outlays. 
   In addition, Congress spent every penny of the $14 billion non-Social Security surplus which we promised to return to working Americans as tax relief. 
   The Congressional Budget Office also reported that increased revenue would present a more favorable picture. On Wednesday, the CBO is expected to issue its new estimates and it appears likely that Americans' tax overpayments will enable us to avoid spending any of the Social Security surplus. 
   However, my concerns are, first, the CBO December estimate gives the general public the impression that we failed to keep our promise to protect the Social Security surplus and that we are now covering it up with budgetary smoke and mirrors. 
   Second, as a result, we have to use additional tax overpayments to fund the increased government spending, even if the new CBO estimate shows we did not spend the Social Security surplus. 
   Already, lawmakers are talking about how to spend the rest of the non-Social Security surplus in an Supplemental emergency early this year. 
   Because of this propensity to spend, I believe the look-back proposal is essential to protect us now and in the future from the temptation to spend ``just a little'' the Social Security and Medicare surpluses. 
   Further, I have argued repeatedly before the Senate that economic forecasting is more of an art than a science. Many uncertainties, risks, and factors are involved. We have a budget of over $1.8 trillion based on a variety of assumptions, estimates, forecasts and projections, with people using both Congressional Budget Office numbers and Office of Management and Budget. It is highly likely that there are errors in this budget. If the error occurs in Social Security spending, we must have a mechanism to correct it. 
   Another compelling reason for this legislation is that we are facing even more severe budget constraints and spending pressures this year because according to the CBO, the discretionary budget authority for fiscal year 2001 is about $542 billion, which is $18 billion less than the amount appropriated for 2000. 
   What's worse, $23 billion out of the $542 billion cap has already been appropriated as advance funding in the 2000 appropriations bills. President Clinton has already talked about breaking the caps which he agreed to, by the way, in 1997. 
   Although we may have more on-budget surplus this year, which is supposed to be returned to the taxpayers in the form of tax relief and debt reduction, there is no guarantee Congress and the administration will not touch the Social Security and Medicare surplus. 
   Since we all have agreed that saving Social Security should be our top priority and have committed to not spending the Social Security surplus for Government programs, we must do everything we can to prevent the Government from spending the Social Security and Medicare surpluses. We need to find a better way to keep our promise to the American people. 
   Senators on my side of the aisle have made a number of attempts to create a  lockbox to lock in every penny of the Social Security surplus exclusively for Americans' retirement. Unfortunately, opposition by the other side has blocked the establishment of this safe lockbox. Some opposed because Medicare was not included. My proposal does protect Medicare. 
   The ``look-back'' mechanism in my legislation is our best option. It will force the Government to live up to our pledge that not a penny of the Social Security and Medicare surpluses will be spent to fund either last year's or this year's appropriations. 
   If our spending plans do pass and we would again, unintentionally wind up spending Social Security, we must be able to keep our commitment to the American people, by scaling back other spending to save Social Security. Without this mechanism Congress and the President may spend some of the Social Security surplus by using inaccurate estimates. 
   The remedy in my bill is a simple one and it should be passed early before we face a problem, so we cannot play the blame game if a re-estimate shows spending of Social Security or Medicare surpluses. 
   In an era of budget surplus, extra prudence and effort is needed to keep ourselves from spending more than we can afford. On principle, we must do everything we can to ensure Washington will not touch any Social Security money. 
   Protecting the Social Security and Medicare surpluses from funding government operations is the last defense of fiscal discipline. I cannot emphasize how vitally important this line of defense is for both political parties because if we lose this defense, our credibility and accountability with the American people will be gone. 
   I strongly believe we should continue to stress our promise to the American people. We must make protection of the Social Security and Medicare surpluses our top priority and ensure that not a penny of Americans' retirement needs is used for Government spending. 
   Again, I believe this can be easily achieved by passing my ``look-back'' legislation which will allow us to enforce that commitment. 
   I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today stunned by the addition of harmful dairy provisions in the final appropriations bill. This omnibus bill contains another extension of the Northeast Dairy Compact for 24 months--which I consider the most brazen attempt in my memory as a member of Congress to steal and move an industry from one region of the country to another. This economic power grab is alternatively characterized as a matter of states' rights, a way to guarantee a fresh supply of milk to local consumers, a means to ensure lower-priced milk to consumers, and a means to help the small family farmer survive. All of these arguments are false--a thinly veiled disguise to cover the truth, which is that this is an unvarnished economic power grab of major proportions. 
   But first, I would like to explain what dairy compacts are, and explain why they are so destructive to the heart of dairy production in America and the Upper Midwest. The Northeast Dairy Compact raises the price of Class I fluid milk above the prevailing federal milk marketing order price within the participating states, and, I might add, above what the market would pay. Milk processors have to pay the higher price for the raw milk they process, and this higher price is passed along to the consumer at the grocery store. With higher prices, consumption goes down, and children are the biggest losers. I don't argue against a fair price or honest price--for any dairy farmer in Minnesota or Vermont or any other state. But I cannot support price- fixing schemes that legislatively transfer market share.  
   The Northeast Compact was authorized in 1996 during consideration of the larger Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act. This controversial issue was inserted in the conference committee, avoiding a separate vote, after the measure had been overwhelmingly defeated on the floor. While most of the FAIR Act was designed to help farmers compete in world markets and reduce government involvement in agriculture, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact established a regional price-fixing cartel within our very own country. The Northeast Dairy Compact has harmed dairy farmers in Minnesota, and this kind of unfair subsidy should be terminated. We should not be passing laws that will have such a harmful impact on any American. This compact does. 
   When this issue came to the fore, compacts were roundly condemned in the major newspapers of the compact region. The New York Times, Boston Herald, the Connecticut Post, and the Hartford Courant all weighed in against the cartel, in addition to publications such as USA Today and the Washington Post. 
   Again, compacts were hardly consensus legislation to begin with. The House refused to put the provision in its broader farm bill. And I must reiterate, the Senate voted on the floor to strip the Compact language from its bill. Despite these defeats, the compact provision was slipped into the bill in conference and signed by the President. The Compact legislation could not withstand the scrutiny of a fair debate on the floor, and had to be muscled in at the last minute in conference, just as we've seen with this attempted extension today. Knowing that this scheme was a bad idea from the start, Congress limited the life of the compact, and that is why compact proponents asked for an extension and could only achieve an extension sneaked into an omnibus bill as we are about to head out of town for the session. 
   Retail prices of milk jumped immediately after the higher Compact price was implemented. As predicted, the milk produced in New England increased by four times the national rate of increase in a six-month period following Compact implementation. The surplus milk was converted into milk powder, leading to a 60% increase in milk powder production. That surplus directly harms dairy farmers in Minnesota and Wisconsin, driving down prices and demand in the Midwest. 
   Soon after implementation, the Northeast Compact had to begin reimbursing school food service programs for the increases in cost caused by the milk price hikes; an admission that prices have gone up and consumers are being affected. However, low-income families that need milk in their diet are not being reimbursed by the Compact for their increased costs. Milk is a food staple, 
   and one of the healthiest foods we have. Are we going to permit the extension of this milk tax that hits low- income citizens hardest? Are we going to continue a food tax on the group of citizens who spend the highest percentage of their income on food? What's next, a special tax on bread, eggs, ground beef, or potatoes? But that won't happen--Why? Because it would be unfair, just as this compact cartel is unfair. Consider the low-income families with small children and the elderly on fixed incomes in your state and ask if this is the population you want bearing the brunt of this regressive milk tax. 
   Despite all of the discrediting information about dairy compacts, members continue to contemplate extending for the second time this bad policy that was initially only to be ``temporary'' assistance to Northeast producers. Everyone who truly understands this issue admits that compacts are harmful for consumers and for American agriculture, but somehow we can't muster the political will to say no to the entrenched interests that support the compact. Thus, we keep hitting the snooze button--preferring to ``temporarily'' extend bad policy rather than addressing it on a policy basis. What is even more egregious is other regions of the country are promoting compacts for themselves to tap into these goodies at the expense of other regions of the country such as the Upper Midwest. And again would force consumers to pay unfair high prices for milk. 
   This is really Economics 101. If you artificially raise the price received for a commodity, you can count on more being produced. Where does the excess go? It goes into areas where there isn't a floor price, and that excess production depresses the price that producers in my state receive. It's really not that hard to understand, despite the sentimental arguments that compact supporters use to cloud the real issues at play in this debate. Again, we are trying to knock down or reduce trade barriers around the world to open markets and give our farmers a level playing field to compete, but would erect these same barriers to trade inside our own borders that will not allow dairy farmers in the Midwest to fairly compete. 
   As I said earlier, I must address some of these urban myths about the benefits of compacts, myths that are so often repeated around here by colleagues that they have become difficult to distinguish from the truth. One of these claims is that compacts are somehow a matter of ``states' rights,'' and that compacts make an important contribution toward devolving power back to the states. 
   The fact is that regulation of interstate commerce is a power specifically delegated to Congress in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution, which states that Congress shall have power ``to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes.'' 
   Regulation of interstate commerce was one of the chief reasons our country's founders abandoned the Articles of Confederation and moved to adopt the Constitution. I consider it one of the great ironies of this debate when I hear colleagues claim that the dairy compact issue boils down to ``states' rights.'' 
   Professor Burt Neuborne, a constitutional law professor at the New York University School of Law, in testimony before a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee, noted that the chief motive for the Founding Fathers' decision to abandon the Articles of Confederation in favor of the Constitution was to foster a free market of trade within the United States. Under the weaker Articles of Confederation that entrusted commerce powers in the states, states enacted price controls to protect high-cost producers from competition from other regions of the country. The Constitution corrected this problem by empowering Congress to regulate interstate commerce. According to Professor Neuborne,  
   At the close of the Revolution, the thirteen original states experimented with a loose confederation that delegated power over foreign affairs to a national government, but retained power over virtually everything else at the state and local level. The lack of a national power to regulate interstate Commerce led to the eruption of a series of trade wars, pitting states and regions against one another in a mutually destructive spiral......  
   United States Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson, reviewing the 
   history of the Commerce Clause in a 1949 opinion, stated that:  
   The sole purpose for which Virginia initiated the movement which ultimately produced the Constitution was 'to take into consideration the trade of the United States; to examine the relative situations of trade of said States; to consider how far a uniform system in their commercial regulations may be necessary to their common interest and their permanent harmony' and for that purpose the General Assembly of Virginia in January of 1786 named commissioners and proposed their meeting with those from other states. The desire of the Forefathers to federalize regulation of foreign and interstate commerce stands in sharp contrast to their jealous preservation of the state's power over its internal affairs. No other federal power was so universally assumed to be necessary, no other state power was so readily relinquished. [As Madison] indicated, ``want of a general power over Commerce led to an exercise of this power separately, by the states, (which) not only proved abortive, but engendered rival, conflicting, and angry regulations.''  
   Continuing to quote again from Professor Neuborne,  
   James Madison noted that the single most important achievement of the Constitutional Convention was to rescue the nation from a continuation of the parochial trade wars that had marred the first ten years of its existence and threatened its future permanent harmony...... Congress should reflect on the fact that Madison's understanding of the relationship between economic protectionism and the erosion of political unity was brilliantly prescient. One of the Founders' enduring insights was that regional economic protectionism is ultimately corrosive of national political unity. To prevent economic  regionalism, the Founders imposed a constitutional prohibition on state and regional efforts to discriminate against goods and services produced elsewhere in the nation. To tamper with that constitutional prohibition is to tamper with the mainspring of the nation's political and economic fabric.  
   Professor Neuborne's research on the topic of interstate compacts, which originate under Congress' grant of power in Article I, Section 10, revealed that prior to the Northeast Regional Dairy Compact, Congress had never granted the compact power to enable states to engage in economic protectionism. Two hundred ninety-nine times before, the compact power had been used for a constitutionally legitimate purpose. Only now, with the advent of the dairy compact, has Congress ever contorted the meaning of Article I, Section 10 as an opportunity to set up a protectionist, multi-state cartel, in direct conflict with the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. 
   The Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that by granting to Congress the power to regulate interstate commerce via Article I, Section 8, the Constitution carries with it a negative implication precluding the states from engaging in protectionist schemes that favor local economic interests at the expense of national competitors. 
   Mr. President, are we not in fact returning to the very types of behavior that the Constitution was in large part designed to remedy? Are we really willing to pit region against region, and create protectionist regimes, under the guise of dairy compacts, even within our own country? 
   The next pro-compact argument I would like to address is the claim that the compact is necessary to guarantee an ``adequate supply of fresh, locally produced milk'' to consumers. As I have said before, I believe the constant refrain that compact supporters are merely trying to guarantee an ``adequate supply of fresh, locally produced milk'' is a calculated deception designed to mislead consumers into believing that without this legislation, there may not be a consistent supply of milk in the grocer's dairy case. This is simply false our nation produces three times more milk than it consumes as a beverage. And I should note that Minnesota farmers have not come to the federal government asking for pricing advantages so they can grow oranges or lemons and guarantee Minnesota consumers a quote ``adequate supply of fresh, locally produced citrus.'' Minnesota farmers 
   want to produce what they produce best, which are dairy products, and they can deliver them to the consumer much cheaper, too. 
   In fact, some compact supporters have the audacity to claim that without a compact, the region would pay more for milk as high shipping costs for imported milk was factored into the price. This is also false. If local producers can sell a product for less than their competitors, then they would have no need of a compact. They could keep their markets by beating the price of the competition. But the truth is, high quality milk can be trucked into New England at the peak of freshness and at less cost than it can be produced in most New England states. 
   Compact supporters also claim that the compacts are necessary to save the small, family dairy farm. Interestingly enough, according to USDA figures, the average dairy herd size is 85 head in Vermont, while in Minnesota it's 57 head. This means that herd sizes in Vermont are almost 50% larger than those in Minnesota. So much for the idea that the compact is protecting dairy producers from competing against large, Midwestern dairy farmers. This is just one of the distortions that I have had to deal with in this dairy debate, and I'm tired of the hard-working dairy farmers in Minnesota being labeled as, quote, ``corporate dairy farmers.'' The average Minnesota dairy farmer grazes a 57-head herd on 160 acres. I know Minnesota dairy farmers don't want to consolidate into larger and larger operations; they just want a level playing field where they can earn enough to support their families and continue to do something they love to do. I would ask my opponents to please not cloak the dairy cartels with the mantle of supposedly helping the little guy against encroaching agribusiness conglomerates. The hard evidence shows that on average, the wealthy, large producers are not, I repeat, not, in the Midwest, and the rich will only get richer if a compact extension gets rammed through the Senate. 
   Mr. President, not only are certain members of this Congress trying to impose expensive dairy compacts on the American consumer, but they are also trying to strong-arm through milk marketing order changes that adversely impact both Upper Midwest producers in the dairy heartland of America and low-income consumers. I also want to review how we have arrived at this point today where Congress is trying not only through compacts but through the milk marketing order system, to blatantly seize market share from dairy producers in one area of the country and give it to producers in another. This bill not only hits Midwest producers once, but twice. 
   The current milk marketing system requires processors to pay higher minimum prices for fluid milk the further the region is located from Eau Claire, Wisconsin. To reform this antiquated, Depression-era method for supplying milk to consumers, which basically picks winners and losers in the dairy industry, Congress, through the 1996 FAIR Act, required USDA to significantly reduce the number of milk marketing orders, and transition to a more market-oriented system of milk distribution. After many months of study and having received comments from hundreds of market participants, USDA proposed Options 1-A and 1-B. The Option 1-A proposal made minimal changes to the old marketing order pricing system, while Option 1-B contained some basic free market reforms and modernizations of the system. The Upper Midwest did not like what it saw in 1-B, actually, and liked the compromise even less, but it was a small step in the right direction, and we supported it as a compromise. 
   The compromise came after the USDA received testimony concerning the two alternatives, and, as I said previously, the final rule takes steps toward simplifying and modernizing the milk marketing order system. As an Option 1-B supporter, I hoped for a proposal closer to 1-B, but accepted the need for compromise and, again, supported it. Implementation of the new compromise orders has unfortunately been postponed by a lawsuit in federal court. 
   Option 1-A is basically no reform, and would ignore the direction of Congress in the FAIR Act. It would increase prices for consumers, affecting most the low-income consumers that spend a high percentage of their wages on food. Option 1-A also keeps in place a regionally discriminatory milk pricing 
   system that benefits producers in some parts of the country at the expense of dairy farmers in other regions, much like compacts. Again, it's a government program that picks winners and losers, not allowing the market to set the prices. It is opposed by free market taxpayer advocacy groups, consumer groups, regional producer groups, and processor groups, and it does nothing to protect the nation's supply of fresh fluid milk. Our nation produces an abundance of milk that is sufficient to supply consumers' needs. 
   Secretary Glickman, writing about the final rule, said that:  
   USDA's own analysis shows that nationally, dairy farmers will realize virtually the same cash receipts under the new, fairer plan as they do now, and when aggregated, the all-milk price will remain essentially unchanged from that under the existing program, which virtually all sides agree sorely needs changing[.]  
   Moreover, Agriculture Committee Chairman LUGAR said that the final compromise rule ``is a good first step toward a policy that places the nation's dairy industry in a position to better meet the challenges of the global markets of the new century[.]'' 
   What we also need to ask ourselves is why are we considering these controversial issues without going through the committee process, with full hearings and testimony? The Agriculture Committee has jurisdiction over milk marketing orders; nonetheless, we are here today trying to circumvent that jurisdiction. 
   Again, the final rule is a compromise, not the best for either 1A or 1B advocates but a middle ground. We should not rush to reverse a process that took months to complete in order to replace it with 1A. Adoption of 1A would in effect maintain the status quo that, again, heavily favors some dairy farms at the expense of others. And please  don't look at this debate as a mere balance sheet of who wins and who loses, or count votes that way. Remember that the Upper Midwest has been at a price disadvantage for more than sixty years, and this reform was only a modest, and, in fact, inadequate, attempt to correct the unfairness. Compacts are bad enough, but retaining these failed dairy policies of the past on top of that is incomprehensible. 
   Currently 85% of the milk produced in the Midwest goes into manufacturing. When other regions of the country receive higher Class I differentials, the excess production spills into Midwestern markets and lowers the prices that our producers receive. Artificially inflated prices will always, always, always increase production. You can count on it like the sun rising in the morning. And by artificially inflating milk prices in areas of the country that are not particularly suitable to dairy production, Congress is literally trying to micro-manage where America's milk will be produced, and to take away dairy markets from the Upper Midwest. 
   No other product receives the same kind of discriminatory pricing treatment that milk does in our country. The Upper Midwest can produce milk for a third less than some regions of the country. Why should the family farmers in the Upper Midwest not be allowed to benefit from the comparative advantage they have in milk production? 
   Some will claim that the compromise reform will cost the dairy farmers across the country $200 million. This is not true. Actually, according to a USDA study, net farm income will be higher under the compromise rule in comparison to the status quo. And the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute at Iowa State, an agricultural policy research group, concluded that 60% of the nation's dairy farmers would receive more income under the USDA plan. 
   Some supporters of H.R. 1402 (the legislation upon which these provisions now before us are based) also make the same argument as dairy compact proponents that if we do not implement H.R. 1402 then milk will be produced by agribusiness, or that further farm consolidations will occur. Going back to the USDA figures, North Carolina, whose congressional delegation has argued strenuously for the reversion to Option 1A, has an almost 20% larger per head average dairy farm size than my home state of Minnesota. Of course, Minnesota is part of one of the regions of the country that the opposition tries to demonize as the center of corporate dairy farming. Proof that this is not a battle between, quote, ``small family dairy farms'' and large Midwestern dairy farms only gets more striking. New York, a state that has also seen significant political support for H.R. 1402, has an average herd size per dairy farm that is 37% larger than Minnesota's. Georgia's average herd 
   size is 72% larger than Minnesota's, and Florida's average herd size is four times larger than my home state's. Like the dairy compact argument, so much for the idea that we are saving the family farmer through passage of H.R. 1402. 
   As an aside, because of the blatant unfairness of the system, and because the efforts of Upper Midwesterners to compromise in good faith have been ignored, forcing us to fight these last minute riders and strong-arm tactics, I have recently introduced legislation to totally deregulate the milk marketing order system, effective upon the date of enactment. This milk marketing order system is a relic from the past. It's a byzantine arrangement of complicated pricing formulas that looks like something conceived in 1980s Eastern Europe. It's time to tear this entire decaying, outdated infrastructure down, and start anew with an even playing field on which all producers can compete. That's what my legislation does, and I ask my colleagues who believe in fair trade and a fair shake for hard working farmers to sign on as cosponsors. 
   Mr. President, the dairy compact and the other dairy provisions attached to this legislation are anti-competitive, anti-consumer, unprincipled, and an affront to the family dairy farmers in my state. To be candid, I'm thoroughly disgusted by this entire turn of events. We have sacrificed any basic sense of fairness during this process. These provisions have been added at the last minute, behind closed doors because they won't survive the scrutiny of public debate. Because of the blatant injustice that is being done to Minnesota farmers, I am committed to joining my Upper Midwest colleagues in doing all I can do to ensure that this legislation does not reach the President's desk. 
   Mr. President, I would now like to read several newspaper editorials that have been written across the country in opposition to dairy compacts and H.R. 1402. 
   To begin, from the March 15, 1997 edition of The New York Times:  
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman blundered last year when he approved a dairy cartel in the Northeast that would jack up consumer prices by perhaps 25 percent........The Dairy cartel, also called a compact, would control the production and distribution of milk in New England, raising its price by between 13 and 35 cents a gallon. That would pump money into the bank accounts of the region's 3,600 dairy farmers by pushing prices back up to last year's sky-high levels. But it would hit 13 million consumers in Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut and Rhode Island with an added cost of up to $100 million. Poor parents, who spend about twice as much of their income on food as do non-poor families, would suffer the most. Food stamps would buy less milk and other dairy products. High milk prices would also raise the cost of national, state and local nutrition programs. With Washington cutting money for welfare, food stamps and other poverty programs, this is no time to impose needless costs on the poor. It will be hard for Mr. Glickman to admit he erred when he approved the cartel. But it would be even harder on parents to pay more for their children's milk.  
   From the March 2, 1998 USA Today:  
   Imagine being a widget maker in Georgia or New Hampshire with a federal guarantee that assures you a higher price for your product than widget makers in Wisconsin or Iowa. Sounds incredible, huh? 
   Imagine being a cattle raiser in Florida or Oregon with a guaranteed price for your beef that's better than what ranchers in Texas or Nebraska can get. Impossible? Yes--but only because you're producing widgets or hamburger. If you're in the milk industry, it's business as usual. 
   Pressured by the dairy industry, the government maintains a Depression-era formula that makes some cows (and their owners) more equal than others, depending on where they live. Millions of consumers and taxpayers pay the price; higher milk costs for themselves, higher taxes for government-bought milk for schools and other programs....... 
   Apologists for government control claim the program is necessary to keep farmers in business and assure a supply of milk. The number of dairy cows plunged from 23.6 million in 1940 to 9.4 million in 1996; farms with dairy cows dropped from 4.7 million in 1940 to 155,300 in 1992. But the milk produced per cow has nearly quadrupled. U.S. milk production is up from 109 billion pounds in 1940 to a projected 162 billion pounds in 2000, despite a 60% reduction in the number of cows. And while sales of cheese, cream and speciality products like eggnog and yogurt are up, U.S. demand for liquid milk has been essentially flat for more than 20 years. 
   Yet dairy farmers continue to get special privileges, eluding even the 1996 ``Freedom to Farm'' law that committed the government to phasing out price supports and market manipulation for corn, soybeans, wheat and other commodities........Aggressive dairy lobbies in state capitals from Louisiana to New York are pressing to form or enlarge new regional compacts that permit even more manipulation of milk prices at the consumer's expense--adding up to 15 or 20 cents a gallon. That's on top of the indefensible marketing orders, which inflate retail milk prices by at least $1.5 billion a year for a program that isn't needed. Congress abolished ``welfare as we know it'' for mothers and children. Welfare for cows and dairy farmers should end as well.  
   The next editorial shows that though the compacts are ostensibly put in place to help small dairy farms, they have failed to do so, and exist as subsidies to large New England operations. Following are excerpts from a July 19, 1999 Boston Globe editorial:  
   Dairy farming in New England, especially in Massachusetts has been a chancy proposition for small, family-run operation........Congress, which must soon decide whether to extend the system's enabling legislation, should modify it to focus more closely on smaller farms rather than lavishing money on larger operations that are fully capable of competing in a tough economic environment. Congress should also resist the temptation to expand the system to other parts of the country....... 
   The rescue effort now in place is a federally sanctioned system of mandated price supports, which amount to about 14 cents a gallon. In Massachusetts this generates $40 million annually, but only $2 million goes to Massachusetts farmers, with most of the balance going to Vermont farms, many of which are larger and have lower costs. Massachusetts's agriculture commissioner, Jay Healy, has proposed limiting the subsidy to a fixed level of production, about 1.5 million gallons of milk annually, which is typical for smaller farms.   
   Concluding with an excerpt from the editorial, it says:  
   Even the New England system provides more subsidies than are needed to achieve its objective. The funds that now go to larger farms would be more effective if they were used to increase small-farmer subsidies, typically $3,000 to $4,000 per farm.  
   Now, I must disagree with the editorialist's assessment that the subsidies should be continued, but I find it very significant that even in New England they recognize that since the subsidy does not specifically target the smaller farms, it disproportionately helps the larger operations because the subsidy is based upon the volume produced. It should not be surprising that efforts to cap the subsidy to a fixed level of production have been successfully resisted by the large dairy farms in New England. 
   The next editorial I will read is from the April 27, 1999 edition of the Houston Chronicle:  
   The Texas House of Representatives recently approved a bill that seeks to raise milk prices and deprive Texans of the benefits of competition. The Senate need not reflect long before rejecting it. House Bill 2000 would require Texas to join the Southern Dairy Compact, which sets the minimum price for milk paid to producers in its member states. The minimum price inevitably would be higher than the price Texans pay in a competitive market.  
   I should note at this point that Congress has not in fact authorized the Southern Dairy Compact, and if common sense, prevails, it won't. Congress has arbitrarily chosen New England consumers to pay the milk tax, and New England producers to receive it. 
   Again continuing with the Houston Chronicle article:  
   Texas dairy farmers are producing all the milk that Texas families and dairy product manufacturers need and more. There is no reason why state government should make families pay more for the milk, ice cream and other dairy products they buy. The state purpose of House Bill 2000 is to preserve family dairy farms and ensure a supply of fresh milk. But history shows that milk price controls heighten the financial advantage enjoyed by the largest producers without sustaining uneconomical small farms. 
   Furthermore, anyone who thinks Texas needs added government regulation to provide a reliable milk supply has not seen the dairy cases at the supermarket that are filled to overflowing with milk and dairy products of every description. Why change a system that provides ample supply and variety at the lowest possible price? Adding Texas to the Southern Dairy Compact would do little to help Texas milk producers, but it would deprive Texas dairy product manufacturers of an advantage they enjoy over competitors in state where the price of milk is controlled. 
   This bill is bad for consumers, bad for manufacturers and bad for the taxpayers who pay for or subsidize milk consumed by schoolchildren, prisoners, patients in public hospitals and food stamp recipients. Few bills could provide more reason to reject them than the authors of House Bill 2000 have provided.  
   The next editorial is from the June 15, 1999 edition of the Philadelphia Inquirer:  
   In 1996, Congress revamped federal farm laws, intending to ratchet down government's intrusion in agriculture. But a bill now pending would use that law to create regional cartels that would set artificially high prices for milk. Pennsylvania consumers should be lobbying lawmakers against this move. Despite the fact that the state's outdated milk-board system already sets minimum milk prices--but no maximum--the legislature last week allowed Pennsylvania to join the cartel known as the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. 
   Consumers here who consistently pay more for milk than in neighboring states should wince at the prospect of a regional price-fixing body imposing still higher prices. Here's how it works: Congress established the Northeast compact under the 1996 act, an agreement among six New England states to prop up milk prices in an effort to save small dairy farms. When milk prices on the open market fall below a ceratin target price, the compact states tack a surcharge onto milk. The extra revenue is passed back to farmers; the higher milk price gets passed along to consumers. 
   The compact is set to expire October 1, but a bill introduced in April would make it permanent and expand it to include six more states, including Pennsylvania. What's worse, the bill also would establish a Southern Dairy Compact, which could include up to 15 more states. Already the Northeast compact has raised milk prices by almost 20 cents a gallon since its inception. By federal and state law, the compact could raise milk prices in Pennsylvania by about 70 cents a gallon, consumer groups warn. The logic behind the original legislation, to save small dairy farms, had some appeal. Dairy farms nationwide have been going out of business, usually because they are acquired by larger producers, at an average rate of 5.1% a year in the 1990s, experts say. 
   But that doesn't prove the compact would protect small farmers; it may hurt them. Larger dairy farms which produce the most milk reap the most benefit in subsidies from the compact. Alarmed by the potential harm both to middle-class consumers and low-income families, various groups are protesting the new bill. Nutrition and consumer groups, government-spending watchdogs and milk processors and retailers all have lined up against the concept. Congress should reject this attempt to extend the counterproductive intrusion on the workings of the free market. Let the milk cartel die.  
   The following editorial is from the January 5, 1999 issue of Newsday:  
   Despite a few new consumer protections that made the deal acceptable to the Democratic Assembly, the state should not have allowed New York's dairy farmers to join a regional milk cartel. This sour stuff will keep the wholesale price of milk artificially high, forcing processors and retailers to pass the cost on to consumers. The hit will fall hardest on the poorest parents who buy milk for their children. And it's not clear now much it will help the small farm owners most in need. 
   Besides, there are other ways to help dairy farmers that wouldn't necessarily push up milk prices in markets. The state, for instance, could cut or subsidize a variety of taxes about which farmers have complained. Meanwhile, wholesale milk prices are at a record high, easing some pressure on farmers. Entrance into the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact would tie New York's farmers into a New England cartel designed to keep prices higher when they otherwise would collapse. Rather than benefit from lower prices, consumers would pay the higher ones when wholesale prices soar. And the law's cap on retail prices is so high that, barring severe inflation, it won't ever be reached. Schools are protected but not other nonprofits. Now, there's only one way to stop this deal. Congress has to approve it. It shouldn't.''  
   This next editorial is from the April 4, 1999 edition of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution:  
   Since the federal Freedom to Farm Act was passed in 1996, the U.S. government has been trying to wean the nation's farmers, including the dairy industry, from government price supports and other subsidies that interfere with the workings of the free market. Unfortunately, the dairy industry is trying to undo that progress by pressuring Congress and states such as Georgia to approve interstate dairy compacts. If the industry succeeds in that lobbying campaign, consumers will have to pay higher prices for a basic food commodity essential for good health. 
   The compacts, if approved would essentially establish legal cartels for dairy farmers and allow the cartels to set milk prices higher than the market would otherwise allow. In Georgia, dairy farmers have rammed through the recent session of the General Assembly a bill allowing them to join the Southern Dairy Compact. The same bill was passed a year ago by the General Assembly but was vetoed by Gov. Zell Miller, who noted that it might be unconstitutional and would certainly raise costs for consumers. The decision whether to sign the latest bill rests with Miller's successor, Roy Barnes. 
   Barnes was elected last year in part by portraying himself as a consumers' advocate. If he honors the philosophy, he too should recognize the dairy compact as nothing more than a back-door tax increase and veto it accordingly. Government should not use its power to guarantee any business or industry a profit. 
   A dairy compact already exists in New England. After it was enacted in 1997, the price of milk rose from $2.54 and fluctuated to a high of $3.21 a gallon. Milk prices there initially jumped about 20 cents a gallon, enough to generate an additional $46.7 million for dairy farmers in less than two years. Not surprisingly, New England dairy farmers see the compact as a safety net designed to prevent their profits from dropping too dramatically. 
   Those who actually pay higher prices, however, see it as little more than a special-interest tax increase that will only hurt consumers, particularly the poor, the elderly and those on fixed incomes. Milk prices go up and down monthly all over the country, but when prices drop significantly in the spring and fall, they only drop slightly in dairy compact states. The savings to the consumer is lost so the dairy farmer can keep a high return on the product. 
   ``It socialism. It's a controlled economy,'' said John Schnittker, an economist with Public Voice for Food and Health Policy. ``Compacts are a really bad deal for consumers. They add about 22 cents a gallon to today's milk price. And they keep paying high prices when prices all over drop.' Nine southern states besides Georgia have already approved creation of a Southern Dairy Compact to mimic the protectionism found in New England. However, that and other proposed compacts must still be approved by Congress, which also has to decide whether to renew the New England Dairy Compact.'' 
   Congress should reject both these proposals as unnecessary, counterproductive intrusions on the workings of the free market. However, if Barnes signs the Georgia law and Congress approves the Southern compact, Georgia consumers are stuck. The state can  withdraw from the compact only through passage of another law by Congress and then only after a one-year waiting period. Approval of dairy compacts in the South would not suspend the law of supply and demand. It would only distort it. Some economists predict that as a result of higher prices, dairy compacts would reduce milk consumption by 8 percent nationwide. Those most vulnerable would be families with young children, who in many cases are already struggling to make ends meet. 
   Georgia's dairy industry is going through a painful consolidation. The state lost 117 dairy farms over the past four years, and farmers warn that without government protection, more and more milk will have to be imported from other states. However, dairy farms in neighboring states have also been disappearing; the trend toward consolidation is nationwide. Furthermore, milk from Alabama or Tennessee tastes the same as Georgia milk, and today's technology allows quick transport to prevent milk products from spoiling. 
   Free enterprise, competition and the open market have been the economic pillars of the United States' economy for more than 200 years. Every experiment at subsidizing an industry has proven to be a failure, particularly in agriculture. Gov. Roy Barnes should protect Georgia consumers and families by vetoing that state's entry into the Southern Dairy Compact. And Congress should dismiss the entire concept as an unnecessary infringement on free enterprise.  
   I also want to share with my colleagues some editorials concerning the milk marketing order system. 
   This editorial is from The Dallas Morning News, dated September 14, 1999. It says:  
   Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura wants Beaumont, Texas to be the center of the dairy universe instead of Eau Claire, Wisconsin. Mr. Ventura knows that there are no dairy cows in Beaumont. Nevertheless, his logic is faultless. That's because federal farm policy dictates that the farther a dairy farmer lives from Eau Claire, the more milk processors must pay him for his milk. Minnesota profits little from the arrangement because it borders Wisconsin. But it is 1,200 miles from Beaumont. So making Beaumont the new Eau Claire makes sense for Minnesota's hard-pressed dairy farmers. 
   In truth, Mr. Ventura favors a free market in agriculture. His facetious advocacy for Beaumont is designed to focus public attention on absurd federal dairy policies, which punish efficient producers and gouge consumers. The United States needs to abandon the Depression-era thinking that led it to calculate milk prices based largely on dairy farms' proximity to Eau Claire. Times have changed; U.S. agricultural policy remains mired in the 1930s. 
   Unfortunately, Congress seems poised to revoke the few tentative reforms that it passed in 1996 and to expand and give extended life to a program that would create consumer-antagonistic milk cartels in sections of the country. A simplified milk-pricing system is supposed to go into effect on October 1. And federal price supports are supposed to end on Dec. 31. But a key congressional committee has approved a bill that would stifle both of these reforms. Another congressional committee is expected to vote soon on a bill that would expand a milk cartel of six northeastern states to as many as 27 states; if Congress does nothing, the cartel would disappear on October 1. 
   Congress should leave the reforms in place and let the milk cartel ride into the sunset. Monkeying with the free marked has raised prices for consumers and hasn't kept marginal dairy farms from going bankrupt.  
   This next editorial is from the July 29, 1999 Chicago Tribune:

<TEXT>
   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, a year ago I was here in this chamber speaking on the 1998 Omnibus Appropriations legislation. I criticized the abusive process that made the entire negotiations exclusive, arbitrary, and conducted behind closed doors by only a few congressional leaders and White House staff, and few Members of the Congress had any idea what was in the bill but were asked to approve it without adequate review and amendments. I also urged the Congress not to repeat the mistake that we need to reform the process and start the process early in the year to avoid appropriations pressure. 
   Many of my colleagues shared my views at the time and agreed that the federal budget process had become a reckless game, and it not only weakened the nation's fiscal discipline but also undermined the system of checks and balances established by the Constitution. 
   At the beginning of the 106th Congress, I argued repeatedly in this chamber that the key to a successful budget process was to pursue comprehensive budget process reforms. I have introduced legislation to achieve these goals which includes legislation that would force us to pass a legally-binding federal budget, allow an automatic continuing resolution to kick-in to prevent government shutdown, set aside funds each year in the budget for true emergencies; strengthen the enforcement of budgetary controls; enhance accountability for Federal spending; mitigate the bias toward higher spending; modify Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) procedures to accommodate budget surpluses; and establish a look-back sequester mechanism to ensure the Social Security surplus will be protected. We also need to pursue biennial budgeting and getting rid of the so-called ``baseline budgeting.'' 
   We were assured by Senate leaders that we were going to pursue real budget process reform early this year and that we would never have another omnibus spending bill in the future. 
   Mr. President, I believe what we have before us today is a repeat of what was promised to never occur again. Once more, with inadequate time to review. The Houses passed this omnibus bill with absolutely no knowledge of what was in it. This is nearly a play-by-play of 1998 because we have not reformed our budget process. As a result, after seven Continuing Resolutions, we have before us an omnibus spending bill that is full of creative financing and earmarked pork programs. 
   Mr. President, when will we ever learn our lessons? 
   Mr. President, it is entirely irresponsible and reckless that Congress has over-used advanced appropriations, used directed scoring, emergency spending and many other budgetary smoke and mirrors to dodge fiscal discipline and significantly increase government spending. Like last year's omnibus bill, this legislation is heavily loaded with irresponsible and inappropriate provisions. It is severely flawed by new spending, no CBO scoring, gimmick offsets and billions of pork-barrel programs. Many last-minute spending needs were loaded into this omnibus bill just in the last few days. I still cannot even tell you what they are, since we haven't been given enough time to review it. The double whammy delivered to Minnesota dairy farmers by adding a two-year extension of the Northeast dairy compact and 1 A order reform is my main reason for opposing this bill. These outrageous last-minute additions seriously hurt Mid-West dairy farmers and are the reason why we are still here today. 
   This omnibus bill has again proven that big government is well and alive in Washington. The bill provides a total $385 billion for just five spending bills, a significant increase over last year's levels. Congress is recklessly and irresponsibly throwing more and more taxpayers' money to help the President enlarge the government. Billions of dollars were added to the spending legislation avoiding the normal committee process, without any amendments and full debate. If hiring more police officers and more elementary school teachers is the solution to stop crime and improve education, let us have an open debate on the merits of the policy through the usual democratic process. Let's not cut deals behind the closed door in meetings by just a few. 
   Since we established statutory spending limits, Washington has repeatedly broken them because of lack of fiscal discipline. We have done so again this year. 
   In my judgment, this omnibus spending bill and the other appropriation bills have been enacted have spent billions of dollars more than the spending caps if we would use honest numbers to score them. To date, the Congressional Budget Office has not provided us with its estimates on this bill. Because of the CBO's inability to score the bill, we do not know what the real cost of it, or whether it stays within the 302(b) allocations. 
   But we do know many accounting rules have been bent in putting this bill together to avoid the tighter spending caps. Let me explain: This bill relies heavily on the so-called ``directed scoring'' technique for it increased spending. Traditionally, Congress always uses the Congressional Budget Office estimates for scorekeeping. However, because the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has more favorable estimates for some government programs than the CBO, the Congress simply directed CBO to use OMB numbers to keep score for this year's spending bills. 
   One of these OMB estimates the CBO was directed to use is the $2.4 billion spectrum sales revenue expected to be collected next year. We all know that level of sales will not be reached. In fact, we criticized the President for using this overoptimistic 
   number in his past budgets. 
   Just by using the OMB's rosy estimates, without making any hard choices, Congress has increased this year's 302(b) allocations by over $17.4 billion. But the real danger is, by the end of the year, the CBO will use its own estimates to score our budget surplus or deficit. If OMB's numbers prove to be unrealistic and wrong, we end up spending the Social Security surplus we have vowed to protect and it will be too late to adjust the budget accordingly. This is the last thing we want to  do. That is why I was disappointed my bill to provide an automatic sequester triggered by spending of the Social Security surplus was not passed. This procedure is absolutely essential to ensure we keep our commitment to protect Social Security. 
   Again and again, Washington lowers the fiscal bar and then jumps over it, or finds ways around it, at the expense of the American taxpayers, so all the spenders and those special interests who benefit at other expenses go home happy. 
   Mr. President, abusive use of emergency spending is another gimmick applied in this omnibus spending bill, as well as in the other appropriation bills we've passed. Last year alone, Congress appropriated $35 billion for so-called emergencies. This year again, over $24 billion of emergency spending was appropriated. Since 1991, emergency spending has totaled over $145 billion. Most of these ``emergencies'' were used to fund regular government programs, not unanticipated true emergencies. Emergency spending is sought as a vehicle to add on even more spending priorities and thus to dodge fiscal discipline because emergency spending is not counted against the spending caps. This has gone too far. We need a better way to budget for emergencies. Most of this spending can be planned within our budget limits. Even natural disasters happen regularly--why not budget for them, as I proposed in my budget process legislation. 
   Mr. President, while I agree ``advance appropriations,'' ``advance funding'' and ``forward funding'' are not uncommon practice here, it does not mean they are the right thing to do, particularly when these budget techniques are used to dodge much-needed fiscal discipline. 
   In the past five years, ``advance appropriations'' have increased dramatically, jumping from $1.9 billion in FY 1996 to $11.6 billion in FY 2000, an increase of $9.7 billion over five years. This year, at least $19 billion was advanced into FY 2001 and outyears which will create even worse problems for us next year and in the future. 
   I understand the upward spending pressure the Congress is facing this year and in the outyears. But I believe we should, and can, meet this challenge by prioritizing and streamlining government programs while maintaining fiscal discipline. We can reduce wasteful, unnecessary, duplicated, low-priority government programs to fund the necessary and responsible function of government. But we need a Biennial Budget, as Senator DOMENICI recommends, to give us time to do this. 
   Instead of streamlining federal spending, we have thrown in more money to please big spenders without the needed analysis to ensure the spending will help us solve problems. Like last year's bill, this bill looks like a Christmas tree full of pork projects. Many are added in the last minute negotiation. But we don't know exactly what they are and how much they cost, because again we have not been given enough time to review this bill. Here are a few examples as identified by Senator MCCAIN: 
   An entirely new title is included in the legislation during last minute negotiations, the ``Mississippi National Forest Improvement Act of 1999,'' which had not previously been considered in the previous Senate or House bills. A half million dollars is added for the Salt Lake City Olympic tree program. It earmarked $2 million for the University of Mississippi Center for Sustainable Health Outreach and $3 million for the Center for Environmental Medicine and Toxicology at the University of Mississippi Medical Center at Jackson. An earmark of $3 million is added for the Wheeling National Heritage Area and $3 million for the Lincoln Library. It earmarked $2 million for Tupelo School District in Mississippi for technology innovation. It includes an earmark of $3 million for the Southwest Pennsylvania Heritage Area. It also earmarked $1 million for the completion of the Easter Seal Society's Early Childhood Development Project for the Mississippi River Delta Region and $1 million for the Center for Literacy and Assessment at the University of Southern Mississippi. It also includes an increase of $3.6 million for Washington State Hatchery Improvement. 
   As the result, we've ended up spending much more money than we should have. My biggest fear, Mr. President, is this omnibus spending legislation may allow Congress and the President to spend some of the Social Security surplus by not imposing an adequate across-the-board spending reduction. 
   Even counting all the ``directed scoring,'' ``advanced appropriations,'' every penny of the $14 billion on-budget surplus and other budgetary gimmicks, it is estimated that Congress could still dip into the Social Security surplus by nearly $5 billion. To fill that gap we need to reduce government spending by 0.97 percent across-the-board. But the agreement reached between congressional leaders and the White House allows only a 0.38 percent reduction which would result in $1.3 billion savings. Clearly, this is done just for face-saving reason, and will not ensure that the Social Security surplus is protected. 
   The proponents of this omnibus bill may quickly point out that there are offsets to fund the new spending. But we all know most of the offsets are simply gimmicks. The best example is a $3.5 billion transfer from the Federal Reserve surplus to the Treasury. 
   As you know, there is nothing new about this proposal and it has been around for quite a while. In the past, Chairman Greenspan called this transfer of the Fed's surplus to the Treasury ``a gimmick that has no real economic impact on the deficit.'' Because it is just an intra-governmental transfer that would not change the government's true economic and financial position. 
   Other offsets such as a one-day delay in pay for our military and civilians will cause enormous financial hardship for millions of American families who depend on the regular paychecks to pay their mortgage, daycare for their kids, and other priorities. Many small businesses and contractors can be adversely affected by this offset as well. Again, this has proven that the victims of Washington's spending spree are the American taxpayers. 
   Mr. President, there are many provisions in the omnibus appropriations bill I support, such as the BBA Medicare fix which includes reinstatement of Minnesota's DSH allotment, the State Department Authorization which includes payment of the U.N. arrears and my embassy security proposal, Home Satellite TV access and others. In fact I have worked hard on many of these proposals. However, I believe the dairy provisions and the general lack of fiscal discipline in the bill have far overshadowed the good provisions. Overall, it is a bad deal for working Americans in general and it is a bad deal for my fellow Minnesotans in particular. I therefore cannot in good conscience vote for this fiscally irresponsible legislation.

   Mr. GRAMS. At the Brandenburg Gate, West Berlin, on June 12, 1987, President Reagan issued a stunning challenge: ``General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization: Come here to this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!'' And less than three years later, the wall crumbled, along with the threat of communism as a viable, universalist alternative to democracy. 
   I remember reporting on the fall of the Berlin Wall as a newscaster. I remember those first tentative attempts to climb over it, and the rush of revelers that followed when no shots were fired. Remember, the wall was built to keep people in, and freedom out. The guard posts in the East were facing eastward, not toward West Berlin. It is incredible that the tenth anniversary of this seminal event passed almost without comment. For it marked the end of the Soviet Empire, and foreshadowed the end of the Soviet Union itself. The global correlation of forces, as the Soviets used to say, aligned with freedom, not oppression. 
   The Wall crumbled because President Reagan was committed to achieving peace through strength. The Reagan Doctrine asserted the need to confront and rollback communism by aiding national liberation movements in Afghanistan, Angola, Grenada, Cambodia, and Nicaragua. He proved that once countries were in the Soviet camp, they need not remain there forever. He realized that our national prestige is reinforced and enhanced when we operate with a coherent, concise, and understandable foreign policy. And by doing so, he succeeded in inspiring and supporting dissidents behind the Iron Curtain who eroded the mortar of that Wall. 
   In contrast, the Clinton Administration has reacted to foreign policy crises, but has failed to a develop a foreign policy. The Administration has lurched from managing one crisis to another, but never articulated the national interest in accordance with a core philosophy. Instead of consistently safeguarding and promoting our values abroad, it has acted on an ad hoc basis according to the needs of the moment, confusing our allies and emboldening rogue nations. Serbia was emboldened to conduct ethnic cleansing in Kosovo; North Korea was emboldened to develop nuclear weapons; Saddam Hussein was emboldened to strengthen his position in northern Iraq. 
   What is the Clinton Doctrine? We have been told about a ``do-ability doctrine'' whereby the United States acts ``in the places where our addition of action will, in fact, be the critical difference.'' However, that alone cannot be the criteria for U.S. intervention. Under that formulation we could be expected to intervene anywhere in the world. And as Secretary Albright stated as our Ambassador to the U.N. ``we are not the world's policeman, nor are we running a charity or a fire department.'' 
   However, as a practical matter, the combination of a ``do-ability doctrine'' with so-called ``assertive multilateralism''--places the United States in the very position which Secretary Albright derided. It has resulted in both the abdication of our responsibilities and the misguided projection of our power. Instead of applying the Reagan Doctrine by equipping and training the Bosnian forces over our allies' objections, the Administration subcontracted our role of arming the Bosnians to a terrorist regime in Iran, unnecessarily endangering the lives of U.S. troops. Instead of arming the Bosnians, we supported our allies standing by in U.N. blue helmets, watching unarmed civilians be massacred in Srebrenica. In contrast, the attempt at nation building in Somalia, and the refusal to provide equipment requested on the ground because it would send the wrong signal, sacrificed the lives of 18 brave soldiers without regard to whether such action advanced our vital concerns. When this Administration acts according to the exigencies of the moment instead of according to an underlying philosophy, the country lurches from paralysis to ``mission creep'' without regard to the national interest. 
   Recently, there has been discussion of the possibility of reworking our entire military force structure--which is presently based on the capacity to fight two simultaneous major regional conflicts--in order to enable us to commit US troops to an ever-growing number of multilateral ``peacekeeping'' missions. I am concerned that we may sacrifice our vital national security interests in order to be able to participate in peripheral endeavors. We should not be shortsighted. We should not lose sight of what we must do in  order to accomplish what we can do. Our military should be used to protect our national security interests, not provide peacekeeping in areas without strategic significance. 
   That kind of distinction will never happen under the Clinton Administration. President Clinton does not have the clarity of purpose of Ronald Reagan. No walls will be torn down. There is no Clinton Doctrine. There is only a half-hearted attempt to justify random acts under an artificial rubric and a series of slogans. And our country is the worse for it. We should note the fall of the Berlin Wall symbolizes more than just a victory of liberty over totalitarianism. It shows that armed with a core philosophy, a coherent doctrine, and a lot of courage, there is no limit to what we can accomplish.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the amendment offered by Senators HATCH and ASHCROFT that will help to reduce drug abuse and illegal narcotics trafficking throughout the United States. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation. 
   I am very concerned about the rate of illegal drug abuse across the nation. According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, there are over 13 million current users of any illicit drug among those aged 12 or over, and 4 million chronic drug users in America. 
   These national statistics are similar to drug abuse patterns in my home state of Minnesota. The 1998 Minnesota Student Survey conducted by the Minnesota Department of Children, Families and Learning and the Minnesota Department of Human Services revealed increased marijuana use in each age group studied--sixth graders, ninth graders, and high school seniors--over the past three years. In 1998, 30 percent of Minnesota seniors surveyed reported using marijuana in the previous year. 
   In addition, the high volume of illegal methamphetamine trafficking and production in Minnesota has placed enormous strain upon the resources of federal, state and local law enforcement agencies investigating the abuse of this deadly substance. In recent years, the number of methamphetamine treatment admissions to treatment centers and ``meth'' arrests of juveniles and adults has increased dramatically throughout our communities. Methamphetamine has become the drug of choice throughout Minnesota and is closely associated with increased crime and gang violence. 
   I am also troubled by the large number of national drug trafficking organizations that have established operations in Minnesota. The alarming rate of meth production and trafficking in my state has been caused by independent organizations that run clandestine laboratories in apartment complexes, farms, motel rooms and residences with inexpensive, over-the-counter materials. The secretive nature of the manufacturing process involves toxic chemicals, and frequently results in fires, damaging explosions, and destruction to our environment. Meth trafficking in both Minnesota and the United States has severely threatened the health and safety of our citizens, and crippled our national movement against drug abuse. 
   For these reasons, I am pleased that the amendment offered by Senators HATCH and ASHCROFT includes the major provisions of legislation that I have recently cosponsored, the ``DEFEAT 
   Meth Act'' introduced by Senator ASHCROFT. This amendment will increase penalties for meth crimes, provide additional federal assistance to local law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute meth trafficking, implement community-based methamphetamine treatment and prevention programs, and safely cleanup illegal meth labs. 
   In my view, any proposal to combat illegal meth trafficking should also provide added security to our nation's farmers and farm businesses who must protect their farms from the theft of anhydrous ammonia, a crop fertilizer which is often used as an ingredient in the illegal manufacture of methamphetamine. Importantly, this amendment makes it illegal to steal anhuydrous ammonia or to transport stolen anhudrous ammonia across state lines if a person knows that this product will be used to illegally manufacture a controlled substance such as methamphetamine. 
   As someone working to secure High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area designation for the State of Minnesota, I am also very pleased that this proposal provides additional resources to investigate and prosecute meth production and trafficking in HIDTA regions throughout the country. This program administered by the nation's drug czar is a critical component of our federal drug control strategy. 
   The Hatch-Ashcroft amendment also toughens federal policy toward powder cocaine dealers, building upon the ``Powder Cocaine Sentencing Act of 1999'' which I have supported throughout this Congress. As my colleagues know, the current law provides that a dealer must distribute 500 grams of powder cocaine to qualify for a 5-year mandatory minimum prison sentence, and distribute 5 grams of crack cocaine to qualify for that offense. These sentencing guidelines result in a 100-to-1 quantity ratio between powder and more severe crack cocaine distribution sentences. 
   The Hatch-Ashcroft amendment represents a fair and effective approach toward federal cocaine sentencing policy. Rather than make federal crack cocaine sentences more lenient, this amendment would reduce from 500 to 50 grams the amount of powder cocaine a person must be convicted of distributing before receiving a mandatory five-year sentence. This legislation would adjust the current 100-to-1 quantity ratio to 10-to-1 by toughening powder cocaine sentences with reducing crack cocaine sentences. 
   I share the concern of parents and families regarding the violence which is occurring at an alarming rate at our nation's schools. Our children should be provided with the opportunity to learn in a safe and drug-free environment. We should make it clear that drug offenders will not be allowed to prey upon the innocence of young people and students. 
   In my view, the Hatch-Ashcroft amendment will help local school districts stop the flow of illegal drugs into our classrooms. Specifically, this proposal increases the mandatory minimum penalties for distribution of  drugs to minors and for distribution of illegal drugs near schools and other locations frequented by juveniles. The amendment also requires school districts that receive federal funds to have expulsion policies for students who bring large quantities of drugs on school grounds. This is consistent with the current law which requires similar policies for students who bring firearms to school. 
   I understand the concerns expressed by some Members of Congress, federal judges, and the public regarding the fairness of mandatory minimum sentences. However, I believe mandatory minimum sentences for certain drug offenses is an important part of our national drug control policy and contributes to safer schools, work places, and communities. 
   Mr. President, the sale, manufacture and distribution of illegal drugs is one of the most difficult challenges facing our country. Drug abuse is a daily threat to the lives of young people and the health and safety of our communities. I believe a strong national anti-drug massage should include the proposals contained within this amendment. Passage of this proposal will provide greater protection to Americans from drug offenders, and drug-related crime and violence.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas and also the Senator from Kansas for their work on this issue. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to the bankruptcy homestead cap proposed as an amendment to the bankruptcy bill. I appreciate the fact that the sponsors of this amendment are attempting to curb abuse of the system, but I fear that in these difficult times for family farmers the homestead cap amendment could disproportionately impact struggling producers. 
   I will remind my colleagues that the Senate recently unanimously approved extension of chapter 12 of the bankruptcy code, which in part allows farmers to stay on their land if they are able to make rental payments to creditors. Just as farmers have needed extension of chapter 12 to weather the current economic downturn, they also need an adequate bankruptcy homestead exemption that will protect their homes and livelihoods from foreclosure as well. 
   I am aware that the Sessions/Kohl amendment exempts ``family farmers'' from the homestead provision, but many farmers will not qualify because of off-farm income earned by the family. This off-farm income has become necessary for survival for may farm families, and as long as such families are not eligible for the exclusion, I must oppose the amendment. 
   As the Senator from Texas mentioned, in Minnesota, the current homestead exemption is $200,000 property value and 160 acres. This is a reasonable, time-tested level of protection. We must remember that this property is not merely where the farmers make their home, but also where they earn their living. Congress recently passed $8.7 billion in emergency farm assistance to help family farmers continue the tradition of producing America's most basic needs, and we should not simultaneously undermine the position of these same farm families by denying them important bankruptcy protections. 
   Again, I know that the amendment sponsors are trying to stop abuse of the system by those who have irresponsibly accumulated debt, but I am afraid many hard working Minnesota farmer who are barely covering their families necessities may be adversely impacted. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Hutchison-Brownback amendment allowing states to affirmatively opt out of the cap on the homestead exemption. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to express my support and appreciation regarding actions taken at United Healthcare that clearly demonstrate to me that proposed congressional action in the area referred to as ``patient's rights'' can be best handled by the marketplace. 
   Yesterday, United Healthcare announced they will be changing the way they manage care in their health plans by giving physicians the final say in determining what course of treatment their patients will receive. In citing the reasons for the change of policy, United noted the savings resulting from their $100 million review process do not justify continuing it. 
   United Healthcare is the second-largest health insurer in the nation and I believe their actions signal an industrywide realization that their review process may be saving them less than they thought. 
   According to United Healthcare, 99 percent of their claims are approved despite an exhaustive review process. While this raises the question of exactly why the federal government needs to disrupt the entire health system by getting involved with one percent of health care claims, it also demonstrates our current private-sector health care providers must respond to consumer concerns or lose their customers to health providers that do. 
   Of course, United Healthcare will still have some review process and require physicians to notify them when a patient needs an expensive procedure or requires hospitalization. This is clear in all of our interests to ensure the appropriate treatments are considered. We should trust our physicians, but with the rapid advancements made in health care every day it is reasonable for us to have a team of experts review all the latest treatments, devices and pharmaceuticals. Clearly, this is an area where health plans are, and should be assisting physicians and ensuring quality health services are offered appropriately in their facilities. 
   By changing their review process, United Healthcare will reduce its medical monitoring staff by 20 percent and re-focus the remaining staff on Care Coordination efforts. 
   This saves money for the plan which in turn saves money for consumers through lower premiums. I believe it is a significant step in the right direction, proving once again, that market forces and demands are productive and responsive. Government solutions usually distort market forces and end up with poorer services at higher costs. 
   I should like to be clear about my support for the Patient's Bill of Rights Plus legislation I cosponsored and voted for--it is still needed because it addresses other important issues. What this change of practice announced by United Health does signal is the potential for us to reach a reasonable conclusion to negotiations underway between the House-passed Patient's Bill of Rights and the Senate-passed Patient's Bill of Rights Plus, particularly on the contentious issue of health plan liability. 
   Mr. President, it is hard to overstate the importance of this announcement from United Healthcare and I felt it was imperative someone in Congress acknowledged private market forces for positive change far outweigh a government imposed remedy.

   Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator from New Mexico. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to offer my enthusiastic support for the package of tax proposals introduced by Senator DOMENICI. I'm enthusiastic, in part, because it contains a provision that is very important to me--above-the-line deductibility of health insurance for individuals. 
   Over 40 million American workers didn't have health insurance in 1997. The number has increased in the last two years to 44 million. This is disturbing, but I believe there is something Congress can do to help without resorting to a national health care system. 
   Mr. President, when employers purchase a health plan for their employees, he or she can fully deduct the costs of providing that insurance, effectively lowering the actual costs of providing coverage. 
   However, when an employee purchases an individual policy on their own, they must do so with after tax-dollars. They don't have the ability or the advantage offered to employers to reduce the actual costs of the policy by deducting premiums from their taxes every year. Therefore, they often wind up without any health coverage at all. 
   Earlier this year, I introduced the Health Care Access Act, which would have ended this discrimination within the Tax Code and make health care available for many more Americans by allowing the full deduction of health insurance for those without access to employer-subsidized health coverage. 
   We have a tax code that discriminates against some, while favoring others. Clearly, this results in fewer people being covered. 
   The amendment before us today takes a slightly different approach, but its goal is the same--to level the tax-playing field. By allowing individuals without access to employer-sponsored health insurance, or those whose employers do not cover more than 50 percent of the cost of coverage, to deduct those costs regardless of whether they itemize or not, we can address a growing segment of our uninsured population by doing this. 
   Under this amendment, from 2002 to 2004, eligible employees can deduct 25 percent of costs, 35 percent in 2005, 65 percent in 2006, and 100 percent after that. 
   If there are no changes in the health care system and no significant downturn of the economy, we can expect the number of uninsured to reach 53 million over the next ten years. This translates into 25 percent of non-elderly Americans without coverage. 
   Forty-three percent of the uninsured are in families with incomes above 200 percent of the federal poverty level. Twenty-eight percent of the uninsured work for small firms and 18 percent of all uninsured are between the ages of 18 and 24. 
   The question that comes to mind is, if we're experiencing record growth in our economy and the unemployment rate is declining, why is the number of uninsured continuing to rise? The answer is costs. 
   In the event a small business can offer a health plan to its employees, many times it is at a higher cost to the employee than it would be if the employee were to have a job at a larger firm. In this instance, employees have to decide if they believe their health status is such that they can go without health insurance, or if they should spend after-tax dollars to pay for a larger portion of their health insurance. Here is where we have the difficulty. 
   Individuals employed by small businesses which can't afford to pay more than 50 percent of the monthly premiums for their employees should be able to have the same tax advantage as the employer in paying for their health insurance. Under our plan today, they will. In fact, because the tax deduction is what we call ``above-the-line,'' meaning if would be available to everyone--even if they don't itemize their taxes--we attack the most significant barrier to health coverage again, which is its costs, and move closer to eliminating all barriers to health coverage. 
   In other words, get more Americans covered by allowing them the deductibility of the costs. 
   I am also pleased that this amendment includes many other important components such as pension reform and small business tax relief. 
   We are talking about tax relief for small businesses, not the wealthiest as you hear from the other side of the aisle, but tax relief pinpointed at the hard-working Americans in this country who are also job providers. 
   Retirement income security is crucial for millions of American workers. This amendment reforms and enhances current pension laws to ensure workers will achieve income security upon retirement. It repeals the unnecessary temporary FUTA surtax, which has become a burden to many small businesses. The amendment allows millions of self-employed Americans to deduct 100 percent of their health insurance costs. This is a critical provision because 61 percent of the uninsured in this country are from a family headed  by an entrepreneur or a small business employee.

   Mr. GRAMS. In wrapping up, the amendment increases small business expensing to $30,000. This change alone means an extra $3,850 in tax savings for each small business in new equipment next year. This amendment also allows small business to increase the meal and entertainment expense tax deduction. The Work Opportunity Tax Credit has helped millions of Americans leave welfare programs and become productive workers in our economy. This amendment makes the WOTC permanent, so small businesses and former welfare recipients will continue to benefit from the Work Opportunity Tax Credit. 
   It seems unfair to me that in a time of prosperity we hear our colleagues on the other side talking about tax increases. Again, in their plan, they would impose new, even higher taxes. They talk about minimum wage; they are taxing and taxing and taxing those people as they enter the job market. What we need is a plan that will reduce taxes, not increase taxes. 
   America's small business is the key to our economic growth and prosperity. The health care, pension reform and tax relief measures included in this amendment will help small business continue to work for America and will allow millions of Americans to realize the American Dream. 
   Again, that is why I rise today to enthusiastically offer my support for the tax package proposed by Senator DOMENICI. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, we are now in the final stages of completing the FY 2000 Appropriation bills. We will soon end the first session of the 106th Congress. Looking back, I must say, we have had some successes, and I am proud of these achievements. However, the biggest failure, in my judgment, is that we have failed to learn the lessons from our past two years' experience and we have failed to maintain fiscal discipline due to our seriously flawed budget process. 
   That's why I rise today to introduce legislation that would reform the federal budget process, strengthen fiscal discipline, and restore government accountability to ensure that taxpayers are fully represented in Washington. 
   Mr. President, after last year's abuse of the budget/appropriation process, many of us realized that the federal budget process became a reckless game in which the team roster was limited to a handful of Washington politicians and technocrats while the taxpayers were relegated to the sidelines. This not only weakened the nation's fiscal discipline but also undermined the system of checks and balances established by the Constitution. 
   At the beginning of the 106th Congress, I argued repeatedly in this chamber that the key to a successful Congress was to pursue comprehensive budget process reforms. I introduced legislation to achieve these goals. I was pleased that Senate leaders included budget process reform as one of the top five priorities in the 106th Congress. Unfortunately, that commitment has not yet materialized. 
   As a result, this year's appropriation process is almost a play-by-play of 1998. Congress over-used advanced appropriations, and used directed scoring, emergency spending and other budgetary techniques to dodge fiscal discipline and significantly increase government spending. 
   Mr. President, our failure can be traced to our seriously flawed budget process. Twenty-five years ago, Congress tried to change its budget practices and get spending under control by passing the Congressional Budget Act. Yet, over these 25 years, our national debt has grown from $540 billion to $5.7 trillion. 
   Spending is at an all-time high, and so are taxes. The budget process has become so complicated that most lawmakers have a hard time understanding it. Of course, that hasn't stopped the proliferation of budget smoke and mirrors to circumvent the intent of the Congress. The flawed process allows members to vote to control spending in the budget and then turn right around and vote for increased appropriations. The process encourages spending increases rather than spending control. It encourages continued fiscal abuse, waste, and irresponsibility. 
   Clearly, we need to immediately pursue comprehensive reform to ensure the integrity of our budget and appropriations process and avoid repeating the same mistakes we made in the past two years. We must do this early in the year before we begin to face appropriation pressures. 
   This is why I am introducing the Comprehensive Budget Process Reform Act. This legislation is the companion bill of HR 853, which was a bipartisan effort led by Congressmen NUSSLE and CARDIN. It has been reported by the House Budget Committee. There are also a number of good budget reform proposals in the Senate I have earlier supported. Reforms introduced by our Budget Committee Chairman Senator Domenici are important and I strongly support his leadership in this area. My legislation is complementary to but broader than Senator Domenici's efforts. 
   Mr. President, let me highlight my legislation. The legislation will force us to pass a legally-binding federal budget, set aside funds each year in the budget for true emergencies; strengthen the enforcement of budgetary controls; enhance accountability for Federal spending; display unfunded liabilities for Federal insurance programs; mitigate the bias toward higher spending, modify Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) procedures to accommodate budget surpluses; and ensure the Social Security surplus will be protected. 
   The core of the legislation will provide for an annual joint budget resolution, rather than a concurrent resolution, thus making it a legally binding budget through a law requiring the President's signature. 
   I believe this is a critical step in reforming the budget process. If Congress and the President agree on a Joint Budget Resolution at the beginning of the process, appropriators in Congress would be legally bound to stay within those spending limits. It forces confrontation at the earliest stages of the budget process, leaving adequate time for legislating detail and minimizing disputes at the end of the process which threaten to shutdown the government. 
   The second component of the bill will redefine emergency spending and create a reserve fund to pay for emergencies. Emergency spending was traditionally used for unanticipated wars and natural disasters that took life and severely damaged property. Because emergency spending today is effectively exempt from congressional spending controls, Congress and the Administration have used this as an opportunity to bust the budget for a lot of spending that isn't emergency related at all. 
   Last year alone, Congress appropriated $35 billion for so-called emergencies. This year again, over $24 billion of emergency spending is appropriated. Since 1991, emergency spending has totaled over $145 billion. Most ``emergencies'' were used to fund regular government programs, not unanticipated events. Emergency spending is sought as a vehicle to add on even more spending priorities. This has gone too far. We need a better way to budget for emergencies. Most of this spending can be planned within our budget limits. Even natural disasters happen regularly--why not budget for them? 
   My legislation will end this abuse of emergency spending. It requires both the President and the Congress to budget up front for emergencies by setting aside dollars in an emergency reserve fund. The reserve fund will contain an amount at least equal to the 5-year historical average of amounts provided for true emergencies. It includes a clear definition of ``emergencies.'' My legislation prohibits release of funds from the reserve pending Budget Committee certification that: (1) A situation has arisen that requires funding for ``the prevention or mitigation of, or response to, loss of life of property, or a threat to national security'', and (2) The situation is ``unanticipated''--with ``unanticipated'' defined as sudden, urgent, unforeseen, and temporary.  
   In the event that Congress and the President fail to agree on annual appropriation measures by October 1, my legislation will allow the budget resolution signed into law earlier in the year to automatically kick in. This will effectively prevent any future government shutdowns due to disagreements on spending priorities between Congress and the Administration. 
   Mr. President, the 1995 federal government shutdown is still fresh in our minds. It was the longest shutdown in history and caused financial damage and inconvenience to millions of Americans when the President refused to support a Balanced Budget Act and tax relief for Americans. The shutdown shook the American people's confidence in their government and in their elected officials. 
   Since 1997, I, along with Senator MCCAIN, have been advocating an automatic continuing resolution, or CR, as we call it, to prevent a government shutdown. I was able to obtain a commitment from the Senate leadership of both parties to pursue this legislation separately in the near future. But no action has followed. If we had an automatic CR, we would not have to go through bitter battles at the end of every fiscal year. 
   The virtue of an automatic CR is that it would allow us to debate issues concerning spending policy and the merits of budget priorities while we continue to keep essential government functions operating. The American taxpayer will no longer be held hostage to a government shutdown. 
   Mr. President, there will always be plenty of uncertainties involved in our budget and appropriations process. The automatic kick-in of the budget resolution in the bill I introduce today will work the same as my automatic CR. 
   Another flaw of the budget process is so-called budget baselines. When a government program is going to increase by 4.5 percent per year, anyone with common sense would think that is a budget increase, not a budget ``cut.'' But under baseline budgeting it could mean ``cut.'' Lee Iaccoca once stated that if business used baseline budgeting the way Congress does, ``they'd throw us in jail.'' 
   This is a typical budget gimmick. Any proposed spending levels below current baselines are perceived as program reductions, allowing some politicians to claim savings while permitting others to claim increases. Baseline budgeting is biased in favor of more spending. It is not honest budgeting but rather very misleading. My legislation would require Congress and the President to use this 
   year's actual spending total as the baseline for the next year's budget. If we decide to spend more than the current year, we are increasing the budget. If we spend less, we are cutting it. Let's call a spade a spade. 
   Mr. President, we have entered an era of budget surplus. It is estimated that in the next ten years, our strong economy will generate an over $1 trillion non-Social Security surplus. If we don't return this surplus to taxpayers in the form of tax relief and debt reduction, the government will spend it all. However, the current budget process limits our ability to provide tax relief for working Americans. 
   The budget law requires that all tax cuts be offset with tax increases or cuts in entitlement programs such as Medicare. Tax cuts may not be paid for by cutting discretionary spending, such as wasteful government programs. This rule, called the PAYGO rule, applies regardless of whether there is a surplus or deficit. The PAYGO rule effectively limits options with respect to reducing taxes because it precludes using spending cuts in discretionary programs to offset tax cuts. Thus there is a built-in bias in favor of higher levels of spending and taxation in the current budget process. 
   My legislation would amend Pay-As-You-Go requirements to permit any portion of the on-budget surplus, excluding Social Security, to be used for tax cuts. 
   Related to the PAYGO rule reform, my legislation also creates a lockbox to lock in every penny that is saved from floor amendments to appropriations bills and use it to reduce federal government spending. Spending levels in the budget resolution and any caps on discretionary spending would be automatically reduced by the amount in the floor amendment. 
   The bill requires committees to submit a plan for reauthorizing all programs within their jurisdictions in 10 years. It also prohibits the Congress from considering a bill that creates a new spending program unless it is sunset within 10 years. My legislation also guarantees Members the right to offer amendments subjecting proposed entitlements to the enhanced oversight of the appropriations process. 
   Under the current budget process, we have over 20 budget functions, and a half dozen different committees with jurisdiction over one budget function. This has complicated the process greatly. To simplify the process, my bill collapses the 20 non-enforceable budget functions currently used into total (aggregate) spending and revenue levels, with separate categories for discretionary and mandatory spending. It is simple, and easy enough for everyone to understand. 
   Mr. President, a number of the Federal insurance programs (excluding Social Security and Medicare) that have a looming impact on the federal budget are not included in our budget process. The liabilities caused by these programs could be enormous. Budgeting for these liabilities will give us better control over long-term programs. My legislation requires the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget to report periodically on long-term budgetary trends, to help make Members aware of the future budgetary implications of spending programs. 
   Finally, Mr. President, it's vitally important that we save the entire Social Security surplus, not for government spending, not for tax relief, but exclusively for Social Security. 
   I believe we need an enforcement mechanism to ensure that Congress and the President do not touch the Social Security surplus. My legislation requires that if any fiscal year's appropriations end up spending the Social Security surplus, a sequestration will be automatically triggered to reduce government spending across the board in the amount of the Social Security surplus that was used. Entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare would not be cut. In addition, the bill reaffirms the protected status of Social Security under the current budgetary law. 
   Mr. President, it is true that our short-term fiscal situation has improved greatly due to the continued growth of our economy. However, our long-term financial imbalance still poses a major threat to the health of our future economic security. Without budget process reform, we will find ourselves again and again making the same mistakes which result in bigger government, more spending and more abuse. We need to spend more time on oversight and reauthorizing expiring programs rather than on endless budget battle at the end of every fiscal year. 
   President Reagan summed up the real problem of our budget process when he pointed out ``this budget process does not serve the best interests of the nation, it does not allow sufficient review of spending priorities, and it undermines the checks and balances established by the Constitution.'' 
   If the Congress adopts the Comprehensive Budget Process Reform Act, it will ensure a budget process that serves the best interests of the nation and allow for careful policy and spending deliberation. That's why I am introducing this legislation today. I urge my colleagues to support this measure.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to call on Congress and the President to make sure the UN reform package is signed into law before we recess. As Chairman of the International Operations Subcommittee, I have worked hard to help forge a solid bipartisan United Nations reform package. 
   Our message in crafting this legislation is simple and straightforward. The U.S. can help make the United Nations a more effective, more efficient and financially sounder organization, but only if the U.N. and other member states, in return, are willing to finally become accountable to the American taxpayers. 
   The reforms proposed by the United States are critical to ensure the United Nations is effective and relevant. Ambassador Holbrooke has been pushing other member states to accept the reforms in this package in return for the payment of arrears. He has succeeded beyond all reasonable expectations, by gaining our seat back on the budget oversight committee--the ACABQ. But he needs this bill signed into law in order to convince the UN that reform will bring certain rewards. 
   But passing this UN package is not just about a series of reforms for the future. It impacts directly on the ability of the US mission to achieve our goals at the United Nations right now. The US does not owe most of these arrears to the UN. It owes them to our allies, like Britain and France, for reimbursement for peacekeeping expenses. And our arrears are being used as a convenient excuse to dismiss US concerns on matters of policy. Depriving the US government the ability to use these funds as leverage is irresponsible; after all, our diplomats need ``carrots'' as well as reasonable ``sticks'' to achieve our foreign policy goals. 
   Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration and my colleagues in the House of Representatives are jeopardizing the payment of our arrears over a policy that I call ``Mexico City lite.'' While I support the proposal to prohibit US government grant recipients from lobbying foreign governments to change their abortion laws, I do not believe it should be linked to the payment of our UN arrears. If these unrelated issues continue to be tied, then there is a good chance neither proposal will be enacted. 
   I am hopeful that my colleagues in the House and the Administration will see the wisdom of adopting measures that will enhance America's ability to exert leadership in the international arena with the revitalization of the UN. The State Department Authorization bill should be allowed to pass or fail on its own merit--not on the merits of the Mexico City lite policy. This agreement is in America's best interest, and the best interest of the entire international community.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon in strong support of this very important legislation that balances the interests of individual consumers with the needs of America's financial services industries. 
   I know names have been mentioned and accolades have gone out, and very well-deserved, to those who need to be thanked for their hard work. I start the list with Senator PHIL GRAMM who worked very hard over this last year. By the way, it was a year ago today following the elections that we began consideration of getting this bill back on the floor again. Also, of course, I thank the ranking member, Senator SARBANES, who worked very hard as well over these years, and especially over the last 12 months, in crafting this bill and making sure of its success. 
   I also thank former Treasury Secretary Rubin and the latter contributions by Treasury Secretary Larry Summers. Chairman Greenspan of the Federal Reserve and SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, of course, were very instrumental in this. I thank our colleagues on the House side, Chairman LEACH and Congressman BLILEY, for their work and efforts. 
   I could go on. When one does this, they always run the risk of not mentioning somebody. There were so many hands in this. 
   Alan Brubaker appears on the list to be commended. Alan is on my staff, and I have to compliment him as well on all the hours he has put in on this bill, working very hard staff to staff. Alan has done a tremendous job, and I compliment him on his efforts. 
   In testimony before the House Banking Committee, then-Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Rubin, testified that the administration estimated enactment of financial modernization legislation will result in annual savings of $15 billion. The important part of this is those savings will end up in the pockets of consumers because in a competitive world, people are going to find the cheapest way in an expanded array of financial services. The consumers, under this bill, are going to be the biggest benefactors--$15 billion in annual savings in financial modernization. 
   This package of reforms has been under consideration, as we heard, in one form or another for over two decades. I am proud to be a member of the committee and the Senate that has taken the handoff from those who came before us and carried the ball across the goal line. As Senator DODD mentioned, former Senator Alfonse D'Amato should also be recognized for the contributions he made over the years. 
   This has been a top priority for myself. I served on the Banking Committee in the House for the one term I was there, and the No. 1 priority when I reached the Senate was to be on the Banking Committee. I was never a banker, but I have sat across the table from many bankers. I thought it was very important to add the voice of a small businessman and an individual in banking legislation. 
   This legislation provides the appropriate regulatory framework for an event already occurring throughout the regulatory fiat, and that is the affiliation between commercial banks, securities firms, and insurance companies. 
   We protect consumers by establishing a system of functional regulation whereby institutions will be overseen by experts in their areas. In other words, the securities operations will continue to be supervised by security experts, banks by banking experts and, of course, insurance by State insurance 
   commissioners. 
   In addition to ensuring a level playing field for business through consistent regulation, again, consumers also benefit because the institutions with which they are dealing will be regulated by the experts in those products. Thus, by authorizing properly regulated affiliations between financial companies, we ensure that our financial services companies will be able to compete worldwide and with appropriate regulation at home, they will not be forced to move offshore to remain competitive. 
   Although the estimated $15 billion in cost savings will certainly benefit our consumers, the provision which most immediately impacts the consumer, of course, is the establishment of a national floor of privacy protections. 
   A lot of people do not realize that without this bill, we would go back to almost zero, except for the fair credit reporting bills. This brings a tremendous number of new protections in privacy to our consumers. It is a major step forward in that area. 
   The consensus contained in this bill will now provide consumers with major areas of protection beyond current law. Specifically, the conference agreement, one, ensures consumers will have greater clarity of their financial institution's privacy policies by requiring the institution to disclose those policies on information sharing--to the affiliates and third parties of both current and former customers--at the time the institution establishes a relationship with that customer, as well as reviewing those regulations or those policies each and every year. The consumer will have major privacy protections. 
   Two, it provides consumers with the ability to take their names off the list,  in other words, to opt out if they do not want their personal information shared with a nonaffiliated third party. 
   Three, it criminalizes the actions of bad actors who use false pretense or, in other words, lie to obtain a consumer's personal financial information. 
   Four, it preserves all existing and all future State privacy protections above and beyond the national floor established in this bill. It allows the States to set their levels as well. 
   Five, it authorizes a study to review whether further privacy measures are needed. That is very important because as we complete this bill--nobody has ever written a perfect bill, I do not think, out of Washington, and it is very important to review what we have done and look at what else needs to be done. But this review is going to be very important as well in the area of privacy. 
   Although the central purpose of the bill is to remove decades-old barriers to the integration of the financial services industry, by recognizing that privacy is both a very important issue to the consumer and a responsibility of the financial institution, the bill puts in place the framework to ensure the consumer is protected and allows the financial industry to expand services and products. 
   I recognize the debate over privacy has not been concluded with these changes. The enthusiasm these provisions have garnered, as well as the expressions of support Congress has received for recent actions to prevent implementation of the FDIC's ``Know Your Customer'' rule and to restrict the ability of States to sell driver's license information, demonstrates the public's concern over these privacy issues. 
   I look forward to further debate on these issues following the comprehensive hearings Chairman GRAMM has pledged to hold after we have received the findings of the report called for in this bill. After further study, we will all be better equipped to consider the issue of privacy. In the meantime, I firmly believe we have provided stronger protections for the consumer. 
   Mr. President, I thank all my colleagues for all their hard work. I strongly urge them to support this conference report. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
   Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. President, I ask Senator GRAMM, in his capacity as chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and one of the chief authors of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that is before us today, to clarify a point about section 731 of the act. Is it correct that section 731 is not intended to affect banks whose home office and authorized branch offices are not located in the State described?

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a multi-faceted package of tax cuts and federal program changes to help our nation's farmers weather this period of low commodity prices. I will first note that this bill is obviously not a cure-all for the farmers' plight, but significant tax reform is an essential component of creating an environment where farmers can thrive. Regulatory reform, crop insurance reform, and improvements in our agriculture trade policies are also critical elements of boosting farm income. 
   The bill I introduce is a collection of tax reform concepts that have been considered individually, but not as a package of comprehensive relief to farmers. Some were in the congressional tax cut package that the President summarily vetoed, denying relief to farmers, middle class workers, and small business owners. All of the provisions of this bill would benefit the farm community, and should not be tossed aside due to partisan posturing as was the case with this past summer's tax relief bill. By offering this multi-part  legislation, I hope to provide a vehicle to move comprehensive tax relief for an important sector in the American economy and culture that has not shared in the prosperity of recent years. 
   The first provision in this legislation is the Farm and Ranch Risk Management Accounts, which were also a part of the recent tax cut bill that the President vetoed. This provision would allow producers to put up to 20% of net farm income in a tax deferred account where the funds could be held in reserve for up to five years for financial emergencies. Farmers operate in a volatile market, and they need all the risk management tools we can provide. When farmers earn a profit they usually invest in additional farm assets, and this would give them a tax incentive and opportunity to instead save more income as a buffer during down cycles. 
   The second provision of my tax bill would accelerate the 100% deductibility of health insurance premiums for the self-employed to make them immediately effective, rather than the full phase-in by 2003. I will note again that this was one of the critical provisions in the tax cut bill that was vetoed by the President, and is also included in my health care legislation. Farmers should not receive the same tax considerations on health benefits as everyone else who obtains insurance through their employment, so that they do not have to choose between decent health care and other necessities of life. This provision equalizes the tax treatment for these farmers. 
   The third provision would raise the effective exemption from estate taxes to $5 million and raise the gift tax exemption to $25,000. According to USDA figures, farmers are six times more likely to face inheritance taxes than other Americans. Farmers must farm more and more acres now to just eke out a humble income. Thus, they accumulate large capital investments through the years that provide them a modest living, but when they die their estate is treated as if they were very rich, and many have never even had a new pickup. Many of these families want to leave their property to their children, so that they can continue the heritage of farming the land. However, the estate tax can reach such prohibitive levels that sometimes the property must be sold to satisfy the insatiable tax revenue appetite of the federal government. 
   At the present time, the average age of farmers is 58 years old. We are just a few years from a period of significant transfers of real property from one generation to another. With all the obstacles to success that producers currently face, why is the federal government adding to their burdens by jeopardizing the time honored tradition of passing the family farm down from generation to generation, when it only generates one percent of federal taxes? Taxes should be gathered to pay for the necessities of government, not to transfer wealth from one segment of the population to another. And even if you believe that such wealth transfer is a legitimate function of tax policy, can we at least agree that family farms should be shielded from the takings? The estate tax can be as high as 55%, which is unfair, threatening the continuity of family-owned businesses. 
   The next provision amends the tax code to treat lands which are contiguous to a principal residence and which were farmed for five years before the principal residence as part of such residence, allowing it to be part of the exclusion of gain from the sale of the principal residence. This allows older farmers to sell their property without facing extraordinary capital gains taxes as a consequence. 
   The legislation also acknowledges that farm income can fluctuate significantly from year to year, and that farmers need a break when income goes does significantly after several good years. The bill thus includes a provision to reach back into a previous tax year and pull income from good years into a current down year. Farmers would then be recompensed for tax overpayments from previous years. Current law permits farmers to lower their tax burdens in good years by averaging in income from less profitable past periods, but it does not allow previous good years to be averaged in to current low income levels. This provision would provide this assistance to struggling farmers, again, giving them some tools to work within a very volatile market. 
   The bill also includes a provision to exempt from the alternative minimum tax certain income from unincorporated farms. Thanks to initiatives to provide tax credits to working families, 
   many farm families would be able to reduce their tax burden if they were not bumping up against the alternative minimum tax. This correction is needed because the alternative minimum tax also does not always permit farmers to take advantage of current laws concerning farmer income averaging. 
   My legislation contains a provision to exclude from gross income up to $350,000 of capital gain from the transfer of property in complete or partial satisfaction of qualified farm indebtedness of a taxpayer, subject to means testing. This would exclude capital gains taxes from the forced liquidations of farm property. 
   The bill also ensures that farm landlords are treated the same as small business people and other commercial landlords, and removes the requirement that they pay self-employment tax on cash rent income. This item corrects an IRS technical advice memorandum to ensure that farmers, like other real estate owners, do not have to pay self-employment taxes on income from cash rent. 
   The measure also amends current law to emphasis certain beneficial farm program goals. They include a requirement that USDA, when approving applications for loans and grants under the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act, places a high priority on projects that encourage the creation of farmer-owner facilities that process value-added agricultural products; an amendment to the Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act to give USDA discretion to use funds for rural development technical assistance; an amendment to the Rural Development Act to emphasize market development education and technical assistance for operators of small- and medium-sized farms, in addition to production assistance. The amendment also requires USDA to explore new marketing avenues such as direct farm to consumer markets, local value-added processing, and farmer-owned cooperatives. 
   We need a renaissance of new thinking and new marketing opportunities for our farmers. I want to ensure that existing programs are focused on helping farmers receive a larger share of the value of their products. As I have said before, I've always been struck by how we have a Department of Housing and Urban Development and a Department of Agriculture, but no real government emphasis on rural development. I hope that these provisions can help rebuild our rural economies. 
   The next two components of the bill restore a tax-exemption for value-added farmer-owned cooperatives that was taken away by a recent IRS ruling, and extends declaratory judgment relief for the cooperatives affected by this ruling. 
   Finally, the bill also includes a provision that increases the threshold amount that triggers when a 
   farmer and employed farm worker would have to pay payroll taxes. The current threshold is $150, and this bill would raise it to $3,000. Farmers need the flexibility to be able to hire part-time workers, such as other nearby farmers or teenagers during the summer. We should free them from the burden and paperwork of having to pay payroll taxes on a minimal amount of expenditures on employees. This $150 figure in current law obviously does not reflect current realities on the farm, and Congress should make this much needed adjustment in the threshold figure. 
   Again, I believe that it is important to emphasize that major tax relief for farmers is a critical component of making Freedom to Farm work, and that's why I'm introducing this bill. I hope that hearings will be held next year on Freedom to Farm, and some adjustments my need to be made to current law. In fact, I have my own bill pending that would extend the term for producers' marketing loans from nine months up to thirty-six months, to give farmers more flexibility, and thus more market power, in determining when to put their grain on the market. No one on this side of the aisle argues that Freedom to Farm is perfect, but there are fundamental concepts in the bill that farmers requested and I believe still want, such as the freedom to  make their own decisions on what and how much to plant. I believe farmers want to plant for the market, not the government. 
   This bill reflects my commitment to try to deliver on the promises to farmers that were made when Freedom to Farm was passed, such as trade expansion, fast track authority, regulatory reform, and crop insurance reform. 
   Of course, if the administration was truly attempting to be accommodating the needs of the farm community, there would be less need for the regulatory reform bills currently pending. I know American farmers can complete worldwide, but we cannot drag our feet on creating a climate in which they can succeed. I believe this farmer tax relief bill is a critical piece of the puzzle. 
   Mr. President, the second tax relief measure I am introducing today would expand income averaging to small agriculture-related businesses. 
   Before 1986, American farmers, agricultural-related businesses and others could apply income averaging for tax purposes. But the Tax Reform Act of 1986 entirely eliminated income averaging. Congress acted primarily on the assumption that tax reduction would substantially reduce the number of taxpayers whose fluctuating incomes could subject them to higher progressive rates and there was no need for income average. While it was understandable that Congress took such action at that time, I believe it was clearly a mistake because Congress completely ignored the nature of agriculture and our rural communities. 
   Today, low commodity prices have made the income of American farmers and agriculture-related businesses fluctuate more wildly than that of any other group of taxpayers. In my own state of Minnesota, income in farm communities had decreased dramatically in recent years. 
   In response to this critical situation, Congress reinstated income averaging for individual farmers temporarily in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, and last year Congress made it permanent for farmers. This was good change and I was pleased to join Senator BURNS and others in passing this 
   important legislation. In my package of tax relief for farmers just discussed, I have added new flexibility for farmers to use income averaging to their benefit. 
   Unfortunately, Congress unintentionally left one important group out of last year's relief legislation. American small agriculture-related businesses, those who work hard to provide seeds, fertilizer, farming equipment and other farm products for farmers, whose income depends on farmers' income, are not included in current law providing income averaging. As a result, these small businesses are facing hardship and need this relief as well. 
   Expanding income averaging to small agriculture-related businesses would provide modest, but much needed, assistance to these businesses and allow them to continue serving farmers and rural communities. It also is consistent with the approach Congress took in the past regarding income averaging. Unlike the permanent income averaging for farmers, my legislation would sunset income averaging for agriculture-related businesses in three years. In addition, it only covers small businesses, not big corporations. 
   Mr. President, the third tax bill I will introduce today is the Rural Revitalization Tax Credit (RRTC) Act. This bill fits into my overall goal of making rural America a better place to live. 
   The objective is to attract business investment to rural areas to provide jobs for those who value life in the small towns of rural America. These jobs can also be invaluable for farm families suffering hard times through low commodity prices, crop diseases or weather disasters. Full or part time jobs can often help farmers help their family farms in down cycles. 
   This legislation is designed to encourage business investment in high poverty rural communities. It would create rural revitalization tax credits which include a development credit that is provided to any company locating in high poverty rural communities. A company would receive a 6 percent tax credit annually of the amount of the investment, which amounts to about 25 percent of the value of the original investment over 7 years. 
   It also creates a wage tax credit which allows employers in high poverty rural communities to receive up to $3,000 per employee hired in that community. In addition, qualified businesses are allowed to write off up to $37,500 as an expense the cost of depreciable, tangible personal property. This proposal is similar to urban empowerment zone proposals introduced in the Congress. We want to apply it to rural America as well. 
   Mr. President, this measure will not solve all the problems that farmers and people in rural areas are facing, but I believe it is one way to create more economic opportunities in our rural communities to preserve and improve the excellent quality of life in these areas. 
   I send the three bills to the desk and ask that they be assigned to the appropriate committees.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as Chairman of the International Operations Subcommittee, which has United Nations oversight responsibilities, and having been appointed by the President to serve two terms as a congressional delegate to the United Nations, I have focused significant attention on the United Nations. On the anniversary of the founding of the United Nations, I think it is appropriate to take time for us all to reflect on that important institution. 
   Fifty-four years ago this week, the members of the United Nations' founding delegation met in San Francisco for the signing ceremony that created the United Nations. There was great anticipation and a collective enthusiasm for this new, global institution. Delegates spoke of hope, of expectation, of the promise of peace. President Truman echoed the thoughts of those founding members when he told the delegates they had, ``created a great instrument for peace and security and human progress in the world.'' Fifty-four years later, however, the United Nations is struggling to meet its potential. 
   In Congress, the need for the United Nations to reform itself often overshadows the activities United Nations does well. As we saw in the Persian Gulf war, the United Nations can play a useful role in building coalitions to address matters of international security. Moreover, the United Nations has the ability to effectively conduct traditional peacekeeping operations, such as those in Cyprus and the Sinai Peninsula, where hostilities have ceased and all parties agree to the U.N. peacekeeping role. In the areas of humanitarian relief, child survival, and refugee assistance, much of the work of UNICEF and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees deserves praise. And many of the U.N. agencies that focus on technical cooperation play a crucial role in establishing and coordinating international standards for governments and businesses, including the International Civil Aviation Organization, the International Telecommunications Union, the Universal Postal Union, and the World Intellectual Property Organization. 
   However, the ability of the United Nations to live up to the goals stated  at its founding has been stymied by its massive, uncoordinated growth. Fortunately, a consensus appears to be building that the United Nations needs to reform in order to be a viable institution. As Secretary-General Annan noted, ``a reformed United Nations will be a more relevant United Nations in the eyes of the world.'' To this end, the United States must help shape the United Nations to be an organization that the United States needs as much as the United Nations needs the United States. 
   In an effort to push the United Nations toward reform, the Senate has passed a comprehensive package that links the payment of arrears to the achievement of reform benchmarks. These are achievable, common-sense reforms. We are calling for a code of conduct with an anti-nepotism provision; a mechanism to sunset outdated and unnecessary programs; and transparency in the budget process. We do not need to micro-manage the United Nations, but we need to make sure a proper structure is in place for the United Nations to be able to manage itself. 
   We must pay our arrears to the United Nations. In doing so, however, we should put the arrears in perspective. Throughout the history of the United Nations, the United States has always been its most generous donor. The United States contributes around $2 billion to U.N. organizations and activities every year. This is three times more generous than any other permanent member of the Security Council. I do not believe success in any of the areas where the United Nations excels would be possible without a high level of U.S. support.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in mourning the untimely death of our friend, John Chafee. Today, we celebrate the enthusiastic spirit he brought with him each day to the Senate, and the generous public spirit exemplified by his work. 
   With John's passing, the State of Rhode Island has lost a leader, the Senate has lost a statesman, and the Chafee family has lost a loving, dedicated husband, father, and grandfather. As the Senate family, the prayers of John's colleagues and our staffs are with Ginny and her entire family. 
   Many of my colleagues have recited the accomplishments of John Chafee. They bear repeating, however. 
   Before his achievements as a legislator, John was a leader in the Marines. He served in the original invasion at Guadalcanal, and when he was recalled to active duty in 1951, he commanded a rifle company in Korea. 
   John then turned his service to the State of Rhode Island, first as a member of its House of Representatives, where he eventually attained the rank of Minority Leader. In 1962, John ran for Governor and won--though it was a very close race. He increased that margin of victory significantly in the following two elections, in 1964 and 1966, when he was reelected with the largest margin in the State's history. 
   Following his governorship, John Chafee went on to serve as Secretary of the Navy for three and a half years. 
   Beginning in 1976, John began his long career in the U.S. Senate. As the only Republican elected from Rhode Island in the past 68 years, John vigorously pursued the interests of his constituents, including environmental issues, health care concerns, and efforts to reduce the Federal budget deficit. Through his position on the Senate Finance Committee, and mine on the Foreign Relations Committee, we worked closely together on a number of fronts to support free trade and oppose unilateral sanctions. I recall at one point we were two of five Senators who opposed a resolution we both thought was harmful to our relationships with another country. 
   John Chafee's contributions to this Senate, however, go much deeper than just those outlined within the pages of his impressive biography. 
   I remember when I moved from the House to the Senate, and those early, confusing days working out of the cramped Dirksen basement. John Chafee was moving his office at the same time, and he invited me up to look his over. He made this new Senator feel welcome in a place where  bonds between the ``old-timers'' are strong and newcomers can sometimes feel intimidated. Ultimately, I didn't take John Chafee's office, but I gladly accepted his friendship. When I last spoke to John, during a short conversation in this Chamber late last week, he talked about his son, Lincoln, and the possibility that son would replace father in the Senate. I think he took great pride in the thought of his family carrying on his tradition of public service. 
   I was moved by the words of John Chafee's staff in a statement they collectively issued on Monday. It said, in part: ``His sense of public spirit was infectious, and we have all learned a great deal from him. But more important than any lesson in civics is the example he set for all of us about how to conduct our lives: listen to both sides; do what's right; always look for the good in people; and, even if you don't prevail, be of good cheer.'' 
   Mr. President, John was a tireless advocate for his constituents, a man who sought agreement in the often-acrimonious atmosphere of Washington, a man who brought meaning to the idea of giving one's word and standing by one's principles. And he was consistently of good cheer. I was proud to serve with him, and proud to consider him a friend.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the trade package before us today which would expand trade opportunities with sub-Saharan Africa, offer enhanced tariff treatment to Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) nations, extend the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) program for 5 years and extend the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. 
   The CBI language will expand benefits to CBI nations, yet continue to protect import-sensitive industries in the United States. It will for the first time link benefits to improvements in areas such as intellectual property rights, investment, market access, government procurement and other issues which will not only help CBI nations develop but create an improved market for U.S. companies in the future. U.S. exports have tripled to the region since the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act was passed in 1984. They have soared the first 6 months of this year, and this legislation will further that progress. 
   The CBI benefits will serve as the next step in helping this region become part of the Free Trade Area of the Americas. 
   The Generalized System of Preferences program aiding the least developed countries expired in July of this year. Most of us have many small importers in our States who have depended on this lower tariff treatment to compete with larger retailers. I know there are many in Minnesota who are now paying enormous tariffs--at the risk of staying in business--and need the program extended for 5 years. Extending the program year by year, often retroactively, and usually with no certainty is no way to treat these small businesses or these countries. The GSP program has been improved over the years, and graduations of countries and products have ensured it helps only those who need assistance will get the help. 
   The African Growth and Opportunity Act is the most controversial, but crucial, part of this package. I have continually supported this effort and am disappointed it has taken so long to consider the measure on the floor. What really is very modest assistance to one of the poorest regions of the world, sub-Saharan Africa, has been  battered from all sides--and it is the needy people of those countries who will suffer the most if we do not pass this legislation. 
   Much of the opposition is from the textile and apparel industry, and I am sensitive to the concern that has come from textile companies in my own State of Minnesota. I believe the Senate bill has addressed this industry's concerns in a very responsible manner. The bill requires the use of U.S. textiles and includes tough transshipment language--far tougher than that of current law. The Customs Service has reassured us that Africa is not a transshipment problem. Africa supplies 1 percent of our textile imports and has little ability to flood our market with additional imports. I believe most new apparel investments in Africa will just replace many in Asia rather than expanding overall textile/apparel imports. 
   Some in the Congress believe this legislation should focus more on debt relief. However, we are involved in multilateral efforts to provide this relief and have made commitments unilaterally as well. I support these separate efforts. This is not the vehicle to expand our debt relief efforts. The focus of this legislation is to foster economic growth through incentives, to create a high-level dialogue between U.S. and African leaders on economic issues, to start the process toward a U.S.-sub-Saharan free trade area--to help Africa develop and prosper through improved business relationships with our companies. We want these relationships to help Africa grow, to expand job opportunities, to become more market oriented as they reform economically and to become less dependent on foreign aid from other nations. 
   Some will say this bill is not worthy of support because it does not provide enough benefit for the United States. Fortunately we don't always pass legislation solely on what it can do for us immediately. We need to look ahead, which we don't do enough of here, but this legislation is a good example of 
   how we should act. The more than 700 million people of sub-Saharan Africa represent an enormous market of the future for us. Right now my State of Minnesota is the 15th largest exporter to the region. We must continue to improve our export opportunities, but we can't do that if we don't allow sub-Saharan Africa the ability to export to us. If we are not there now helping them help themselves, developing the relationships needed to build friendship and trust, sub-Saharan Africans will not want to buy our products in the future. And we know how many other countries are there to step in if we are not there. Again, we can't expect to develop an export market there if we are not with them during the hard times when sub-Saharan Africans need us to give them a small edge to compete for exports into the United States. If Africa can't become strong and prosperous, it will not be able to buy our products in the future. 
   A strong and secure Africa will not only benefit trade, but will help us achieve our goals in areas such as drug trafficking, terrorism, human rights, and many others. 
   I also want to mention a statement I just read whereby AIDS activists oppose this legislation because they believe sub-Saharan African countries will spend more on business investment than on social services spending such as health care. I strongly disagree with this thinking. The Africa Growth and Opportunity Act will help countries grow and prosper. It will enable these governments, and their people to spend more on their health care needs, including the need to fight the devastation of AIDS. 
   Mr. President, this bill is a good one. It complements what we are doing in so many other ways to help sub-Saharan Africa. The entire package is one we should enthusiastically support. I urge my colleagues to vote for this trade package without damaging amendments. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, first, I want to associate my remarks to the Senator's comments dealing with the 10th anniversary of the disappearance of Jacob Wetterling. 
   Our support continues to go out to the family and also, as Senator WELLSTONE mentioned, to the Jacob Wetterling Foundation. Patty and Jerry Wetterling have worked tirelessly to aiding in the search for missing children. As the Senator said, Jacob's Hope is all of our hope. 
   Again, I commend the Wetterlings for their efforts. Also, our sympathy and support continues to go out to the family in the disappearance of Jacob Wetterling 10 years ago.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I offer my support today of S. 1692, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1999, introduced by my colleague, Senator SANTORUM. Congress has twice passed legislation outlawing partial-birth abortion, only to have it vetoed by the President for fallacious reasons. It is time that we close this shameful chapter in our nation's history during which we have permitted the destruction of fully-formed, viable human beings in a most gruesome and shockingly cold-hearted manner. If there is a meaningful distinction between this abortion procedure and infanticide, it escapes me. 
   I know that there is a certain numbing fatigue that sets in when we are forced to once again review the details of the partial-birth abortion procedure. But we must not let our aversion to the particulars of the procedure cause us to turn away from addressing the cruel injustice of it. I commend Senator SANTORUM for his persistence in pursuing this legislation. Congress must keep the pressure on President Clinton to stop opposing the bill and sign it into law. 
   It is time for President Clinton to abandon the false claim that somehow this bill would jeopardize the health of a mother unless a so-called health exception permitting the procedure is not added to the bill. President Clinton knows that the term ``health'' in the context of abortion has become so broadly defined by the Supreme Court that it would strip this bill of any force, and would render the entire bill meaningless. Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has denounced this false argument, asserting that ``partial-birth abortion is never medically  necessary to protect a mother's health or her future fertility. On the contrary, this procedure can pose a significant threat to both.'' The American Medical Association has also expressed support for the partial-birth abortion ban, noting that the Santorum bill ``would allow a legitimate exception where the life of the mother was endangered, thereby preserving the physician's judgment to take any medically necessary steps to save the life of the mother.'' 
   The bottom line is, the alternative bill that has been offered by the minority leaders in the past, and which we will likely see again, extends no real protection at all to unborn children. Again, the so-called health exception it adopts essentially renders the bill meaningless, and offers opponents to the Santorum bill only a cosmetic, public relations cover to veil their commitment that abortion should be free of any reasonable restrictions. 
   To allow this partial-birth procedure to continue to be performed across our land cheapens the value of life at all stages, for the unborn, the physically handicapped, and the feeble elderly. Our government must affirm life and not let our civil society decay into a mentality that only the strong and self-sufficient should survive and the weak can be considered expendable. 
   President Clinton once said that he wanted abortion to be ``safe, legal, and rare.'' He has worked very hard to keep it ``legal,'' in the sense of being completely free of any restrictions. It is now time for Congress and the President to make the partial-birth method of abortion truly rare by passing and signing S. 1692.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns about the proposed McCain-Feingold bill. 
   I have always maintained several guiding principles when considering proposals to change the way our campaigns are financed, the most important of which is the first amendment right of Americans to participate in the political process. I have heard from many constituents who agree that Congress should focus its attention on preserving the first amendment, which has been the basis for active citizen participation in our political process. 
   Recently, a constituent from Woodbury, Minnesota, wrote, ``The First Amendment to the Constitution must not be legislated into obscurity. Money is only one of the many voices people use to express their views. You must not remove the voice of the people in an attempt to remove avarice and greed from the political process.'' 
   By guaranteeing to citizens the right to speak freely and openly, the first amendment ensures, among other things, average Americans can participate in our political process through publicly disclosed contributions to the campaigns of their choice. The first amendment also allows Americans to freely draft letters to the editor, join political parties, and participate in rallies and get-out-the-vote drives. I am proud of Minnesota's long history of active citizen participation in many of these activities during each election year. 
   Mr. President, before this debate concludes, the Senate will have considered many broad, sweeping proposals to amend the McCain-Feingold bill in an attempt to impose new restrictions upon our fundamental rights. However, rather than pass new campaign finance laws, we should encourage and protect citizen involvement in our political process through greater enforcement of our existing election laws, fair and frequent disclosure of candidate campaign contributions, and a long-overdue increase in Federal contribution limits. I remain concerned about any proposal that infringes upon the fundamental right of citizens, candidates, groups, and political parties to have their voices heard in the democratic process. 
   In my view, efforts to pass burdensome and restrictive campaign finance proposals overlook the fundamental reason why the American people have begun to lose faith in their government. The public's mistrust of their elected officials has not grown from a lack of laws, but from the activities of those who break our existing laws. Minnesotans have contacted me to express their outrage over blatant violations of our existing Federal election laws, and more specifically, illegal and improper campaign activity that occurred during the 1996 elections. 
   During the course of this debate, we should not forget that election laws enacted 25 years ago to curb corruption in the political process have been circumvented and repeatedly violated. This was made very clear to the American people throughout the extensive hearings conducted by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee during the last Congress, despite the 
   fact that more than 45 witnesses either fled the country or refused to cooperate with the committee investigation. 
   Importantly, the investigation conducted by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee has contributed to the investigative and prosecutorial efforts of the Justice Department's Campaign Task Force. Above all else, the findings issued by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee have proven that the current law works if we simply enforce the laws on the books. 
   For these reasons, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of the amendment offered by Senators THOMPSON and LIEBERMAN that would improve the enforcement of our existing election laws. Among its provisions, this proposal would authorize federal prosecutions of federal election laws if the offender commits the existing offense ``knowingly and willingly'' and the offense involved more than $25,000. As my colleagues know, current law only allows violations of election laws to be prosecuted as misdemeanors. 
   Mr. President, the Thompson-Lieberman amendment also extends the statute of limitations for criminal violations of the Federal Election Campaign Act from 3 years to 5 years--consistent with the statute of limitations for most other federal crimes. It would direct the United States Sentencing Commission to promulgate a sentencing guideline specifically directed at campaign finance violations and consider issuing longer sentences for those whose convictions involve foreign money or large illegal contributions. 
   Most importantly, this amendment would make it clear that all foreign money is illegal by prohibiting soft money donations to candidates or political parties by foreign nationals. I know that all Americans were outraged by the improper role of foreign money contributions during the 1996 presidential campaign. I commend Senators THOMPSON and LIEBERMAN for this meaningful proposal to improve our current enforcement structure and ensure that violations of federal election laws do not occur during the 2000 campaign. 
   In addition to more timely enforcement of our existing election laws, I believe reasonable disclosure requirements provide the electorate with more information, deter corruption or the appearance of corruption through increased exposure of contributions, and  help to determine violations of election laws. However, we should ensure that disclosure requirements do not infringe upon the individual rights and privacy of donors or discourage citizen involvement in the democratic process. In fact, it was a former Minnesotan, Chief Justice Warren Burger, who emphasized the need for carefully drafted disclosure provisions as part of his opinion in the case of Buckley versus Valeo. 
   In Buckley, Chief Justice Burger wrote,  
   Disclosure is, in principle, the salutary and constitutional remedy for most of the ills Congress was seeking to alleviate. *.*.* Disclosure is, however, subject to First Amendment limitations which are to be defined by looking at the various public interests. No legislative public interest has been shown in forcing the disclosure of modest contributions that are the prime support of new, unpopular, or unfashionable political causes.  
   Mr. President, I commend Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD for their decision to modify their proposal and reduce the level by which this legislation would infringe upon the first amendment rights of Americans. Unfortunately, the revised McCain-Feingold bill continues to place new restrictions upon national political parties through a proposed ban on party soft money. 
   I do not believe that any limit or ban on party soft money would survive strict scrutiny by the Supreme Court. We should not pursue a suspect expansion of government control of national parties, but rather recognize that political parties enjoy the same rights as individuals to participate in the democratic process. This is a view consistent with the Supreme Court decision in Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee versus FEC, in which the Court found that Congress may not limit independent expenditures by political parties. 
   In striking down limits on the ability of political party independent expenditures, the Supreme Court wisely questioned any attempt to demonstrate a compelling reason for government regulation upon the ability of political parties to support state and local party participation in the political process when it declared: 
   ``We also recognize that FECA permits unregulated `soft money' contributions to a party for certain activities, such as electing candidates for state office *.*.* or for voter registration and `get out the vote' drives. *.*.* But the opportunity for corruption posed by these greater opportunities for contributions, is, at best, attenuated.'' 
   Mr. President, I believe we should strengthen, rather than diminish, the role of political parties. In my view, some of my colleagues favor a ban on party soft money because parties promote ``issue advocacy'' communications. These advocates fail to recognize that a political party's ability to engage in these communications is fully protected by the first amendment. In debating the merits of a proposed ban on party soft money, we should heed the Supreme Court's wisdom in Buckley when it held that communications which do not expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate using such words as ``vote for'' or ``defeat'' cannot be regulated. 
   Mr. President, I firmly believe there would be less reliance upon party soft money if Congress would increase the current contribution limits and encourage individuals and donors to become involved in entities that are already subject to regulations and disclosure, such as political action committees and national parties. In many ways, the prevalence of soft money in recent campaigns is a consequence of contribution limits established in 1974 and upheld in Buckley. 
   I am very encouraged that the Supreme Court for the first time since 1976 recently heard arguments regarding the constitutionality of contribution limits. I believe both contributions and expenditures are entitled to protection as core political speech and have concerns with the Supreme Court's decision in Buckley, which upheld limits on contributions while striking down limits on expenditures. In my view, to leave these limits in place without any adjustment would be unfair and continue to threaten the individual rights of donors and individuals. As Chief Justice Burger wrote in Buckley, ``Contributions and expenditures are the same side of the First Amendment coin.'' 
   Mr. President, I am committed to protecting the rights of all Americans to participate in the political process. However, we should not use violations of existing law to restrict political speech and participation in the political process. Those who choose to offer their ideas and talents in a manner that will help to strengthen our nation for future generations must not be discouraged from doing so.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, October 17, 1999 is ``National Sunday School Teacher Appreciation Day'' and I want to take this opportunity to honor the 15 million American men and women who serve as Sunday school teachers. They are surely one of our nation's most valuable resources. 
   Since 1993, ``National Sunday School Teacher Appreciation Day'' has helped foster an increased awareness of the vital role Sunday school plays in the life of the local church and community. By marking this day, churches have an opportunity to nominate the cream of the crop of their Sunday school teachers for national recognition. An integral part of this campaign is the search for the ``Henrietta Mears Sunday School Teacher of the Year.'' This award was established in honor of Dr. Henrietta Mears, a famous Christian educator who influenced the lives of such Christian leaders as Dr. Billy Graham, and many more. 
   Through their work, Sunday school teachers offer a wealth of information and guidance to America's youth. In the wake of incidents at Columbine High School and, more recently, at the Wedgewood Baptist Church in Texas, the importance of these volunteers, who help shepherd their communities through difficult times, only increases in value. Through community-based programs--and especially those deeply rooted in faith, such as Sunday School--our nation and my state of  Minnesota can help bring out the best in our children as they go through the ever-more challenging task of growing up in our society. 
   Sunday school teachers have had an enormous influence on countless Minnesotans, including myself. I personally recall my Sunday school teachers as men and women of great character who I respected and admired, and who helped shape my moral fiber. As I look back on my own experience, and those of my friends and relatives, it is with considerable appreciation I make this statement today. The service given by the men and women who every week give up their Sunday mornings to help educate and mold our children is certainly service given from the heart. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, I personally thank all Sunday school teachers in my state of Minnesota and across the country for the tremendous work they do for not only our youth, but for all families and our society as a whole.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I will talk a few minutes this morning in support of the Ashcroft amendment to the Agriculture appropriations bill dealing with sanctions. I know this Agriculture appropriations bill covers many areas, including dairy, as we just heard our colleague from Rhode Island discuss. I have a different view, of course, on the dairy situation. I hope to have more on that in another statement that will also be entered into the RECORD in regard to the Agriculture appropriations bill. 
   I was disappointed the conferees decided to drop the Ashcroft Food and Medicine for the World amendment added by 70 Senators to the Senate Ag appropriations bill. I am a cosponsor of the bill to be introduced by Senator ASHCROFT and the cosponsors of his amendment. While I would prefer this bill addressed all unilateral sanctions, not just food and medicine, I strongly support the bill as a good start to reforming our sanctions policy. As a cosponsor of the Lugar Sanctions Reform Act, I believe it is long overdue that the administration and the Congress think before we sanction. 
   it makes no sense to punish the people of a country with which we have a dispute. Denying food and medicine does nothing to penalize the leaders of any country. Government leaders can always obtain adequate food and medicine, but people suffer under these sanctions, whether they are multilateral or unilateral. Those two areas should never be a part of any sanction. 
   At the same time our farmers suffer from the lingering effects of the Asian financial crisis as well as those in other areas of the world, we either have, or are debating, sanctions that further restrict markets for our farmers and medical supply companies. Since most of our sanctions are unilateral, it makes no sense to deny our farmers and workers important markets when those sales are made by our allies. I need not remind any of you that we are still experiencing the aftermath of the Soviet grain embargo of the early 1980's when the United States earned a reputation as an unreliable supplier. 
   Another example of how we have harmed our farmers is the Cuban embargo. I have for several years supported Senator DODD's Cuba food and medicine bill, similar to this proposal. For 40 years this policy was aimed at removing Fidel Castro--yet he is still there. This is a huge market for midwestern farmers, yet it is shut off to us for no good reason. Because Cuba has fiscal problems, many of its people are experiencing hardship. Those who have relationships with Cuban-Americans receive financial support, but those who don't have relatives here need access to scarce food and medical supplies. Higher shipping costs from other import sources has restricted the volume of food that can be imported. Yet here we are 90 miles away. We could help these people, but we cannot. It is time to develop more contact with the Cuban people and time to help those who do not have relatives in the United States. This bill does not aid the government, as United States guarantees can only be provided through NGOs and the private sector. Currently, donations are permitted, as well as sales of medicine, but they are very bureaucratically difficult to obtain, and they don't help everyone. Our farmers are in a good position to help and they should be allowed to do so. 
   I applaud Senators ASHCROFT and HAGEL and many others for there work to ensure farmers and medical companies will not be held hostage to those who believe sanctions can make a difference. Any administration would have to get Congressional approval for any food and medicine sanction. This is our best opportunity to help farmers and to show the world we are reliable suppliers. I urge the support of my colleagues for this long overdue legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to first commend my colleagues for their overwhelming cloture vote last night that permits the Senate to move closer to passing this very important Agriculture appropriations conference report. I especially commend my colleagues for stopping an intended filibuster that was designed to apply pressure to extend the life of the Northeast Dairy Compact. I look forward to the day when we can talk about the Northeast Dairy Compact in the past tense with its detrimental effects on Midwest dairy farmers; that time will be ended. 
   After hearing all the rhetoric about how compacts are necessary to save small family dairy farms, I think it is very important to highlight some information my office recently received. According to the USDA, NASS data regarding 1998 dairy herd size averages, Vermont dairy farm herd sizes averaged 85 head and New York farms averaged 81 head. In the Midwest, Minnesota dairy farms averaged 57 head and Wisconsin farms averaged 59 head. Again, Vermont dairy farms averaged in size almost 50 percent larger than Minnesota dairy farms. So much for the idea that the Northeast is competing against corporate farms in the Upper Midwest. 
   I cannot stress this point enough: The Northeast Dairy Compact is heavily subsidizing large-scale dairy operations while those small farmers in the region do not receive enough to seriously impact their bottom line. 
   We have always known that compacts are bad for consumers, especially low-income consumers. But now we have additional data from the USDA showing they help large-scale dairy farming operations rather than helping what we hear a lot about, the small farm proponents they claim to help. 
   Dairy compacts are an economic zero sum game in which there are many losers--most importantly, again, the consumer, and especially low-income consumers. Dairy farmers in the noncompact regions become losers. We hear the rhetoric that somehow the compact is only there for the Northeast and it doesn't have any effect on any other dairy farms across the country. That is completely false. It does have dramatic effects and impacts upon prices of farmers in other areas, especially in the Upper Midwest. 
   The real winners in this zero sum game, again, are the large dairy producers located in the Northeast that receive literally tens of thousands of dollars in subsidies for their already profitable businesses, not the small dairy farmer who supporters say were the focus of this idea to begin with. 
   The average 6-month subsidy for large Northeast dairy farms is projected to be $78,400--$78,400 in 6 months. Dairy farmers in Minnesota would relish that kind of an income if it were spread across the whole year. But Minnesota farmers wisely have rejected this effort that distorts the system and harms their fellow farmers in other States. 
   Compact supporters have chosen a strategy of pitting one region of the country against another, offering the cartel-like protection of a compact to other States to prod them into joining the economic warfare. They say: In order to strengthen our position, let's encourage others to set up compacts, let's try to expand these ``cartels,'' and then we can encourage more votes--and then, again, pitting one region of the country against another, encouraging economic warfare. Then they can carve up the market, they can receive fixed prices for the milk they produce, and they claim this policy does not discriminate against other regions of the country. 
   Higher prices promote higher production. It doesn't take a scientist to figure this out. That is, production is expanded beyond the compact region's fluid needs, the excess production then goes into nonfluid dairy products or nondrinkable milk products, and this depresses the nonfluid prices nationwide. 
   The overproduction in the Northeast generated by the compact --the cartel, the fixed prices, encouraging overproduction--then is spilt over into other regions of the country, which then depresses those prices. When they say it has no effect on other dairy farms around the country, that is completely false. It does. Where does the excess milk go? Again, the prices encourage overproduction, the overproduction then is spread out across the country, and that depresses the prices for dairy farmers in the Upper Midwest. 
   It is very disappointing to me that colleagues would describe themselves as free marketers, who understand the basic principles of economics would sign on to this protectionist economic power grab. For farmers who raise corn, soybeans, wheat, potatoes, and other commodities, it seems we are willing in this Congress to try to work for their best interests. There is no difference if you raise corn in Iowa or Illinois or Minnesota or Pennsylvania; the markets treat that corn the same. 
   It is on a competitive basis. The farmers compete on their productivity. But when it comes to milk, it is completely different. If you are in one part of the country, you get more money for your milk than in other parts. Now in the Northeast we want to set up a cartel that has price fixing, that encourages overproduction, which then spills over to the rest of the country. 
   Why do we support one part of a national agricultural policy but then distort another part of that policy, and that is dealing with dairy? Why should dairy farmers be treated differently than any other farmer? Why should we take dairy markets from one region of the country and give them to another region of the country? That is exactly, again, what the cartel does. Because the milk produced in the Northeast that is not consumed in fluid form is spilled over into the Midwest as powdered milk, cheese, and butter. So they are now competing for those markets and we are then giving them those markets, or at least a share of them. Should large producers in the Northeast be able to thrive at the expense of small farm families in the Midwest? 
   Our farm families in the Midwest are among the most productive in the country. Yet their fate now depends not on their competitiveness, not on their ability to produce in a competitive manner but on the raw deal presented to them by subsidized dairy farmers in the Northeast. 
   I am always frustrated by the claim from our pro-compact spokespersons, and repeated again in a recent Christian Science Monitor article, that compacts are necessary to guarantee customers and consumers ``an ample supply of fresh, locally produced milk.'' I am satisfied this rhetoric is designed to scare consumers into believing if they do not support these compacts they will then go to the grocery store and encounter empty milk cases because they cannot get ``fresh, locally produced milk.'' 
   The well-known truth is, with the modernization of refrigeration and transportation, we could basically eliminate the entire milk marketing orders in this country. That is why they were established to begin with, because there was not the refrigeration, there was not the transportation to ensure an adequate supply of milk in other parts of the country. So it has distorted the entire dairy process. 
   But now, with new types of refrigeration and transportation, milk can be shipped all over the country and can go to any consumer from anywhere, fresh, just as, say, oranges from Florida, lettuce from California, red meat from down in Texas. But our country's dairy supply is more than adequate to produce fluid milk; that is, the class I milk, as they call it. That milk can be supplied to any part of the continental United States. There is no shortage of fluid milk production in America. It should be built on a competitive basis, not protectionist, not a compact region, not guaranteeing some farmers protection at the expense of other farmers. 
   The country produces three times as much milk as it consumes as a beverage. ``The milk may not be locally produced,'' is what you have heard--some of the jargon now, ``fresh, locally produced''--but it will be fresh. To tell consumers they will not get fresh, locally-produced milk, again, is an intentional deception designed to lead people into thinking if there are no compacts, the grocers' milk supply will dry up or deliveries might be sporadic or frequently interrupted, which is 
   simply not true. The perception that somehow Midwest milk is not as good as anything produced locally is also an affront to the hard-working dairy farmers in my State. 
   A compact spokesman in the Christian Science Monitor article also claims that locally produced milk will be cheaper to deliver than the milk bought and brought in from outside the area. Not if you live in a compact region, it will not be cheaper. Compacts are designed to protect inefficient producers in one region against the more efficient producers in another--specifically, the efficient farmers in the Upper Midwest. When people argue that when dairy products are no longer produced within a region prices to consumers go up within the area, do not believe it. If that were true, why would they need compacts at all? 
   If milk produced locally would be cheaper, why do they need a compact at all? The reason they need it is to drive up their prices. Dairy compacts create a minimum price for milk, and they are designed to keep cheaper milk out of the region, not in the region. Again, we don't do this with any other farm product. We do not set a floor or a minimum price for corn from one region to another. We don't pit the Northeast against the Midwest against the Southeast against the South; we do not do that. But in dairy we do. 
   Dairy compacts create a minimum price for milk, and they are designed to keep cheaper milk out of a region, not into the region. So, again, why do they need compacts at all if their arguments are true? 
   Upper Midwest producers can sell class I fluid milk in New England for less than the $16.94 per hundredweight floor price of the compact. But the floor price in New England effectively keeps the cheaper milk out of the market. Indeed, after the Northeast Compact was enacted in 1997, the price of milk rose--this is the price of milk in New England--from $2.54 all the way up to a high of $3.21 a gallon. Milk prices  there initially jumped about 20 cents a gallon. In fact, there were some grocers who put up signs along the dairy case that said: Don't blame me for the higher prices in milk. Blame the compact. That was because consumers were complaining about the jump in the price of milk in the New England area. 
   So it does drive up the price. They always quote a study that was done. They said the first 6 months the compact went into effect, it had basically no effect. I would like them to take the last 6 months because the compact had not even geared up in those first 6 months, so it had very little chance to distort the market. But now, take a poll, now take a survey, do the report now, and I will bet the 6 months in the last 6 months would be much different than what they are quoting today. 
   I believe compacts are clearly bad for America. I urge my colleagues to reject their extension and insist they not, again, be slipped into another appropriations bill in the dead of night. 
   To wrap up about the dairy bill--I also wanted to talk about the Agriculture appropriations conference we are considering. I am pleased again it contains the $8.7 billion in emergency appropriations. I urge the USDA to work to get the assistance to our Nation's farmers without delay. 
   I am also encouraged by conference report language urging the President to be more aggressive in strengthening trade negotiating authority to help American farmers and also in expressing Congress' goals for the upcoming negotiations. The 
   conference report is not perfect but it will give our farmers the help to make it through another year. But it will be imperative that Congress continues to address reforms in our trade sanctions, EPA regulations, crop insurance, and also in the Tax Code for farmers to have an environment in which they can truly thrive. I am also glad conferees added additional assistance to farmers who suffered through these natural disasters. 
   I urge the USDA, when it is distributing the aid, to remember farmers in the northwestern part of my State of Minnesota have been prevented from planting due to flooding. In fact, some farmers in the northwestern part of Minnesota have not had crops now for 7 years because of varying disasters: Flood, drought, disease, et cetera. In northwestern Minnesota this year, crop agents and FSA crop acreage reports show that 70 to 75 percent of the entire area's tillable acres were prevented from being planted in 1999. Only 10 percent of the normal intended acreage of annual crops will be harvested this year at all. Rainfall amounted to over 200 percent of normal in the critical planting months of April, May, and June. 
   I know there have been many farmers across the Nation affected by drought this year, just the opposite of the problems we have had. But I do expect USDA to provide sufficient and equitable relief to farmers in northwestern Minnesota who have been shortchanged in the past by some of these relief bills. I now hope Congress will turn to enacting long-term solutions that will make such emergency packages as this one unnecessary. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues to fulfill our responsibilities to the American farmer. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, the Senate's responsibility for advice and consent on treaties places a grave responsibility on the institution and its members. There is a very high bar that treaties have to meet, a two-thirds vote in the Senate. That is for good reason. Our nation takes our treaty obligations seriously, and the Senate is the final check on flawed or premature commitments. While I support the goal of controlling nuclear proliferation, it is becoming clear the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) is not in the best interests of this nation. 
   After a meeting with the President, personal discussions with some of our nation's top diplomats, including former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, and participation in hearings held by the Foreign Relations Committee, I harbor reservations about this treaty in its current form and question if it would truly be in the nation's best strategic interest as we move into the 21st Century. 
   Specifically, the treaty fails to address the key questions of verifiability and reliability: can the results that treaty supporters hope to achieve be verified, and can the treaty ensure the continued reliability of our nation's stockpile? 
   Since I have been in the Senate, I have voted for three arms control treaties. However, in my judgment, this zero-yield test ban is not in our best interest. We would not be able to verify compliance with the Treaty or ensure the safety and reliability of our nuclear arsenal. Six former Defense Secretaries, two former CIA Directors from the Clinton Administration, and two former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including Minnesota's General Vessey, have concluded that ratification of the CTBT would be incompatible with our nation's security interests. 
   The original official negotiating position of the Clinton Administration was to have a treaty with a finite duration of 10 years that permitted low-yield nuclear tests and would have forced countries such as Russia and China into a more reliable verification monitoring regime. If the Administration had negotiated a treaty along those lines, I think it would have had a workable result with a good chance of being ratified. 
   Instead, the Administration agreed to a treaty of unlimited duration and a zero-yield ban that prohibits all nuclear tests; a treaty which is clearly unverifiable and a clear departure from the positions of all previous Administrations, both Democratic and 
   Republican. For instance, President Eisenhower insisted that low-yield nuclear tests be permitted. President Kennedy ended a three-year moratorium on nuclear tests, saying the U.S. would ``never again'' make that kind of error. President Carter opposed a zero-yield test ban while in office because it would undermine the U.S. nuclear deterrent. No other Administration has ever supported a zero-yield ban which prohibits all nuclear tests. 
   Ronald Reagan's words, ``Trust but verify,'' remain a guiding principle. But a zero-yield ban is not verifiable. While the exact thresholds are classified, it is commonly understood that the United States cannot detect nuclear explosions below a few kilotons of yield. We know that countries can take advantage of existing geologic formations, such as salt domes, to decouple their nuclear tests and render them undetectable. Also, advances in commercial mining capability have enabled countries to muffle their nuclear tests, allowing them to conduct militarily significant nuclear explosions with little chance of being detected. 
   Should technical means of verification fail, the onsite inspection regime is extremely weak. If we suspect a country has cheated, thirty out of fifty-one nations on the Executive Council have to agree to an inspection. It will be extremely difficult to reach this mark given that the Council established under the treaty has quotas from regional groups and the U.S. and other nuclear powers are not guaranteed seats. If an inspection is approved, the suspected state can deny access to particular inspectors and can declare a 50-square kilometer area off limits. These are exactly the type of conditions we rejected in the case of UNSCOM in Iraq. 
   As to the question of reliability, we all recognize that our nuclear deterrent is effective only if other nations have confidence that our nuclear stockpile will perform as expected. A loss of confidence would not only embolden our adversaries, it would cause our allies to question the usefulness of the U.S. nuclear guarantee. We could end up with more nuclear powers rather than fewer. 
   There is a very real threat the credibility of our nuclear deterrent will erode if nuclear testing is prohibited. Historically, the U.S. often has been surprised by how systems which performed well in non-nuclear simulations of nuclear effects failed to function properly in an actual nuclear environment. Indeed, it was only following nuclear tests that certain vulnerability to nuclear effects was discovered in all U.S. strategic nuclear systems except the Minuteman II. 
   The Stockpile Stewardship Program is advertised as an effective alternative to nuclear 
   testing. I hope it will enable us to avoid testing in the near future. However, many of the critical tools for the Stockpile Stewardship Program have not been developed. For example, the high-powered laser system which supposedly will have the capacity to test the reliability and safety of our nuclear stockpile was scheduled to come on line in 2003, but has now been pushed back two years later. We should make sure that alternatives to nuclear testing are fully capable before we commit to abandoning testing. 
   There also are very real safety concerns which we must address when dealing with aging materials and components of weapons that can degrade in unpredictable ways. Right now, only one of the nine types of weapons in our nuclear stockpile have all available safety features in place, because adding them would have required nuclear testing. It doesn't make sense to effectively freeze our stockpile before all of our weapons are made as safe as possible. We must make sure that the members of our armed forces who handle these weapons are not placed in jeopardy, and the communities which are close to nuclear weapons sites are not endangered. 
   Furthermore, this treaty would not ensure U.S. nuclear superiority. As John Deutch, Henry Kissinger and Brent Scowcroft stated in a recent op-ed, ``no serious person should believe that rogue nations such as Iran or Iraq will give up their efforts to acquire nuclear weapons if only the United States ratifies the CTBT.'' There is already a  nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Any threshold state that is ready to test has already broken the norms associated with that treaty. There is no reason to believe that the CTBT regime, which has no real enforcement mechanism, will succeed where the NPT has failed. Nations that are habitual violators of arms control treaties will escape detection, building new weapons to capitalize upon the U.S. deficiencies and vulnerabilities created by the CTBT. 
   While I support continuing the current moratorium on nuclear testing, it seems premature for the United States to consider ratifying the CTBT. I can envision a time, however, when ratification of a much better negotiated treaty could benefit our nation--but not until we have developed better techniques for verification and enforcement, and the advanced scientific equipment we need for the stockpile stewardship program.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution which would designate the week of February 14-20 as ``National Biotechnology Week.'' 
   I'm submitting this resolution because I believe it is important for our nation to recognize the role biotechnology has played in enhancing, saving and extending our lives. Indeed, biotechnology has extended the average American's life by nearly 25 years. 
   Mr. President, the 20th century has shown the most significant advancements in all fields of biotechnology and there is reason to believe it will continue to deliver great hope and promise well into the 21st century. This industry is one of our fastest growing and will add thousands of new job opportunities to our economy. Just as the weeks of January and February, 2000 represent the start of a countdown to a new millennium beginning in 2001, they also represent the countdown to breakthroughs we all once thought were impossible. 
   Already, advances made in agricultural biotechnology have given us increased crop yields and promises of new uses for our agricultural commodities as well as the higher quality, more nutritious products to improve the competitiveness of our farmers. Great strides have been made through the use of biotechnology and health care and hold the keys to successfully treating or curing diseases such as cancer, diabetes and countless other conditions. Biotechnology has assisted us in improving water quality, conserving precious topsoil and reducing the need for pesticides which helps us improve our environment for future generations. 
   Mr. President, these are just a few examples of the impact biotechnology has had on our lives. I believe Americans should understand the importance of biotechnology in our way of life. With the passage of the resolution I introduce today, we provide a forum for many events in February to salute and promote this industry of the future. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing this important industry.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise strongly to support Senator NICKLES' pending amendment on the Labor-HHS bill, and I commend his leadership and vitality on this very important issue. 
   This amendment reassures the American people that Congress is not going to spend one penny of Social Security money, and it will put the Senate on record that we will honor that commitment. 
   We hear our colleagues from the other side of the aisle say Republicans are already dipping into Social Security. They want to spend more money. 
   That is not true. What we are trying to do is say we are going to go up to the edge but not go over; that is, not spend one dime of Social Security money. By being able to do that, we don't want to dip into the Social Security trust fund. We think everybody, across the board, on discretionary spending should make sure that doesn't happen. 
   That means we have an across-the-board cut. In other words, reduce all spending, in order to protect Social Security. That, I think, would be a fair and even way to do it. 
   Our colleagues on the other side don't want to cut spending. They are not talking about cutting spending at all in any programs. What they are saying--and the gimmicks they would use or the magic they would put into this budget--is simple tax increases. Let's penalize big tobacco, they say. But they don't tell us there are dozens of other tax increases buried in their proposal that would also affect every other average working American in this country. In other words, to support their higher spending level, they want to go out and attack the taxpayer. ``Let's raise taxes,'' ``close loopholes,'' are some of the words they use. The magic they put in it is tax increases. 
   That means every American out there can face higher Federal taxes in order to support larger spending. We are saying, let's do it the other way around. Let us be fiscally responsible. Let us not ask more of the taxpayer. Let us reduce spending across the board and do it in a very fair and equitable way. 
   I believe this is a crucial step to truly protect the Social Security surplus and save it exclusively for Americans' retirement, not for tax relief, not for government spending. This is a line we absolutely have to draw in the sand. 
   In fact, over the past few days I have been working on legislation which is related to Senator NICKLES' amendment. I will introduce the bill today. 
   This legislation will be complimentary to the Nickles amendment. His is a sense-of-the-Senate--my bill would create a mechanism to enforce our commitment. It would prevent anyone, whether it be the Congress or the administration, from raiding the Social Security surplus. This enforcement mechanism is simple and straightforward. Because we won't know whether we are spending the Social Security surplus until we get the CBO revised numbers in January, this bill will trigger an automatic across-the-board cut in discretionary spending to make up any differences if the January reestimate shows we are spending any Social Security surplus. It would work similarly to the sequester of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings, but applies to Social Security surplus spending. 
   Let me address why it is so important to pass both the Nickles sense-of-the-Senate and my legislation. Economic forecasting is more of an art that a science. Many uncertainties, risks, and factors are involved. We have a budget of $1.8 trillion based on a variety of assumptions, estimates, forecasts and projections, with people using both CBO numbers and OMB numbers. It is highly likely that there are errors in this budget. While we should learn from our past mistakes and take a very prudent and conservative approach in our economic outlook and our spending, a $10 billion error in forecasting of $1.8 trillion is not uncommon. 
   However, some of our colleagues are out there accusing us of spending the Social Security surplus. the truth is, we don't want to, but honestly we don't know for certain at this point. Neither does the President nor our Democratic colleagues. That is, whey we need my bill as our insurance that we will live up to our commitment. 
   Some wave the CBO August letter to prove they are right. But Mr. President, as one economist observed, ``If you torture numbers long enough, they will confess to anything.'' This is true with the CBO estimates. As you know, the CBO is a scorekeeping office and it scores based on whatever assumptions Congress requires it to use. We could continue to argue indefinitely over the right assumptions. That does not solve the problem. 
   Since both Congress and President Clinton have agreed that saving Social Security should be our top priority and have committed to not spending the Social Security surplus for government programs, we must find a better way to keep our promise to the American people. 
   Republicans have made a number of attempts to create a lockbox to lock in every penny of the Social Security surplus, not for government spending, not for tax relief, but exclusively for Americans' retirement. Unfortunately, opposition by the Democrats has blocked the establishment of this safe lockbox. 
   In the absence of the Social Security safety lockbox, I hope that all of our colleagues and the President agree with us that we must draw a line in the sand. And live up to our pledge that not a penny of the Social Security surplus will be spent to fund this year's appropriations. Personally, I will vote against any spending bills that our right plans to spend Social Security money. If our spending plans do pass and we would, unintentionally wind up spending Social Security, my bill allows us to keep our commitment to the American people, by scaling back other spending to save Social Security. 
   Again, since we must use economic assumptions, the difficulty we are facing is because the numbers are so close we won't know if this year's appropriations have spent the Social Security surplus--or which specific spending bill or bills have spent the money--until next year when we receive the CBO re-estimate. Therefore we need an effective enforcement mechanism to ensure that Congress and the President do not touch the Social Security money. 
   The best mechanism is that proposed by Senator NICKLES' sense-of-the-Senate and my legislation. If this year's appropriations end up spending the Social Security surplus as a result of estimate errors, we will automatically rescind that amount by reducing government spending across-the-board and return it to the Social Security trust fund. This will affect discretionary spending only--not entitlement programs for seniors or the needy. 
   My biggest fear, is that without this mechanism Congress and the President may spend some of the Social Security surplus by using erroneous estimates. We would be forced to legislate after the fact if there is a re-estimate that shows spending of the Social Security surplus. The atmosphere of panic could cloud the type and speed of the remedy. The remedy should be my bill, and it should be passed before we face a problem, so we cannot play the blame game once we have a re-estimate. 
   The President's revised budget plan would have dipped into the Social Security surplus by $24 billion. Counting his $12 billion emergency spending request, the President would spend $36 billion of the Social Security surplus for fiscal year 2000. Compared with his original budget, which would have taken $150 billion from the trust funds, this revised plan is a great improvement. 
   However, the President still wants to spend money he pledged to save. That's not acceptable. We must say no to anyone who wants to spend even a penny of the Social Security surplus because we promised the American people we would save it. There is no excuse in an era of budget surplus to continue raiding the Social Security trust funds. Washington has done enough damage to America's retirement system.  
   In 1998, American workers paid $489 billion into the Social Security system, but most of the money, $382 billion, was immediately paid out to 44 million beneficiaries the same year. That left a $106 billion surplus. The total accumulated surplus in the trust fund is $763 billion. 
   Unfortunately, this surplus exists only on paper. The Government has consumed all the $763 billion for non-Social Security related programs. All it has are the Treasury IOUs. 
   Despite Washington's rhetoric of using every penny of Social Security surplus to save Social Security, last year's omnibus appropriations bill alone spent over $22 billion of the Social Security surplus. Without the enforceable mechanism provided by the Nickles amendment and my legislation, the Social Security surplus is likely to be spent to fund other government programs in fiscal year 2000 and the outyears. 
   Enough is enough. We must stop this outrageous practice. The time is now to show our resolve in protecting every penny of the Social Security surplus to ensure it will be available for Americans' retirement income security. 
   Do not mistakenly think that our colleagues across the aisle have changed their big spending ways by their rhetoric opposing spending the Social Security surplus. Do not believe for a second that they want to maintain fiscal discipline. They still want to spend more by taxing more. 
   Instead of controlling spending, the President and the Democrats have increased government spending and created even more government programs. They believe they know best how to spend taxpayers' money and that they can do more by spending more. 
   This solution to continue to grow funding for government programs at unprecedented high levels is to raise taxes. In the President's budget, he has not just proposed to penalize American tobacco companies, but to raise taxes on also small businesses, homeowners as well as millions of other Americans who are already overtaxed. 
   Again, the President's solution to avoiding spending the Social Security surplus will be to increase taxes. He will penalize American small businesses by changing their tax rules; he penalizes millions of American seniors who rely on life insurance products for their retirement; he penalizes non-profit trade organizations, which serve the disadvantaged in their communities so well, by taking away their tax exempt status; he penalizes other American companies by imposing environmental surtaxes and excise taxes. The President also penalizes millions of American homeowners by increasing their mortgage transaction fees; he penalizes millions of American travelers by raising taxes on their domestic air passenger tickets. 
   Is there anyone left who hasn't been penalized by the President and his colleagues in the Congress? 
   A tax increase is not the solution to this year's serious spending problem. Exercising fiscal discipline is our best solution. Although we don't know if we already have spent the Social Security surplus for fiscal year 2000 due to uncertain and incomplete estimates, we should take a very prudent approach on spending. On principle, we must do everything we can to ensure Washington will not have a chance to touch any Social Security money. 
   I am disappointed that instead of solving the problem, Washington is trying again to hide behind creative financing, forward funding, emergency spending and so-called technical adjustments to give the appearance we are not breaking the spending caps or eating into the Social Security surplus. I am also disappointed that Congress spends every penny of the $14 billion on-budget surplus for increased spending. Remember, this $14 billion is the tax overpayment which we promised to return to working Americans in the form of tax relief. I proposed this in the budget resolution and Congress included this in our budget resolution early this year. 
   I have warned repeatedly that if we don't return tax overcharges to the taxpayers or reduce the debt, Washington will spend it all, leaving nothing for tax relief or the vitally important task of preserving Social Security. This year's appropriations bills have proven my fear to be well founded. The last thing we want to do is to spend these tax overpayments to enlarge the government. Since President Clinton's veto prevents major tax relief this year, we at least should dedicate this on-budget surplus to reduce the national debt. But we are spending every penny of it, in violation of our commitment in the budget resolution. 
   Twenty-five years ago, the Congress passed the Congressional Budget Act, which created an annual budgeting process in the hope of controlling spiraling government spending. Twenty five years later we have made progress but are still unable to tame this beast. 
   Today, spending is at an all-time high, and so are taxes. The government is getting bigger, not smaller. Government spending is growing twice as fast as personal income. Discretionary spending has increased by over 20 percent since 1993. 
   The budget process has become so complicated that most lawmakers have a hard time understanding it. Of course, that hasn't stopped the proliferation of budget gimmicks to circumvent the intent of the Congress. The flawed budget process allows Members to vote to control spending in the budget and then turn right around and vote for increased appropriations. 
   Spending caps are the best example of the phrase ``fiscal discipline'' means nothing in Washington. Spending caps were supposedly a good tool to control spending--if the President and lawmakers could stick to them. But since the establishment of statutory spending limits, Washington has repeatedly broken them because of a lack of fiscal discipline. In fact, the first budget criteria in the past has been to first break the caps so spending could be accommodated. 
   Washington set new spending caps in 1990 after it failed to meet its deficit reduction targets. In 1993, President Clinton broke the spending caps for his new spending increases and created new caps. But in 1997, the President could not live within his own spending caps, and he broke them again. New spending caps were again re-negotiated and established in BBA. 
   By 1998, one year later Congress and President Clinton could not live within their new limits and proposed over $22 billion of so-called ``emergency spending'' and other unauthorized spending in the omnibus spending legislation to get around the caps. The use of ``emergency'' spending is far too broad, and has become a common budget gimmick. 
   This year Washington may spend $37 billion or more above the spending caps and use more creative bookkeeping to give the impression we are maintaining the caps. It demands more spending to fully fund government programs, but delays payment of the bills until the next fiscal year, placing more and more pressure on future caps and spending commitments. 
   Again and again, Washington lowers the fiscal bar and them jumps over it, or finds ways around it, at the expense of the American taxpayers. This is wrong. If we commit to living within the statutory spending caps, we must stick to them. We must use every tool available to enforce these spending limits. If we were still facing a budget deficit we would not be spending this much money. But because there is a surplus, the feeding frenzy continues. Again, a lack of fiscal discipline. 
   I understand the upward spending pressure the Congress is facing this year and in the outyears. But I believe we should, and can, meet this challenge by prioritizing and streamlining government programs while maintaining fiscal discipline. We can reduce wasteful, unnecessary, duplicate, low-priority government programs to fund the necessary and responsible functions of government. We could if we tried, but it seems it's easier just to throw more money at the budget. Many believe we can help more if we spend more, but the spending comes at the expense of somebody--and that somebody is usually the average, middle-class taxpayer. 
   It's true that our short-term fiscal situation has improved greatly due to the continued growth of our economy. However, our long-term financial imbalance still poses a major threat to the health of our future economic security. The President said tax relief was irresponsible. Wrong. It's spending appetite that is irresponsible. 
   Breaking the caps through more and more spending will only worsen our  short-term fiscal outlook and affect our ability to deal with long-term budget pressures. 
   We can run but we cannot hide from our budget problems. We must make hard choices and be honest about it. While ``advance appropriations,'' ``advance funding'' and ``forward funding'' are not uncommon practices here, it does not mean they are the right thing to do, particularly when these budget techniques are used to dodge much-needed fiscal discipline. 
   In the past 5 years, ``advance appropriations'' have increased dramatically, jumping from $1.9 billion in fiscal year 1996 to $11.6 billion in fiscal year 2000, an increase of $9.7 billlion over 5 years. This year, President Clinton proposed advancing nearly $19 billion into fiscal year 2001. Advance appropriations create even worse problems for us in the outyears. We must end this irresponsible practice. 
   I realize how extremely difficult it is for appropriators to get their job done this year. I appreciate the fact that tremendous efforts are being made to keep our promise not to spend any of Social Security surplus. My point is, in an era of budget surplus, extra prudence and effort is needed to keep ourselves from spending more than we can afford. If we can maintain fiscal discipline, we will be able to honor our commitment to the American people not to take any money from Social Security. 
   Protecting the Social Security surplus from funding government operations is the last defense of fiscal discipline. I cannot emphasize how vitally important this line of defense is for both the Republican Party as well as the Democratic Party. If we lose this defense, our credibility and accountability with the Americn people will be gone. 
   Mr. President, the best protection is the Nickles sense-of-the-Senate amendment coupled with my legislation. If more accurate or actual numbers show Congress and the President have spent the Social Security surplus for fiscal year 2000 and beyond, an effective mechanism will ensure the money is returned. It is plain and simple. I hope my colleagues from both sides will support the Nickles amendment and my legislation.

   Mr. GRAMS. Why would it be 9 percent? Some of the latest numbers I have seen are anywhere from $3.8 to $5.6 billion, and all of the appropriation bills are not yet completed. They have not been submitted or voted on, so we are still estimating. If the Senator is talking about $30 billion or $40 billion, we are not in that range right now. Those accusations have been made, but according to the numbers I have seen, we are not in that range.

   Mr. GRAMS. Without agreeing to the Senator's numbers, let me say that if that were the case, wouldn't it show that we are spending more than we should and that that kind of a cut would be something that we should do? If we are going to go back and say to the taxpayer: We can't manage the books and somehow we have spent 9 or 10 percent more in discretionary spending than we have, and the only way we can make it up is to go out and penalize, as my colleagues have said, big tobacco, but also penalize in dozens of other ways with other tax increases--in other words, if we can't do our job responsibly--then we should go to the taxpayer and say, let's just have a little more revenue to make up those differences. I don't think it is going to be in the range of 9 or 10 percent. If that would be true, I think that would be a glaring argument we are overspending by 10 percent in discretionary spending and we should make every effort to trim that spending.

   Mr. GRAMS. I think we are overspending by that much, too. I will say this once again, as I mentioned earlier in my statement. We are using a lot of different numbers. We are using a lot of assessments, projections. We are taking a lot of risks in a $1.8 trillion budget. If some of these numbers are wrong, then I think we need to go back and adjust them. The question, I guess, comes down to how do we adjust them. My colleagues on the other side would adjust them by raising taxes so they could keep spending more. What we are advocating is we would adjust our spending habits and spend less across the board. I think we need to do that 
   because taxpayers today are paying taxes at an all-time record high. Forty-two percent, on average, of everything people in my State of Minnesota earn goes to pay taxes. I think that we can't continue to ask them to pay even more because we can't hold down their spending. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield back my time.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation extending the term of the CCC marketing assistance loans made to producers by Farm Service Agencies from nine months to thirty-six months. Moreover, my bill grants the Secretary of Agriculture discretion to extend the term of a marketing assistance loan for an additional nine month period if the Secretary determines the extension beyond the thirty-six months would be beneficial to producers. 
   This nonrecourse marketing assistance loan program gives farmers more bargaining power in the market because they are not forced to sell their crops immediately after the harvest. Without the loan program, buyers' knowledge that farmers have their backs against the wall needing money to repay their bills can force down prices. Prices at harvest also tend to be lower due to the ample volume of grains. These nonrecourse loans permit a farmer to store the grain for a period of time, allowing him the opportunity to sell his crop later when the market price might be higher than the harvest price. 
   The problem with the current system is that buyers know when the nine month loans are coming due, which adversely impacts the marketing position of producers. Buyers know that the financial pressure on producers is building and they will be forced to take a lower price. Extending the term of the loans from nine to thirty six months will give the farmers better marketing power because it introduces more uncertainty and therefore options to farmers on when the grain will be sold. 
   I should note that I do not expect farmers to exhaust the full thirty-six months to market their grain, or that the Secretary would routinely extend that term to 45 months, due to the decline in grain quality that would consequently occur. However, I wanted to ensure that farmers possess as much flexibility as possible in deciding when to market their product.  
   Again, with this bill, I hope to provide farmers with another marketing tool to help them get the best price possible on the market. Our farm families are hurting, and we must help. In addition to introducing this bill, I want to again call upon Agriculture Appropriations conferees to complete their work without adding new issues. Relief to farmers must be passed as soon as possible. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Agriculture Committee to pass my bill in the near future.

   Mr. GRAMS. I heard the Senator earlier talking about what is going on in the conference committee now, dealing with agricultural appropriations. The Senator talked about the Northeast Dairy Compact. As mentioned, we had a full and open debate, had a floor vote, and were able to defeat the compact--as we did 2 years ago, by the way. Also, we talked about farmers across the country, dairy farmers, recently voting for a compromise on milk marketing orders, the new orders that were put out by the USDA. It was not everything everybody wanted, but it was a compromise between the 1-B and the 1-A. But now we find out again, as happened in 1997, people are working actively inside the conference to try to insert language to basically overturn those issues that have had widespread solid support, both among the dairy farmers across the country and also Members on the floor of the Senate. 
   I was wondering why is this going on in the conference, in the Senator's opinion?

   Mr. GRAMS. I would like to follow up my question. 
   I know Senator WELLSTONE would like to be part of this debate and ask a question as well. 
   But I know we have some differences on the Freedom to Farm, but one thing Freedom to Farm did not do is pit one region of farmers against another, whether it was dealing with corn or soybeans or any of the other commodities. But somehow when it comes to dairy, an antiquated system, as you mentioned, needs to be changed. 
   We are looking at something that basically says we are going to have some winners in this country--when it comes to dairy--but we are going to have some losers. In other words, the dairy farmers in Wisconsin and Minnesota have the Government with an antiquated dairy program standing on their necks and saying: You are not going to be able to succeed because we are going to put limits on you. Yet we are going to give tremendous advantages to others. 
   All we are asking for is fairness, a level playing field. We are not asking for farmers in the Northeast or the Southwest to be disadvantaged. But we sure cannot support a program that says: You are going to have some farmers who are winners and some who are losers. 
   So how do we work this into a new dairy bill coming out of this session that is going to give our farmers just an opportunity to compete, which is all they ask for?

   Mr. GRAMS. I wanted to ask a quick question if I could. What we are asking for doesn't cost money. This is not a request to give farmers in Minnesota or Wisconsin more money but to allow them the ability to compete on a level playing field. That is all we are asking for, as far as this dairy policy goes. 
   As you mentioned, and very well have laid out the problem, 
   this is a program set up in 1930, completely outdated. If we were going to begin a new milk marketing program today, it would not look like anything debated in the committees at all. This is an unfair system, outdated. It has no rhyme or reason to markets or regions or producers or our dairy farmers. So we have a system now, and all we are asking for is legislation or a program that would allow our farmers to compete. We are willing to compete with anybody in any part of the country and let the chips fall where they may. 
   At the same time, this program will cost consumers additional money, whether it is low-income, whether it is school lunch programs, or whatever it is. So this program has a lot of negatives to it, and all we are asking for is a level playing field and competition. Is that what the Senator says?

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, every year at this time it seems we are here on the Senate floor debating another attack on the Forest Service's Timber Management Program. Every year those who wish to eliminate logging in our national forests come up with another angle which they claim helps protect the environment by eliminating ``wasteful'' spending on logging practices. Every year people throughout northern Minnesota and forested regions across the country see their jobs and their livelihoods threatened in the name of preservation or conservation. And every year, those of us who represent the good people of the timber and paper industry in our states have to fight, scratch, and claw our way to a narrow victory that saves those jobs and those families from economic ruin. 
   I come from a state in which the forest and paper industry is vital to our economy. The reduction in the timber program on national forests has had a dramatic impact over the past ten years on the number of jobs and the economic vitality of northern Minnesota. According to Minnesota Forest Industries (MFI), jobs provided by the timber program in Minnesota dropped from over 1,900 in 1987 to less than 1,100 last year, and they continue to decline. 
   The reduction in timber harvests on federal lands has had an equally dramatic effect on unrealized economic impacts. MFI estimates that unrealized economic benefits include over $10 million from timber sales, $25 million in federal taxes, $2.5 million in payments to states, and $116 million in community economic impact in Minnesota alone. 
   It is important to point out that the timber program in national forests has a very positive impact on the amount of federal money that goes to rural counties and schools. Nationally, the program contributes $225 million to counties and schools each year through receipts from timber sales in national forests. In Minnesota, the timber program provided roughly $1.7 million to counties and schools in 1998 alone. If the timber program would have met its allowable sale quantity in 1998, that number would have risen to nearly $2.5 million. 
   I am fascinated by the claims of some of my colleagues that the timber program is a subsidy to wealthy timber and paper companies and the claims that the timber program loses money because we are giving timber away to these companies. If you truly believe that, I challenge you to visit northern Minnesota and speak with the families who have lost their mills and the loggers who have lost their jobs. Talk to the counties and the private landowners who cannot access to their own property because the Forest Service doesn't have enough money to do the environmental reviews. Or talk directly to the Forest Service personnel and let them tell you how lengthy and costly environmental reviews and the overwhelming number of court challenges to those reviews is making the timber program so costly. 
   Then go speak with state or county land managers and ask them why their timber programs are so successful. Ask them why their lands are so much more healthy than the federal lands and why they're able to make money with their timber programs. In Minnesota, St. Louis County only has to spend 26 cents in order to generate one dollar of revenue in their timber program and the State of Minnesota spends 75 cents to generate one dollar of revenue. The Superior National Forest, on the other hand, spends one dollar and three cents to get the same result. 
   I cannot see how my colleagues can stand here on the Senate floor and tell me that the forest and paper industry in our country, and its employees, are the bad guys. The forest and paper industry in America employs over 1.5 million people and ranks among the top ten manufacturing employers in 46 states. These are good, traditional jobs that help a family make a living, allow children to pursue higher education, help keep rural families in rural areas, and provide a legitimate tax base from which rural counties can fund basic services. These are jobs that we in Congress should be working diligently not only to protect, but to grow. 
   Unfortunately, many Members of Congress who advocate these ideas have never taken the time to understand the positive economic and environmental benefits of science-based timber harvests. They have never sat down with a county commissioner who does not know where he is going to get the money for some of the most basic services the county provides to its citizens. They have never considered that for every 1 million board feet in timber harvest reductions in Minnesota, 10 people lose their jobs and over $570,000 in economic activity is lost. And they have never taken the time to go into a  healthy forest where prudent logging practices have been essential to ensuring the vitality and diversity of species. 
   If Members of this body want to make the timber program profitable across the country, then we should have an honest debate about what works and does not work in the program. We should discuss frankly the ridiculous number of hoops public land managers have to jump through in order to process a timber sale. I think we need to discuss the fact that under the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act the federal government must provide access across federal lands for state, county, and private landowners to access their land. Yet in Minnesota, those landowners either have to wait a number of years or pay for the environmental reviews themselves because the Forest Service claims it does not have enough money. We should also discuss openly the dramatic impact court challenges are having on the ability of the Forest Service to do its job and to carry out the timber program in a cost-effective manner. On top of that, it's clear that under this administration the Forest Service does not want a timber program that shows a profit and they have done an effective job of using the powers of the executive branch to vilify both the timber program and the men and women of my state who rely upon that program in order to meet their most basic needs. 
   Virtually everyone in this body, including this Senator, is committed to the protection of our environment and to the conservation of our wildlife species and wildlife habitat. I believe we can expand upon our commitment to wildlife and provide additional resources for habitat protection. But I do not believe we must do so on the backs of timber and paper workers throughout the nation. I am willing to work with anybody in this chamber towards those conservation efforts, but let's not do it by pitting timber and paper workers against conservationists. 
   We cannot simply stand here and claim that the Bryan amendment is an easy way to throw some money towards the preservation of public land. Rather, this amendment is going to take jobs from my constituents and hurt the economy of the northern part of my state. The Bryan amendment is just one more step down the road toward eliminating logging on federal land. This amendment is going to reduce the ability of a number of rural counties in my state to make ends meet and to provide necessary services to residents. Those are just a few of the realities of the Bryan amendment and just a few of the reasons why I cannot and will not support its passage.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I have had a chance to discuss the role of the U.S. at the United Nations with the nominee on a number of occasions and I am confident that the President has nominated the right man for the job. Mr. Holbrooke has a reputation for being a tough negotiator and a practiced arm-twister and those are exactly the attributes we need in our next Ambassador to the United Nations. 
   It's not going to be easy to get the UN to implement the Helms-Biden package even though there is widespread agreement on the need for reform. I believe Ambassador Holbrooke has the skills necessary to leverage our position as the most powerful nation in the world--and as the largest contributor to the UN--to ensure greater transparency and accountability in that organization. That is why I have enthusiastically backed the nomination of Mr. Holbrooke and look forward to working with him in the future.

   Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, in a few hours we are going to cast a very important vote to return tax overpayments to working Americans. The passage of the conference report of the Taxpayer Reform Act will signal a clear victory for all Americans. I commend the Senate Republican leadership and especially Chairman ROTH for their strong commitment to major tax relief in this Congress. 
   We promised to return to American families the non-Social Security tax overcharges they paid to the Government, and today we are going to fulfill that solemn promise. We can now proudly declare that: promises made are promises kept. 
   The proposed tax relief significantly reduces taxes for millions of American families and individuals and immediately eases working Americans' tax burden and allows them to keep a little more of their own money, again, for their own family's priorities. 
   The American people have every reason to celebrate this victory because they are the winners in this debate on tax cuts. 
   This tax relief is a victory for all Americans, particularly the middle-class, who will receive a $800 billion tax refund over the next 10 years. 
   It is a victory for millions of Minnesotans because each family in my state of Minnesota is expected to receive $8,000 in tax relief over 10 years. 
   It is a victory for the 22 million American couples who will no longer be penalized by the marriage penalty tax, because we completely eliminate this unfair tax. 
   It is a victory for millions of farmers and small business owners because this tax relief enables them to pass their hard-earned legacies to their children without being subject to the cruel death tax. 
   It is a victory for millions of self-employed and uninsured because health care is made more affordable to them with full tax benefits. 
   It is a victory for millions of baby-boomers because the pension reform allows them to set aside more money for their retirement. 
   It is a victory for millions of entrepreneurs and investors because the capital gains tax is reduced to stimulate the economy. 
   It is also a victory for millions of parents, students, teachers, and workers because higher and better education will be available and affordable with a variety of tax benefits included in this package. 
   By any standard, the working men and women of this country are the winners, not Washington. 
   Moreover, in my judgment, this tax relief plan is a highly sensible, responsible and prudent one. It reflects American values and is based on sound tax and fiscal policy. It comes at the right time for working Americans. 
   We must recall that Americans have long been overtaxed, and millions of middle-class families cannot even make ends meet due to the growing tax burden. They are desperately in need of the largest tax relief possible. 
   The budget surplus comes directly from income tax increases. These overpaid taxes are taken from American workers and they have every right to get it all back. 
   This tax relief takes only a small portion of the total budget surplus. In fact, only 23 cents of every dollar of the budget surplus goes for tax relief. 
   After providing this 23 cent tax relief, we have reserved enough budget surplus to protect Social Security and to reform Medicare, including prescription drug coverage for needy seniors. We further reduce the national debt and reserve funding for essential federal programs. 
   Contrary to Mr. Clinton's rhetoric that tax relief will cause recession, cutting taxes will keep our economy strong, will create jobs, increase savings and productivity, forestall a recession and produce more tax revenues. Somehow, he believes that if Americans spend the money, it is bad, but if it is left here for Washington to spend, it is good. History has proved again and again that tax cuts work. It will prove this tax relief is a sound one as well. 
   I am also pleased that this tax relief does not come at the expense of seniors. We have locked in every penny of the $1.9 trillion Social Security surplus over the next 10 years, not for government programs, not for tax cuts, but  exclusively to protect all Americans' retirement. 
   We have been working hard to reform Medicare to ensure it will be there for seniors. Prescription drug coverage for the needy will be part of our commitment to seniors to protect their Medicare benefits. Had the White House and Democrats cooperated with us, we could have fixed Medicare by now. The President discounted his own commission on Medicare reform. 
   In any event, we will continue our effort to preserve Medicare as Chairman ROTH reveals his Medicare bill in the near future. 
   We have reduced the national debt and will continue to dramatically reduce it. Debt held by the public will decrease to $0.9 trillion by 2009. The interest payment to service the debt will drop from $229 billion in 1999 to $71 billion in 2009. We will eliminate the entire debt held by the public by 2012. 
   As I indicated before, we have not ignored spending needs to focus on tax cuts as has been charged. We not only have funded all the functions of the government, but also significantly increased funding for our budget priorities, such as defense, education, Medicare, agriculture and others. 
   In fact, we set aside over $505 billion in non-Social Security surplus to meet these needs. This proves we can provide $792 billion in tax relief while not ignoring other important priorities. 
   This major tax relief does not come at the expense of seniors, farmers, women, children or any other deserving group. 
   On the contrary, it benefits all Americans and keeps our economy strong. And most importantly, this tax relief will give every working American more freedom to decide what's best for themselves and their families. 
   Mr. President, let me conclude my remarks by citing President Reagan who once said: ``Every major tax cut in this century has strengthened the economy, generated renewed productivity, and ended up yielding new revenues for the government by creating new investment, new jobs and more commerce among our people.'' 
   President Reagan was right. This tax relief will do the same. 
   Now, Mr. President, we have done our job, and it is up to President Clinton to decide if he wants to give back the tax overpayments to American families or spend them to expand the government. 
   In Buffalo, NY, earlier this year, the President said: If we give the money back to the American people, what if they don't spend it right? In other words, the President looked down his nose at working Americans and said they are too dumb to spend their money right. They are smart enough to earn it, not smart enough to spend it. I hope the President will trust the American people and make the right decision.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation I've drafted to provide a prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries. 
   While I firmly believe we must deal directly with the structural problems facing the Medicare program, I also understand the very real need to provide prescription drug coverage now. 
   Mr. President, Americans might be surprised to learn there are estimates that about half the people who have ever--ever--reached age 65 are alive today. It's a revealing statistic--one we should be proud of because America has had much to do with the success in lengthening the life expectancy of nearly everyone in the world. Whether it's through government-funded research at the National Institutes of Health or private research funded through foundations, it has all contributed to this success. 
   In 1900, the average American could expect to see their 47th birthday. Today, Americans can expect to celebrate 29 more birthdays--living to the age of 76. Clearly, this increased life expectancy can be attributed to many things, but the advances made in pharmaceuticals is, perhaps, the most significant contributor. 
   When the Medicare program was being discussed by Congress in the 1960s, no one could foresee the enormous change our health care system would experience over the course of thirty years. Of course, we couldn't have expected them to know how different things would be today. 
   In the 1960s, health care was predominately hospital or clinic oriented and as a result, Medicare focused on hospital stays. Indeed, even months before the final Medicare package was passed there was debate over whether physician visits should be included in the program. Now, we find ourselves with a program going broke, but in need of reform--a program largely successful for the past 30 years, but woefully inadequate in meeting the needs of today's seniors. 
   Mr. President, one of the first witnesses before the Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, Robert Reischauer, described Medicare's problems as the four ``i's:'' insolvency, inadequacy, inefficiency and inequity. I couldn't agree more. 
   As I alluded to earlier, perhaps the best example of the inadequacy of the current Medicare program is the lack of a prescription drug benefit. While I continue to believe the best way for us to include a prescription drug benefit in Medicare is through overall reform, I also believe it is important for us to explore different ways we can meet the challenge of adding the benefit without undermining the entire program. 
   In putting together my plan for providing a prescription benefit, I tried to keep in mind the root of our dilemma. Many make the mistake of thinking access to needed pharmaceuticals is the problem. It's not--affording the increasing number and cost of prescriptions is the real problem facing seniors today. 
   Mr. President, my plan, the ``MEDS Act of 1999,'' would work like this: 
   Single seniors with incomes of $927 per month or less, will be eligible to receive their prescription drugs with a 25 percent co-payment and no deductible. Married seniors with incomes of $1,244 per month or less will be eligible for the same co-payment of 25 percent with no deductible. 
   The income figures are the equivalent of 135 percent of the federal poverty level. 
   Seniors above the income limits will be protected through a monthly deductible of $150. 
   For amounts over those deductibles, Medicare will pay 75 percent of the prescription cost. 
   Mr. President, rather than using a yearly deductible, which, in the first months, forces many seniors to use more of their monthly income on prescription drugs than they can often afford, my plan uses a monthly deductible allowing seniors to budget their drug costs every month. 
   In addition, it ensures that if a senior, such a your parent or grandparent, is seriously ill in one month, Medicare will cover 75 percent of their drug costs with no caps on the benefit. Meaning, they get the help they need when they need it. 
   While I understand there will be concerns about how we determine when a beneficiary has reached their $150 deductible, particularly on a monthly basis, I contend that we have the knowledge and technology necessary to structure the program nearly any way we wish--we simply have to use it. 
   Mr. President, America's seniors understand that if their drug costs are $50 a month, it doesn't make sense for them to buy a drug insurance policy for $100 a month. In this case, prescription drug coverage is not the issue. The issue is, can the senior trying to get by an $600 a month afford the $50 or $75 a month to pay for their medications? And, in the event of a major illness, can a senior bear the entire cost of treatment during that particular month? 
   My plan would make sure that person gets relief when the costs become too much to handle. It is truly a safety net for seniors and especially for those who would not otherwise be able to reap the benefits of modern medicine. 
   I believe this is a responsible, credible plan for America's seniors. I hope it will serve as a starting point for an honest, rational and responsible discussion about who needs help and how much. 
   While I applaud the President for putting forward a plan, I believe it falls short in one important way--it doesn't help those who need it most. 
   President Clinton's plan requires all seniors to pay $288 in monthly premiums and a co-payment of 50 percent up to $2,000. Under the President's plan, the most benefit any senior could get is $712 and, by capping the benefit at $2,000, it abandons seniors when they need help most. 
   The debate over prescription drug coverage and overall Medicare reform may be political for some, but I know seniors in Minnesota who have difficulty paying for their prescriptions don't think much of political games played by politicians in Washington. They won't care who takes credit for this or that. They just want to know they won't go broke or hungry to pay for the medicines they need to stay alive. The plan I introduce today, the Medicare Ensuring Prescription Drugs for Seniors (MEDS) Act, will help ensure that they won't.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the cloture motion on the  motion to recommit the appropriations bill to committee with instructions to include the Jeffords/Leahy amendment. 
   First, I would like to express my displeasure with this attempt to dodge the clear purpose of Rule 16. 
   I am at a loss to understand how we can reinstate Rule 16 one week then turn around and justify offering what is an extremely controversial policy change that is clearly non-germane on a major appropriations bill. Drafted to circumvent Rule 16 restrictions, Mr. JEFFORDS' proposed changes to the farm bill almost guarantee litigation and confusion in the milk marketing system due to the uncertainty over its effect. It is a controversial, non-germane issue that does not belong on an appropriations bill as a floor amendment. 
   It is important that I remind some of my colleagues that this amendment does not extend authorization of the compact to your states. Also, this August 2nd letter from Charles Rawls, General Counsel for USDA, states that funds have already been spent to implement the milk marketing order reform and the reform could still operate without oversight from USDA. The order reform is administered by producer assessments so no other federal funds are required to implement it. Thus, though the Jeffords Amendment intends to maintain the status quo in milk marketing orders by not funding implementation, counsel for USDA states that the specific implementation date requirement contained in Public Law 105-277 remains unaltered. Any uncertainty in the effect of this amendment is between whether the reform can be implemented without USDA oversight or whether we will have no dairy marketing orders at all. Reinstating the current system similar to 1A is simply not an option here. 
   Mr. President, as the letter from Mr. Rawls shows, it's not clear this amendment would save the Northeast Compact, and it certainly does not solve any problems for the other states seeking to form compacts. Not only does the amendment fail to extend compacts to other areas of the country outside the Northeast, it also does not implement Option 1-A. 
   Despite the fact that I do not believe Mr. JEFFORDS' amendment accomplishes its intended goal I also urge you to vote against cloture on the simple grounds of rejecting the concept of providing a benefit to producers in one area of the country which gives them a competitive advantage over dairy farmers in other regions of the United States. 
   Dairy farmers are suffering all over the country. Why support this compact legislation that helps mainly one area of the country at the expense of others? Why support an effort that would send the signal that we can consider endless controversial non-germane issues on appropriations bills in the future? Why risk passage of needed relief to America's farmers? 
   Besides addressing the narrow issue of the pending amendment, I would like to remind you why compacts that penalize consumers, particularly low-income consumers, milk processors, and regional dairy producers are so dangerous, and urge my colleagues to reject this blatantly unfair barrier that penalizes some of the best and 
   most efficient dairy farmers in America. 
   First, I would like to explain what dairy compacts are. The Northeast Dairy Compact raises the price of Class I fluid milk above the prevailing federal milk marketing order price within the participating states, and, I might add, above what the market would pay. Milk processors have to pay the higher price for the raw milk they process, and this higher price is passed along to the consumer at the grocery store. With higher prices, consumption goes down, and children are the biggest losers. I don't argue against a fair price--or honest price for any dairy farmer in Minnesota or Vermont, but I cannot support price fixing that distorts the free market. 
   The Northeast Compact was authorized in 1996 during consideration of the larger Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act. This controversial issue was inserted in the conference committee, avoiding a separate vote, after the measure had been overwhelmingly defeated on the floor. While most of the FAIR Act was designed to help farmers compete in world markets and reduce government involvement in agriculture, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact established a regional price-fixing cartel within our very own country that promotes higher production which depresses prices outside the compact. The Northeast Dairy Compact has harmed dairy farmers in Minnesota, and this kind of unfair subsidy should be terminated. 
   When this issue came to the fore, compacts were roundly condemned in the major newspapers of the compact region. The New York Times, Boston Herald, the Connecticut Post, and the Hartford Courant all weighed in against the cartel, in addition to national publications such as USA Today and the Washington Post. 
   Again, compacts were hardly consensus legislation to begin with. The House refused to put the provision in its broader farm bill. And I must reiterate, the Senate voted on the floor to strip the Compact language from its bill. Despite these defeats, the compact provision was slipped into the bill in conference and signed by the President. The compact legislation could not withstand the scrutiny of a fair debate on the floor, and had to be muscled in at the last minute in conference. 
   Knowing that this scheme was a bad idea from the start, Congress limited the life of the compact. That's why proponents will seek an extension by amendment today. 
   Retail prices of milk jumped immediately after the higher Compact price was implemented. As predicted, the milk produced in New England increased by four times the national rate of increase in a six-month period following compact implementation. The surplus milk was converted into milk powder, leading to a 60% increase in milk powder production. 
   Soon after implementation, the Northeast Compact had to begin reimbursing school food service programs for the increases in cost caused by the milk price hikes; an admission that prices have gone up and consumers are being affected. However, low-income families that need milk in their diet are not being reimbursed by the Compact for their increased costs. Milk is a food staple, and are we going to vote today to extend this milk tax that hits low-income citizens hardest who spend a high percentage of their 
   income on food? What's next, a special tax on bread, eggs, ground beef, or potatoes? Consider the low-income families with small children and the elderly on fixed incomes in your state and ask if this is the population you want bearing the brunt of this regressive milk tax. 
   I cannot stress to my colleagues enough that you simply cannot contain the market distortions and economic hardship that these compact schemes cause. Proponents present an idyllic picture of the compacts as only a few cents hike in the price of milk to preserve the small, rural dairy farmer. This is simply not true. Dairy compacts are an economic zero-sum game in which there are many losers--most importantly the consumer (especially the low-income consumer) and dairy farmers in non-compact regions. The real winners in this zero-sum game are large dairy producers in the Northeast that receive literally tens of thousands of dollars in subsidies for their already profitable businesses, not the small dairy farmer who supporters said was the focus of this idea. The average six month subsidy for large Northeast dairy farms is projected to be $78,400. Dairy farmers in Minnesota would relish that income over the whole year, but Minnesota farmers wisely reject this effort to distort the system and harm their fellow farmers in other states. 
   It also is erroneous to characterize this issue as small family farms in one region falling victim to large, corporate-style farming conglomerates in another. There are no, if you will, ``Wal-Marts'' of dairy farming in Minnesota. In our state, we have families that farm as a way of life, know that they must stay efficient to remain competitive, and want desperately to compete on a level playing field. Minnesota has thousands of family farms--passed from generation to generation --that are struggling to stay afloat in a rigged market that unfairly favors producers in a different part of the country. And many have failed. Compacts are not a policy that saves family farms. 
   As Wayne Bok, President of the Minnesota-based co-op Associated Milk  Producers has put it, consider what would happen if the Northern states decided they wanted to produce oranges, and formed a compact to do so. Oranges sold in the North would receive a higher price than oranges sold in other regions. As a result, production of oranges would increase in the North. Prices in the South would drop until production decreased to compensate for the increase in Northern production. Moreover, Northern farmers would begin to convert from, say, corn and dairy farming, to the now more profitable farming of oranges. 
   Would this be good for the country's most efficient orange growers in Florida and California? Absolutely not. 
   Would this be good for consumers? 
   Absolutely not. 
   This outrageous scenario demonstrates the ridiculousness of current dairy policy. Let each farm region of the country do what it does best and don't erect artificial barriers that keep the products of the most efficient producers out of the hands of the consumers. 
   In 1996 Congress and the President committed to a new farm policy, moving our country away from artificial price and supply 
   controls, and freeing farmers to compete on the world market. American farmers are the most skilled and efficient in the world, and they deserve the opportunity to compete and expand their markets. At the same time that we are calling upon our global trading partners to bring down their trade barriers for the benefit of both consumers and producers, we attempt to continue or construct new barriers between regions in our own country that discourage the free flow of commerce and create significant market distortions and price increases. Its hypocritical for us to demand free trade at a global level but enact trade barriers within our own country. 
   I urge my colleagues today to commit to fairness in dairy policy. Please be fair to consumers and dairy producers--vote against this or any other compact amendment. 
   I must also address the other intended effect of the dairy amendment, the proposal to zero out funding for implementation of the final rule presumably to maintain the status quo in federal milk marketing orders and to extend the Northeast Dairy Compact. I believe that Mr. JEFFORDS' amendment fails to accomplish this intent. 
   The current milk marketing system requires processors to pay higher minimum prices for fluid milk the further the region is located from Eau Claire, Wisconsin. To reform this antiquated, Depression-era method for supplying milk to consumers, which basically picks winners and losers in the dairy industry, Congress, through the 1996 FAIR Act, required USDA to significantly reduce the number of milk marketing orders (regions) in the country and transition to a more market-oriented system of milk distribution. After many months of study and having received comments from hundreds of market participants, USDA proposed Options 1-A and 1-B. The Option 1-A proposal made minimal changes to the old marketing order pricing system, while Option 1-B contained some basic free market reforms and modernizations of the system. The Midwest did not like what we saw in 1B, actually, and like the compromise even less, but it was a small step in the right direction. 
   The compromise came after the USDA received testimony concerning the two alternatives, and its final rule again takes steps toward simplifying and modernizing the milk marketing order system. The new compromise orders will be effective October 1, 1999. I hoped for a proposal closer to 1-B, but accepted the need for compromise and have supported it. 
   Option 1-A is basically no reform, and would ignore the direction of Congress in the FAIR Act. It would increase prices for consumers by $74 million per year, affecting most the low-income consumer that spends a high percentage of their wages on food. Option 1-A also keeps in place a regionally discriminatory milk pricing system that benefits producers in some parts of the country at the expense of dairy farmers in other regions, much like compacts. Again, it's a government program that picks winners and losers, not allowing the market to set the prices. It is opposed by free market taxpayer advocacy groups, consumer groups, regional producer groups, and processor groups, and it does nothing to protect the nation's supply of fresh fluid milk; our nation produces an abundance of milk that is sufficient to supply 
   consumers' needs. 
   Secretary Glickman, writing about the final rule, said that:  
   USDA's own analysis shows that nationally, dairy farmers will realize virtually the same cash receipts under the new, fairer plan as they do now, and when aggregated, the all-milk price will remain essentially unchanged from that under the existing program, which virtually all sides agree sorely needs changing[.]  
   Moreover, Chairman LUGAR said that the final compromise rule ``is a good first step toward a policy that places the nation's dairy industry in a position to better meet the challenges of the global markets of the new century[.]'' 
   Again, the final rule is a compromise, not the best for either 1A or 1B advocates but a middle ground. We should not rush to reverse a process that took months to complete in order to keep the status quo. 
   What we have here is a double whammy. Compacts are bad enough, but retaining the failed dairy policies of the past is just incomprehensible. 
   Finally, what we need to ask ourselves even more is why are we considering these controversial issues on this appropriations bill. The Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over compacts and Agriculture over milk marketing orders. Please respect these committees' opposition to these amendments which circumvent their jurisdiction, respect the reimplementation of Rule 16, and vote against this attempt to legislate through the appropriations process. And most of all, reject an amendment that doesn't even accomplish its intended purpose.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I will talk a little bit about the numbers the Senator from Vermont was using. He said that somehow right now Minnesota and Wisconsin dairy farmers are making more money than the other farmers around the country. That is simply not true. By $2, $3, $4 per hundredweight, the rest of the country is getting more money today than what Minnesota and Wisconsin dairy farmers are allowed to receive for their milk. 
   And that is why I say under this old, arcane program, if we were going to go start a new dairy program today, it would never look anything like this. But when they say we are getting more money, that is not true. They are way up in prices, $17, $18, $19 a hundredweight for milk, and we are at $10, $11, $12, $13. If ours comes up 20 cents a hundredweight under this arrangement and theirs stays about the same, we are not even close to them yet. 
   So this is a very small move in the right direction for reforms. But it by no means is putting Minnesota or Wisconsin ahead of anybody in the country. I still think it is unfair for all the other States under this old program to stand and discriminate against dairy farmers in Minnesota and Wisconsin. We want fairness in this program--nothing more, nothing less.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today the Senate passed the Cochran amendment to the agriculture appropriations bill that provides emergency relief to the nation's rural communities. I voted for the Cochran plan and the assistance it will bring to suffering Minnesota farm families. 
   Earlier in the discussion of agriculture relief, I participated in efforts to find a compromise that could provide more relief than the Cochran proposal. Specifically, I believe Minnesota farmers would have been better served by the Grassley-Conrad amendment, which failed by a close margin. The Grassley-Conrad package provided some additional elements, such as flood and crop loss payments, as well as increased aid for dairy producers. It was an $8.8 billion proposal that would have been particularly beneficial to our state's farmers. 
   The Cochran bill preserves the use of increased Agricultural Market Transition Act (AMTA) payments for income assistance to farmers, which is good for Minnesota producers. The Daschle-Harkin alternative package, while providing a higher amount of relief, tied income assistance to production levels. I am concerned that their proposal would have shortchanged some farmers, like wheat farmers in Northwestern Minnesota, who were unable to plant a crop this year due to severe weather. In one Northwestern county, only 10 percent of the normal acreage was planted. The Cochran proposal also provides needed relief to oilseed, livestock, dairy, and sugar producers. It also reduces the cost of crop insurance and increases the LDP payment limit to $150,000. And it exempts food and medicine sales from unilateral sanctions which will help Minnesota farmers sell to Cuba and other countries. 
   I am also pleased that the Senate resisted the attempt to extend the life of the Northeast Compact and prevent enactment of the federal milk marketing order reforms during consideration of the emergency farm relief package. Considering the hardships that the rural areas are suffering, now is certainly not the time to be taking up controversial proposals which discriminate against Midwest dairy farmers. Dairy farmers in the Midwest are struggling to make a decent living for their families, and they should not have to shoulder the additional burden of dairy policies that prevent them from receiving a fair price. I urge the conferees on the agriculture appropriations bill to likewise reject extension of the dairy compacts, and restore market fairness for America's dairy producers. 
   There is a great deal of apprehension in the rural community over the future of farming, and I am certainly glad that we passed essential relief for farmers now, instead of waiting until after the August recess. I remain committed to Freedom to Farm and the opportunity that it promises. However, Freedom to Farm can only help our farmers if the political courage can be mustered to enact reforms in the areas of taxation, sanctions and regulations, and if we can continue to expand our markets. In the short-term the nation's farmers need assistance to tide them over in these difficult times, and I'm pleased that the Senate took the necessary steps to get aid to them quickly.

   Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, I rise in strong support for the Ashcroft food and medicine sanctions reform amendment. While I would prefer this amendment addressed all unilateral sanctions, not just food and medicine, I support the amendment as a good start to reforming our sanctions policy. As a cosponsor of the Lugar Sanctions Reform Act, I believe it is long overdue that the administration and the Congress think before we sanction. 
   It makes no sense to punish the people of a country with which we have a dispute. Denying food and medicine does nothing to penalize the leaders of any country. Government leaders can always obtain adequate food and medicine, but people suffer under these sanctions, whether they are multilateral or unilateral. Those two areas should never be a part of any sanction. 
   At the same time our farmers suffer from the lingering effects of the Asian financial crisis as well as those in other areas of the world, we either have, or are debating, sanctions that further restrict markets for our farmers and medical supply companies. And denys that food and medical supplies to some of the worlds most needy. 
   Since most of our sanctions are unilateral, it makes no sense to deny our farmers and workers important markets when those sales are being made by our allies. 
   I need not remind any of you that we are still experiencing the aftermath of the Soviet grain embargo of the late 1970's when the United States earned a reputation as an unreliable supplier. 
   Another example of how we have harmed our farmers is the Cuban embargo. For 40 years this policy was aimed at removing Fidel Castro--yet he is still there. This is a huge market for midwestern farmers, yet it is shut off to us. Because Cuba has fiscal problems, many of its people are experiencing hardship. Those who have relationships with Cuban-Americans receive financial support, but those who don't need access to scarce food and medical supplies. This bill does not aid the government, as U.S. guarantees can only be provided through NGO's and the private sector not armies, not  to terrorists. Currently, donations are permitted, as well as sales of medicine, but they are very bureaucratically difficult to obtain, and they don't help everyone. Our farmers are in a good position to help and they should be allowed to do so. 
   I applaud Senators ASCHROFT and HAGEL for their work to ensure farmers and medical companies will not be held hostage to those who believe sanctions can make a difference. Any administration would have to get congressional approval for any food and medicine sanction. This is our best opportunity to help farmers and provide much-needed food supplies to the overage people in these countries, and to show the world we are reliable suppliers. I urge the support of my colleagues for this long overdue amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to support the tax relief plan offered by Senator PHIL GRAMM. But I also want to talk a little bit about what we heard from our Democratic friends and colleagues on the other side. 
   Make no mistake about it, the surplus dollars out there are going to be spent. The question is, Who is going to spend it? Are we going to allow it to be returned to the hard-working families and Americans and allow them to spend it, or are we going to let Washington spend it? To some, it seems that if the taxpayers spend it, it will jeopardize the economy, but if we trust the President and trust Washington, the money will be spent correctly. 
   Also, I heard them talk about 1993 and what a great turnaround in fiscal policy for this country it was, and that it was due to their efforts that turned this economy around. The CBO finds the increased revenues were propelled by personal income tax increases, and it cites four reasons for this unexpected revenue: First, the rapid growth of taxable income, which raised the tax base for personal income receipts; second, adjusted gross income, which has grown even more rapidly than taxable personal income, mainly through the realization of capital gains--the capital gains tax increased by 150 percent between 1993 and 1997, which is a third of the growth of the tax liability relative to the GDP--third, raising taxes paid on pensions and IRA retirement income; fourth, and most important, is the increase in the effective tax rate. That is people making a little more money, inflation pushing them into the higher brackets, and now not paying 15 percent but 28, 31 percent or higher. 
   By the way, this is also what CBO said. It points out that the revenue windfall did not result from legislative policy changes, which my Democratic friends have claimed. In other words, the CBO says the legislative initiatives taken by the President and the Democrats did not generate this surplus; what generated this surplus was the investment in the economy by businesses, through the Reagan era of tax relief bills, and also by the high productivity, work, and effort of the American people. It wasn't by what Washington did; it was in spite of what Washington did that led to this. 
   So, clearly, all four reasons that we have a surplus are the result of the productivity of working men and women and businesses in this country. 
   Before I run out of time, I want to show you this chart. This depicts what is going to happen to the surplus. This is excess money that taxpayers have sent to Washington. Here is what I have often said. Here we have the man saying, ``I found someone's wallet, and I want to do the right thing, so I plan to spend the money carefully.'' 
   That is what our Democratic colleagues and the President want to do. When they find the money on the street, instead of giving it back to the people it belongs to, they are going to spend it carefully for you. 
   Again, this debate is not over anything except who is going to spend the money. As the Senator from North Dakota said, it is a clear, bright line. The line is: Do we want Washington to spend your surplus tax money, or do we want to return it to you and allow you to spend it on your priorities? 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as we consider the $792 billion of overpaid taxes we seek to refund in the Taxpayer Refund Act, millions of Americans are deeply concerned about President Clinton's veto threat. We just heard the statement about we cannot have a ``reckless'' tax cut, but they want to give back this money to our children and grandchildren and to the American people. 
   The truth is, our bill is the bill that wants to return this surplus to the taxpayers of the country; the President's bill wants to spend it. It is very different. Somehow, if we give it back in tax relief, it is reckless because the American people somehow do not know how to spend it, but let us keep it in Washington and let Washington spend it and it is fine. I do not understand that logic. 
   The President has also threatened to veto a proposal from his own party to provide just $500 billion in tax relief--again, more evidence that they want to spend the money, not give it back, not save it for our children, but spend it on new Washington programs. 
   The President is hinting at supporting tax relief somewhere in the $250 billion range, but his own budget included only one tax cut, and that could only be used for savings, not to let families decide how to spend their own money, but for Washington, the President, to tell you what you are going to do if he decides to give any of your surplus back. 
   I take this opportunity to make a few points about why the taxpayers have every right to expect this Congress and the President to return at least $792 billion of overpaid taxes. 
   First, let me emphasize that this bill is a 10-year $792 billion tax cut plan that benefits all Americans, with a focus on providing major tax relief for middle-class families. It is not a tax cut for the rich. It is not an unrealistic level of relief. It significantly reduces taxes for millions of American families and individuals, and it is the biggest tax relief we have ever had since President Ronald Reagan cut taxes dramatically in the early 1980s. I again commend Chairman ROTH for his leadership and his commitment to providing major tax relief. 
   We promised to return to American families the non-Social Security tax overcharges they paid to the Government, and we have fulfilled that solemn promise. The proposed tax relief will immediately ease working Americans' tax burden and allow them to keep a little more of their own money and use it on their family priorities--not Washington's, not President Clinton's, but their families' priorities. 
   This taxpayer relief refund legislation gives middle-class working families at least $450 a year in relief from the tax squeeze. It corrects the injustice of the marriage penalty tax by allowing married couples to file joint returns as if they were single payers of taxes, so 22 million Americans will no longer be penalized simply for the fact they are married. 
   This legislation also eliminates the alternative minimum tax to permit millions of American families, including farmers, to enjoy the full benefit of tax exemptions and credits such as the $500-per-child tax credit which I championed and the Senate passed back in 1997. 
   The proposed tax relief includes a reduction in the death tax which will help farmers and small businesses across the country pass on their hard-earned legacies to their children, not to pass it on to the Government but to pass it on to their children and their heirs. 
   The bill makes health care more affordable for millions of self-employed and uninsured by making their health care costs 100-percent deductible, and it includes my legislation to permit workers without coverage to deduct  their health insurance costs and also allows those purchasing long-term care policies to deduct them as well. These measures will allow more people to obtain health care coverage or improve the coverage they already have. 
   The bill before us also encourages working Americans to save more for their future by expanding IRAs and providing education tax benefits for parents, for students, and for workers. 
   There is other tax relief for hard-working Americans as 
   well. While there is still room to improve the legislation, such as to expand the broad-based tax relief and to provide immediate relief of the marriage penalty, this $800 billion package is a clear victory for working Americans. 
   One of the most important points I have made repeatedly in this Chamber is that the non-Social Security surplus is the working people's money, not Washington's, and the people deserve the refund. 
   America's strong economy has turned the ink in Washington's accounting book black for the first time in 40 years. The budget surplus above and beyond Social Security will top $1 trillion to $1.4 trillion over the next 10 years. The CBO finds the increased revenue is propelled by personal income tax increases, and the CBO cites four sources for this unexpected revenue: 
   First, the rapid growth of taxable income, which has raised the tax base for personal income tax receipts. 
   Second, the CBO says adjusted gross income, which has grown even more rapidly than taxable personal income, mainly through the realization of capital gains. The capital gains tax increased by 150 percent between 1993 and 1997, which is a third of the growth of tax liability relative to GDP. 
   Third, rising taxes paid on pension and IRA retirement income. 
   Fourth, and I think the most important, is the increase in the effective tax rate. As Americans are working harder, as they earn more money, as inflation is there, it pushes more and more of them into the higher tax brackets. The tax rate increase accounts for 40 percent of the tax growth in excess of GDP growth. That is an unfair tax. It has pushed people from one tax bracket into another. 
   By the way, the CBO also points out the revenue windfall did not result from legislative policy changes. In other words, according to the CBO, the legislative initiatives taken by the President and by Congress did not generate this surplus. 
   Clearly, all four reasons we have a surplus are the result of the productivity of working men and women of this country, and it has little or nothing to do with Washington. So why should the President, why should Congress, be at the front of the line to spend this surplus, and why are we hearing claims that the $792 billion of tax relief will--and these are the scare tactics, we hear them time after time and they are ridiculous, but they say that tax relief will somehow harm Social Security, it will harm Medicare, and similarly impact Federal spending. 
   Again, my point is, these are overpaid taxes from American workers and they have every right to get it all back. To say we cannot provide this level of relief without hurting Americans is totally inaccurate. 
   We must recall that Americans have long been overtaxed and millions of middle-class families cannot even make ends meet due to the growing tax burden. Our savings rate in this country this year is a negative because families do not have any money left, especially after paying taxes, to put away. They are desperately in need of this largest possible tax relief. 
   Americans today, for example, are paying in my State of Minnesota 42 percent of their hard-earned money on taxes to support Government. 
   It is hard enough to raise one family without having to raise your Uncle Sam at the same time. According to the Government's own data, the average household today pays about $10,000 in Federal income taxes alone. That is twice as much as they paid in Federal taxes in 1985. The total Federal tax will consume 21 percent of the national income. Americans have not paid this much in taxes since World War II. 
   They say: Oh, Americans aren't overtaxed. But since President Clinton was elected in 1993, the amount that Federal tax consumes of the gross domestic product has gone from 18 percent to 21 percent. So the Government is taking more of what this country produces, and it comes out of the pockets of average working Americans. 
   In the past few years, Washington's income, in fact, has grown faster than our economy and twice as fast as the income of working Americans. Washington is growing twice as fast as what you are getting in your paychecks. With more middle-income workers being thrown into higher tax brackets, the ``middle class tax squeeze'' has been devastating. 
   Millions of middle-income Americans, who have worked hard to get ahead, have been pushed from the 15-percent tax bracket up into the 28-percent tax bracket. Hundreds of thousands of others have been pushed from the 28-percent tax bracket into the 31-percent bracket, and so on. More people working explains the surge of the Social Security surplus because payroll taxes are levied against everyone. So part-time, low-income, minimum-wage earners cannot escape the cruel tax bites. 
   According to the census report, the income of the average American family has grown--get this--the average income of the American family has grown only 6.3 percent, in constant dollars, between 1969 to 1996--6.3 percent, while Federal tax revenues have increased by nearly 800 percent during the same time. Yet I hear my colleagues on the other side of the aisle say Americans aren't overtaxed; somehow, they are doing fine. 
   As a result, Americans today are working harder and they are working longer, but they are taking home less money because the Federal Government is taking home more. A larger share of the earned income of working Americans is siphoned off here to Washington, and it isn't available for families to spend on their priorities. 
   A recent Census Bureau report finds that 49 million hard-working Americans, including 8 million middle-class Americans, live in a household that has trouble paying for just their basic needs. 
   President Clinton himself at one time--this was down in Texas during a campaign swing in 1995--admitted to a group of contributors, by the way, that Americans were taxed too much. He said: I might have raised taxes too much in 1993. He said: You might think I did. Well, I think I raised them too much, too. 
   But today he still refuses to refund overpaid taxes to Americans, because he does not think working Americans are ``going to spend it right.'' President Clinton believes individuals are not capable of making decisions for themselves and bigger Government is the only solution. Instead, he spends the surplus for Government programs, and he calls meaningful tax relief ``fiscally irresponsible.'' His priority is not to give tax relief at all. It is ``irresponsible'' to ease Americans' tax burdens a little so they can afford basic necessities. 
   That is the question. Is it irresponsible to even have a 
   family night out once in a while? The family has been, and will continue to be, the bedrock of American society. Strong families make strong communities; strong communities make a very strong America. But 22 million working American couples have been forced to pay $1,400 a year more, on average, in taxes every year simply for choosing to be married. Is it irresponsible to get rid of an unfair tax policy that discourages marriage?

   Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator very much. 
   So the question I was asking is, Is it irresponsible to get rid of an unfair tax policy that discourages marriage? The President at one time a couple years ago said, yes, this is an unfair tax, but, basically, Washington needs it more than the couple does in order to raise a family. 
   I have heard many who oppose $792 billion in tax relief support the individual relief included in this package. Just which specific section of the ROTH bill would they throw out? What part  of tax relief do they object to most? I would like to know which part they would like to get rid of to get down to what they are proposing in tax relief. 
   Let me further address the issue of so-called ``fiscally irresponsible'' tax cuts that we hear of so often. ``Fiscally irresponsible,'' that means, do not give it back to the people who own it, earn it, and should have it, but give it to Washington. That is ``responsible,'' I guess. 
   But in a recent analysis of President Clinton's midsession proposal, the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office found that our budget plan saves all of the $2 trillion Social Security surplus while the President's revised plan still spends $30 billion of the Social Security surplus. He cannot get by with just spending surplus; he is going to raise taxes by $98 billion, and he is also going to dip into the Social Security trust fund again. 
   His original plan spent over $150 billion of the Social Security surplus. Yet we still hear claims that our tax relief is at the expense of seniors. It is the President who is spending the money, raising taxes, and dipping into the Social Security trust fund. Yet we are irresponsible because we want to return to the American people the overcharge in taxes? 
   The CBO estimates that our plan reduces more debt held by the public than the President's plan. That is another thing. We do reduce the debt even more than the President's plan. Ours also produces an additional non-Social Security surplus of nearly $300 billion over the next decade while the President's plan, again, spends almost all of the on-budget surplus. Do you spend it or do you give it back in tax relief? That is the question. Whose money is it? 
   The CBO also says the President's midsession proposal has no net tax cut but, instead, increases taxes by $95 billion. Again, the surplus isn't enough. He wants to raise taxes another $95 billion. The President commits over $1 trillion in new and additional spending over the next decade by expanding Government programs or creating new programs. 
   Just quickly, I will show this chart. This is what we are talking about as to what the President plans to do. 
   We all agree on saving Social Security, putting every dime from the Social Security surplus into the trust fund, into our lockbox, and not spending that. This is our projected $3,371 billion expected surplus. But the President wants to spend all that is remaining and raise taxes by $95 billion more in order to do that. 
   So contrary to Mr. Clinton's plan, our budget provides $792 billion in tax relief to working Americans. Meanwhile, we save every penny of the Social Security surplus exclusively for Americans' retirement. In addition, we set aside over $505 billion for Medicare and to address spending needs. 
   Out of this whole projected surplus, we plan on saving for Social Security, for Medicare, for education, other needs, 75 cents on every dollar of this expected surplus. Only 25 cents on the dollar, one-quarter, would go to tax relief. Somehow, they want to spend the whole dollar. 
   Our tax relief takes only a small portion of the total budget surplus. In fact, only 23 cents of every dollar of the budget surplus goes for tax relief. 
   There is enough to provide this 23 cent of every surplus dollar for tax relief, to protect Social Security and to reform Medicare, including prescription drug coverage from needy seniors. But what I want to stress today is how we spend this $505 billion is not the question before today. It will come at the end of the year when we look at Medicare reform and the final appropriations bills. Today the issue is, can we provide $792 billion in tax relief, and I think we have proved we can with these charts, and the expert advice us received through the budget process. 
   In fact, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out who is fiscally responsible and who's fiscally irresponsbile. 
   Contrary to Mr. Clinton's rhetoric that tax relief will cause recession, cutting taxes will keep our economy strong, will create jobs, increase savings and productivity, forestall a recession and produce more tax revenues. 
   History has proved that tax cuts work: 
   In the 1960s, President Kennedy proposed and later President Johnson enacted an individual income tax reduction of an average of 20 percent and reduced the top income tax rate from 91 percent to 70 percent. This tax relief preceded one of the longest economic expansions in U.S. history. 
   In the 1980s, Ronald Reagan inherited an economy that was deep in recession. Unemployment and inflation sank to double digits and interest rates hit over 20 percent. Reagan implemented an economic plan that dramatically cut taxes, reduced regulations, and got the economy moving again. 
   What resulted was nothing short of an economic miracle. Our nation experienced the longest peacetime economic expansion in American history. Over 8 years, 20 million new jobs were created, unemployment sank to record lows, all Americans did better, and in spite of lower rates, tax revenues increased. 
   In the 1990s, many States cut taxes and turned their budget deficits into budget surpluses. 
   Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating enacted the largest broad-based tax cut in the state's history; Michigan Governor John Engler enacted 24 tax cuts, reducing state personal income taxes to the lowest level in a generation; New Jersey Governor Whittman cut taxes 17 times, reducing state income taxes by 30 percent. In my own state of Minnesota, Governor Carlson cut taxes and generated a record budget surplus. And Governor Ventura returned the surplus to Minnesotans in the form of sales tax rebate and across-the-board income tax cuts. 
   None of these states broke their budgets; instead they produced a robust economy and generated big budget surpluses which allowed them to provide even more tax cuts. 
   Our neighbor north of the border, in the Province of Ontario, chose to follow New Jersey and cut their income tax by 30 percent in 1995 instead of increasing spending. It generates a very successful economy. This year, Ontario Premier Mike Harris will cut the income tax by another 20 percent. Here is what he says; ``the debate is over; tax cuts create jobs.'' 
   Finally, I would like to take a moment to talk again about Social Security, Medicare, and debt reduction. 
   Republicans are pleased that President Clinton agrees with us that shoring up Social Security and Medicare should be our nation's top priority. But the difference is President Clinton talks about it; and Republicans act on it. 
   We are determined to achieve these goals. We have locked in every penny of the $1.9 trillion Social Security surplus over the next 10 years, not for government programs, not for tax cuts, but exclusively to protect all Americans' retirement. 
   We have been working hard to reform Medicare to ensure it will be there for seniors. Prescriptions drug coverage for the needy will be part of our commitment to seniors to protect their Medicare benefits. Had the White House and Democrats cooperated with us, we could have fixed Medicare by now. 
   In any event, we will continue our effort to preserve Medicare as Chairman ROTH reveals his Medicare bill in the near future. 
   We have reduced the national debt and will continue to dramatically reduce it. Debt held by the public will decrease to $0.9 trillion by 2009. The interest payment to service the debt will drop from $229 billion in 1999 to $71 billion in 2009. We will eliminate the entire debt held by the public by 2012. 
   As I indicated before, we have not ignored spending needs to focus on tax cuts as has been charged. We not only have funded all the functions of the government, but also significantly increased funding for our budget priorities, such as defense, education, Medicare, agriculture and others. 
   In fact, as I mentioned earlier, we set aside over $505 billion in non-Social Security surplus to meet these needs and the debate on how these funds is not before us today. But is there to highlight how Republicans can provide $792 billion in tax relief while not ignoring other important priorities. 
   This major tax relief does not come at the expense of seniors, farmers, women, children or any other deserving group. On the contrary, it benefits all Americans and keeps our economy strong. And most importantly, this tax relief will give every working American more freedom to decide what's best for themselves and their families.  
   Let me include my remarks by citing President Reagan who once said: ``Every major tax cut in this century has strengthened the economy, generated renewed productivity, and ended up yielding new revenues for the government by creating new investment, new jobs and more commerce among our people.'' 
   President Reagan was right. 
   I remember vividly that when I first proposed the $500 per child tax cut in 1993, the naysayers called it bad policy, even ``dangerous.'' Democrats accused us of cutting taxes for the rich. Sound familiar? Some in Congress contended it was too costly, and others argued that we should balance the budget first. I argued repeatedly that we could and should do both. And so we did. As a result, now we have a balanced budget, and the largest surplus in U.S. history. Cutting taxes, reducing the national debt, and reforming and protecting Social Security and Medicare at the same time are all possible. We can do it again. We must do it again. 
   I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment and support the $792 billion in tax relief in the Taxpayer Refund Act. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute today to Lt. David Stout of the Minnesota State Highway Patrol for being named the Patrol's 1999 Trooper of the Year. This is the second such honor for Lt. Stout, who was also given the award in 1977. He served in the State Patrol since 1969 and retired last month after 30 years of service. 
   Lt. Stout began his service in the Patrol in the East Metro Area of the Twin Cities and most recently has worked in the Duluth area. Among the highlights of his career, Lt. Stout was honored to lead Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's motorcade during his visit to Minnesota in 1990. 
   His family and friends know that David will enjoy his retirement with his 32-foot coastal tugboat, which he recently refurbished and now docks on Lake Superior. When winter makes Superior unnavigable, David and his wife Geri will spend time with family in Green Valley, Arizona. Among his friends and family who are proud of David's career are David's nephew Tim, a member of my staff. On behalf of all Minnesotans, I salute Lt. David Stout's service to the people of Minnesota.

   Mr. GRAMS. I congratulate the Senator from Georgia for putting together this special order on taxes. If we don't talk about it, if we don't act on it, as sure as day follows night, Washington will spend this surplus unless we do something. It is a very important issue, and I appreciate the opportunity to join in. 
   A few minutes ago the Senate cast another important vote in an attempt to lock away every penny of the Social Security surplus for Americans' retirement security. If enacted, this lockbox legislation would effectively end the practice of allowing the Government to spend Social Security money on other Washington ``wish list'' programs. 
   I take this opportunity also to commend Leader LOTT, Chairman DOMENICI, and Senators ABRAHAM and ASHCROFT for their leadership on this very important issue. I believe stopping the Government from raiding the Social Security trust fund is an essential first step to ensure Social Security will be there for current beneficiaries, the baby boomers, as well as their children and grandchildren. I am pleased this remains our No. 1 priority. 
   We will protect Social Security, preserve Medicare, and dramatically reduce the national debt, while providing major tax relief. Republicans are pleased that President Clinton agrees that shoring up Social Security and Medicare should be our Nation's top priority. But the difference is that President Clinton talks about it and Republicans are ready to act on it. 
   A good example is the President's commitment to work out a Social Security lockbox compromise when talking with the leadership this past Monday. Yet here we are again, another cloture vote, and no agreement. Where is the action to back up that type of commitment? 
   The Republicans are determined to achieve these goals. We have locked in every penny of the estimated $1.9 trillion Social Security surplus over the next 10 years--not for Government programs, not for tax relief, but exclusively to protect all Americans' retirement. 
   We have been working hard to reform Medicare to ensure it will be there for seniors. Prescription drug coverage for the needy will be part of our commitment to seniors, to protect their Medicare benefits. Had the White House and the Democrats cooperated, we could have fixed Medicare by now. 
   We have reduced the national debt and will continue to dramatically reduce it. Debt held by the public will decrease to $0.9 trillion by 2009. The interest payment to service the debt will drop from $229 billion in 1999 to $71 billion in 2009. We will eliminate the entire debt held by the public by 2012. 
   We have not ignored spending needs to focus on tax cuts as has been charged. We not only have funded all the functions of the government, but also significantly increased funding for our budget priorities, such as defense, education, Medicare, agriculture, and others. 
   Meanwhile, Republicans are committed to providing nearly $800 billion of the projected non-Social Security surplus--the tax overpayments of working Americans--for tax relief. 
   This is the largest tax relief since President Reagan and it does not come at the expense of seniors, farmers, women, children, or any other deserving group. 
   However, despite our healthy economy expanding our on-budget surplus, which, again, is not the Social Security surplus, President Clinton still denies meaningful tax relief for working Americans. He and his aides accuse our tax relief plan of being ``dangerous'' and ``risky,'' squandering your money by giving it back to you, worried that you won't spend it right. The administration believes you are smart enough to earn your money but you are not smart enough to know how to spend it--Washington is. 
   He believes public opinion polls show less interest in tax relief. No wonder! How many people do you know like paying taxes and actually expect a refund? Most people have given up any thought of tax relief--but they still constantly remind me how important it is when I travel around Minnesota. 
   To tell the public they don't deserve tax relief is just plain wrong. The Bureau of Census just released a report last week that finds 49 million hard-working Americans--nearly one person in every five--lived in a household that had trouble paying for their basic needs. 
   They are going further into debt each month trying to make ends meet. Credit cards are charged to the limit. They need tax relief. 
   What's even more shocking, Mr. President, is that not all of these 49 million are underprivileged people, over 8 million Americans are from middle-class families, families that earn more than $45,000 a year. 
   Let me repeat, Mr. President, a significant number, 8.1 million, to be exact, of middle-class and well-off families today have difficulties making their ends meet. They even have trouble paying rent, medical bills or other basic daily needs. A family night at the movies, a dinner out, braces, piano lessons are often out of reach to average income families. 
   Mr. President, this is not my data, nor is it data from think tanks. This is the data produced by the government of the United States. 
   Some experts attribute this financial hardship to lack of savings, which is true, but there is much more. 
   Our personal savings rate has dropped from 9.4 percent in 1981 to only six-tenths of a percent last year. This year the government reported that the rate actually dipped below zero for the first time since the Great Depression. 
   In fact, in the past 70 years, including the Great Depression, our savings rate has dropped as low as it is today  only twice before. The personal savings rate has remained low for more than a decade, and net personal savings other than pensions have virtually disappeared over the past ten years. 
   But why? My answer is that government tax bites have been getting bigger and more cruel. Americans have been struggling to pay basic bills. After paying Uncle Sam and paying for basic family needs, there is nothing left for working Americans to save, or for money even to provide for the basics. 
   Americans should be able to save for their future, but they also should be able to pay for what most of us here take for granted--the family's night out, the lessons, camps, etc.,--the things that improve our quality of life. Tax relief can improve the quality of life of middle-class American families. 
   Mr. President, I remind you the total tax burden on working Americans is at an all-time high. The government's own data shows that the average household pays $9,445 in federal income taxes alone--twice what it paid in 1985. 
   Federal taxes take a huge bite out of Americans' hard-earned paycheck and consumes about 21 percent of the national income, the highest proportion since World War II. And it's still growing. Total taxes from all levels of government--federal, state, and local taxes--stand at a record 32 percent of national income. 
   Mr. President, according to the Census report, the income of the average American family has grown only 6.3 percent in constant dollars between 1969 to 1996. However, federal tax revenue increased nearly 800 percent during the same period of time. 
   Studies show that if government spending in this country had remained at the 1960 level, the average income of an American family of four, even accounting for inflation, would be $23,000 higher today than it is. That could certainly improve the quality of life for those families. 
   The tax burden has become even more excessive since 1993. Over the course of President Clinton's administration, Washington's income has grown faster than our economy and twice as fast as the income of working Americans. In fact, federal taxes have grown by over 54 percent. That's nearly $4,000 a year more per person. 
   Because of the unfair tax system, millions of middle-income Americans who have worked hard to get ahead have been pushed from the 15-percent bracket into the 28-percent bracket. Hundreds of thousands of others have been pushed from the 28-percent bracket into the 31- and 36-percent brackets. No one can escape this growing tax burden, not even low-income and minimum wage workers. 
   Since payroll taxes are levied against everyone, as low-income and minimum wage workers work harder and earn more, their payroll taxes also increase, taking a huge bite out of their hard-earned dollars that are most needed to keep families above the poverty line. As a result, Americans today are working harder and longer but taking less home. A larger share of the earned income of working Americans is siphoned off to Washington, and isn't available to spend on family--not Washington--priorities. No wonder working Americans have trouble making their ends meet. No wonder they cannot save for emergencies. No wonder they work two or three jobs but still cannot get ahead. 
   President Clinton himself at one time admitted that Americans were taxed too much. But he still refuses to return the tax overpayments back to them because he does not think working Americans will spend it right. Instead, President Clinton has decided he will spend much of the surplus for his own government programs. 
   President Clinton and some of our Democratic colleagues insist we should have Social Security and Medicare first before we have tax cuts. In my view, this is nothing but an effort to deny working Americans tax relief. 
   Republicans have saved Social Security and have tried to create interest in Medicare reform. Tax relief only detracts from the need to spending more to bring home the bacon for many of our colleagues on the other side. Even after we've set aside and protected $2 trillion for Social Security and Medicare, he and my Democratic colleagues in the Senate still insist the tax relief is unachievable. 
   Over the next 10 years, the federal government will collect over $22.7 trillion in taxes. Excluding the Social Security tax surplus, the government will take $17 trillion from Americans' paychecks while it needs only $16 trillion to operate the government. In other words, the average U.S. household will pay approximately $5,307 more than the government needs over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Research Service. 
   One question we should ask ourselves before we decide how to spend any non-Social Security surplus is where the budget surplus comes from. Do we have a budget surplus because the government is spending less or because it is taking more of our money? The CBO has showed us precisely where we will get our revenues in the next ten years. The data indicates that the greatest share of the projected budget surplus comes directly from income tax increases, primarily from the capital gains realizations and increase of effective income tax rates. 
   Clearly, Mr. President, as I have argued repeatedly our revenue windfall did not just fall from the sky, nor has it come from any belt tightening in Washington. It comes directly from American taxpayers. 
   Again, my point is, Mr. President, that this non-Social Security surplus is nothing but tax over-payments. It is the American taxpayers' money and it should be returned. 
   Like the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan, my biggest fear is that if we don't give the non-Social Security surplus back to the taxpayers, Washington will soon spend it all. Such spending will only expand the government, making it even more expensive to support in the future, creating an even higher tax burden than working Americans bear today and a higher federal debt. That's why Chairman Greenspan says ``If we have to get rid of the surpluses--I would far prefer reducing taxes than [increasing] spending, and, indeed, I don't think it's a close call.'' 
   Major tax relief as we have proposed will help all Americans keep a little more of their own money. It will give middle class families relief from the tax squeeze. It will help farmers and small business owners pass their hard-earned legacies onto their children. It will help to reduce self-employed medical costs, and correct the injustice of the marriage penalty tax. It will encourage working Americans to save and invest more. It will reward people who work hard to get ahead. It will benefit all Americans and ensure our economy continues to grow. But more importantly, it will give working Americans more freedom to control their own fate and decide what's best for themselves and their families. This is exactly what President Clinton and our Democratic colleagues fear will happen. They simply cannot let go of their misconceived belief that higher taxes and more government spending are the best answers to America's challenges. That's the fundamental difference between the two parties. That is what this debate on tax relief is all about.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk a little bit about the health care bill we are debating in this Chamber. 
   Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have day after day asserted that their Patients' Bill of Rights legislation is better than the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus legislation, of which I am a proud cosponsor. 
   If we are to believe that raising the cost of every insured individual's premiums by 6.1 percent and increasing the number of uninsured by roughly 1.8 million people is what is good for America, then, yes, this could be called a better bill. I, however, don't think those statistics suggest it's a better bill. Most Americans who know that this legislation increases costs and increases the number of uninsured do not think it is a better bill at all. 
   I firmly believe that the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus, S. 300, is a much more productive solution to problems facing Americans in the health care market today. 
   Mr. President, eight to ten percent of Minnesotans are uninsured today. Now, we in Minnesota enjoy a lower uninsured rate than the national average and we have historically had one of the lowest uninsured populations in the country. 
   However, if S. 6 is adopted into law, I could expect to see about 36,000 more Minnesotans become uninsured. Nationally, about 15 percent of our population today is without insurance. They may be uninsured for a number of reasons, but I bet the biggest obstacle for most people is access, and access is determined by costs. They simply cannot afford the costs of insurance. 
   These uninsured Americans would be left even further behind if we adopt the Kennedy-Daschle health care bill. Our colleagues make no effort whatsoever to address the problems of the uninsured. I do not think this is good policy, I do not think it is good for the Nation, and it certainly is not good for those already uninsured or those who will be forced to drop health care insurance because of increased costs. 
   Thankfully, we have an alternative, and it is called the Health Care Access and Equity Act of 1999, or S. 1274. I was pleased to introduce this legislation along with my colleagues Chairman ROTH and also Senator ABRAHAM of Michigan. When we introduced this bill on June 24, we did so with the support of 15 of our colleagues. 
   The Health Care Access and Equity Act does several things to increase access to health insurance, but one of the most important components is the full deductibility of health insurance costs for those without access to health insurance coverage through their employer. The Health Care Access and Equity Act of 1999 presents us with the opportunity to create the most comprehensive tax deductible coverage system in our Nation's history. It achieves this by eliminating one of the most discriminatory portions of the Tax Code: the disparate treatment between an employer purchasing a health plan as opposed to an individual purchasing health insurance on their own. 
   When employers purchase a health care plan for their employees, he or she can fully deduct the cost of providing that insurance, effectively lowering the actual cost of providing that coverage. However, when an employee purchases an individual policy on their own, they must do so with after-tax dollars and cannot fully deduct the cost of that plan. They do not have the ability or the advantage offered to employers to reduce the actual costs of their policy by deducting the premiums from their taxes every year. Therefore, health insurance is too costly and, for many, they usually wind up without health coverage. The Health Care Access and Equity Act will end this discrimination within the Tax Code and make health care available for many more Americans. 
   Let's make the same tax incentives for purchasing health insurance now available to employers apply to everybody. Let's level the playing field, and we will have taken the next logical step in the evolution of our health care system. 
   I believe Congress should be doing what it can to lower the cost of health insurance, making it more affordable--not by proposing legislation that will raise the costs and will make health insurance more and more difficult to afford. 
   I have a chart with me that shows the impact my legislation would have for my constituents. As you can see, it would reduce health insurance costs by anywhere from $796 to $1,384 for a family of four living in Mankato, MN, and also $887 to about $1,542 for a family of four living in St. Paul, or the Twin Cities. This is because they could deduct their premiums on their taxes, and this is what they would save off their tax 
   bills which they could use then to pay for health insurance policies, thus making health care more affordable. 
   These are very significant costs which could make health insurance coverage available for many more people in my State, as well as across the country, who are currently in the individual health insurance market, and that is more than my colleagues on the other side of the aisle can say about their bill. 
   It seems most proposals before the Senate are just out there forcing some Federal definition of quality health plans onto the consumers and then sticks them with the bill, the increased cost for those mandates. It is not good policy, it does nothing for those who are uninsured, and it will not help those who will be forced to drop their health insurance because they can no longer afford the increase in those health care premiums. 
   Even without the increased costs associated with the so-called Patients' Bill of Rights legislation, employers are already anticipating premium increases of between 7 to 10 percent over and above the costs that would be forced to go up under the plan by Senator KENNEDY. Add on to that the costs of the Patients' Bill of Rights and you get higher numbers across the board, you get higher premiums, higher uninsured and higher frustration because any raise in pay that a middle-class worker might expect will now go toward even higher health care premium costs. 
   It is estimated that benefit mandates comprise over 20 percent of the price of health plan premiums already in the  State of Minnesota, and if you add on top of that the 5- to 6-percent tax on health plans and we are getting close to one-third of that premium being attributed to taxes or mandates. 
   You might say: Employers can cover the premium increases. Some may, but some may not. Regardless, the money employers use to cover higher health insurance premiums could be used to increase the employee's salary. By increasing the employers' costs, Congress will force employees to forego a pay increase. My colleagues across the aisle may believe this is a good direction for the country to go in, but I do not, and I know that most Minnesotans do not agree. 
   If all this were not bad enough, 57 percent of small businesses say they will stop providing health insurance for their employees if they are exposed to the Kennedy-Daschle bill's liability provisions. This is not just a threat. Most small businesses are not able to absorb higher operating expenses without cutting back or eliminating some costs, and that could mean as well some jobs that would be lost. 
   Let's talk about the liability issue a little bit. 
   Under Senator KENNEDY's legislation, employees will be able to sue their employers for something the employer is not obligated to provide. That sounds a little strange to me, so I have to say it again. People will be able to sue their employer if they are unhappy with something their employer is not in any way obligated to provide. 
   Proponents of increasing costs through liability will say: We have carved out employers from the liability provisions so only insurers, HMOs, and third-party plan administrators would be liable. This may be true in theory, but what they will not tell you is that there is already no way to separate the two under recent guidance from the Department of Labor. The guidance clarifies that employers have a fiduciary obligation to 
   monitor plan quality. This responsibility renders so-called carve-outs ineffective because there is no way employers can completely absolve themselves of benefit decisions under their health plan which is required under the Democrats' illusionary carve-outs. 
   As I have mentioned before, the Kennedy-Daschle approach will increase costs, and even if employers could meet the guidelines for that liability exemption, the costs are still passed on to the employers and, of course, those costs are then passed on to their employees. Essentially, the Kennedy-Daschle liability provision does not guarantee quality health care. What it does guarantee is increased health premium costs for every American. 
   What fork in the road is this country taking when a notion such as this is given any serious discussion? Isn't it apparent to supporters of the Kennedy bill that if companies are exposed to this type of liability they would just drop insurance coverage for their employees? 
   I have never believed we need more litigation in this country, and this is certainly not an exception. We all want patients to have protection as much as anyone else. Yet how do we ensure patients are receiving the health care they need in a timely fashion? 
   I believe a strong, independent, quick, and easily accessible appeals process for those who have been denied health care services they and their physicians believe is necessary is what is needed and appropriate means to resolve coverage disputes. Again, as an original cosponsor of the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus legislation, I support an idea for this strong, independent, external appeals process to ensure people receive the health care they need and to make sure they get it when they need it. 
   Perhaps the best part of the appeals process is the fact that the external appeal is binding on the health plan but not binding on the person who is appealing. What does that exactly mean? 
   It means if you were denied care you and your physician believe is necessary, go through the appeals process and the appeals board agrees with you, the health plan then is legally bound to pay for that care. However, if you are unsatisfied with the outcome of the appeals process, you can then sue the health plan under current law, which allows the collection of attorney's fees, the cost benefit, court costs, injunctive relief, and other equitable relief. 
   No one can sue their way to good health, but we can give them the tools they need to get the care they need when they need it, and the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus gives consumers those tools. 
   The Kennedy-Daschle bill also includes a provision which, on the surface, also sounds very reasonable. It allows physicians and patients to determine what is medically necessary. Who could be against that? But what they do not tell you is creating such a standard could, under some circumstances, work against the patient's best interest. I will give an example of how this could happen. 
   Under Senator KENNEDY's bill, health plans would be required to cover the costs of whatever setting or duration of care a physician decides is ``medically necessary.'' 
   The bill goes on to define medical necessity as whatever is consistent with generally accepted principles of professional medical practice. 
   This effectively prohibits health plans from intervening in situations when it is clearly in the patient's best interest. For instance, the Centers for Disease Control figures indicate that approximately 349,000 unnecessary caesarean sections were performed in 1991. While decisions regarding these individual procedures were based on generally accepted principles, a large number of women were needlessly subjected to major surgery and risk of infection. 
   Another shortcoming of the generally accepted principles of medical practice is the variance in treatments from region to region. Let's take a look at what the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care 1998 says about treatments for breast cancer;  
   Once diagnosed, surgery is universally recommended for the treatment of breast cancer. There are two principle surgical approaches: breast sparing surgery (lumpectomy, which is followed by radiation therapy) and mastectomy (complete removal of the breast). Randomized clinical trials have shown that these two approaches have nearly identical rates of cancer cure........Despite scientific evidence that the survival rate is the same for breast sparing surgery and for mastectomy, and in spite of wide consensus that patient preferences should determine which treatment is chosen, the wide variations in surgical rates suggest that physician, rather than patient, preferences are the deciding factor on most cases.  
   That's what the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care 1998 has to say about the choice between lumpectomies and mastectomies. Let me tell you about a related incident which actually happened in my state of Minnesota. 
   Several years ago, one of the major health plans in Minnesota received a telephone call from a Minnesota physician seeking authorization to perform an outpatient mastectomy on a woman suffering from breast cancer. This physician wanted to admit a woman to a same-day surgical center, remove her breast and then send her home later that day. 
   The health plan's medical director had never heard of an outpatient mastectomy being done before. In answer to questioning by the health plan, the physician admitted he had done the procedure only one time before. When asked why he wanted to do this procedure on an outpatient basis, he told the plan it was at the request of the patient. The plan's representative told the physician to wait and make no plans to do the procedure outpatient. 
   The health plan then went to the patient and asked why she would want to procedure done as an outpatient. She told the plan's representative that the physician told her the plan was ordering him to do the procedure on an outpatient basis. ``You know how insurance companies are,'' she said he told her. 
   When the plan told her they hadn't ordered the physician to do the procedure outpatient, she began to cry. She did not want the procedure done outpatient. 
   The health plan called the physician back and told him that due to the lack of medical necessity, they were denying his request for authorization to do the mastectomy on an outpatient basis. The patient had the mastectomy as an inpatient, and because of complications, she ended up staying in the hospital for several days. 
   Mr. President, this women was a single-mother of three who would have been totally incapable of caring for herself, much less her three children, if the physician had done the procedure outpatient as he originally requested. 
   This example demonstrates how health plans can and do contribute to  quality in our health care system. Are there problems in some areas? Have mistakes been made? Yes. But, let's think about the consequences of what we do here today. Will the Kennedy bill really make health care better? More quality oriented? I don't think it will. 
   New breakthroughs in pharmaceuticals and medical devices are unveiled almost daily. Many of these breakthroughs come from Minnesota companies and research facilities. These breakthroughs represent opportunities for individuals to live longer, healthier, more productive lives. I believe it would be difficult for physicians, or anyone, to be able to keep up with all the latest technology and treatments by themselves. Yet, that's what we're forcing them to do if the medical necessity provision included in the Kennedy bill passes as written. Further, if plans are required to pay for whatever procedure, treatment, drug or device providers offer, we could be putting patient's health, and perhaps their lives, at stake. 
   To show the inconsistency of President Clinton and Senator KENNEDY display by insisting the medical necessity provision be part of the Patients' Bill of Rights, they directly contradict a report issued in February by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. The report found that the majority of all Medicare fee-for-service fraud cases is a lack of medical necessity. You may recall Secretary Shalala holding a press conference in response to this report calling on America's seniors to be more vigilant when receiving health care services to assure that fraud is not being committed. 
   If the administration is urging consumers and health plans to take action in order to reduce fraud in the Medicare program, why is it proposing to bar health plans from using the very same tools to prevent fraud in their programs? 
   While I'm thinking about Medicare and the Patients' Bill of Rights, it was President Clinton who insisted, under the threat of a veto, a provision be included in the Balanced Budget Act which denies seniors one of the most basic patient's rights--the ability to use their own money to pay for the health care services they believe are necessary. Our Democratic colleagues agreed with the President and have stalled reconsideration of this egregious violation of a basic right. I am hopeful we can get to that patient's right later this year. 
   The problems our health care system faces are not just the result of managed care. If it were, Minnesota, where 90 percent of health care consumers are in managed care organizations, would not have the longest life expectancy in the United States. The Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul would not have the lowest health care costs of the top 20 metropolitan areas in the United States, and we wouldn't have an uninsured rate half the national average. Minnesota has found a way to live and thrive with managed care. It's not without problem, but for the vast majority of Minnesotans, it works well. With all due respect to my colleague from Massachusetts, Minnesotans don't want his definition of a quality health plan and we don't want him to tell us what protections we need or don't need. 
   During my first term in Congress, President Clinton introduced the Health Security Act, which is now commonly referred to as ``Clinton Care.'' I was opposed to the President's legislation because it was nothing short of a government take-over of the best health care system in the world. I remain opposed to this type of legislation because it is too prescriptive, too centralized and limits health care choices. 
   Over the past two years, we've seen bill after bill introduced which propose, in the name of quality health care, to allow federal bureaucrats, Congress and lawyers to practice medicine without a license. Benefit mandates are thrown around Congress as if there were no consequences. I've heard it referred to as legislating by body part. 
   We are told by those on the other side of the aisle, ``we need to have benefit mandates so Americans can receive quality health care,'' and ``let's preempt the states because they don't know what they're doing.'' I disagree, and the very individuals who regulate HMOs and every other type of health plan for the respective states--the insurance commissioners--also strongly disagree. In fact, State insurance commissioners have already spoken to Congress on this issue. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners wrote this to Chairman JEFFORDS in March of this year.  
   It is our belief that states should and will continue the efforts to develop creative, flexible, market-sensitive protections for health consumers in fully insured plans, and Congress should focus attention on those consumers who have no protections in self-funded ERISA plans.  
   The letter goes on to explain very precisely their view of pending legislation:  
   The states have already adopted statutory and regulatory protections for consumers in fully insured plans and have tailored these protections to fit the needs of their states' consumers and health care marketplaces. In addition, many states are supplementing their existing protections during the current legislative session based upon particular circumstances within their own states. We do not want states to be preempted by Congressional or administrative actions.  
   There has been a lot of smoke blown around here about how many health-based organizations have endorsed this bill or that bill, but when it comes to regulating health insurance policies, I believe we need to put more stock in the option of those who are currently responsible for regulating health insurance--our state insurance commissioners. They know best what the people in their states need--they know best how to achieve their goals, and Congress should know better than to question their ability or willingness to meet those challenges. 
   As we get deeper and deeper into the details of the Kennedy-Daschle bill, I am reminded of something Minority Leader DASCHLE said in the opening hours of this debate. He claimed that the reason insurance companies call them HMOs ``is that H-M-O stands for their patient philosophy: Having Minimal Options.'' Mr. President, I suggest that it is the Kennedy-Daschle bill that would take away options and our colleagues should be willing to admit it. 
   We have seen our colleagues' true motives when they backed President Clinton's Health Security Act, when they backed President Clinton taking away a senior's right to use their own earnings to pay for medical services without the government and now we see it with the Kennedy-Daschle Patients' Bill of Rights. Consumer's options are becoming minimal and we have government to thank for that. 
   To suggest that our bill--the only one expanding options for the American people by eliminating restrictions on medical savings accounts, allowing the self-employed to fully deduct the cost of purchasing health insurance, and permitting the carryover of unused funds in flexible spending accounts--limits Americans choices, ignores the contents of our bill and ignores the reality of the Kennedy-Daschle bill. 
   Another issue I would like to talk about is something I have taken great interest in over the past three years--emergency medical services. This is perhaps one area in our debate which Republicans and Democrats have agreed is important enough to ensure access for Americans in need of immediate care. Every proposal in Congress contains some form of the prudent layperson standard for emergency services. That is with good reason. 
   The Federal Government has some precedence in dealing with access to emergency care through a law enacted in the 1980s called EMTALA, or The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. This act requires hospitals to treat everyone and anyone who enters their emergency department regardless of ability to pay as a precondition to participation in the Medicare program. 
   All the proposals before Congress with the prudent layperson standard include some reference to EMTALA. Where I have concern is the lack of any mention of ambulance services in any Patients' Bill of Rights legislation. While there has been some mention of ambulance services being included as part of the ancillary services clause under EMTALA, this simply will not work. 
   I will remind my colleagues that EMTALA only affects what happens once an individual arrives at a hospital's emergency room door. It covers none of the pre-hospital care people receive from courageous EMS personnel  all over the Nation whose sole function is to get the sickest among us to the emergency room quickly, efficiently and safely so emergency physicians can tend to our condition. 
   Contrary to what most people think, EMS personnel do not make diagnoses. They do not make decisions about whether a patient should or should not be transported to an emergency room based on their medical condition. Ambulance personnel respond to calls initiated in any number of ways, arrive at the location, assess the patient's condition, stabilize them and ready them for transportation to a facility with the personnel trained to make a diagnosis. 
   The reason I wanted to bring this to everyone's attention is because I believe many of us have not taken the time to fully understand the function ambulance services performs in the health care delivery system. We cannot afford to continue ignoring the important role EMS plays in health care. 
   For the past 3 years, I have introduced legislation which would address some of the problems ambulance services faces every day. My most recent iteration is S. 911, the Emergency Medical Services Efficiency Act. I invite any and all of my colleagues to join me as a cosponsor of this important legislation. I am hopeful we can include several of its provisions in the Patients' Bill of Rights legislation before us today. 
   For every 1 percent increase in premiums, there are an additional two to four thousand uninsured in Minnesota. Whether it's a family of four in Ada, Minnesota or a single mother of two in Zumbrota, I don't want to be responsible for any Minnesotan losing their health insurance coverage. I believe if I were to vote for the Kennedy-Daschle bill, I would be doing just that--ensuring that 36,000 Minnesotans will be forced to drop their coverage because they can no longer afford it. 
   That is something I, along with 97 of my colleagues in the Senate, voted not to do in a sense-of-the-Senate resolution last year. I urge my colleagues to honor the promise they made in that vote and defeat the government-centered, one-size-fits-all vision of health care illustrated by the Kennedy-Daschle Patients' Bill of Rights. Patients will get a bill all right--one taken out of their paychecks every month. 
   I urge my colleagues to say yes to creating choices, yes to protecting consumers who aren't currently protected, yes to being mindful of costs, and yes to increasing the number of insured--they can do all that with one vote for the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus.

   Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much. 
   Mr. President, I rise to lend my voice in support of Senator COLLINS' amendment regarding deductibility for long-term care insurance. 
   I know some of those on the other side call this a sham-type proposal. But to the minority, a lot of times a sham, or empty vessel, or a shell game, if the Government doesn't do it, or buy it, or provide it somehow, if you encourage personal responsibility, if you encourage individuals to buy in the private sector, that doesn't count. The Government is left out. 
   I think by offering this amendment--by offering the tax incentives--to try to level the playing field between big employers, self-employed, and employees who do not have coverage, and giving them this incentive, many will take the option to buy this long-term insurance because they will have more access and because it will be more affordable. 
   That is the heart and basis of this amendment. 
   As Senator COLLINS mentioned, the long-term care provision of this amendment was contained within the Health Care Access and Equity Act which I introduced last month. I am pleased the Senate will get a chance to vote on this issue because it is such an important issue for today's seniors and tomorrow's retirees. 
   Mr. President, it is estimated that, in the history of the world, half of the people who have ever reached age 65 are alive today. As the baby boom generation ages, the population of those over age 65 will increase quicker than at any time in history. The increase in the aged population brings with it a number of complex and vexing issues, one of which is long-term care. 
   The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act tinkered slightly with the issue of long-term care insurance, but we need to meet the issue head on rather than skirt the edges. 
   I have believed we should encourage individuals to save for their retirement needs and, for a number of reasons, usually cost, long-term care insurance is often overlooked during retirement planning. Unfortunately, I think this often leads to individuals spending themselves down to poverty and relying on Medicaid in order to pay for long-term care. 
   Again, the heart of this amendment is to encourage people when they are  planning for those years to also include long-term care to protect their estate, to protect their heirs. 
   By allowing individuals to deduct the costs of long-term care insurance, we can prevent many of our elderly from impoverishing themselves in order to receive long-term care. 
   I also wanted to express my appreciation to Senator HUTCHINSON for his work on the prudent layperson language which is so important to all of our constituents. 
   As many of my colleagues know, I have been working on emergency medical services issues for the past 3 years and believe this provision will not only help patients in their time of emergency, but it will help our EMS providers continue to offer the most advanced emergency care in the world. This will help do that. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I'd like to express my appreciation to the physician Senator from Tennessee for not only his work on the access to specialists provision, but also his work throughout this debate providing a voice of experience and reason. 
   Again, I would urge my colleagues to vote for this much needed tax relief for long-term care insurance.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a Minnesota radio station from Bemidji, KBHP-FM, for geing honored with the 1999 Crystal Radio Award given by the National Association of Broadcasters. The Crystal Radio Award recognizes stations for their year-round commitment to community service. KBHP-FM was one of ten stations chosen to receive Crystals, making this their third award since 1987. Since the Award's inception in 1987, eight other stations in Minnesota have joined the ranks receiving the Crystal. These stations are WJON-AM in St Cloud, KSJN-FM in St. Paul, WWTC-AM, WCCO-AM, KQRS-FM/AM in Minneapolis (twice), KCUE-AM in Red Wing, KWOA-AM in Worthington, and WLTE-FM in Minneapolis. 
   I congratulate KBHP-FM for this great achievement and enter into the RECORD a brief description of the Station's work from the Cyrystal Radio Award program.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for S. 1282, the Fiscal Year 2000 Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government Appropriations bill. In particular, I commend the Senate Appropriations Committee for its support of the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program within this legislation. 
   The High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program was established in 1988 to assist state and local governments to investigate, prosecute and prevent illegal drug production and trafficking. Since 1990, the Office of National Drug Control Policy has designated twenty-six regions of the nation as High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas. Most recently, the States of Ohio, Oregon, and Hawaii were among those areas granted HIDTA status to help improve coordination of drug control efforts. 
   Unfortunately, communities in my home state of Minnesota continue to be threatened by drug abuse and illegal drug trafficking, particularly methamphetamine. In recent years, methamphetamine has become the drug of choice throughout Minnesota, and is closely associated with increased violent crime. In my recent meeting with Office of National Drug Control Policy Director General Barry McCaffrey, he referred to methamphetamine as ``the worst drug that ever hit America.'' 
   The alarming rate of meth production and trafficking has been caused by small, independent organizations that run clandestine laboratories in apartment complexes, farms, motel rooms and residences with inexpensive, over-the-counter-materials. The secretive nature of the manufacturing process involves toxic chemicals, and frequently results in fires, damaging explosions, and destruction to our environment. A constituent from Benson, Minnesota underscored the devastating effects of illegal meth production when he wrote, ``The resultant crime and addition problems are destroying small and mid-sized rural communities.'' 
   The high volume of meth trafficking in Minnesota has also placed enormous strain on the resources of those federal and state law enforcement agencies investigating abuse of this deadly substance. In 1998, for example, task forces from Freeborn County, Hennepin County, and Washington County seized a total of fourteen meth labs, an increase from five seizures in 1997. In 1998, the Minneapolis-St. Paul Resident Office of the Drug Enforcement Agency seized more than 200 pounds of meth, compared to 67 pounds seized in 1997. 
   Mr. President, Minnesota's local law enforcement community has begun to strengthen its strategy for combating illegal drug use. By September 1, a committee that includes representatives from the U.S. Attorney's Office, the Minnesota Sheriffs Association, the Minnesota Attorney General's Office, and the Minnesota Department of Public Safety will submit its proposed HIDTA initiative to the Office of National Drug Control Policy.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, over the last several months, I have also worked to focus attention on the value of the HIDTA program to communities throughout Minnesota. This past Spring, I presented the need for a ``Minnesota HIDTA'' to Office of National Drug Control Policy Director Barry McCaffrey during the May edition of my monthly cable television program. As the administrator of the HIDTA program, General McCaffrey clearly understands that although law enforcement is primarily a local responsibility, the federal government can support the ability of local law enforcement to investigate and prosecute serious drug offenders. 
   I am pleased to have included a provision within S. 899, ``The 21st Century Justice Act'' that underscores the need for additional federal antidrug resources in Minnesota. This provision directs the Office of National Drug Control Policy to establish a ``Northern Border High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area'' that would include the State of Minnesota. It also authorizes $2.7 million in Fiscal Year 2000 to improving coordination of antidrug efforts currently underway by local prosecutors, sheriffs, police chiefs, and state law enforcement officials. 
   Again, I commend the Senate for its support for the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program. I will continue to work with law enforcement officials, my colleagues in the Senate, and the Office of National Drug Control Policy to ensure that localities have the assistance they need to protect our communities from crime and drug abuse.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, we wanted to take a little time this morning to again talk about what I consider the overtaxation of the average working family in the United States. The tax burden is getting larger and larger every day and every year. In fact, under this administration it has grown by about 50 percent in just the last 6 years. To sum up some of these things we do have a number of other speakers who will come down this morning and join us and lay out some of the facts and figures on the current tax status in the United States. 
   Next Sunday our Nation will celebrate the Fourth of July. Millions of Americans and their families and  friends will gather to raise the national flag, parade in their hometown, grill in their backyard, or drive to the beach for a relaxing vacation. 
   The Fourth of July is always a truly great American holiday. 
   As we observe this special occasion, I rise to remind the American people of why we celebrate the Fourth of July, Independence Day, and to call upon Congress and the President to take immediate action to provide meaningful tax relief for all overtaxed Americans. 
   This great Nation was born out of a tax revolt. The revolt was not because of Founding Fathers were selfish but because they did not want to be shackled under more government regulations, bureaucracy, taxing powers, and unjust legislation of their homeland. 
   They did not want to send their hard-earned money to the Parliament in England that furthered their own special interests in order to keep themselves in power. 
   This tax revolt was about freedom and liberty, about a person being able to own himself, his labor, and the fruits of his labor. This is the simple moral origin of our Nation. 
   Our Founding Fathers understood well that low taxes and freedom were directly related. They did their best to ensure that the American people continued to enjoy their freedom. 
   Unfortunately, this freedom that our Founding Fathers treasured so much and that triggered our Nation's independence has been eroded. 
   Today, Americans are overtaxed. The tax burden on working Americans is more crushing than ever. In 1913, less than 1 percent of all Americans paid income tax. Only 5 percent of Americans paid any income tax as late as 1939, before World War II. 
   Today, the Federal tax burden is at a historic high. Federal taxes consume nearly 21 percent of national income. A typical American family pays $9,450 in Federal income tax per year. 
   A median-income family can expect to pay nearly 40 percent of its income in Federal, State, and local taxes--more than it spends on food, clothing, and housing combined. 
   But our Democratic colleagues and President Clinton do not believe this rapidly growing tax burden is excessive and have preferred new spending to tax cuts. 
   One of the best indicators of how exhausting the tax burden has become is the annual arrival of Tax Freedom Day, the day on which Americans stop working just to pay their State, Federal, and local taxes and actually begin keeping their earnings for themselves. 
   This year, Americans had to wait until May 11 before they marked Tax Freedom Day. At 132 days into the year, it's the latest arrival of Tax Freedom Day ever. 
   As a sign of just how far and fast taxes have escalated, in 1950, Americans marked Tax Freedom Day on April 3. 
   Cost of Government Day, a day calculated by Americans for Tax Reform, goes further by including taxes, regulations, and total government spending. This year Cost of Government Day arrived on June 22. 
   The total cost of government in 1999 is estimated at $3.72 trillion, that is up from $3.56 trillion in 1998. 
   This is a 4.5-percent increase overall, and that is almost double the rate of inflation. The cost of Government regulation alone will cost taxpayers over $1.06 trillion in 1999. Again, our Democratic colleagues and President Clinton do not believe this rapidly growing tax burden is excessive, and they have repeatedly denied tax cuts to Americans. 
   Let's take a look at another indicator. Over the course of President Clinton's administration, Washington's income has grown faster than our economy and has grown twice as fast than the income of the average American. In fact, Federal taxes have grown by over 54 percent during this administration. That is nearly $4,000 per year more per person. The income tax rates also indicate Americans are overtaxed. 
   The average tax rate for the 437,036 individual returns filed for 1916 was 2.75 percent. Again, the average tax rate for nearly the half million Americans who filed returns in 1916 was just 2.75 percent of income. Under President Reagan, we had only two income tax rates: 15 percent and 28 percent. But today, there are now five tax rates, and Americans can be taxed as high as 40 percent in Federal taxes. 
   In the past few years, over 20 million American workers earning between $30,000 to $50,000 have been pushed from the 15-percent income tax bracket to the 28-percent income tax bracket due to the unfair tax systems we have. On top of that, they have to also pay a 15.3-percent payroll tax. Federal taxes alone account for the loss of 43 percent of the income for those middle-income Americans who have worked hard just to try to get ahead. 
   The President and the Democrats always like to tell middle-income Americans that, of course, they are only out there taxing the rich while they stick their hands deeper and deeper into the pockets of average Americans. They use class warfare as a cover to tax all Americans at a higher and higher rate. 
   The rapidly growing tax burdens hurt low-income and minimum wage workers as well. They may not pay income tax, but they still have to pay the payroll tax. As low-income and minimum wage workers work harder and earn more, their payroll tax increases, again taking a huge bite into hard-earned dollars that are most needed to keep those families above the poverty line. Once again, our Democratic colleagues and the President do not believe this rapidly growing tax burden is excessive and have repeatedly refused to support any tax cuts. 
   Let's ask the American people if they are overtaxed and want a tax refund on their overpaid taxes. Let's ask a full-time mom and former schoolteacher, Susie Dutcher, about the overall tax burden. According to her:  
   Taxes are far and away the biggest portion of our family budget.  
   Susie would love to put more dollars into their retirement account, would love to buy more books for their three children, or put more money in their college fund or spend more money for other family priorities, but she cannot because much of the fruit of their labor is again taken by the Government. 
   Ask John Batey of Tennessee about the death tax. John runs a 500-acre family farm that has been part of the Batey family for 192 years. John has spent all of his life on his family farm and, like most other farmers, he plans to be a good steward of the land, save and build his assets, and someday try to leave his farm to his children. 
   After the death of his father 5 years ago and the death of 
   his mother last June, John began to settle his parents' estate. As he was about to take over the family farm, the IRS sent a death tax bill for a quarter of a million dollars. The land value of the farm increased significantly, but the death tax has never been indexed. John had no choice but to sell some of his assets, dip into their lifelong savings, and even borrow some money to pay Uncle Sam. 
   The Federal death tax was originally levied to pay for the war in 1916 to help fund the efforts of World War I, and estates under $9 million were not taxed at that time. But it later evolved into a mechanism, of course, with a redistribution of private income. 
   Just like the Batey family, millions of American farmers and small businessowners are faced with paying high taxes or, in fact, losing their farms and businesses to pay the death tax. Unfortunately, again, my Democratic colleagues insist that a cut in the death tax is a tax cut for the rich, and they can hardly justify a costly tax cut that benefits some of the wealthiest taxpayers. 
   Ask janitor Joe of Virginia about the capital gains tax. Over the last 30 years, Joe saved every penny of his income he could possibly save after paying Federal, State, and local taxes. He took the risk, and he invested his savings smartly in the market. He was excited as he watched his savings grow into $1/2 million in assets. That excitement soon turned into torment upon retirement when he began to withdraw the funds. The Government took nearly one-third of those hard-earned savings for capital gains taxes. 
   Or you could ask newly wedded Alicia Jones of my home State of Minnesota about the marriage penalty. Alicia and her husband graduated from college and had just begun working full time 2 years ago. In 1998, Alicia and her husband worked full time in professional careers. They had no children and were renting an apartment and trying to save to buy their first house. They had to pay at least an additional $1,400 under the marriage penalty tax in our Tax Code for simply being married. 
   As a result, on top of the over $10,000 they already had deducted from their  checks to pay Federal taxes, they had to take an additional $700 out of their limited savings account to pay for Federal taxes, taxes that they would not have had to pay, by the way, if they had not been married. 
   She wrote and said:  
   I'm frustrated by this. I'm frustrated for the future. How do we get ahead when each year we have to take money out of our savings to pay more and more for our taxes? I hope that you will remember my concern.  
   Alicia's story is not uncommon. There are 21 million American families in this same situation. If these individual stories are not convincing, let's take another look at the polls. 
   A recent Gallup-CNN-USA Today poll shows that over 65 percent of Americans believe taxes are too high. Half of the American population think the tax system itself is not fair. A Fox News poll indicates that 65 percent of Americans believe that no more than 20 percent of their income should go to Federal, State, and local taxes. As I said, about an average of 40 percent today is collected from Americans across the country. 
   An Associated Press poll also shows that the majority of Americans want to use the non-Social Security surplus that we are hearing so much about this week for tax relief, not for more 
   pet spending programs by this administration. 
   The list goes on. There are a lot of people around Congress, and especially in the White House, who talk about tax relief, but I believe it is all show. 
   The message from the American people is loud and clear: We are overtaxed, we want meaningful tax relief, and we want and need tax reform. 
   I ask my fellow colleagues and the President to ponder a very fundamental question about taxation over this holiday: Should our Government tax working Americans' income when they first earn it? Should the Government be able to tax it again when they save it, tax it again when they spend it, tax it again when they invest it, and tax it yet again when they die? 
   They talk about redoing taxes for low income people because it takes a larger portion of disposable income. I agree, but there is no excuse to tax others even more to support larger and larger spending plans. 
   To my fellow Americans, I invite you to think about our country's origin over this Independence Day holiday. Take a closer look at your payroll stubs to see how much in taxes is taken from your income, or just take a few moments to examine the hidden taxes on your holiday spending. You will be shocked to find out how much tax you are actually paying. 
   Let me give a few examples. If you drive the family car on vacation on the holiday, remember that 45 percent of the cost of your car goes to taxes. Over half of what you pay for a gallon of gasoline ends up going for taxes. Thirty-six percent of the cost of the tires on your car goes to taxes. And if you choose to fly, 40 percent of that cost also will go to the Government. 
   Staying at a hotel is not cheap either, but did you know about 40 percent of your bill goes to the Government in the form of taxes? 
   If you decide to stay at home and have a simple barbecue to celebrate Independence Day, the Government will stay there as an uninvited guest, and 43 percent of the cost of beer and 35 percent of the cost of soda will go to taxes. The Government's slice of your pizza is about 38 percent, and taxes account for 72 percent if you want to have a drink. Even 31 percent of what you pay for a loaf of bread is taxed. 
   I think you get the idea of how much of the price of the average products you will buy over this holiday weekend is going to go to the Government in taxes. 
   So in closing, I am encouraged by President Clinton's announcement that the budget surplus will grow by an estimated $1 trillion over the next 15 years. This additional budget surplus, I believe, makes tax relief even more necessary and even more feasible. 
   Even President Clinton is talking about new possible tax relief for the American people this year. I welcome the opportunity to work with the President to try to provide tax relief for all Americans--not to talk about it, not to be all show, but to make sure that some tax reform is passed in tax relief. 
   Saving Social Security, reducing the national debt, cutting taxes are imperative for our economic security and our economic growth. Our strong economy has offered us a historic opportunity to achieve this three-pronged goal. 
   Republicans are committed to returning the non-Social Security surplus to overtaxed Americans who are out there working hard and generating it in the first place. We have reserved nearly $800 billion of the non-Social Security money for tax relief in our budget, and we will provide meaningful tax relief for all Americans this year. 
   Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
   I now yield the floor to my colleague from Georgia, Senator COVERDELL, for up to 10 minutes.

   Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator from Georgia for his remarks this morning. Also, I thank him for all his hard work during this and previous Congresses to make sure that American families will be allowed to keep a little bit more of their hard-earned money, that less of it will come to Washington, and that they will have a little bit more control over how they spend it and what they spend it on. I appreciate it and thank him for all his efforts and work. 
   I also recognize this morning the Senator from Missouri, Mr. ASHCROFT, who also has been a leader in the fight against higher taxes and is working very hard for tax relief.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator very much. I appreciate the words and all of the efforts of the Senator from Alabama. He is talking about the President announcing that a tax cut is possible. He is agreeing with us that tax cuts are important. 
   I think we have to be very careful because I think it would be a bad deal for the American people if we got a little bit of a tax cut but it came at the cost of huge increases in spending. We don't want that type of a tradeoff. We want to make sure that tax relief means tax relief and not just some token tax relief while we increase spending over in the other side. 
   I recognize for up to 5 minutes this morning the Senator from Kansas, Mr. BROWNBACK, and I also want to compliment him for all of his hard work and efforts in the area of taxes.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas for his efforts in discussing the importance of continued work in reducing the tax burden for average Americans. 
   The bottom line is that we are overtaxed today. The average family today spends about 40 percent of everything they make on taxes. Compare that to 1916 when the taxes began; it was less than a 3-percent tax burden on those paying taxes at that time, which was only about 5 percent of the American people. Today over 40 percent of a family's income goes into taxes. 
   When we talk about tax relief, we are talking about giving back money that has been overcharged--in other words, the excess money, the surplus. We are not talking about cutting any Government spending. We are not talking about reducing even the size and scope of the Government under these plans. That we need to do. If we were going to actually cut taxes, we would be giving back the surplus and then looking for ways to reduce the amount of money the Federal Government spends. 
   A couple of brief facts on the tax burden and how it has grown. Under the Clinton administration, individual income tax relief for income tax receipts  has far outstripped our economic output. The tax collections have more than doubled this country's gross domestic product growth in the last 6 years. It is almost double what personal income growth has been. In other words, Washington spending is growing twice as fast as the growth in the entire economy and twice as fast as a person's personal income. I think that is what we are talking about today. 
   We all need to pay taxes. We need to support Government. There are many good things the Government does. We need to review the excessive spending and Washington's belief that it can do everything for everybody. 
   In a bipartisan effort and mood, I yield the reminder of my time to the Senator from South Carolina to sneak in some remarks this morning. 
   I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the recent passage by the Senate of S. 254, the ``Violent and Repeat Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act of 1999.'' 
   One of the most complex issues facing our society is how communities confront the troubling trends in violent crime committed by young people. In particular, the recent tragedy in Littleton, Colorado underscores that all elements of our society, including parents, faith-based organizations, local officials, educators, students, and law enforcement officials should be encouraged to work together to develop innovative and effective solutions to reducing and preventing violent acts committed by our nation's youth. 
   In 1997, young people under the age of eighteen represented 17 percent of all violent arrests; 50 percent of all arson arrests; 37 percent of burglary arrests; and 14 percent of murder arrests. Overall in 1997, law enforcement agencies made approximately 2.8 million arrests of persons under the age of eighteen. These sobering statistics indicate the need to combat youth violence in America to ensure that the young offenders of today do not become the career criminals of tomorrow. 
   For these reasons, I am pleased to have voted for passage of S. 254, the ``Violent and Repeat Juvenile Offender Accountability and Rehabilitation Act.'' I believe that many of the provisions within this legislation will hold violent juvenile offenders accountable for their actions and also integrate many young offenders back into their communities. We should all recognize that federal legislation is not a ``silver bullet'' solution to the problem of youth violence, and that our response to this epidemic is only one aspect of nationwide efforts to reduce and prevent violent juvenile crime. 
   Among its most significant provisions, this bipartisan legislation will provide assistance to Minnesota and other states to help develop local programs that hold young criminal offenders accountable for their actions, including such reforms as drug testing offenders upon arrest; implementing graduated sanction programs for repeat offenders; and building detention facilities for juvenile offenders. Equally important, states will also be empowered to prevent juvenile delinquency through initiatives such as one-on-one mentoring programs aimed toward at-risk juveniles and providing treatment for juveniles who suffer from substance abuse. 
   Mr. President, this measure also addresses an area of increasing concern to communities in my home state of Minnesota--gang violence. Today, there are more than 12,000 gang members in Minnesota, the nation's tenth-highest level of gang participation. 
   Throughout Minnesota, many communities have developed programs to stop the spread of gang activity, including the ``South Metro Gang and Youth Violence Project'' sponsored by Carver, Dakota and Scott counties. Among its achievements, this project has developed a computerized database to identify gang members, established a telephone hotline for graffiti removal, and formed the ``South Metro Gang Task Force,'' through which law enforcement agencies meet monthly to share information regarding gang activity in their jurisdictions. Through education, training and other community initiatives, this program has begun to tackle the threat of gang and youth violence. 
   In my view, the federal government can supplement local anti-gang initiatives by vigorously enforcing federal laws designed to combat interstate gang crime. The anti-gang provisions within S. 254 will also help to deter gang involvement by imposing stiff penalties on anyone who recruits a minor to become a member of a criminal street gang, or who uses a minor to distribute illegal drugs or participate in crimes of violence--common activities of gangs. By imposing enhanced penalties on those who wear body armor during crimes and prohibiting violent felons from owning body armor, we will also help to protect the lives of law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line each day protecting our communities from the threat of gang violence. 
   As someone who has always supported the important role of local communities in developing anti-crime strategies, I am pleased that the Senate modified this legislation to encourage the active role of State Advisory Groups (SAGs) as part of the juvenile justice system. I am hopeful that the conference report to this legislation will preserve the same level of responsibility for SAGs as provided under current law. 
   In my home state, the Minnesota Juvenile Justice Advisory Committee (JJAC) is composed of twenty-two individuals appointed by the Governor, including local prosecutors, students, police chiefs, judges, and state agency personnel, representative of communities throughout Minnesota. In 1998, JJAC awarded more than $1 million in federal funds to community-based organizations, schools, Indian reservations, and local law enforcement agencies to help develop effective and innovative juvenile offender programs. Statewide, more than 40,000 youth and their families were served by local programs identified and evaluated by JJAC last year. I ask that a list of the Minnesota Juvenile Justice Advisory Committee membership and a letter to me from the JJAC Vice-Chair be included as part of the RECORD following my remarks. 
   Mr. President, over the last several months, I have given careful thought to the aspects of our society that may contribute to incidents of juvenile crime, including the influence of the entertainment industry upon young people. My concerns are underscored by a recent e-mail I received from Andrew Backenstross, a young Minnesotan and Boy Scout who is working on his Citizenship in the Nation merit badge in the community of White Bear Lake. 
   Andrew wrote, ``All my teachers say that school should be a safe place to go and study. But Colorado and other places show us how exposed we are and that it could happen to us. Public schools need to be able to discipline or remove anyone who is not a threat or will not meet standards. Metal detectors, searches and police walking the halls is not the answer. That was not needed when my Dad went to school. People thought differently. We have to ask, what has changed? Maybe we are being conditioned for violence.  
   ``My parents have taught me about standards, acceptable behavior and respect for myself and 
   others. Maybe more help could be given to parents to be parents. Maybe if they didn't have to give so much of their income away in taxes they could afford to stay home and be parents.'' 
   In response to the concerns expressed by young people such as Andrew, and thousands of parents, I am pleased that the Senate bill encourages the entertainment industry to voluntarily establish guidelines to reduce violence in motion pictures, television programming, video games, and music lyrics. The bill also encourages Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to provide filtering software to consumers that could block juvenile access to unsuitable material. These provisions will provide parents with the tools needed to reduce their children's exposure to the culture of violence. 
   Mr. President, there were several amendments offered to this legislation that would impose additional restrictions upon lawful Americans, without contributing to a reduction in juvenile crime. Throughout the debate over these proposals, I urged the Senate to promote greater enforcement of our existing firearms laws before passing new gun control measures that would infringe upon the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens. I am very concerned that prosecutions of those who violate federal firearms laws have been far less zealous than what the American people deserve and expect. 
   According to the Executive Office of the United States Attorney, there were only eight prosecutions in 1998 of those who violated the federal prohibition on possessing a firearm in a school zone. From 1996 through 1998, there was only one prosecution of felons who have been denied the purchase of firearms after being subjected to a background check. These statistics underscore the reality that passing new, expansive gun control laws will not prevent violent crime or the illegal use of firearms. 
   As an alternative to far-reaching gun control proposals, I supported an amendment that encouraged the enforcement of existing gun laws, the rights of law-abiding citizens, and keeping firearms from children and criminals. This proposal provided $50 million to hire additional federal prosecutors to prosecute those who violate our gun laws; a prospective ban on juveniles convicted of violent offenses from ever owning a firearm; and enhanced penalties for juveniles who illegally bring a gun or ammunition to school with the intent of possessing or using the firearm to commit a violent crime. 
   Additionally, this proposal requires all firearms transactions at gun shows to be subject to the National Instant Check System (NICS) without subjecting law-abiding purchasers to unnecessary fees or record-keeping requirements. Importantly, this provision preserves legitimate business transactions at gun shows while also addressing the public safety concerns of millions of Americans. In my view, this proposal was more reasonable than a more-restrictive proposal by Senator LAUTENBERG that was later passed by the Senate. 
   Mr. President, I believe the Senate passage of this bill is an important contribution to the national response to youth violence. The 106th Congress should seize the opportunity to pass meaningful and balanced legislation that will encourage local solutions to the complex problem of juvenile crime.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I wish to talk this morning about health care. I find it ironic we are trying to get to a very important agricultural appropriations bill, and the Democratic side of the aisle is preventing the Senate from moving on that. Hopefully we can work out an agreement on these health care issues and discuss and debate them openly. I look forward to the debate. 
   I find it humorous when Senator KENNEDY calls our bill the ``Patient Bill of Wrongs''. It seems that if it is not his way, it is the wrong way. Our bill is the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus, which I think goes further in trying to encourage people to get health insurance and to have coverage, rather than leading America toward a government-type system of national health care. 
   I am looking forward to the debate. I hope the agreement can be worked out and we can discuss the different views on health care reform, listen to Senator KENNEDY on his Patients' Bill of Rights, and also to have adequate time to fully debate the Republican plan, Senator NICKLES' bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus. I think we must have time to compare and contrast those two plans. I think the American people are going to get a good idea where both parties stand on the direction of health care and health care reform in the near future.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Chairman ROTH and Senator ABRAHAM, to introduce legislation which will provide access to affordable health insurance for 43 million uninsured Americans, correct the inequities in the tax treatment of certain types of health insurance, and allow for the full deductibility of long term care insurance. 
   The Health Care Accessibility and Equity Act of 1999 presents us with the opportunity to create the most comprehensive tax-deductible coverage system in our nation's history. 
   One of the most discriminatory portions of the tax code is the disparate treatment between an employer purchasing a health plan as opposed to an individual purchasing health insurance on their own. 
   Mr. President, when employers purchase a health plan for their employees, he or she can fully deduct the costs of providing that insurance, effectively lowering the actual costs of providing that coverage. 
   However, when an employee purchases an individual policy on their own, they must do so with after tax-dollars. They don't have the ability or the advantage offered to employers to reduce the actual costs of the policy by deducting premiums from their taxes every year. 
   Therefore, they usually wind up without health coverage. The Health Care Accessibility and Equity Act will end this discrimination within the tax code and make health care available for many Americans today. 
   Further, the legislation offered today by Senator ROTH, Senator ABRAHAM, and myself would immediately allow the self-employed to fully deduct health insurance costs. Twenty-five million Americans are in families headed by a self-employed individiual--20 percent of those are uninsured. 
   We always talk about trying to have more Americans covered by health care insurance. Yet, we have a tax code which discriminates against some, while favoring others. This results in fewer people being covered. 
   Let's make the same tax incentives for purchasing health insurance available to employers apply to everyone--level the playing field and we will have taken the next logical step in the evolution of our health care system, 
   Mr. President, I believe Congress should be doing all we can to lower the costs of health insurance. 
   However, it seems most proposals before the Senate do just the opposite by forcing some federal definition of a quality health plan on consumers and sticking them with the bill. 
   It's not good policy it does nothing for those who are uninsured and it certainly won't help those who will be forced to drop health insurance because they can no longer afford the premiums,. 
   Mr. President, we've heard a lot of rhetoric about patient protections and why the Federal Government needs to step in and help consumers. Indeed, a better role for the Government is to help consumers by removing restrictions on Medical Savings Accounts as we do in this legislation as well. 
   MSAs allow the consumers to control their costs when it comes to providing their families with health care. It would allow them to decide which provider they want to see and which services they want and will pay for. Certainly, empowering patients is a much more productive solution to a problem than simply forcing consumers to buy the government's definition of quality health insurance. 
   When Congress created the medical savings accounts in the Kassebaum-Kennedy Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, there were so many restrictions placed upon the program then that it was essentially set up to fail. Yet MSAs have managed to become tremendously successful. 
   According to the General Accounting Office, 37 percent of all MSA policyholders were previously uninsured. When you gave them the option and the opportunity, they were then able financially to buy insurance. Clearly, MSAs are providing an option for those who before couldn't afford to buy health insurance. 
   The bill we are introducing today does not force Americans into a government-centered health care plan, a system that they spoke so loudly against back in 1993, if we remember. Senator KENNEDY's Patients' Bill of Rights legislation, I think, is another example of a government-centered approach which actually threatens the accessibility and the affordability of health care. 
   Again, this morning, our legislation fosters a consumer-centered health care system without raising the costs, which so many of our constituents have favored. 
   Glenn Howatt of the Minneapolis Star Tribune recently did an article on MSAs and spoke with several policyholders. I will read a portion of his article which I believe demonstrates exactly why Congress needs to lift the restrictions on MSAs so that everyone has the opportunity to purchase an affordable health insurance plan. Mr. Howatt gives an account of Suzanne Eisenreich Roberts.  
   Last year, Roberts thought it would be a good idea to dump her individual health insurance policy, which cost $330 every month, because she rarely got sick. 
   She switched to an MSA last year. Her premiums dropped to $100 per month, but her deductible shot up to $2,250 a year. 
   Two days after the new policy became effective, Roberts developed a gallstone problem that required surgery. Although the insurance covered the $14,000 surgery, Roberts had to pay $2,250 to satisfy the deductible requirement. 
   ``Financially, I can afford the deductible,'' said Roberts. And, she noted, ``I was really out nothing because I would have spent it in premiums anyway.'' 
   If Roberts had kept her old policy, her annual premiums would have been $3,960. 
   But her new policy's premiums are just $1,200 a year--a $2,760 saving that more than makes up for the deductible cost.  
   Even though she went with the MSA, even though she had to have surgery the first year, she was far ahead by having a medical savings account compared to her own insurance policy. 
   I ask unanimous consent to have printed the entire text of Mr. Howatt's article and another pertinent article in the RECORD.

   Mr. GRAMS. Clearly, Mr. President, MSAs offer many benefits for the uninsured. Let's lift the restrictions placed on MSAs and allow everyone to open a Medical Savings Account. 
   The Health Care Accessibility and Equity Act begins the process of dealing with our nation's long term care needs. 
   Mr. President, it is estimated that, in the history of the world, half of the people who have ever reached age 65 are alive today. 
   And as the babyboom generation ages, the population of those over age 65 will increase quicker than at any time in history. 
   The increase in the aged population brings with it a number of complex and vexing issues, one of which is long term care. 
   The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act tinkered slightly with the issue of long term care insurance, but we need to meet the issue head on. 
   The legislation Chairman ROTH, Senator ABRAHAM, and I are introducing today would eliminate the questions surrounding what constitutes a qualified versus non-qualified long term care plan and their tax treatment. 
   I have always believed we should encourage individuals to save for their retirement needs and, for a number of reasons, usually cost, long term care insurance is often overlooked during retirement planning. 
   Unfortunately, this often leads to individuals spending themselves down to poverty and relying on Medicaid. By allowing individuals to deduct the costs of long-term care insurance, we can prevent many of our elderly from impoverishing themselves in order to receive long-term care. 
   The Health Care Accessibility and Equity Act of 1999 is good policy and will begin to address the crisis of 43 million Americans without access to affordable health care insurance today. Most important, it levels the playing field for those who are purchasing health insurance individually. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to help us get closer to the goal of health care access for all Americans.

   Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Chair. Madam President, I thank the chairman for recognizing me. 
   As the subcommittee chairman with jurisdiction over the State Department authorization bill, I compliment our chairman for all the work he has put into this bill to move it quickly to the floor. 
   As he said, I hope we can get these amendments addressed and send this bill to the House and hopefully have it signed by the President in the very near future. 
   I worked closely and diligently with Members on both sides of the aisle and the administration to craft legislation which will strengthen America's leadership role in the international arena. This package enhances the security of our embassies abroad, establishes benchmarks for the payment of U.N. arrears, and prioritizes our international affairs expenditures. 
   I am pleased this authorization bill contains the provisions of a bill I introduced, the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999. In the aftermath of the embassy bombings in August of 1998, the State Department Accountability Review Boards chaired by Admiral Crowe concluded that we have devoted inadequate resources and placed too low a priority on security concerns. Those findings echoed those of the Inman Commission, which issued an extensive embassy security report that raised these same points 14 years ago. 
   We seek to remedy that situation by establishing an Embassy Security and Construction Account so funds designated for embassy security will not be used for other purposes. In addition to authorizing $600 million a year for the next 5 years, this bill provides security requirements for U.S. diplomatic facilities and requires the Secretary of State to certify that the funds are being used to meet security objectives. It also establishes requirements for threat assessments and also emergency procedures. Working abroad will never be risk free. But we can take a number of measures, like these, to make sure that safety is increased for U.S. Government employees overseas. We can also put forward requirements to ensure we have an effective emergency response network in place to respond to a crisis should one arise. 
   I am also pleased that the U.N. Secretary General and the administration have endorsed our U.N. reform package which provides $819 million in arrears and another $107 million debt relief in exchange for reforms. This is a positive step towards shaping a U.N. that is a viable organization in the 21st century. Because any organization burdened with a bloated bureaucracy and no mechanisms to control spending will collapse under its own weight of inefficiency. We must reform the United Nations now, and the United States has the responsibility to play a major role. If we do nothing, and the United Nations collapses under its own weight in a few decades, then we will have only ourselves to blame. 
   I believe that the U.N. needs the discipline of actual benchmarks tied to the arrears to provide the impetus for fundamental reform; because given the power of an 
   entrenched U.N. bureaucracy, true reform will only occur when there are tangible incentives to  change. We have seen how difficult it is to streamline our own bureaucracy here in Washington. It is even more difficult to streamline an international organization where each member is involved in these decisions. But I want to underscore that these reforms are achievable. These reforms include having Inspectors General in the specialized agencies; promoting merit-based employment; and establishing a code of conduct for personnel with an anti-nepotism provision. Congress' message is simple and it is straightforward. The U.S. can help make the United Nations a more effective, more efficient and financially sounder organization, but only if the U.N. and other member states, in return, are willing to finally become accountable to the American taxpayers. 
   That being said, I want to emphasize that the U.N. does excel in certain areas. The U.N. Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture gives financial aid to organizations that help torture survivors, like the Center for Victims of Torture in Minnesota. Assisting treatment centers for victims of torture is an effective method to lessen the incidence of torture by providing irrefutable medical and psychological evidence that torture is actually still occurring. These centers also serve a strategic purpose of restoring faith in the principles of human rights and democracy. That is why I am leading the effort to increase the U.S. contribution to $5 million a year. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the entire bipartisan package and, especially, to understand how difficult it was to arrive at an agreement on the arrears. Again, I commend the chairman and also the ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee for their diligence and also their perseverance in effecting this compromise bill. This agreement is in America's best interest, and the best interest of the entire international community. 
   I compliment the chairman for all his fine work in getting this bill to the floor. Again, I urge my colleagues to vote for its passage. 
   Thank you very much, Madam President. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to introduce another Social Security-related bill. 
   This bill would give all researchers access to Social Security's Continuous Work History Sample (CWHS). 
   The access to the CWHS is critical for the general public and other government agencies to fully evaluate the working of the current system and estimate the budgetary impact of any changes that need to be made in the future. 
   The CWHS is a key set of data which holds information on the work and benefit histories of Social Security program participants. Until 1976, this data was widely available to federal, state agencies, universities and private research groups. 
   There is no evidence of any misuse of the CWHS in the period before 1976. 
   The 1976 Tax Reform Act denied access to CWHS data to almost all users outside of the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration. 
   Although it later extended the access to a few units of government agencies, private researchers are still denied access. The excuse was to protect privacy. 
   However, the IRS is covered by the same law. But it has interpreted the law to enable it to make samples of individual tax returns available to researchers on the basis that identifiers must be removed and the research must be bona fide. 
   Mr. President, if the IRS can make its data available to researchers, why cannot the SSA do the same? 
   Last year, during a Budget Committee hearing, I asked SSA Commissioner Apfel about this. Here is his reply:  
   The SSA supports, in principle, the idea of making data from our administrative records available to researchers in order to better inform the ongoing debate on the future of Social Security.  
   The National Research Council and other academic institutions also support to give researchers access to the CWHS. 
   My legislation would amend the 1976 Tax Reform Act to allow bona fide researchers access to CWHS data, and at the same time protect the confidentiality and privacy of program participants. 
   It also requires researchers to sign a legally binding agreement that restricts use of the data to the research and forbids the disclosure of information that could be used to identify individuals. 
   Mr. President, this is ``good government'' legislation. Allowing access to CWHS data will open the entire Social Security system to outside scrutiny. 
   It will significantly improve oversight of the program and enable Americans to know everything they need to know about how the system operates and what changes are needed to make it solvent. 
   I, therefore, urge my colleagues to support these legislative initiatives.

   Mr. GRAMS. 
   Mr. President, 1999 has been declared the ``International Year of the Older Person'' by the United Nations. 
   In honor of this special tribute, I rise today to introduce legislation specially designed to provide fair and accurate Social Security benefits in order to help all Americans achieve retirement security. 
   I believe senior citizens in this country have made, and continue to make, valuable contributions to their families, communities and to society as a whole. 
   One of the most troubling aspects of the debate over Social Security's future has been attempts to frighten older Americans. Many seniors fear that they may lose their Social Security benefits. 
   To ease their fears and worries, I introduced legislation last month that would require the government to legally guarantee seniors full Social Security benefits plus accurate COLA adjustments. 
   In essence, this bill would give older Americans property rights to their Social Security benefits, which they do not have now. It is no wonder they now worry about loss of benefits. 
   However, an accurate method for how we calculate Social Security remains a subject of debate. 
   In order to understand this issue, Mr. President, we need to go back and take a closer look at how seniors' COLAs are currently calculated by the government. 
   To compensate for the effects of inflation, Congress passed legislation in 1972 to give Social Security beneficiaries an automatic cost of living adjustment, or a COLA. 
   This COLA is based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as tracked and surveyed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) under the Labor Department. 
   Currently, the BLS produces two official CPIs, one for All Urban Consumers called the CPI-U, and one for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, called the CPI-W. 
   The CPI-U represents the spending habits of about 80 percent of the population of this nation, and the CPI-W is a subset of the formula, representing about 32 percent of the total population. The government uses the later the CPI-W to measure COLAs for Social Security benefits. 
   But clearly, this does not reflect the older American population and their consumption habits. Spending habits of urban wage earners cannot be equated with those seniors. Nevertheless, the government continues to use it calculating COLAs for Social Security beneficiaries. 
   Back in 1987, after considerable criticism of the CPI-W and its applicability to senior consumers, Congress amended the Older Americans Act of 1965 to require the BLS to develop an experimental CPI that would better reflect the buying habits of consumers 62 years of age or older. This is now known as the CPI-E. 
   The CPI-E places greater weight on the cost of such goods and services as medical care and prescription drugs, areas where seniors spend more than other Americans. 
   Although it's still experimental, the preliminary finding shows annual increases in Social Security benefit payments received by older Americans are not keeping pace with inflation on the goods and services on which they spend much of their money. 
   Over the past 15 years, goods purchased by seniors increased 6 percentage points more than goods purchased by the general public. Their medical costs skyrocketed 156 percent. The main reason that the CPI-E has been higher than the other two CPIs. 
   My concern is, as inflation on medical and pharmaceutical goods continues to rise, without a fair COLA increase, older Americans' hard-earned Social Security benefits are worth less and less. Their purchasing power will continue to diminish. 
   Mr. President, that's why I am introducing legislation today to prevent that from happening. My legislation is simple and straightforward. It first calls for the establishment of a CPI Review Committee made up of well-known economists who have expertise in the field, plus representatives of our senior citizens population. 
   The Committee will be given the task of studying how to analyze and improve the CPI-E method, make recommendations, and form an implementation plan to produce a CPI that accurately reflects the senior population and their consumption that will be used to determine the Social Security COLA each year. 
   Appointing economic professionals will de-politicize this issue, and allow us to make sound policy based on merits rather than on political consideration. 
   This is also consistent with the measures recommended by the Advisory Commission to Study the Consumer Price Index, or the Boskin Commission, which calls for Congress to establish an independent committee or commission of experts to review progress in developing a new system of measuring the overall cost of living adjustments. 
   Within a year, the Committee I recommend is required to complete its work. A pilot program will test the accuracy of the CPI-E over a 3 year period by using improved and recommended methods. 
   However, I must point out that the experimental CPI-E currently computed by the BLS has limitations. For instance, the number of consumer units was relatively small, only 19 percent of the total sample. 
   Expenditure weights used in the construction of the CPI-E have a higher sampling error than those used for larger populations. 
   That's the reason that my legislation specifically instructs the Committee to remove this and other major limitations. To construct an improved CPI-E that is more scientific, accurate and representative of older Americans' spending habits. 
   We had the right idea in 1987. My legislation will improve on that law after we've had some time to analyze it. 
   Now, Mr. President, I know some of my colleagues will raise questions about this bill. 
   First, they are going to say, what about the issue of cost? Mr. President, it is perhaps true that moving from the CPI-W to the improved CPI-E to determine Social Security COLA increases may increase federal spending. 
   As a consistent fiscal conservative, I am concerned about the budgetary impact. I believe we must exercise caution and discipline on how government spends our money. 
   However, the issue of a fair Social Security COLA is not at its root a fiscal one, but rather an issue of fairness, particularly in the case of retired workers who rely upon their fixed Social Security pensions for survival. 
   I have argued repeatedly that the federal government has entered into a sacred covenant with the American people to provide benefits for their retirement if they pay into the system. 
   We have also committed to give them a fair COLA to keep up with inflation. It's our moral and contractual duty to honor that commitment, and to ensure the program will be there for current and future beneficiaries. 
   Senior citizens are a unique consumer population that should not be lumped into a category that considers spending habits the same as the average American family of four. 
   Once again, Mr. President, this is an issue of fairness and justice, not an issue of cost. All my legislation asks for is an accurate CPI and a fair COLA, up or down. 
   Second question: if an official CPI-E is created, wouldn't it set a potentially dangerous precedent for creating a CPI for every seemingly distinct population group? The answer is no. 
   Senior citizens comprise nearly 60 percent of Social Security beneficiaries, and this number will increase substantially as the Baby Boomer generation retires. Furthermore, the Social Security program is specifically intended to benefit senior citizens. It's only fair and rational to create an accurate CPI for them. 
   However, we have not forgotten that there is another distinct group of Social Security beneficiaries who receive disability benefits. 
   Because this group also spends more of their money for medical and pharmaceutical goods and services, their purchasing power could be affected by the inaccurate CPI and therefore COLA increase. 
   My legislation specifically requires the Committee to look into this issue and make recommendations on how to resolve it. 
   Third question: would this legislation overlap and contradict the study conducted by the Boskin Commission? The answer again is no. 
   On the contrary, my legislation is a complement to the Boskin Commission report. It parallels the general recommendations of the Boskin Commission. 
   These include development of a new Consumer Expenditure Survey that is larger and therefore more representative of the American consumer; development of a new market basket of goods and services that can register changes in the quality of products, the introduction of new products, and the substitution of less or more expensive goods when prices change; and development of a point-of-purchase survey that can register consumer shifts to lower price outlets. 
   Finally, would this legislation set back Social Security reform efforts? The answer is no. As I mentioned earlier, it would be wrong to let Social Security beneficiaries bear the burden of a mistake which is not of their own making. 
   In fact, when we give a legal guarantee to older Americans that they will receive Social Security benefits in full plus a fair COLA increase and take this fear away from them, it will be much easier to move the retirement system from a PAYGO system to a fully funded system. 
   This would in effect secure retirement income for our children and grandchildren. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, retirement security for today's and tomorrow's seniors is essential to the social stability and economic prosperity of our society. This is all my legislation attempts to achieve. 
   I urge the Senate to make this issue the top priority for the 106th Congress. Working together, we will meet the demographic challenges and move towards a society that allows all ages to progress in the new millennium.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Clarence Lien of Forest Lake, MN. On June 7, 1999, I had the great honor of presenting a much-belated Purple Heart to Clarence. He is most deserving of this long overdue recognition. I, therefore, take this opportunity to congratulate Clarence and thank him for his service and sacrifice. President Ronald Reagan said, ``Freedom is not something to be secured in any one moment of time. We must struggle to preserve it everyday. And freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction.'' We must always remember the great debt of gratitude we owe to those like Clarence who have served our country in the Armed Forces, protecting the freedom we all too often take for granted. Again, congratulations, Clarence. I salute you.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to America's small businesses--the backbone of our nation's vibrant economy. As my colleagues may know, this week is recognized as ``National Small Business Week.'' 
   As a former small businessman, I believe small businesses have always been one of the leading providers of jobs throughout our communities. Today, there are over 24 million small businesses that serve as the principal source of new jobs, employing more than 52 percent of the private workforce. 
   In particular, I am very proud of the tremendous growth in women-owned businesses over the last several years. According to the National Foundation for Women Business Owners, there are more than 166,000 women-owned businesses in my home state of Minnesota, employing 349,800 people and generating $42.3 billion in sales. Between 1987 and 1996 the number of women-owned businesses increased dramatically, by over 73 percent. 
   Mr. President, one of the unique aspects of Minnesota's small business community is the large number of high-tech companies throughout our state. I certainly envision an important role for small, high-technology businesses in meeting the nation's science and technology in the years ahead. Small businesses account for 28 percent of jobs in high-technology sectors and represent 96 percent of all exporters, underscoring the important role the small business community will have toward developing a 21st century economy that is globally and technologically driven. 
   During ``National Small Business Week,'' I am proud to share with my colleagues the special recognition recently granted by the Small Business Administration to two dedicated Minnesotans: Comfrey Mayor Linda Wallin and Ms. Supenn Harrison, a restaurateur in Minneapolis. 
   Mr. President, in 1997 several communities in Minnesota were threatened by terrible tornadoes and floods. Almost immediately, Mayor Wallin provided courageous leadership to protect the community of Comfrey from this dangerous natural disaster. In addition to establishing a command center to coordinate efforts to rebuild and provide relief to residents, Mayor Wallin secured assistance from the SBA to rebuild a civic center, a new library, and an elementary school. This year, the SBA has honored her with the ``Phoenix Award'' for those who have displayed confidence, optimism, and love of community while surmounting near disaster. 
   Ms. Supenn Harrison, a successful CEO of Sawatdee, a Thai restaurant in Minneapolis, represents the finest of Minnesota's small business owners. Ms. Harrison is Minnesota's 1999 honoree as one of the fifty finalists to be considered for the National Small Business Person of the Year. Ms. Harrison's investment in her company and employees through constant efforts to update equipment, implement new marketing strategies, and encourage high employee morale underscores her commitment to a strong economy. 
   Mr. President, I am honored to recognize the contributions of Minnesota's  small business community during ``National Small Business Week.'' I look forward to working with my colleagues to promote an economic climate where small businesses can succeed through federal regulatory relief, tax reduction, a skilled workforce, and free trade policies.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to amend the Poultry Products Inspection Act to include birds of the Ratitae order, such as ostriches, emus, and rheas, in the mandatory USDA meat inspection program. Currently producers of ratitae participate in a voluntary inspection program, but costs are borne by the producers and can add as much as $2 per pound to the price of the product. The USDA currently absorbs the cost of inspection for the more traditional agricultural products, such as turkey, poultry, and beef. 
   I introduce this legislation to encourage agricultural entrepreneurship and diversification, and to level the economic playing field for those farmers willing to take innovative risks to bring new products to American and global consumers. Ratite meat is reported to be high in protein and low in fat and cholesterol, and byproducts from the animals are being studied by universities and medical labs for their potential uses. I would also note that farmers engaged in producing ratite meat can now be found all over the country, not just in Minnesota. 
   With the increasing focus in our country on food safety, I believe this bill is a small but important step toward both encouraging development of alternative agricultural products and ensuring the safety of the food our citizens consume. 
   I ask my colleagues to join with me in support of this bill to help family farms diversify into new products that will provide them with new income sources and give American consumers more variety at the grocery store.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the national Federated Boys Clubs, known today as the Boys and Girls Club of America. 
   Although the Boys Clubs were not organized nationally until 1906, origins of the club can be traced as far back as the mid-1800s. As early as 1853, a Club-like facility was established in New York City for the purpose of lodging newsboys. However, the first Boys Club, as we know it today, wasn't established until 1860. The Dashaway Club in Hartford, Connecticut is recognized as the first known Boys Club, which provided afterschool activities for children from disadvantaged homes. 
   Soon the idea of a shelter for youth to spend time during non-school hours caught on. These clubs offered a safe place for children to congregate and stay out of trouble. Rapidly, Boys Clubs sprouted up around the country. In the early years, the clubs were concentrated mostly in New England. By 1906, 53 separate Boys Clubs were in existence. It was decided that these clubs should somehow work collectively. On May 13, 1906, a group of businessmen and Boys Clubs representatives met to discuss the idea of a national federation. Thus, the Boys Clubs of America was born. 
   Although the clubs continue to operate autonomously, the national organization provides staff recruitment and training, program research, facility construction, fundraising, and marketing. In addition, the national club addresses legislative and public policy issues affecting young people. In 1956, the Boys Club celebrated its 50th anniversary and received a U.S. Congressional Charter. As more and more clubs were formed, the organization grew and began serving girls as well as boys. In 1990, the name was officially changed to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. Today, there are over 2,200 clubs operating nationwide, serving over three million children. Minnesota is proud to be home to 21 Boys and Girls Clubs, serving 33,456 children. 
   The Boys and Girls Clubs provides hope, inspiration, and the opportunity for children to realize their full potential as citizens. These clubs provide guidance, support, and leadership, while encouraging youth to abstain from drugs and alcohol, strive for scholastic achievement, become involved in community service, develop personal talents such as music or art, and explore career opportunities. Dedicated volunteers have helped the Boys and Girls Clubs of America become a success. 
   Mr. President, on the 93rd anniversary of its founding, I applaud the hard work and dedication of the men, women and youth who have contributed to the success of the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. Through their persistence and encouragement, youth across the country have benefitted greatly.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to promote awareness of missing children and honor those who selflessly work to search and rescue the thousands of children who disappear each year. As my colleagues may know, today is recognized as ``National Missing Children's Day.'' 
   According to a recent U.S. Department of Justice study, annually there  are over 114,000 attempted abductions of children by nonfamily members, 4,500 child abductions reported to police, and 438,200 children who are lost, injured, or otherwise missing. These numbers are truly cause for concern by all Americans. 
   As a parent, I believe local communities, schools, faith-based organizations and law enforcement should be encouraged to work together to protect the most vulnerable members of our society--children. From a federal perspective, I am proud to be a cosponsor of legislation to reauthorize the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the Runaway and Homeless Youth Program through the next five years. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children operates under a Congressional mandate and works in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice on Delinquency Prevention. I know my colleagues would agree that the Center has an outstanding record of safely recovering missing children across the country, and most recently achieved a 91 percent recovery rate. 
   Mr. President, as we remember the many missing children across the nation today, I want to especially recognize the relentless work and effort to protect our nation's children by Minnesota's Jacob Wetterling Foundation. The Foundation was established by Jerry and Patty Wetterling after their son, Jacob, was abducted by a masked man at gunpoint near the Wetterling home in St. Joseph, Minnesota. Today, the Jacob Wetterling Foundation is a national, non-profit foundation committed to preventing the exploitation of children through educating, raising awareness and responding to families who are victims of abduction. 
   Mr. President, our children represent our future and we must continue our work to keep them safe. Again, I commend the numerous volunteers, organizations, and government agencies who all work on a daily basis to find missing children and prevent others from disappearing.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to take a little time this morning to talk about Social Security. I know our Nation has been engaged in Social Security reform discussions for about 2 years now kind of formally. But, informally, many have been talking about what we are going to do to ensure a safe, sound Social Security system in the future. 
   We all expected that we could work in a bipartisan manner during this Congress to be able to complete the immense task of saving and strengthening Social Security for the American people. 
   Unfortunately, President Clinton has failed to take leadership on this issue and has failed to present an honest plan to this Congress to address Social Security's rapid approaching crisis. 
   There is widespread reluctance to move forward on reform due to political considerations. Yet, if we keep delaying essential reform until after the ``next election''--it is always after the next election--we will never be able to complete our goal of ensuring retirement security for future generations of Americans. 
   Now, on the positive side, the debate has surely raised the public's awareness of their own retirement security shortcomings. It has brought attention to the Social Security crisis and has led to a variety of solutions to fix the system. 
   I believe this is a healthy debate, one that we must continue to encourage. I am sure that when our elected officials muster the political will to make some of those hard choices we face, the Nation will be ready to support those choices. 
   Regardless of when we actually consider Social Security reform, we must continue the job of educating Americans about the importance of savings and retirement planning. We must continue to debate the role of future Social Security benefits in our retirement security decisions. 
   That is why I am here. I rise today to introduce three pieces of legislation as first steps to save Social Security. To outline the bills, my first bill, very simply, would grant every current and future Social Security beneficiary a legal right to those Social Security benefits. 
   The second is a comprehensive plan to move Social Security from the current pay-as-you-go system to one that is a fully funded, personalized retirement system, to ensure a safe, sound, secure retirement program that maximizes benefits for the retiree. 
   The third bill would provide real information about the costs and the benefits under the current Social Security system. 
   Mr. President, each working American devotes his or her entire life to a job, or series of jobs, and pays hundreds of thousands of dollars in Social Security taxes into the retirement system. In fact, Social Security taxes are the largest tax that many families will ever pay, accounting for up to one-eighth of the total lifetime income that will go into Social Security. 
   Many people, including myself, believe that Social Security benefits are our ``earned right.'' We think that because we have paid Social Security taxes, we are legally entitled to receive Social Security benefits. But this ``earned right'' is nothing 
   but an illusion--an illusion created by politicians who call Social Security taxes ``contributions'' and make Social Security sound like it is a regular insurance program. 
   The truth is that the American people do not have any legal right to their Social Security benefits, though they pay Social Security taxes all of their lives. Their benefits are always at the mercy of the Government and politicians who can adjust them and can even spend them on unrelated Government programs. This fact--that Americans currently have no legal right to Social Security--was decided by the courts when the Social Security was just getting started. 
   Mr. President, it was back in 1937, less than 2 years after the creation of Social Security, that the Supreme Court decided in the case of Helvering v. Davis that Social Security was not an insurance program. 
   The court held:  
   The proceeds of both the employee and employer taxes are to be paid into the Treasury like any other internal revenue generally, and are not earmarked in any way.  
   So, basically, Social Security is just a tax, not a retirement system. 
   The Court also pointed out:  
   Congress did not improvise a judgment when it found that the award of old-age benefits would be conducive to the general welfare. The President's committee on economic security made an investigation and report ..... with the loss of savings inevitable in periods of idleness, the fate of workers over 65, when thrown out of work, is little less than desperate....... Moreover, laws of the separate States cannot deal with this effectively.......Only a power that is national can serve the interests of all.  
   What it meant was that Social Security was not and is not an insurance program at all, but a tax--a tax, pure and simple--that leaves retirement benefits to be actually determined by the political process--not the benefits of the plan, but the political process. 
   This decision was later confirmed in another important case, Fleming v. Nestor. In this case, the Supreme Court more expressly ruled that workers have no legally binding contractual rights to their Social Security benefits, and that those benefits can be cut or even eliminated at any time. 
   Mr. President, this is a very interesting and important case. Ephram Nestor was a Bulgarian immigrant who paid Social Security taxes from 1936 until he retired in 1955. He received a $55.60-per-month Social Security check during his retirement. But in 1956, Nestor was deported for having been a member of the Communist Party in the 1930s. His Social Security checks were stopped in accordance with the law. 
   Nestor sued the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, claiming that because he had paid Social Security taxes, he had a right to Social Security benefits. 
   The Supreme Court rejected his claim, clearly stating:  
   To engraft upon the Social Security system a concept of ``accrued property rights'' would deprive it of the flexibility and boldness in adjustment to ever changing conditions which it demands.  
   The Court also held:  
   It is apparent that the non-contractual interest of an employee covered by the [Social Security] Act cannot be soundly analogized to that of the holder of an annuity, whose right to benefits is bottomed on his contractual premium payments.  
   It strikes me that these Supreme Court decisions prove that if Social Security is considered more of a welfare program, there is no assurance that retirees will receive benefits now or in the future if they are judged unworthy, or if the IOUs owed to the Social Security Trust Funds are deemed unnecessary to repay. It also shows, contrary to common belief, that Social Security is not backed by the full faith and credit of the government and is not a government-guaranteed investment. I believe these decisions--which we rarely see referenced, for obvious reasons--are unfair and wrong, and must be corrected. 
   In my view, workers must have a full legal right to receive government-guaranteed Social Security benefits. The reason is simple: despite these court cases, I believe most people think that the federal government should provide benefits to the American people for their retirement, if those people have paid into the system. It's our moral and contractual duty to honor that commitment, and ensure the program is more of an insurance policy than a welfare program. Coming demographic changes will soon create huge cracks in the Social Security program--if the government fails to make the changes necessary to address the crisis ahead, it would be wrong to let current or future beneficiaries bear that burden. 
   As a first step to saving Social Security, legislation I am introducing today would grant every current and future Social Security beneficiary an ``earned right,'' or legal right, to their Social Security benefits plus an accurate inflation adjustment. 
   This could be achieved by requiring the government to issue U.S. Treasury-backed certificates specifying the level of guaranteed benefits. 
   Mr. President, this legislation, the Social Security Benefits Guarantee Act, is not at all complicated. All it does is to create an ``earned right'' to Social Security, which every American deserves and should be given in the first place. It shows that regardless of how we may reform the system in the  future, retirees will earn a return on the investment they make in the form of payroll taxes. 
   By granting Americans this legal right, we are taking away uncertainties resulting from the growing political debate. Social Security will no longer be subject to Washington's manipulation, and the IOUs will be repaid. Implementing my legislation would force Congress and the Administration to come up with an honest plan to save and strengthen the Social Security system. 
   But more importantly, it would put millions of current and future Social Security beneficiaries at ease, allowing them to sleep at night without fearing the loss or reduction of their retirement benefits. 
   Mr. President, once we have secured Social Security benefits, taking the difficult steps to reform the Social Security system will be easier. The current system has served us well until now. The changing demographics of our society makes it impossible for the system to survive without reform. I believe a fully-funded, market-based, personalized retirement system would give all workers full property rights to their retirement investment. 
   Not only could personal retirement account, or PRA, benefits be three to five times higher than current Social Security benefits, workers would actually own the money in their account and could pass the assets on to their children. It would be part of your estate, which today, as you know, Social Security does not transfer. Congress would no longer spend the surplus money. 
   That's the reason I am today re-introducing my legislation, the ``Personal Security and Wealth in Retirement Act.'' 
   Mr. President, Americans today are living longer and retiring earlier than ever before. American retirement security is supposedly built on a three-legged stool: Social Security, private pensions, and personal savings. These are the three cornerstones of a secure retirement. 
   Unfortunately, today these cornerstones have eroded. Without major repair, the stool will collapse, causing serious financial hardship for millions of Americans. 
   Most Americans rely increasingly on Social Security for their retirement income. Not everyone has a private pension and some are unable to save. Yet Social Security, upon which rests their hopes for a secure retirement, is headed for bankruptcy. 
   Benefits for 76 million baby boomers and future generations of retirees will not be there unless something is done soon. 
   I believe the best solution to our retirement crisis is to reform Social Security by moving it from a pay-as-you-go retirement system to a fully-funded, market based system. The legislation I am introducing today will do just that. 
   The first criticism you will hear is that a market-based retirement system is too risky. However, my plan would guarantee benefits for current and future beneficiaries, while retaining and expanding the current safety net under Social Security. 
   At the same time, workers would have the freedom to control their funds and resources for their own retirement security within certain safety and soundness parameters. Workers and their employers could divert 10 percent of a worker's income into personal retirement accounts. 
   In addition, workers could also contribute to personal retirement accounts they've established for their non-working children. 
   Let me focus on the proposed safety net provisions under my plan: One key component of my proposal is to ensure that a safety net will be there at all times for disadvantaged individuals. This can be done without government guarantees of investments or overly strict regulation of investment options. 
   Under this legislation, a safety net would be set up and would involve a guaranteed minimum benefit level: 150 percent of the poverty level. When a worker retires, if his or her PRA fails to provide the minimum retirement benefits for whatever reason the government would make up the difference. 
   So nobody would retire into poverty. They would retire at least with a minimum of 150 percent of the poverty level. 
   The same applies to survivor and disability benefits. If a worker dies or becomes disabled, and his or her PRA doesn't accumulate sufficient funds to provide minimum survivor and disability benefits, the government would match the shortfalls. 
   This simple safety net is necessary, and the minimum benefit would guarantee that no one in our society would be left impoverished in retirement, while still allowing workers to enjoy the freedom and prosperity achievable under a market-based retirement system. 
   This would operate in a manner similar to the federal government's Thrift Savings program, which includes safe investments and a far higher return than Social Security. If the system works for us, others should also be able to benefit from it. 
   Another feature of the fully funded retirement system I'm outlining could provide better survivor and disability benefits than the current Social Security system offers. 
   Under my plan, for instance, when a worker dies, his family would inherit all the funds accumulated in his PRA. 
   I use my father as an example. He died at the age of 61, and from Social Security received a check for $253 as a death benefit. But that was all. Under our system, all the money that you have paid in during a lifetime of working would be yours. And, if you happen to die early, it would then be a part of your estate and transferred to your heirs. The savings wouldn't disappear into the black hole of the Social Security trust funds, or become tangled in a survivors' benefit bureaucratic debate. 
   The system would also provide, besides the retirement savings, a survivors benefit package. 
   My plan requires the funds that manage PRAs to use part of their annual contribution or yield to buy life and disability insurance, supplementing their accumulated funds to at least match the promised Social Security survivors and disability benefits. 
   By requiring retirement funds to purchase life and disability insurance for everyone, all workers in each individual fund would be treated as a common pool for underwriting purposes. The insurance would be purchased as a group policy not by individual workers by investment firms or financial institutions, thus avoiding insurance policy underwriting discrimination while providing the largest amount of benefits at the lowest possible cost. 
   Mr. President, again, a major criticism of a market-based personal retirement account system is that it's inherently volatile, subject to the whims of investors and the market, exposing a worker's retirement income to unnecessary risks. 
   My plan specifically addresses this concern by requiring the approved investment firms and financial institutions that manage PRAs to have insurance against investment loss. 
   By approximating the role of the FDIC, we ensure that every PRA would generate a minimum rate of return of at least 2.5 percent, which is more than current Social Security benefits. 
   In fact, Social Security is paying less than 1 percent today, and for future generations it would actually be a negative rate of return. 
   Regardless of the ups and downs of the markets, workers would still do better under this system than under the current Social Security program. 
   This is another safety net built into my plan to give the American people peace of mind when it comes to their retirement investment. 
   To further reduce risks to a worker's PRA, my legislation also requires that rules, regulations, and restrictions similar to those governing IRAs would apply to personal retirement accounts. 
   PRAs must be properly structured and follow strict, sensible guidelines set forth by the independent federal board that will oversee the system. 
   In choosing qualified investment firms and financial institutions to manage the PRAs, the oversight board is responsible for examining the credibility and ability of these companies, and then approving them as PRA managers accordingly. 
   In other words, to put in place a very safe and sound retirement system, much like the FDIC is in banks. People are confident their savings is protected. This would be the same with their retirement accounts. They would be protected. This will generate much better returns, as much as three to five times more at retirement  than today's Social Security--three to fives times more benefits when you retire than under the current Social Security plan because personal retirement accounts, unlike Social Security, make real investments which produce new income and produce wealth. 
   That means improved benefits for everybody, including low-wage earners, without the redistribution of private income.

   Mr. GRAMS. The third bill I am introducing today deals with the flow of information related to an individual's Social Security contribution. 
   Most working Americans are poorly prepared for their retirement. That is because of a disturbing lack of information. Congress needs to help them better plan for retirement by providing useful and accurate information about the Social Security benefits they are going to receive. 
   In other words, let people know exactly what the system is, how much is in the trust fund, how much money they can expect to receive at retirement, and what will be the rate of return of their investment. 
   Americans currently receive Social Security information through the personal earnings and benefits estimate statements or the PEBES, provided by the Social Security Administration. However, a recent GAO report shows that the report, although useful, is actually incomplete and it is difficult for many Americans to understand exactly what is in the account for them at Social Security. 
   As a result, many workers, even those near retirement, continue to overestimate their likely Social Security benefits, which, bottom line, threatens their quality of life throughout their retirement years. 
   Social Security taxes are the largest tax that many families will ever pay. It will account for up to one-eighth of the total lifetime income they will make. Few Americans know the value or the yield of their investment, because the Government never tells them the whole truth about Social Security by providing them with this key information. Reliable information on Social Security is crucial to enable Americans to better understand the value of their Social Security investment and to help them determine exactly how much they should supplement their expected Social Security benefits with other savings in order to have a certain level of retirement security. 
   This is particularly important for some ethnic minorities, because research shows that African Americans have lower rates of return from Social Security. They get less back from the system than others who pay in. Low-income, single, African American males have a negative rate of return today. As I said, overall it is about a 1 percent rate of return. For many, it will be a negative rate of return. But for low-income, single, African American males today, they already have a negative rate of return on the money they pay into the system. 
   My bill would improve the reports by requiring the Social Security Administration to provide an estimate of the Social Security benefits a worker is going to receive in terms of inflation-adjusted dollars, as well as an estimated rate of return the worker is projected to receive from Social Security. 
   In real dollars, it means today if you are 20 years old, the report says when you retire you could expect to receive about $98,000 a year in retirement benefits. You say, that is great, 98,000 a year; but if you take in the inflation-adjusted amount throughout those 40 years in buying power, it would be less than $14,000 in today's money. 
   So you need to know exactly what you are going to get at retirement and what the buying power of those dollars is going to be 40 years from now so that you can make better plans on how you are going to plan for your retirement. 
   Given the crucial role of information about Social Security in retirement planning and the fact that, beginning this year, the statements from Social Security will be mailed annually to every eligible individual over 25, immediate improvement of these standards is imperative. These numbers are already going to be sent out, so this isn't an added cost, this isn't asking for a new program from the Government; this is saying that the report the Social Security Administration is going to send to every American over 25 needs to be more accurate than the information provided today. 
   Information will not solve all the problems we have with Social Security, but I think it will surely give working Americans some useful tools to help them better plan for retirement. 
   In closing, American workers labor mightily to put money aside for retirement. They should have full property rights to their money. They deserve the security of owning their retirement benefits and savings. My legislation gives American workers legal protection to their retirement savings. It will stop politicians from cutting their benefits to spend money in other unrelated programs out of our Social Security trust fund. It also allows American workers maximum freedom to better plan for their retirement by giving them more accurate information on their Social Security benefits. 
   In closing, retirement security is essential to millions of Americans and we must do everything we can to help them achieve that security and the peace of mind that will go along with it. 
   My legislation charts a course which I believe will lead us there.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the 1999 Supplemental Appropriations legislation. Let me make a few brief remarks explaining why I will vote against it. I do so reluctantly because some of this funding is necessary, such as the agriculture spending, and some is offset. I co-sponsored and strongly supported the Enzi amendment to fully offset spending in this bill. Since our colleagues on the other side of the aisle blocked this effort to be fiscally responsible, thereby giving their support to this spending of Social Security surplus funds, I cannot endorse this irresponsible spending. 
   The Concord Coalition, a bipartisan watchdog of fiscal policy, calls this bill a ``SAYGO'' bill, and SAYGO stands for spend-as-you-go. According to the Concord Coalition, ``Congress is using the emergency spending loophole to create a new budgetary concept--spend as you go (SAYGO). I fully agree with the Concord Coalition. Sadly, the term ``SAYGO'' has captured the essence of this legislation. 
   However, there is nothing new about this practice. Congress has repeatedly used this old trick on the American taxpayers as a way to expand government programs and escape budget disciplines. 
   Let me remind my colleagues about what happened last year. 
   As you recall, Mr. President, despite the rhetoric of President Clinton and Congress to use every penny of the budget surplus to save Social Security, last year, we spent nearly $30 billion of the Social Security surplus for alleged ``emergency spending.'' This was more than one third of the entire Social Security surplus for 1998. In last year's omnibus spending legislation alone, Congress spent $22 billion, and nearly $9.3 billion in regular appropriations was shifted into future budgets, a new  smoke-and-mirrors gimmick, since we are now hearing how impossible it will be to live within budget caps for FY 2000. No wonder! 
   In addition, few of these ``emergency spending'' items were true emergencies. Many of these dollars could have been included in the annual appropriations process. 
   Last year's irresponsible spending used up the Social Security surplus we were supposed to save, broke the statutory spending caps we promised to keep, and as a result made the caps even tighter for this year. 
   Clearly, that was a big mistake. That's why many of us believe we should end this practice before it becomes automatic and even more egregious in the future. In fact, that's why we passed this year's Budget Resolution with a new enforcement mechanism which allows any Senator to raise a point of order against non-defense emergency designations in an appropriations conference report. In my judgment, this should include defense as well. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, we are repeating the same mistake in the 1999 Supplemental Appropriations bill. It includes $15 billion of spending with an estimate of only $2.5 billion actually outlayed this fiscal year. So it is quite obvious this spending is a way to relieve some of the pressure on the FY 2000 spending caps. If the spending caps need to be lifted, let's vote on that up front, not this way. I would not vote to lift the caps anyway, but it is a more responsible way of handling what some believe is a budget crisis. 
   The legislation was originally intended to provide disaster relief to Central America and was later expanded to cover our military action in Kosovo, which are necessary and important spending. Even the agriculture spending is necessary. But conferees also added significant funding that is not emergency-related and was not requested by the President in the conference report. 
   The conference report for this year's emergency spending bill includes $15 billion with only $1.9 billion offset. This means Congress is spending $13 billion of the Social Security surplus, which is over 10 percent of this year's Social Security surplus. 
   The President requested $5.5 billion for military operations in Kosovo and Southwest Asia. But the conferees have doubled that amount. As a result, American taxpayers now have to pay $10.9 billion additional for defense, much of which should be considered in FY 2000 appropriations and was not an emergency. These add-ons 
   include $1.84 billion for military pay and pension increases and $2.25 billion for spare parts, depot maintenance and readiness training. 
   I believe we must allocate sufficient resources to ensure our national security and I am concerned about readiness. We must provide adequate funding to maintain our military operations and support our troops in Kosovo and elsewhere. However, I don't believe we can use our immediate needs as a vehicle for non-emergency defense spending. General defense readiness needs, such as a military pay raise and a pension benefits increase, is not an emergency and should be handled through the normal budget, authorization and appropriations process. Again, if the spending cap is a problem, we should deal with that problem head on, not by this back-door approach. 
   Further, this conference report is a Christmas tree that's loaded not with ornaments, but with plenty of non-emergency spending items under the guise of an emergency, totaling over $200 million. Even some emergency related funding is far above what is needed and requested. For example, the President requested $370 million funding for FEMA, but the conference report has almost tripled that amount. This is not right. Attached is a copy of Senator MCCAIN's list on the objectionable provisions contained in this conference report. 
   My biggest concern is that we have promised the American people we will save every penny of the Social Security surplus exclusively for Social Security. In the recently-passed budget resolution we included a provision to lock in $1.8 trillion of the Social Security surplus to save and strengthen Social Security. We are continuing to pursue Social Security lockbox legislation to prohibit Washington from continuing to loot the Social Security surplus for unrelated government spending. Now we are backing off from that promise, claiming we will make it up next year. I've heard that before. I believe this will damage our credibility and accountability with the American people, as well as further endanger our already damaged Social Security system. 
   As I mentioned earlier, there are some good provisions I strongly support in this bill. Frankly, some of the provisions and funding will help my own state of Minnesota. But the non-emergency spending which is not offset overshadows these good provisions. I cannot in good conscience vote for this legislation. 
   Finally, the Concord Coalition challenges us, I quote: ``Fiscally responsible Members of both parties should put an end to SAY-GO by rejecting this emergency supplemental.'' They are right. Above all we must maintain the fiscal discipline and responsibility we promised the American people. We must keep our commitment to protect Social Security. I hope my colleagues will reject this measure.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator ENZI's bill to offset all of the nonemergency funding in the supplemental with an across the board cut in non-defense discretionary accounts. 
   As one who vigorously opposed the omnibus appropriations bill of last year which resulted in spending far above our commitments, I was surprised that here we have yet another attempt to circumvent our budget principles--and to spend part of the Social Security surplus nearly all of us pledged to devote only to Social Security. 
   While there are true emergencies in the supplemental I support, such as the agriculture spending and funds directly related to our Kosovo operation, I strongly oppose inclusion of other defense spending that clearly should be considered in the normal appropriations process. And I oppose beefing up the FEMA budget three times over the President's request as well. What all of this is about is just a gimmick to claim we are not breaking the caps as we proceed into the fiscal year 2000 appropriations process by providing some funding now. The last estimate I saw indicated only $2.5 billion of this funding will be outlayed in this fiscal year. So--why are we appropriating $15 billion? 
   Mr. President, I have no objection to this additional spending--if we pay for it. Senator ENZI's legislation, which I have cosponsored does pay for it. This is the responsible thing to do, since most of this bill--over $13 billion is not emergency spending. 
   Those who believe in integrity of our budget process and in the need to preserve Social Security will vote for this bill.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of all those who serve their fellow citizens through their active participation in the nation's emergency care system to make my remarks on the introduction of S. 9-1-1, the ``Emergency Medical Services Act of 1999.'' 
   Mr. President, as a Senator who is deeply concerned about the every-expanding size and scope of the federal government, I've long believed Washington is too big, too clumsy and too removed to deal effectively with many of the issues in which it already meddles. However, I also believe there's an overriding public health interest in ensuring a viable and seamless EMS system across the country. By designating this week as national EMS Week, our nation recognizes those individuals who make the EMS system work. 
   There's no more appropriate time to reaffirm our commitment to EMS by addressing some of the problems the system is presented with daily. 
   I've often said that Congress has a tendency to wait until there's a crisis before it acts, but Congress cannot wait until there's a crisis in the EMS system before we take steps to improve it. There's simply too much at stake. 
   Whether we realize it or not, we all depend on and expect the constant readiness of emergency medical services. To ensure that readiness, we need to make efforts to secure the stability of the system. This has been my focus in drafting the EMSEA. 
   The most important thing we can do to maintain the vitality of the EMS system is to compel the government to reimburse for the services it says it will pay for under Medicare. 
   In the meetings I've had with ambulance providers, emergency medical technicians, emergency physicians, nurses, and other EMS-related personnel, their most common request is to base reimbursement on a ``prudent layperson'' standard, rather than the ultimate diagnosis reached in the emergency room. 
   While the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 [BBA] contained a provision basing reimbursement for emergency room services on the prudent layperson standard, I find it troubling HCFA refuses to include ambulance transportation in its regulations as a service covered by the patient protections enacted as part of Medicare Plus Choice. I also believe it is unacceptable that beneficiaries participating in fee-for-service are not granted the protections afforded to those in Medicare Plus Choice. 
   There has been a great debate in the Senate for the last year regarding protections for consumers against HMOs. Many of my colleagues would be startled to learn of the treatment many seniors have experienced at the hands of their own government through the Medicare fee-for-service program. The federal government would do better to lead by example rather than usurping powers from state insurance commissioners by imposing federal mandates on health insurance plans already governed by the states. 
   To illustrate how prevalent the problem of the federal government denying needed care to Medicare beneficiaries is, I want to share with you a case my staff worked on relating to Medicare reimbursement for ambulance services. I mentioned this case last year, but it is worth repeating. Please keep in mind that this is the fee-for-service Medicare program. 
   In 1994, Andrew Bernecker of Braham, Minnesota was mowing with a power scythe and tractor when he fell. The rotating blades of the scythe severely cut his upper arm. Mr. Bernecker tried to walk toward his home but was too faint from the blood loss, so he crawled the rest of the way. Afraid that his wife, who was 86 years old at the time, would panic--or worse, have a heart attack--he crawled to the pump and washed as much blood and dirt off as he could. His wife saw him and immediately called 911 for an ambulance. 
   He was rushed to the hospital where Mr. Bernecker ultimately spent some time in the intensive care unit and had orthopedic surgery. A tragic story. 
   In response to the bills submitted to Medicare, the government sent this reply with respect to the ambulance billing: ``Medicare Regulations Provide that certain conditions must be met in order for ambulance services to be covered. Medicare pays for ambulance services only when the use of any other method of transportation would endanger your health.'' The government denied payment, claiming the ambulance wasn't medically necessary. 
   Apparently, Medicare believed the man's wife--who was, remember, 86 years old--should have been able to drive him to the hospital for treatment. Mr. and Mrs. Bernecker appealed, but were denied and began paying what they could afford each month for the ambulance bill. 
   After several years of paying $20 a month, the Berneckers finally paid off the ambulance bill. Medicare later reopened the case and reimbursed the Berneckers, but unfortunately, Mr. Bernecker is no longer with us. 
   I have a few more examples I'd like to share with my colleagues to assure them this is not an isolated incident. In fact, I encourage all of my colleagues to meet and speak 
   with their EMS providers to see first-hand how the lack of consistent reimbursement policy impacts their ability to provide services. This one provision of the Emergency Medical Services Efficiency Act will bring fairness and clarity for both the beneficiary and the EMS provider trying to help those in need. 
   In Austin, Minnesota, a 66-year-old male was found in a shopping center parking lot slumped over the steering column of his car. The car was in drive, up against a light pole with the wheels spinning and the tread burning off the tires. An Austin policeman at the scene requested an ambulance and the driver was transported to the emergency room. Ambulance transportation reimbursement was denied based on the assumption that the driver could have used other means to get to the emergency room. Apparently, since he was already in the car, he was supposed to drive himself to the hospital despite being unresponsive. 
   Another case in Minnesota involved a 74-year-old male who was complaining  to his family about an upset stomach when he collapsed. The frightened family began CPR and summoned an ambulance via 9-1-1. The city's fire department was the first on scene and applied an automatic external defibrillator, which advised against shock. Paramedics arrived and continued CPR en route to the emergency room. The patient ultimately died of cardiac arrest. Again, Medicare fee-for-service denied payment for the ambulance because it was deemed unnecessary. 
   Finally, Mr. President, a 74-year-old female complained of flu-like symptoms. Her family checked on her and found she was acting confused and strange. They summoned emergency medical services. Paramedics arrived to find the woman awake but confused as to time and events. They discovered she had a history of cardiac disease and diabetes. The paramedics tested her blood-sugar level and found it below 40. For those of you unfamiliar with diabetes, a blood sugar level below 70 is dangerous and could lead to seizure. But once again, Medicare denied payment. 
   Mr. President, I have a stack of actual run tickets from EMS providers in Minnesota, with names and other identifiers deleted, all demonstrating what a problem this is for Medicare beneficiaries and EMS providers. Again, I urge all of my colleagues to meet with their EMS providers and ask how these denials affect them. 
   Title II of the Emergency Medical Services Efficiency Act creates a Federal Commission on Emergency Medical Services which will make recommendations and provide input on how federal regulatory actions affect all types of EMS providers. 
   EMS needs a seat at the table when health care and other regulatory policy is made. Few things are more frustrating for ambulance services than trying to navigate and comply with the tangled mess of laws and regulations from the federal level on down, only to receive either a reimbursement that doesn't cover the costs of providing the service or a flat denial of payment. 
   Mr. President, I came across this chart two years ago which demonstrates how a Medicare claim moves from submittal to payment, denial, or write-off by the ambulance provider. Look at this chart and tell me how a rural ambulance provider who depends on volunteers has the manpower or expertise to navigate this mess. And, in the event it is navigated successfully, ambulance services are regularly reimbursed at a level that doesn't even cover their costs. 
   Mr. President, I have heard complaints from many individuals about the cost of ambulance care. In fact, some within this very body criticize ambulance providers for the high prices they charge for their services. While I do not doubt there are cases of abuse, I know for a fact an overwhelming majority of EMTs, Paramedics, Emergency Nurses and EMS providers are trying to provide the best possible care for their patients at a reasonable price. 
   Let's talk about how much it costs to run just one ambulance. There's the cost of the dispatcher who remains on the line to give pre-arrival assistance. The ambulance itself, which costs from $85,000 to $100,000. The radios, beepers, and cellular telephones used to communicate between the dispatcher, ambulance, and hospital. The supplies and equipment in the ambulance, including everything from defibrillators to bandages. The two Emergency Medical Technicians or Paramedics who both drive the ambulance and provide care to the patient. The vehicle repair, maintenance, and insurance costs. The liability insurance for the paramedics. And the list goes on. 
   Yes, the costs can be high, but it's clear to me that, with the uncertainty ambulance providers face out in the field each day, they need to be prepared for very type of injury or condition. Mr. President, that's expensive. 
   I'm convinced those who complain about the high costs of emergency care would be the first to complain if the ambulance that arrived to care for them in an emergency didn't have the life-saving equipment needed for treatment. 
   Let's be honest with ourselves: we want the quickest and best service when we face an emergency--and that costs money. 
   Mr. President, many of our political debates in Washington center around how to better prepare for the 21st century. I've always supported research and efforts to expand the limits of technology and continue to believe technological innovations and advances in biomedical and basic scientific research hold tremendous promise. 
   Under the new EMSEA, federal grant programs will be clarified to ensure EMS agencies are eligible for programs that relate to highway safety, rural development, and tele-health technology. 
   Emergency Medical Services have come a long way since the first ambulance services began in Cleveland and New York City during the 1860s. 
   Indeed, the scientific and technological advances have created a new practice of medicine in two short decades, and have dramatically improved the prospects of surviving serious trauma. There's reason to believe further advances will have equally meaningful results. 
   Innovations like tele-health technology may soon allow EMTs, nurses, and paramedics to perform more sophisticated procedures under a physician's supervision via real-time, ambulance-mounted monitors and cameras networked to emergency departments in specific service areas. By not considering EMS agencies for federal grant dollars, we may cause significant delays in the application of current technologies. That would be a mistake. 
   In August of 1996, the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration and the Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau issued a report, ``Emergency Medical Services: Agenda for the Future.'' The report outlined specific ways EMS can be improved, and one of the stated goals was the authorization of a ``lead federal agency.'' 
   After consultation with those in the EMS field throughout the country, I believe the most appropriate action is to take our time and get it right by conducting a study to determine which current or new office would best coordinate federal EMS efforts. 
   Those are the major provisions of the legislation I introduce today. 
   Mr. President, in 1995, there were approximately 100 million visits to emergency 
   departments across this nation. Roughly 20 percent of those visits started with a call for an ambulance. Each one of those calls is important, especially to those seeking assistance and to the responding EMS personnel. While EMS represents a small portion of health care spending overall, it is critically important. It serves as the access point for the sickest among us and it would be tragic for Congress to deny its role in improving the system. 
   Over the past several years, I've been privileged to get to know the men and women who dedicate their talents to serving others in an emergency. 
   The nation owes a great deal to the EMS personnel who have dedicated themselves to their profession because they care about people and want to help those who are suffering. Nobody gets rich as a professional paramedic, and there's no monetary compensation at all as a volunteer. The field of emergency medical services presents many challenges--but offers the reward of knowing you helped someone in need of assistance. 
   Every year, the American Ambulance Association recognizes EMS personnel across the country for their contributions to the profession, and bestows upon them the Stars of Life Award. 
   This year, 94 individuals have been chosen by their peers to be honored for demonstrating exceptional kindness and selflessness in performing their duties. 
   Mr. President, Minnesota suffered a tremendous loss this year. On January 14, while extricating a victim of an automobile accident, two EMTs were hit by a car. Brenda HagE, an EMT and Registered Nurse, was transported in traumatic arrest to a nearby hospital where she was pronounced dead. Ms. HagE is survived by her husband Darby and two children. 
   I ask that the Senate observe a moment of silence for Ms. HagE and all EMS personnel who have died in the line of duty. 
   Mr. President, I've talked with many professional EMTs, paramedics, and emergency nurses, and most tell me they wouldn't think of doing anything else for their chosen career. Similarly, volunteer EMS personnel tell me of the indescribable satisfaction they feel when they help those in their community get the care they need.  
   So, in honoring them during this National EMS Week, I can think of no better way to recognize their service than through legislation that will help them help others. 
   I ask my colleagues to support them by supporting S. 9-1-1, the ``Emergency Medical Services Act.''

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to join many of my colleagues this morning in saying just how grateful I am that I had the chance to work with ``the Admiral.'' When I call Bud Nance ``the Admiral,'' I do so on purpose, because when a Senator referred to ``the Admiral,'' of course you never had to question which one. We all knew that Member was talking about--of course, Admiral Nance. 
   The Admiral was a great man, a true American hero. He survived over 150 Japanese suicide bomber attacks during World War II. He became a Navy test pilot, which was dangerous work. In one of the 10-men units in which he served, five pilots died in crashes. So we know he was not only brave but also blessed. 
   Later he commanded the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Forrestal and served as deputy assistant to the President for national security affairs under Ronald Reagan. 
   Chairman HELMS and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee benefited from his intense patriotism and vast experience. We are all very lucky that he was willing to serve his country in this way, continuing his lifelong commitment to the defense of our Nation's interests. 
   Let me say something else about the Admiral. He was a modest man, a very simple man, and he certainly would not  want all of this fuss about his accomplishments over a very long life. But Admiral Nance was a Navy man and, of course, loved to tell stories. In his memory, I want to relate an anecdote about the Admiral which reflects his straightforward nature and, above all, his sense of humor. 
   This happened before my time in the Senate, but it is one of those stories that gets repeated by members of the Foreign Relations Committee. I share it with everyone today because if any of you did not have the pleasure of knowing Bud Nance, you will have a better understanding of why he was so beloved by everybody with whom he worked. 
   It occurred in the summer of 1992 when Admiral Nance was the minority staff director of the Foreign Relations Committee and he had requested a document from AID on funds for Nicaragua. The answer the Admiral got from AID was not in English with dollar amounts, but rather it came in Spanish with amounts in cordobas. 
   So the Admiral wrote back to AID saying he had three staff members who were Spanish speakers, but they were all busy, and since English was obviously not AID's official language, he wanted all communication from AID to the committee to be either in Russian or Hebrew during the month of August. But--here is the real kicker--the Admiral sent his response to AID through the proper channels on Foreign Relations Committee stationery, it was all very proper and official looking, except for one thing: He had a member of his staff draft it up in Hebrew. And that is the truth. I have a copy of the letter right here. 
   By the way, the only bit of English was, of course, his signature at the bottom of the letter: ``James W. Nance.'' According to the Admiral, he never heard back from AID on that matter, but he never received another foreign-language document without a translation as well. 
   So again, Mr. President, this is not just a time to mourn our loss, but I believe very strongly it is a time to celebrate the Admiral's life. He will be missed, but he will not be forgotten. 
   Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, we are all horrified by the human suffering that we are seeing every day as ethnic Albanians are being forced to flee Kosovo. The scope of this tragedy is overwhelming. Many of the refugees have not only lost their homes and other material possessions--they have been separated from their families and stripped of their identities, as documents were stolen and destroyed. While NATO and the United Nations are trying to manage the refugee crisis, there have been glaring shortcomings in their capacity to help refugees to be reunited with loved ones. 
   I am pleased the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is looking to the private sector for assistance, and that the private sector is generously contributing equipment, funds, and expertise to help ease this horrible situation. UNHCR currently does not have the technological capability to furnish a registration system which could log and issue identification papers to over 400,000 displaced Kosovars who have taken refuge in Albania. So Microsoft, Hewlett-Packard, Compaq, Securit World Ltd, and ScreenCheck B.V., have offered to provide a registration system that will facilitate the distribution of relief supplies and assist in the reunification of family members. Clearly, this effort will make a substantial difference in helping the refugees in Albania to rebuild their lives. While we automatically rely on government agencies to respond to such a crisis, it is encouraging to see companies step up to the plate and volunteer assistance they can provide faster and more efficiently than the public sector. This kind of private sector involvement should serve as an example for other companies to follow.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor those police officers who devotedly and selflessly work to protect and serve the public on a daily basis. I also pay special tribute to those men and women who have given their lives in the line of duty. 
   According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation data, 138 law enforcement officers lost their lives while protecting our communities across America in 1998. Of this total, 61 law enforcement officers were slain in the line of duty. Our Capitol community was tragically affected last July when Capitol Police Officer Jacob Chestnut and Special Agent John Gibson were mortally wounded while they upheld their sworn duty to protect visitors, staff and Members of Congress. 
   All Americans should keep alive the memory of these two brave and heroic men, and recognize the contributions of the countless other law enforcement officers who have either been slain or disabled while performing their duties. For these reasons I am a proud cosponsor of S. Res. 22, which designates May 15, 1999, as ``National Peace Officers Memorial Day.'' 
   Mr. President, during this week of poignant ceremonies, Minnesota remembers Corporal Timothy Bowe of the Minnesota State Patrol who was murdered while assisting the Chisago County Sheriff Department on June 7, 1997. Last year, Corporal Bowe's name was added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Corporal Bowe was a devoted husband, father, trooper, and friend. More importantly, Corporal Timothy Bowe was a true Minnesota hero. This week, Corporal Bowe's name will be joined on the memorial by 155 other law enforcement officers who were killed in the line of duty. 
   Sadly, in our society today, unless we are personally affected by violence or disorder, we often do not realize the dedication of our law enforcement officers, and the sacrifices they make to keep our communities safe. ``National Police Week'' is an important time for all Americans to recognize the role law enforcement officers play in safeguarding the rights and freedoms we all enjoy daily and give thanks for their countless hours of service. 
   Mr. President, we owe a debt of gratitude not only to the slain officers who served their communities so courageously by preserving law and order, but also to their families, who have lost a spouse, parent or child. Our law enforcement officers are heroes and we must never forget their contributions and sacrifices--during ``National Police Week,'' they are well remembered.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I proudly rise today to honor and celebrate my home State of Minnesota's 141st year of statehood. On this date in 1858, Congress admitted Minnesota into the Union as the thirty-second State. 
   Let me begin by saying that the name ``Minnesota'' comes from two Sioux Indian words meaning sky-tinted waters. Now Mr. President, if you have ever been to Minnesota you will agree that my State was properly named. These ``sky-tinted waters'' are representative of Minnesota's many lakes (in excess of 12,000) and the numerous rivers and streams which run throughout the State. In fact, Minnesota has more shoreline than California, Florida and Hawaii combined! 
   Several million Minnesotans and out-of-state visitors take advantage of these waters every year to swim, water ski, boat, canoe, or fish. This Saturday, May 15, represents one of my home State's most treasured yearly experiences, the fishing opener. I have always been impressed with the spirit the opener brings out and the way it joins our State and visitors in a common interest. Out on the lake, people aren't too concerned with the difficulties of everyday life. Once a fishing rod is nestled tightly in hand, Minnesotans tend to forget the phone, the fax, or the other annoyances that consume so much of our lives today. The experience re-connects us to a much simpler time. 
   In addition to Minnesota's water resources, one-third of the State is covered with forests. Aspen, balsam fir, pine, spruce, and white birch grow in the northern part of the State, whereas groves of ash, black walnut, elm, maple and oak grow in the south. These forests form the centerpiece of 66 State parks, 55 State forests, one national park, and two national forests, all of which provide outdoor enthusiasts with scenic hiking, camping, and other outdoor activities on a year-round basis. 
   Mr. President, in addition to our beautiful lakes, streams, forests, and parks, Minnesota has much more to offer. My State produces 75 percent of the nation's iron ore which covers a section of northern Minnesota rightly known as the ``Iron Range.'' There are also large deposits of granite found near St. Cloud and along the upper Mississippi River. I am proud to say that over 6,000 tons of Minnesota granite was used to make the walls and floor for the Franklin Delano Roosevelt memorial here in Washington, D.C. 
   The fertile soil has been key to Minnesota's overall economy, providing  suitable farmland that covers a little more than half the State. Agriculture is Minnesota's largest industry, generating over $22 billion in goods and services per year. One of every four Minnesota jobs is tied in some way to agriculture, and 25 percent of our overall economy is dependent upon farmers and agri-business. Today Minnesota has approximately 87,000 family farms. Even though times are difficult for many of these family farmers, Minnesota depends upon their successful recovery. 
   Furthermore, Minnesota is home to some of the world's leading job providers--including 3M, Pillsbury, Honeywell, and Cargill, to name a few. Minnesota is also known for its achievements in the area of health care. It is a leader in the medical device industry and home to one of the world's premier health care facilities, the Mayo Clinic in Rochester. 
   Minnesota is also the birthplace of many great innovations which have become part of our American culture, such as Cellophane Transparent Tape, Post-it Notes, and the world's first enclosed mall located at Southdale Shopping Center in Edina. Today we have the Mall of America in Bloomington which is one of the world's largest enclosed malls and most popular tourist destinations. Among other notable Minnesota facts, we are the source of the Mississippi River, home to the busiest freshwater port in North America (which also happens to be the farthest inland ocean port in the United States), and Minnesota reaches the furthest north of the 48-continental States. 
   Mr. President, I hope I have managed to convey the pride I have for my state and its people, and in doing so, have perhaps encouraged others to visit. As a U.S. Senator from Minnesota, I wanted to express the honor I feel in representing the people of my State, which I believe is one of the premier States in the greatest country on Earth.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as we wrap up this work day here in the Senate, I want to take a little time to talk about a subject that is near and dear to everybody's heart, and, of course, that is taxes. 
   Most Americans believe they pay too much in taxes. And you know, they are right. 
   One of the biggest and best indicators of how exhausting the tax burden has become is the annual arrival of what we call Tax Freedom Day, and that is the day on which Americans stop working just to pay their State, Federal, and local taxes and actually begin working and keeping their earnings for themselves and their families. 
   This year, Americans had to wait until today, May 11, before Tax Freedom Day actually arrived. At least 132 days into the year, this is the latest arrival of Tax Freedom Day ever. 
   As a sign of just how far and fast taxes have come, in 1950, Americans marked Tax Freedom Day on April 3. 
   For residents in my home State of Minnesota, the situation is even more troubling because this year's Tax Freedom Day has been pushed forward to May 21, nearly 2 weeks later than the rest of the country. 
   That ranks Minnesota third in the Nation; only in New York and Connecticut do taxpayers have to wait even longer to begin keeping their own money. 
   Tax Freedom Day, as calculated by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, reveals an ever-increasing tax burden over the past 25 years. And the single most potent explanation for America's late Tax Freedom Day is our seriously flawed tax system. 
   Our tax system is unfair, it is complicated, and it is designed to squeeze more money out of the wallets of working Americans to expand Government. 
   Since 1993, for instance, Federal taxes have increased by 54 percent. Can you imagine that? Since 1993, Federal taxes have increased 54 percent, which for the average taxpayer translates into a $2,000 per year increase in the amount of taxes they pay to the Federal Government. That is $2,000 a year more today than just 6 years ago was paid to the Federal Government by the average taxpayer. As a result, Americans today have the largest tax burden ever in history, including World War II, and it is still growing. 
   Federal taxes now consume on average about 21 percent of our national income, compared to just over 18 percent in 1992. So again, 3 percent more of this country's GDP goes to taxes than it did just 6 years ago. On average, every American--each and every American--is paying $10,298 this year in Federal, State and local taxes. On average, each American is paying $10,298 this year to support Government. 
   A typical family now pays more of its income in total taxes than it spends on food, clothing, transportation, and housing combined. More and more middle income families are being pushed into higher tax brackets every year. 
   Here is an example of the devastating ``middle class tax squeeze.'' There are more than 20 million American workers today with annual earnings between $30,000 and $50,000. Before 1993, they paid income taxes at the 15 percent tax rate. But most of them have now been pushed into the 28 percent tax bracket, and that is due to inflation and economic growth. Worse still, they have to pay the 28 percent federal income tax rate on top of a 15.3 percent payroll tax. 
   This adds up, for average Americans making between $30,000 and $50,000, to a tax rate of 43 percent to the Federal Government, and that is without counting State, local, and other taxes. So for many Americans, making between $30,000 and $50,000 a year, they are paying about 50 percent of their income to support Government. So any gains the taxpayers might have made in wages have been snatched away by Washington in the form of a bigger tax bite. This is the most important reason for the late arrival of Tax Freedom Day. 
   People today work hard and then are penalized for their work. With punitive taxes, Washington makes the American dream of working hard for a better life more difficult, and even for some, it makes it impossible. 
   The only way we can effectively stop this and push back Tax Freedom Day is to terminate the Tax Code and replace it with one that promotes freedom and economic opportunity. We must repeal the 16th amendment and abolish the IRS. 
   We must create a new tax system that is fair, simple, and friendly to the taxpayers--when they no longer need to file a tax return with the IRS, and when their families' finances aren't revealed to Government bureaucrats, 
   and when they are no longer penalized for getting or staying married--or for dying, for that matter--when everyone pays the same tax rate without any loopholes for any special interest groups, and when hidden taxes are eliminated and everyone can easily understand the tax laws. And finally, there will be no more IRS audits and abuse--because, again, we need to pull out the IRS by the roots to abolish the IRS entirely. 
   Pending fundamental tax reforms, Congress must provide meaningful tax relief to help alleviate the tax burden on working Americans. 
   That is why the recently-passed budget resolution reserves nearly $800 billion of the non-Social Security surplus over the next 10 years earmarking it for tax relief. 
   This proves that this Congress is committed to providing meaningful tax relief in 1999, while protecting Social Security and Medicare, reducing the national debt, and funding important national priorities. 
   This year's budget also includes my amendment calling on the Congress to place a priority on middle income tax relief by returning tax overpayments to those from whom it was taken. 
   It includes options for tax relief, such as a broad-based tax cut, marriage penalty relief, retirement savings incentives, death tax relief, health care-related tax relief, and education-related tax relief. If enacted, this will be the largest tax relief since the Reagan tax cuts of the 1980s. 
   Americans are frustrated by the late arrival of Tax Freedom Day. They are worried about their future economic security. And they also want the opportunity to put their dollars to work supporting their families, not supporting the Government. 
   We owe it to the American taxpayer to work together to fix the system through fundamental tax reform. We can do this through turning Tax Freedom Day from a day of disappointment into a day finally worth celebrating. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
   I rise in strong support of the Shelby amendment and urge the Senate to approve this amendment today. I say this with utmost respect for my committee chairman, Senator PHIL GRAMM. As you know, I support PHIL GRAMM and we agree on so many issues across the board, but this is one time when I have to disagree with my chairman. As I say, even his lovely wife Wendy disagrees with Senator PHIL GRAMM on a few issues. I hope he realizes the respect I have for him and his arguments on this amendment, but I feel that I have to support this. 
   As a Senator who worked on a bipartisan basis last year with Senator REED of Rhode Island to draft a compromise operating subsidiary amendment, I have invested a great deal of time studying the pluses and minuses of this option. I have come to the conclusion that it is appropriate for national banks to conduct full financial activities, with the exception of insurance underwriting and real estate development in the operating subsidiary. 
   This amendment preserves corporate flexibility by allowing subsidiaries of well-capitalized and well-managed national banks to conduct many of the same activities--such as securities underwriting and merchant banking--as bank holding companies and foreign bank subsidiaries. 
   I would like to note that insurance underwriting and real estate development are not permitted in the subsidiary. 
   Although some have claimed that the subsidiary approach could lead to a competitive advantage for banks, the amendment prevents competitive advantages by imposing the same prerequisites for conducting new financial  activities on national banks as are placed on bank holding companies. 
   The subsidiary also is safer for national banks. First, the amendment includes a number of appropriate safety and soundness ``firewalls'' to ensure that the subsidiary remains an asset to--and not a liability of--the bank. 
   These firewalls include: one, requiring that capital invested in the subsidiary be deducted from the capital of the bank and that the bank remains well-capitalized after the deduction; two, prohibiting the consolidation of assets of the subsidiary and the bank; three, limiting the investment the bank may make in the subsidiary to the same amount that the bank could ``upstream'' to holding company affiliates by way of dividends; four, requiring the bank to maintain procedures for identifying and managing financial and operational risks posed by the subsidiary; five, requiring the bank to maintain--and regulators to ensure--a separate corporate identity and separate legal status from the subsidiary; and six, imposing the lending restrictions found in Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit from the bank to the subsidiary--total extensions of credit to any one subsidiary may not exceed 10 percent of the bank's capital and total extensions of credit to all subsidiaries may not exceed 20 percent of the bank's capital. 
   The operating subsidiary approach adds another safety and soundness element because the subsidiary could be used as an asset to protect the taxpayer if the bank runs into trouble.

   Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I want to take time today to first outline my support for the bill overall, and then also to talk a little bit about the current pending business, and that is the question concerning CRA. 
   As a member of the Senate Banking Committee, I rise in strong support of S. 900, the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, and urge my colleagues to take the committee's recommendation to pass this very important piece of legislation. 
   The Glass-Steagall Act--which prohibits commercial banks from affiliating with companies predominantly engaged in the securities busines--was passed at a different point in time and in a dramatically different economy. In response to the numerous commercial bank failures during the depression, the Glass-Steagall Act was enacted as part of President Roosevelt's economic recovery package. One premise leading to the law which has since been proven incorrect, by the way--was that commercial banks which were involved in securities underwriting failed at a higher rate than other banks due to losses in their securities business when Wall Street collapsed. Subsequent studies have proven that these very same banks actually fared better than other banks which had not diversified by offering broad securities products. Unfortunately, as with most of the flawed legislation on our books, the law was not sunset and has hindered America's financial institutions--banks and securities firms alike--since its enactment in the 1930s. 
   Although commercial banks in recent years have been able to conduct limited securities underwriting activities through Section 20 affiliates, S. 900 appropriately repeals the Glass-Steagall prohibitions on common ownership of commercial banks and securities firms and will allow these activities to be conducted without the arbitrary restrictions which govern these activities currently. 
   The Bank Holding Company Act also includes similar restrictions in Section 4(c)(8) which have prevented safe, sound, and well managed commercial banks from affiliating with insurance companies. Although insurance is unquestionably a financial product, banks have been prohibited from underwriting insurance, and insurance companies have been restricted from fully entering the business of banking. This bill removes the Bank Holding Company Act restrictions and it preempts State laws which prohibit these affiliations. 
   Although there always seems to be broad agreement that the time for reform is now, every recent effort has failed because the devil has been in the details of how to regulate the new entities. S. 900 successfully incorporates a wide array of negotiated agreements between the interested industries to provide functional regulation--meaning regulation by product and not by the entity offering it. Under the bill's regulatory structure, banking products will be regulated by bank regulators, securities activities will be regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and insurance will continue to be regulated by State insurance commissioners. This system will ensure that the experts in each area will oversee the activities to protect the consumer and to ensure that all parties are playing on a level playing field. 
   As part of this system of functional regulation, the bill retains the current system of State regulation of insurance. While I strongly support State regulation of insurance, I believe there is a role for some Federal oversight. I believe that because Congress delegates the authority to regulate the insurance activities of national banks, it also has the responsibility to ensure that State regulation does not result in bloated, burdensome, and unresponsive regulation. Also, I will be holding hearings this year in the Securities Subcommittee to explore where any flaws exist and will work hard to address them with all of the interested parties.  
   Another major area of functional regulation contained in S. 900 is the regulation of securities activities. The bill provides a workable compromise which eliminates the bank's existing broker-dealer exemption and substitutes a system of targeted exemptions which protect traditional banking products while requiring other securities activities to be offered by a broker-dealer. Also, the bill requires the SEC and the Federal Reserve Board to work together to determine how future products will be regulated. 
   There has been some talk around Washington that an amendment may be offered to delete these bank exemptions and give the SEC complete authority to determine how future products will be regulated. 
   Let me be clear that if this amendment is offered, it is done so for only one reason--and that would be to kill the bill. If the bank exemptions are eliminated and traditional activities, such as trust activities, are not statutorily protected, the entire banking industry will unite against this bill. Again, I urge my colleagues to oppose any amendments which significantly alter the bill's securities provisions. 
   When repealing current law affiliation restrictions, the question is also raised about what activities the new broader bank holding companies will be able to conduct. The bill contains a standard--financial in nature--by which all activities of a bank holding company must comply. This provision maintains the current separation of banking and commercial activities, while providing appropriate flexibility, again, subject to Federal Reserve Board oversight. Some have criticized even the narrow flexibility which is provided in this bill. However, without this flexibility many financial companies will not be able to take advantage of the new structure contained in the bill and will continue to expand their activities outside of the bank holding company model and, thus, outside the oversight that the structure would ensure. Also, while on the topic of banking and commerce, I want to briefly touch on the unitary thrift holding company. There are three thrift related provisions either in S. 900 or which are expected to be considered as floor amendments. First, as reported by the Committee, the bill prevents the formation of any new unitary thrift holding companies after February 28, 1999. This provision will protect any applications which were ``in the pipeline'' at that time, on the date the bill was unveiled but will prevent any new unitary charters, thus providing a finite universe of unitary charters. 
   Mr. President, another provision which is included in the base text of the bill extends the assessment differential between banks and thrifts on the payment of interest on bonds that were issued by the Financing Corporation as part of the savings and loan crisis. In 1996, Congress enacted legislation requiring thrifts to make a one-time assessment into the Saving Association Insurance Fund or better known as SAIF, to fully capitalize the then-undercapitalized fund. This assessment was included predominantly because it was scored as a revenue gain under budget rules, and it could be used as the offset that Congress needed to grant the President added spending that he was demanding in return for his support of the balanced budget plan. 
   In order to lighten the blow to thrifts and to ensure that the FICO bond interests payments were made in a timely and also in a dependable manner, Congress for the first time spread the assessment for FICO interest to the commercial banks. Under that legislation, banks were to be assessed at a rate one-fifth of that which thrifts are assessed until January 1, 2000, at which time all institutions would be assessed at the same rate. 
   The bill before us today extends for 3 years the period during which there will be an assessment differential. Not surprisingly, the thrift industry adamantly opposed this provision. It is expected that Senator JOHNSON will be offering an amendment, which I intend to support, which strikes the FICO assessment extension and eliminates the thrifts' ability to affiliate with nonfinancial firms. 
   Although this amendment presents an unpopular choice for thrifts, I believe that it is in the best interest of the thrifts in my State because it will positively impact their bottom line while only slightly impacting their ability to affiliate. 
   I should note that if the Johnson amendment were approved outside of the underlying modernization bill, it would be much more burdensome, because thrifts would then be limited to selling only to banks or to other thrifts. However, the bill's expansion of the ability of bank holding companies to affiliate with insurance companies and securities firms passes through to thrifts and will now permit nonunitary thrifts to also sell to banks, sell to securities firms, or insurance companies. 
   Now I want to take a moment to discuss the issue which will likely be the most contentious during the debate on this bill. That is the Community Reinvestment Act or CRA. During consideration of this bill, the Banking Committee approved two balanced amendments designed to bring rationality to a law which has ventured far from what I believe was its original purpose. CRA was enacted in 1977 to encourage financial institutions to help meet the credit needs of the local communities in which they were chartered. Although noble sounding, CRA has drifted far afield from that original purpose. S. 900 includes a small bank exemption, approved on a bipartisan vote of the committee, which exempts banks with assets of under $100 million and which are outside of a metropolitan statistical area for the CRA. 
   Although I have received a number of calls of opposition from constituents in urban areas in my State, which will not be affected by this exemption, I do think it is important to listen to what some of the bankers in rural Minnesota are also saying. I am sure this is true not only in Minnesota but in rural banks across the country. 
   Although these bankers are often vilified, I believe that 
   they play a very crucial role in ensuring that affordable financial services are widely available in the rural America. 
   Just take, for example, the comments of John Schmid of the Security State Bank in Sebeka, MN. John writes:  
   We are a small rural Minnesota bank with assets of $21 million--$21 million, this is not a large money center bank--and our town population is 680 souls. We could not exist if we did not support and reinvest as much as we could in our town and surrounding area.  
   Gregory Morgan of First National Bank of Montgomery, MN, also tells a similar story. He writes:  
   Our bank is 36 years old, founded on the idea of serving the entire community of Montgomery and as such, we have been successful. Our efforts of living and breathing community reinvestment are not driven by having to be in compliance with some law written in Washington but rather by listening and serving our friends and neighbors throughout the Montgomery area.  
   Yet another constituent committed to his hometown is Romane Dold, of Currie State Bank. Romane writes:  
   We are a small community bank located in a town of 300 people. Our assets are $17 million. Our bank has always adhered to the regulations of CRA and, in fact, received an ``Outstanding'' rating in our most recent exam. The problem that we have with the regulations is that it just is not necessary. Our bank has been in this town since 1931 and quite honestly, if we hadn't been reinvesting in this community for over 60 years we wouldn't be here. CRA has just been another ``little burden'' that we have to contend with to appease some regulator.  
   Finally, the message Kieth Eitreim of Jasper State Bank in Jasper, MN, shared also proved that CRA is a bottom-line issue, costing small rural communities precious dollars, a lot of money. His bank is  
   .....an $18 million bank located in a town of 600 people in southwestern Minnesota. CRA is a requirement that does absolutely nothing to protect the people of my community except to cost them money. The last exam we had lasted 3 days and proved what we already knew. We service our community. If we did not, we would not be in business.

   Mr. GRAMS. I understand the concern, and I know those numbers have been raised in the questions. 
   I also know, if you look at the other side of the story, I have talked to some of these small bankers who say they live in a town or work in a town of 300 people. And if you look out in the rural parts of the country today, most of the population in these small towns is growing in age. So his concern was, although we make all these loans available, there are not many home mortgages being sought. There are not many automobiles being bought. There are not many washers and dryers for which loans are being asked. There isn't the demand for the loan. 
   You have to expect that these bankers are going to have to put the money to some use, if there is nobody out there asking for the loan. The question I have for the Senator is, how many of those loans have been asked for and then denied? 
   The story I have--and I don't have this information in front of me--is that he said it is awfully hard to loan money to my community when there is no request for loans. What do I do, let the money sit in the safe overnight? No, he has to invest it, maybe in some of these other government or other financial institutions or financial mechanisms. 
   I think there are two sides of that story. It is not that these banks are turning down loans. In many cases, in these small communities in rural parts of the country, there is no demand for these loans. The bank is a good, safe place to keep it, but not always to be able to use the bank's facilities.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, by putting a face on the businesspeople working day in and day out trying to help America's rural communities strive and survive, I hope we can eliminate the vilification which is cast upon them. We are talking about banks under $100 million. As the gentleman from Sebeka said: 680 people is not a major financial center, and we have done the best we can to meet the requirements. We would not be in existence and would not be able to survive in our community if we didn't reinvest and if we had turned down these loans. 
   There is a commonsense way to look at it. According to the stories we have heard and the bankers we have talked to, a lot of times these are banks with three or four employees. Many times they are asked to have a full-time employee just to work on government regulations, which takes a lot of money that could be used for loans, et cetera, out of the bank, and, as one banker said, it does absolutely nothing for his community. That is where we have to look at some of this. This is common sense. 
   By using their words to show that they are meeting their communities' needs, not because Washington tells them to do so or says they have to, but, again, because it is in their best interest and it is in the best interest of their community and their town, it proves the need for the small bank exemption. 
   The Committee also included a provision which has mistakenly been deemed a ``safe harbor.'' Unlike a safe harbor, which gives an institution a free ride, the rebuttable presumption included in S. 900 simply gives meaning to the work of the regulators during CRA exams. CRA's stated purpose is to require each appropriate federal banking regulator to use its authority when examining financial institutions to encourage such institutions to help meet the credit needs of the local communities. By providing a rebuttable presumption, the bill gives the regulator the benefit of the doubt that they are meeting the requirements of CRA by encouraging action by the institution during the exam. However, the bill provides a safety that if someone feels that the regulator has not properly assessed the institution, provided the individual can prove the regulators failure, it can still protest an action. Thus, this amendment simply protects federal banking regulators against harassment by individuals who simply want to criticize their work. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I regret to have to include a negative comment in this statement about an otherwise outstanding bill. However, I believe that the operating subsidiary provisions included in S. 900 are inadequate and should be amended. As the Senator who worked on a bipartisan basis last year with Senator REED of Rhode Island to draft a compromise operating subsidiary amendment, I have vested a great deal of time studying the pluses and minuses of this option. I have come to the conclusion that it is appropriate for national banks to conduct full financial activities, with the exception of insurance underwriting and real estate development. I enthusiastically support the op sub amendment of Senator SHELBY which will be offered to this bill. It is identical to the amendment I authored last year and again this year in Committee. The amendment provides adequate safeguards to ensure that the sub poses no greater risk to the bank than a holding company affiliate. Another benefit of this amendment is to provide competition among regulators. A recent conversation I had with a banking lawyer convinced me that this amendment is prudent public policy. The attorney shared with me that in his dealings with the Federal Reserve Board and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the agencies have been cooperative in helping his client work through issues and find creative ways to deal with their problems while the other has done nothing to help. If we were to eliminate the competition, regulators would have no incentive to be responsive to the institutions they regulate and American banks would have no where to turn if they are unhappy with their treatment. 
   Mr. President, in closing I again urge my colleagues to support this important legislation so that we can move the bill through conference and to the President for his signature. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as a strong critic of the Administration's policy in the Balkans, I am uncomfortable expressing my reservations now that we are in a state of war. The U.S. forces conducting air strikes against Serbia have my full support as they go into battle even though I do not support what I believe to be an ill-defined mission. 
   Mr. President, I opposed the resolution authorizing the President to bomb Serbia, because I did not see how bombing Serbia would end the atrocities being committed, bring about stability in the region, or lead to greater political autonomy for Kosovo. And I am going to oppose this resolution as well. The Senate should not be moving to authorize the President ``to use all necessary force''--when the President has not asked us for that authority--and when the President has given every indication that he has no intention of moving in that direction. I know that the authors of this resolution have the best intentions, but I do not think that it is prudent to push the Commander-in-Chief towards putting U.S. troops on the ground. If the President believes that ground troops are necessary, the President should come to the Congress, clearly explain his objectives and how the use of force can achieve those specific goals. Then, and only then, should the President ask Congress for authorization to use ground troops. That is the way to proceed. 
   Mr. President, the only lasting solution to this conflict in the Balkans is a negotiated agreement where both sides agree to live with the results. It is inevitable that Russia, and other traditional Serb allies, will play a role in this process. But given the record of the UN in Bosnia, the peacekeeping force would be more credible if it was under a different organization's control. OSCE member nations who did not participate in the NATO bombing campaign could provide a credible force. The conflict between the Serbs and the Kosovars will not end with a NATO defeat of the Serbs, just as it didn't end with the defeat of the Serbs by the Turks in Kosovo in 1389. The conflict will continue to flare unless a political solution is found to this intractable problem, so I urge the Administration to actively engage in finding a negotiated settlement to this conflict which will lead to a sustainable peace in the Balkan region.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in order to call attention to one of the most onerous barriers currently facing American agriculture. It is a regional price-fixing cartel, which benefits only those producers within its own boundaries, at the direct expense of consumers. It is a patently unfair, unabashed attempt to distort basic principles of market forces. It is the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, which has been in effect in New England States since July 1997. 
   Today, Senator RUSS FEINGOLD of Wisconsin and I introduce the Dairy Fairness Act, which would repeal the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. As many southeastern States are passing enabling legislation to lay the groundwork in forming their own compacts, we feel it is necessary to once again review the notorious history of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, and its negative impact on consumers and on all dairy farmers--with the notable exception, of course, of the largest dairy industries within the compact region. 
   The 1996 FAIR Act included significant reforms for diary policy. It set the stage for greater market orientation in dairy, including reform of the archaic Federal milk marketing orders. Yet despite a strong vote by the Senate to strip the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact from its version of the FAIR Act, and the deliberate exclusion of any compact language from the House version of the bill, a Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact provision was slipped into the conference report. This  language called for the termination of the compact upon the completion of the Federal milk marketing order process. That would have been in April of 1999. Well, through last year's appropriations process, the implementation of USDA's Federal Milk Marketing Order reforms have been delayed by 6 months. Of course, this was not at the request of the USDA. With the delay came an automatic extension of this compact. This political maneuvering is outrageous, and it comes with a high price tag attached--a high price tag to be paid by milk drinkers, and the rest of the Nation's dairy farmers. 
   The goals of the Northeast Dairy Compact have been clear since its inception. That was--to increase the profits of producers within the compact region, but at the expense of everyone outside of the compact. And by now, the obvious ramifications have been realized--higher milk prices within the compact region. This, not surprisingly, has led to a decrease in milk consumption. According to data from the Northeast Dairy Compact Commission, the compact, since it has been in effect, has added $46.5 million to the cost of milk in New England. As the fluid milk prices which consumers pay rise, the burden falls disproportionately on low-income families, particularly those with small children. Low-income families spend a greater percentage of their income on food. They are harmed as a direct result of this compact. 
   The compact is having other dramatic effects as well. The increase in prices which producers receive for their milk has led to surplus production, which has had a negative effect on other producers around the country. Conversion of this surplus milk into cheese, butter, and powder drives down prices for these products in other non-compact regions. 
   Take milk powder, for instance. Some of the compact's excess supply has been converted into nonfat milk powder. Between October 1997 and March 1998, New England produced 11 million more pounds of powder, 60 percent more than it did in the same period of the preceding year. During that time, nonfat powder production in the U.S. increased by only 2 percent. Furthermore, between October 1, 1997 and March 31, 1998, the nonfat milk powder glut in the U.S. drove prices so low that USDA had to spend nearly $41 million to buy surplus milk powder from dairy processors. Dairy producers outside of the compact region clearly are harmed as a direct result of the compact. 
   In fact, the only real winners have been the largest industrial dairies of the Northeast. It is really no surprise. Just consider it: if the compact pays a premium per hundredweight of milk, and large industrial dairies are able to produce, for example, 15 to 20 times more than the ``typical'' traditional dairy farm that the compact was supposedly going to protect, who do you think the big winners are? It certainly isn't the traditional dairy farm. They are also put at a competitive disadvantage, and thanks again to regional politics. And so are dairies outside the compact region. 
   We must keep sight of the fact that a dairy compact, or any sort of compact for that matter, is essentially a price-fixing scheme, which so abuses interstate commerce that it requires a special authorization of Congress. Otherwise it would violate Federal antitrust laws. We have come to the point where we must ask ourselves, as a nation, in which direction will we proceed concerning dairy policy. USDA has just presented its recommendations for Federal Milk Marketing Order reforms. It is not a great step in the way of reform, but at least it represents a rational attempt to decrease Federal interference in the dairy business and to treat producers all over the country a little more fairly. A national patchwork of compacts would render the Federal Milk Marketing Order reforms meaningless. It would essentially kill any hope for the beginning of real Federal reform. Interstate commerce in the milk industry would be so confusing it would be a confusing maze that harms consumers. While dairy was not included in the farm bill, it was always envisioned that a later dairy solution would conform to the free market concept of that farm bill. 
   We all know that it is difficult in Washington to have the courage to bypass any of those quick-fix issues in favor of a long-range view which would produce better and sound dairy policies. But that is exactly what we need today. That is where real leadership comes into play. So let's be advocates for the traditional dairy farmers, not just the mega-dairies. What is required now is a complete overhaul of this backward-looking and just plain unfair compact legislation. Senator FEINGOLD and I will continue to fight the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact, and any other dairy compact that may be proposed. And we urge our colleagues to give all dairy farmers, in all areas of our country, the ability to compete on a level playing field. 
   To this end, and in order to underscore the need for significant reform, Senator FEINGOLD and I today also introduce the Dairy Reform Act, which would equalize the minimum adjustments to prices for fluid milk marketing orders at $1.80 per hundredweight of milk. This legislation, again, represents real reform, and a level playing field that will allow farmers to compete fairly and not have the Federal Government stand on the neck of dairy farmers in one area of the country while supporting those in others. It would allow producers to compete in a system where efficiencies--efficiencies--would be rewarded and they would be important according to market principles. The current system is so weighted against the Upper Midwest that our dairy farmers have to be twice as good just to be able to break even. The Dairy Reform Act proposes a marketing system which would truly be fair.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce The Department of Energy Abolishment Act of 1999. I am pleased to include as original cosponsors Senator SPENCER ABRAHAM and Senator JON KYL and want to thank them for their support both this year and in past Congresses. 
   I would also like to say that Congressman TODD TIAHRT will be introducing his DOE elimination bill today in the House of Representatives and I thank him for his continued leadership and cooperation on this issue. 
   As many of my colleagues are aware, the effort to eliminate the DOE is not a new endeavor. In fact, since its inception, experts have been clamoring to eliminate the Department and to move its programs back to the agencies from which they were taken--agencies better suited to achieving specific programmatic goals. 
   When we began to look into the specifics of DOE elimination in the 104th Congress, we considered three main issues. First, we examined the fact that the Department of Energy no longer has a mission--a situation clearly reflected by the fact that nearly 85 percent of its budget is expended upon ``non-energy'' programs. 
   The Department was created to develop a long-term energy strategy with an ultimate goal of energy indepedence. Sadly, we are now far more reliant upon foreign energy sources than we were when the Department was created. 
   During the long oil lines of the 1970s, we were about 35 percent dependent on foreign oil. Today, it is more than 60 percent. So our foreign oil dependency has grown, and a lack of an energy strategy is a result of the failure of the DOE. 
   I recall at one point Secretary Hazel O'Leary commented that we should consider taking the word ``energy'' out of the Department's name because it was such a small portion of its overall activity. Next, we studied those programs charged to the DOE and reviewed its ability to meet the related job requirements. 
   And finally, we looked at the DOE's ever-increasing budget in light of the first two criterion--determining whether the taxpayers should be forced to expend nearly $18 billion annually on this bureacratic hodgepodge. 
   Now, I want to be up front and say for the record that I acknowledge the difficulties inherent in eliminating a cabinet-level agency. I am keenly aware that the chances of passing this bill into law in this Congress, with this Administration, and in a presidential election year are difficult. 
   Those chances may be exactly as they were in 1996 when I first introduced this legislation and when we held our first hearing on the matter, but unfortunately, the reasons for offering the bill haven't changed. 
   In 1996, the opponents of this legislation charged that it was unnecessary. They claimed that the Department was headed in the right direction and making the changes necessary to both justify its mission and reduce its bloated budget. 
   The call of many Members of Congress to eliminate the Department encouraged a group of DOE supporters to back a hastily arranged set of objectives in defense of the DOE's record of mismanagement. 
   At the time of the 1996 hearings on this legislation, the backers of the Department relied largely on the DOE's Strategic Alignment and Downsizing Initiative as a defense against charges that the Department wasted too much money and that the Department was involved in a two-decades old scavenger hunt for new missions. 
   The Strategic Alignment and Downsizing Initiative, its proponents claimed, would save taxpayers over $14 billion in 5 years and change the way the DOE conducted business. Regrettably, those projections were never met and the Initiative was never taken seriously--even by the same people who touted its promise. 
   In fact, while they have continued their reluctance to reduce their budget--they have continuously sought billions of dollars in budget increase to fund their on-going mission creep. So I think its worthwhile to look back on the great hopes those opposed to my bill placed on this proposal. 
   While speaking about this legislation on September 4, 1996, in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Bennett Johnston said, ``Maybe all of this would be worth doing if we were going to save the taxpayers a lot of money. But the operational savings claimed by S. 1678 by the Heritage Foundation are actually less than the operational savings that would be realized by the Department's on-going strategic realignment initiative, savings that the GAO has testified are real.'' 
   In other words, the Senator was saying that the Department of Energy would save more money for the taxpayers by doing a better job than we could by eliminating the department. 
   As I stated earlier, Mr. President, the Strategic Alignment and Downsizing Initiative--the great hope of DOE's defenders in 1996--hasn't achieved one red cent of budgetary savings over the last 4 years, and it doesn't appear that anything is going to change anytime soon. Regrettably, the Strategic Alignment and Downsizing Initiative isn't the only improvement the Department has failed to make over the past four years. 
   Today, commercial nuclear waste still sits at 73 sites in 34 states despite both legal and contractual obligations that mandated the removal of the waste by January 31, 1998, more than a year ago. 
   Since my election to the Senate in 1994, I have listened to a parade of DOE witnesses tell the Energy and Natural Resources Committee that they are committed to resolving this conflict and living up to their responsibilities. Every nominee I have questioned has told me how important this issue is to them and how they are going to work with Congress. But not one of them--not one--in any substantive way, has taken actions which generate faith in Congress that the DOE is capable of fulfilling its promises. Again--not one--nominee has delivered on their promises--instead, of what they need to say to get confirmed and then return to business as usual. 
   They don't keep their promises. They say what they need to say, what Congress wants to hear to get confirmed, and then they go on with business as usual. 
   Today, the Government Performance and Results Act paints a clear picture of how difficult it is to get a grip on the size of problems at the Department of Energy. The Department's final strategic plan, which took four years of preparation, scored a pathetic 43.5 points out of a possible 100. That is how good this is. 
   And the DOE's FY99 annual performance plan was ranked fourth from last of all government agencies--scoring 30 out of a possible 100. No business, no college student, no family, could consistently perform so miserably and yet maintain a cushy existence of even larger and larger budgets. 
   But thanks to an indifferent Administration, and a Congress that places too little importance on its oversight role, the DOE continues along with the knowledge that its protectors will keep the lights on and the funding flowing without any regard for the American taxpayer. 
   And today, as this nation continues to grow increasingly dependent upon foreign oil--in total contrast to the DOE's core mission. Even in light of this Administration's focus on alternative energy, the DOE expends less than one-sixth of its budget on ``energy'' related programs--a trend that clearly will continue well into the future. 
   Let me be the first to state that the proposals contained within this bill are not all of my own. The idea to eliminate the Department of Energy is not a new one--since its creation in 1978, experts have been clamoring to abolish this ``agency in search of a mission.'' This bill represents the comments and input of many who have worked in these fields for decades, but, I consider it a work in progress. 
   Under the Department of Energy Abolishment Act of 1999, we dismantle the patchwork quilt of government initiatives--reassembling them into agencies better equipped to accomplish their basic goals; we refocus and increase federal funding towards basic research by eliminating corporate welfare; and, we abolish the bloated, duplicative upper management bureaucracy. 
   First, we begin by eliminating Energy's cabinet-level status and establishing a three-year Resolution Agency  to oversee the transition. This is critical to ensuring progress continues to be made on the core programs. 
   Under Title I, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) is spun off to become an independent agency, as it was prior to the creation of the DOE. The division which oversees hearings and appeals is eliminated, with all pending cases transferred to the Department of Justice for resolution within 1 year. The functions of the Energy Information Administration are transferred to the Department of Interior with the instruction to privatize as many as possible. And with the exception of research being conducted by the DOE labs, basic science and energy research functions are transferred to Interior for determination on which are basic research, and which can be privatized. Those deemed as core research will be transferred to the National Science Foundation and reviewed by an independent commission. Those that are more commercial in nature will be subject to disposition recommendations by the Secretary of Interior. 
   The main reasoning behind this is to ensure the original mission of the DOE--to develop this nation's energy independence--is carried out. 
   With scarce taxpayer dollars currently competing against defense and cleanup programs within the DOE, it's no surprise that little progress has been made. However, by refocusing dollars into competitive alternative energy research, we will maximize the potential for areas such as solar, wind, biomass, etc. 
   For states like Minnesota, where the desire for renewable energy technologies is high, growth in these areas could help fend off our growing dependence upon foreign oil while protecting our environment. 
   Under Title II, the laboratory structure within the DOE is revamped. 
   First, the three ``defense labs'' are transferred to the Defense Department. They include Sandia, Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore. The remaining labs are studied by a ``Non-defense Energy Laboratory Commission''. 
   This independent commission operates much like the Base Closure Commission and can recommend restructuring, privatization or a transfer to the DOD as alternatives to closure. Congress is granted fast-track authority to adopt the Commission's recommendations. 
   Title III directs the General Accounting Office to assess an inventory of the Power Marketing Administration's assets, liabilities, etc. This inventory is aimed at ensuring fair treatment of current customers and a fair return to the taxpayers. All issues, including payments by current customers, must be included in the GAO audit. 
   Petroleum Reserves are the focus of Title IV. The Naval Petroleum Reserve is targeted for immediate sale. Any of the reserves that are unable to be disposed of within the three-year window will be sold transitionally from the Interior Department. 
   The Strategic Petroleum Reserve is transferred to the Defense Department and an audit on value and maintenance costs is conducted by the GAO. Then, the DOD is charged with determining how much oil to maintain for national security purposes after reviewing the GAO report. 
   Under Titles V and VI, all of the national security and environmental restoration/management activities are sent to the Department of Defense. 
   Therefore, all defense-related activities are transferred back to Defense, but are placed in a new civilian controlled agency (the Defense Nuclear Programs Agency) to ensure budget firewalls and civilian control over sensitive activities such as arms control and nonproliferation activities. 
   And the program which has received much criticism as of late, the Civilian Nuclear Waste Program, is transferred to the Corps of Engineers. This section dovetails legislation adopted by the Senate last Congress. A key element is that the interim storage site is designated at Nevada's Test Site Area 25. 
   As I mentioned in the beginning of my statement, while I believe we should eliminate the Department as cabinet-level agency, I appreciate the difficulty involved in accomplishing this goal now and realize the opposition to this among many of my colleagues. For that reason, I believe it is important to point out that the reasons I have outlined for eliminating the Department have a dual purpose--they can also serve as reasons for improving the Department. 
   Toward that end, I am willing to work with any Member of the Senate and House to improve, downsize, or restructure the DOE. I have long advocated positions which are consistent with my beliefs. 
   I am an original co-sponsor of The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1999--legislation I believe is essential to fulfilling the DOE's promises to America's ratepayers and taxpayers. I have been a strong supporter of legislation and efforts which are aimed at improving our nation's energy security by promoting domestically produced alternative and renewable fuels. Those efforts have included support for extending the ethanol tax credit, including biodiesel as an alternative fuel under the Energy Policy Act, cosponsoring the Wind Energy Tax Credit, cosponsoring the Poultry Litter Tax Credit legislation, and cosponsoring legislation to reform the hydropower relicensing process. 
   Briefly, I believe those efforts strengthen the original mission of the Department of Energy. My bottom line is, I want America's taxpayers to be assured they are receiving a proper return on their investment. 
   The taxpayers need to have confidence they are receiving the services they deserve. Unfortunately, the record of the Department of Energy is evidence in part of our reliance upon foreign oil, by the nuclear waste program debacle and by the low ratings it receives under the Government Performance and Results Act, and is a record of failure the taxpayers should no longer be forced to bear. 
   I patiently awaited the reforms and savings promised by the Department and its advocates, but the waiting continues and the savings never developed. As long as this is the case, I will continue to offer my legislation to dismantle the Department of Energy and shift its responsibilities elsewhere. 
   I send the bill to the desk and ask it be referred to the proper committees.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the efforts of Senator MURKOWSKI and Senator HAGEL by cosponsoring the Energy and Climate Policy Act of 1999. 
   This legislation marks a turning point in how we address the potential problems associated with global climate change. 
   It addresses these potential problems not by mandating draconian reductions in energy use and hiking energy taxes, but by providing America's businesses and innovators with the tools they need to make long-term, substantive carbon dioxide emissions reductions. 
   One of the problems with the administration's support of the Kyoto Protocol is that while they have already agreed to legally-binding greenhouse gas emissions reductions, the GAO found last year that the administration does not have quantitative performance goals for the money they intend to spend on their intiatives. 
   In other words, the administration has agreed to a treaty with legally-binding reductions and they clearly want to spend a lot of money to reach those limits--but they don't have any idea how much of an impact all of their spending will have on emissions reductions. 
   This legislation says ``let's take a different road.'' The Murkowski-Hagel bill will establish a new research, development and demonstration program that promotes technologies and practices which allow energy users to avoid or reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
   Those technologies include alternative energy technologies, energy efficiency technologies, and technologies that take current energy production processes and make them better and more efficient. 
   The bill will also promote technologies that remove and sequester greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and emissions streams. 
   This bill is aimed at involving the private sector in our decisionmaking processes and bringing them to the table as well. It is aimed at putting American ingenuity to work whether it be in the home, at the business, or out on the farm. The Murkowski-Hagel bill simply says that we recognize our responsibility to reduce or sequester greenhouse gas emissions and we are taking substantive, long-term steps to that rising challenge. 
   The Murkowski-Hagel bill does not start from the premise that we are to blame for the theoretical impacts of global warming. It doesn't attempt to punish American businesses by forcing them to reduce their energy consumption or by bankrupting them through higher energy prices. This bill does not accept the long-held beltway view that Washington knows best. It recognizes that American businesses and individuals can do tremendous things when they are challenged to do better and when Government is their partner rather than their adversary. 
   I sincerely hope that all Members of the Senate can support this piece of legislation so that it can pass into law as soon as possible. I look forward to continuing to work with Senators MURKOWSKI and HAGEL and others interested to continue our efforts to both protect the environment and strengthen the American economy as we enter into the 21st century. 
   While I am here this morning, I would like to renew my request to President Clinton that he submit the recently signed Kyoto Protocol to the Senate for ratification. Mr. President, the United States Senate has clearly expressed its interest in this matter and its opposition to any attempts to implement the Treaty prior to Senate advice and consent. 
   In the 105th Congress, the Senate undertook a number of activities which illustrated these concerns. First, S. Res. 98 unanimously expressed the Senate's position on both the projected economic impacts of the Treaty and the participation of developing nations. 
   Second, in a series of measures, including the FY99 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill, the FY99 Department of Defense Appropriations Bill, the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act, and the FY99 VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, the Senate expressed its concern with any attempts at premature implementation and Administration actions which advance the provisions of the Treaty prior to Senate advice and consent. It is my understanding that the Administration has largely ignored the provisions of those pieces of legislation. 
   While President Clinton has long maintained that he will not submit the Treaty to the Senate prior to obtaining ``meaningful'' developing nation participation, his recent actions clearly demonstrate that he will not withdraw U.S. support, regardless of what the final agreement may be. 
   By signing the Treaty on November 12, 1998, while allowing an additional two years for continued negotiations on elements critical to the Treaty's impact on our nation, he has predetermined the outcome and weakened our nation's negotiating position. And despite the Senate's unanimous framework provided within S. Res. 98, there has been little substantive progress towards obtaining any ``meaningful'' participation among developing nations. 
   I can only conclude that the Administration's premature signing of this Treaty was based on political considerations that should never have been factored into such an important decision. Under no circumstances should a Treaty be signed until we agree with its principals. Just briefly, as I conclude, once a Treaty has been signed by the United States, it should immediately be sent to the Congress for ratification, not used for political purposes. 
   So again, I strongly urge the President to submit the Kyoto Protocol, which he has already signed, to the Senate for ratification. If he believes it is important enough to sign and to implement through backdoor tactics, then he should also believe it is important enough to for Congress, the people's voice, to have an opportunity to review it, debate it, and vote on its ratification. 
   I believe the Senate must have the opportunity to examine the Treaty now and debate it openly before the American people.

   Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, I wanted to be here this morning to strongly support safe deposit box legislation that would lock in any future Social Security surpluses, again only to be used for Social Security. 
   That doesn't sound like rhetoric to me, although that is what others are charging. But this is an effort to make sure the surpluses for Social Security go forward to making sure that Social Security is going to be solvent in the future. 
   I commend the Senate majority leader and Senator DOMENICI for making this legislation a top priority. I am pleased to join Senators ABRAHAM, ASHCROFT, and DOMENICI to offer this important substitute amendment. 
   The recently released 1999 Social Security Trustee's Report shows the financial status of the Social Security Trust Funds has slightly improved due to our strong economy. 
   The Trustee's report that Social Security will begin operating in the red in 2014, a year longer than last year's report, and it will go broke in 2034, two years later than projected last year. 
   This does not mean we don't need to worry about Social Security any more, and that future economic growth will wipe out all of our problems with Social Security as some suggest. 
   On the contrary, it reveals that Social Security unfunded liability has increased by $752 billion, which means Social Security is falling deeper into debt. It makes reform of Social Security more urgent than ever. 
   Although the increased surplus has slightly pushed back the date of insolvency, the significant increase of unfunded liability makes it harder to fix Social Security. Clearly, nearly $20 trillion in unfunded liability makes Social Security reform more imperative, not less--$20 trillion in unfunded liability. That means $20 trillion worth of benefits that the Government has promised that is not available in the Social Security Trust Funds. 
   That's why we are introducing this legislation today as an essential first step to save and strengthen Social Security. 
   Mr. President, this legislation is an enforceable mechanism to preserve the surplus generated by Social Security. It is designed to lock in every penny of the $1.8 trillion Social Security surplus in the next 10 years to be exclusively used for Social Security. 
   Pending reforms, these surpluses would retire debt held by the public to increase cash reserves in the Social Security trust funds. This mechanism ensures the surplus will be used in the future to pay for promised Social Security benefits once retired baby boomers threaten the solvency of the trust funds. 
   Although I prefer an immediate reform to move Social Security to a fully-funded retirement system, I believe this is the only way to actually save Social Security at this time, and to provide the dollars needed of any reform package in the offing. 
   President Clinton unveiled his Social Security proposal under his FY 2000 budget. The bottom line of his plan is that it allows the Government to control the retirement dollars of the American people by investing for them. It does nothing, however, to save Social Security from bankruptcy. 
   Worse still, despite his rhetoric about saving every penny for Social Security, President Clinton has proposed to take $158 billion in Social Security dollars to finance Government programs unrelated to Social Security.  
   The only positive aspect of his proposal is that the President has admitted the insolvency of Social Security and has recognized the power of the markets to generate a better rate of return, and therefore improved benefits. 
   The fundamental problem with our Social Security system is that it's basically a Ponzi scheme--a pay-as-you-go pyramid that takes the retirement dollars of today's workers to pay benefits for today's retirees. 
   It has no real assets and makes no real investment. With changing demographics that translate into fewer and fewer workers supporting each retiree, the system has begun to collapse. 
   There is a lot of double-counting and double talk in President Clinton's Social Security framework. The truth of the matter is the President spends the same money twice and claims that he has saved Social Security. 
   All the President has done is create a second set of the IOUs in the trust fund. It is like taking the money he owes Paul out of one pocket and applying it to the money he owes Peter in the other pocket, and then pretending that he has doubled his money and is now able to pay them both. 
   In addition, the President has proposed to spend $58 billion of Social Security money in FY 2000 for new Government spending. Over the next five years, he will spend $158 billion of our Social Security money. 
   President Clinton's plan does not live up to his claim of saving Social Security. He has not pushed back the date when the Social Security Trust Fund will begin real deficit spending. That date is still the same--2014. Social Security will have a shortfall that year and the shortfall will continue to grow larger year after year. 
   There are no longer surpluses building up in the Social Security account. There will actually be a deficit, and the shortfall will be $200 billion a year by the year 2021. By the year 2048, that deficit would run $1.5 trillion a year. 
   Since the government has spent the surplus and has not set aside money to make up for this shortfall, it will have to raise taxes to cover the gap--something that economists estimate will require a doubling of the payroll tax. 
   The proposal by the President to have the government invest a portion of the Social Security Trust Funds is no solution. It would give the government unwarranted new powers over our economy, and it will not provide retirees the rate of return they deserve. 
   Mr. President, it's going to take real reform, not Washington schemes, to help provide security in retirement for all Americans. The first essential step is to stop raiding from the Social Security Trust Funds, and truly preserve and protect the Social Security surplus to be used exclusively for Social Security. 
   This is exactly what this safe-deposit box legislation will achieve. 
   Mr. President, the best part of this legislation is that it will prevent Congress and the Administration from spending the Social Security surplus. 
   As I mentioned earlier, Social Security operates on a cash-in and cash-out basis. In 1998, American workers paid $489 billion into the system, but most of the money, $382 billion, was immediately paid out to 44 million beneficiaries the same year. 
   That left a $106 billion surplus. The total accumulated surplus in the trust fund is $763 billion. 
   Unfortunately, this surplus exists only on paper. The government has consumed all the $763 billion for non-Social Security related programs. All it has are the Treasury IOUs that ``fit in four ordinary brown accordian-style folders that one can easily hold in both hands.'' 
   Despite the President's rhetoric of using every penny of Social Security surplus to save Social Security, last year's Omnibus Appropriations bill alone spent over $21 billion of the Social Security surplus. 
   Without the enforceable lockbox created by this legislation, future surpluses are likely to be spent to fund other government programs, leaving nothing for baby boomers and future generations. 
   Another important component is that this legislation would use the Social Security surplus to reduce the amount of federal debt held by the public. 
   Clearly, there is a valid economic reason to pay down the federal debt. Although I join most economists who agree that paying off the federal debt with a budget surplus would not stimulate growth in the same way that a tax cut would, it is still far preferable to having the government spend all the surplus. 
   Mr. President, many of us in Congress agree with the President that we should, and indeed must, devote the entire Social Security surplus to saving Social Security. However, his plan does not do what he says while our legislation does. 
   Mr. President, this legislation will be an essential first step to save and strengthen Social Security. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today across our country, Americans are commemorating Earth Day, a day vitally important to all who serve in this Chamber as well. 
   As my colleagues know, Earth Day was first observed on April 22, 1970. Its purpose was, and it remains, to make people across the country and around the world reflect on the splendor of our planet, an opportunity to get the people to think about the Earth's many gifts we often take for granted. 
   Earth Day is a day for us to renew our commitment to protect our environment and recognize the respect we must give our natural resources, recycling and replenishing whenever possible. 
   The New York Times, on the original Earth Day, ran a story which in part read:  
   Conservatives were for it. Liberals were for it. Democrats, Republicans and Independents were for it. So were the ins, the outs, the executive and the legislative branches of Government.  
   Mr. President, the goals of Earth Day 1970 were goals upon which all of us agree. They are goals still shared across the country, regardless of age, gender, race, economic status, or religious background, and they are shared by this Senator as well. 
   I consider myself a conservationist and an environmentalist, and I think everyone who serves in the Senate also does. No one among us is willing to accept the proposition that our children or grandchildren will ever have to endure dirty water or filthy skies. Our children deserve to live in a world that affords them the same environmental opportunities that their parents enjoy today. 
   When speaking about the Earth and our environment, however, it is becoming increasingly difficult to highlight the consensus that exists in Congress on protecting the environment, because the environmental debate is now so focused on the margins. 
   The proliferation of special interest groups has forced our debate away from our common concerns and left the American people with the idea that an individual is either for the environment or against it, and that determination is made not by the voters or by one's record, but by the scorecard or the rhetoric of a particular organization. 
   I would like to take a moment this Earth Day to remind my constituents and the American people of the tremendous progress we have made on a bipartisan basis towards protecting the Earth and its inhabitants and, at the same time, improving and conserving our precious natural resources. 
   In the 104th Congress, we passed several major pieces of legislation to improve the environment. They include the Safe Drinking Water Act, the conservation title to the farm bill, the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Invasive Species Act, the Everglades Protection Amendments, the Food Quality Protection Act, the Water Resources Development Act, the Battery Recycling Act, and the Parks and Public Lands Management Act, just to name a few. 
   Those public laws are now at work helping Americans protect the environment by including billions of dollars to improve the safety of our Nation's drinking water and billions more on conservation efforts on more than 37 million acres of sensitive 
   land. 
   Those programs will help improve our cities' waterfronts, control invasive species in our lakes, and increase visitor enjoyment and natural resource protection in our Nation's parks and in our visitors' enjoyment. 
   Unfortunately, if a Member's constituents did not take the time to review the complete record of their Member of Congress, they would not know the truth. 
   While the accomplishments of the 104th Congress are impressive, the 105th Congress did not rest on its laurels over the past 2 years. The environmental accomplishments of the 105th Congress include the National Wildlife Refuge System Improvement Act, the North American Wetlands Conservation Act, the Dolphin Conservation Act, the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act, the National Park System Restoration Act, the National Wildlife Refuge System Volunteers and Community Partnership Act, the Tropical Forest Conservation Act, the African and Asian Elephant Conservation  Acts, and a host of programs contained within the provisions of the appropriations legislation. 
   Again, these programs will provide even more money, billions of dollars across the spectrum of environmental protection. These programs were passed only through bipartisan cooperation and were largely supported by most Members of Congress. 
   In the 106th Congress, we are off to another good start. I have focused my efforts on looking at legislation which improves our Nation's energy efficiency and security and promotes the use of alternative renewable sources of energy. 
   I am a cosponsor of legislation to extend the wind energy tax credit and to provide a tax credit for the production of energy from poultry litter. 
   I have also cosponsored legislation with Senators COVERDELL, BREAUX, and DEWINE which would force Federal facilities to comply with the provisions of the Clean Water Act, something they are currently able to avoid by claiming sovereign immunity. 
   I will soon be joining Senators MURKOWSKI and HAGEL as an original cosponsor of the Energy and Climate Policy Act which, through tax credits and public-private partnerships, will promote research and development of technologies which reduce or sequester greenhouse gas emissions. 
   We have had tremendous accomplishments in Congress over the past 4 years, and I make this point not to illustrate a difference between Republican and Democratic Congresses, but to highlight our shared commitments to protecting the environment, improving our wildlife habitats, making our water supply safer, increasing visitor enjoyment in our Nation's parks, and also strengthening our dedication to leaving a proud legacy of natural resource protection for our children and grandchildren to enjoy. 
   Mr. President, I make these points because they are often not properly presented to the American public, because many proenvironmental initiatives are passed by unanimous consent or by voice vote. They often do not appear on our voting records. Instead, Americans are left with the five or six votes over an entire year that a special interest group portrays as the complete environmental record of Members of Congress. 
   Anyone who closely monitors Congress knows that these issues are not as simple as some make them out to be, and a 
   Member's record is not accurately reflected by five or six selective votes, votes which are many times procedural votes and not votes on final passage. That is why I have long believed we can do a better job of promoting our shared commitment to both environmental protection and economic growth by highlighting our many common beliefs, rather than taking a microscope to those beliefs upon which differences arise. 
   Clearly, partisanship will always be present in congressional debates, but no American is well served when issues as important as environmental protection are dominated by the flagrant distortion of the truth. 
   Mr. President, I suggest that on this Earth Day, we pledge to come together to improve our environment and strengthen our natural resources. I suggest that we recognize both our failures and also our successes of the past. We must recognize that today compliance with regulations is the rule and that blatant attempts to pollute and circumvent regulations are the exception. With this in mind, I believe we must renew our Nation's commitment to pragmatism. 
   Government on all levels must do its part as watchdog while empowering those being regulated to develop unique and innovative means of compliance. At the same time, we must promote ideas that create public-private partnerships and encourage companies and individuals to take voluntary steps to protect our natural resources. Through education and awareness, we will be able to approach environmental issues in a way that fosters compromise and in a way that ensures public policy is pursued in the best interest of all. 
   It is time we commit ourselves to achieving real results through environmental initiatives. We must make sure that Superfund dollars go to clean up the Superfund sites, not go into the pockets of lawyers. We must base our decisions on clear science with stated goals and flexible solutions. We must give our job creators more flexibility in meeting national standards as a means of eliminating the pervasive ``command and control'' approach that has infected so many of our Federal programs. 
   And finally, the Federal Government needs to promote a better partnership between all levels of Government, with job providers, environmental interest groups, and with the taxpayers. Moving forward together in eliminating the inflammatory rhetoric which sometimes consumes the entire environmental debate will not be easy, but if we are going to work together to ensure the splendor of our natural resources far into the future, I believe it is a step that we are going to have to take. 
   Thank you very much, Mr. President.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to again express my strong support for the education proposals currently before the Senate, which would direct more dollars and decision-making authority to states, teachers, and parents. 
   Today the Senate considers an important bill designed to facilitate education administration and free more resources for our students. The ``Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999'' would extend the ``Education Flexibility Partnership Demonstration Program,'' otherwise known as ``Ed-Flex.'' 
   Ed-Flex allows eligible local school districts to forgo federal red tape that consumes precious education resources. In return, states must have sufficient accountability measures in place and continue to make progress toward improving student education. States must also comply with certain core federal principles, such as civil rights. The concept of Ed-Flex is simple, yet the benefits would be significant. In other words, let's put more money into educating our kids in the classroom rather than lining the pockets of bureaucrats. 
   The Ed-Flex demonstration program is currently in place in 12 states. The ``Ed-Flex Act of 1999'' would allow all 50 states the option to participate in the program. With good reason, the program has been very popular. Unnecessary, time-and-money-consuming federal regulations are rightly despised by school administrators. Did you know that the federal government provides only seven percent of local school funding, but requires 50 percent of all school paperwork? That's ridiculous. We need to put education dollars into the classroom instead of bureaucracy. 
   Ed-Flex takes a critical step in allowing more localized decision-making authority--the power to decide when the federal regulations are more troublesome and expensive than they're worth. Today, there are simply too many regulations which are despised by school administrators. 
   Giving more decision-making authority to states and local school districts is good common sense. Naturally, those who are closest to our students are in the best position to make the most appropriate and effective decisions concerning their education. One-size-fits-all legislation may work well in other areas, but not in education. Some of the most successful classrooms across our nation vary tremendously in their structure, functioning, and appearance. 
   In my home state of Minnesota, for instance, we have very rural communities, urban communities, and everything in between. We've got farm kids, suburban kids, and city kids. All of these kids are students. And I know this sort of rural-to-urban community-mix is typical for most states. How much sense does it make then, to require local school districts and classrooms--all with their own particular strengths and weaknesses--to follow, in lock-step, the homogenized, uniform routine of federal bureaucracy? Not much. 
   This week in Minnesota, the focus in the State Legislature is on education, and those involved in the debate over spending priorities and education initiatives will be Minnesota state officials, teachers, and parents: people much better suited to be making decisions for our students than Washington bureaucrats. 
   We have opportunities before us to do something meaningful for our children's education. A complementary bill to Ed-Flex which promotes local decision-making power is Senator HUTCHINSON's Dollars to the Classroom Act. Under this proposal, many federally funded K-12 programs would be consolidated and the dollars sent directly to states or local school districts--free from the usual Washington red tape. The bill would require that at least 95 cents out of every dollar spent on 31 primary and secondary federal education programs go to the classroom, allowing teachers and parents to support local education priorities. 
   It would take money from competitive federal grant programs, which rarely reach the local classrooms that need them, and send this money directly to local schools and districts for their spending needs. 
   Mr. President, in a more general sense, we need to address the reasons why our students aren't achieving the levels of academic excellence they  should. Of course we all want the best education available for our children, and to improve the state of American education and schools for all children. 
   It's in the best interest of our kids and of our country. It would be nice to think that we could solve the problems of education by spending more and more money. Unfortunately, that doesn't work. The United States is the world leader in national spending per student. Yet our test scores show that our system is failing our children. 
   Test results released last year show that American high school seniors score far below their peers from other countries in math and science. We're at rock bottom. It's going to take more time and effort to solve these problems--and the most important work will be done by those in the best position to do so: parents, teachers, and local administrators. We must give them the freedom they need to accomplish the job. This freedom comes with the authority to make decisions based on a variety of specific needs. I will continue to support measures like the Ed-Flex legislation and the Dollars to the Classroom Act, that return money and control--from Washington--to parents, teachers, and local school districts. After all, they know best how to spend education dollars.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise this morning to support the budget conference report. Before I speak on the report, I would like to take this opportunity to commend the Senate Majority Leader and Chairman DOMENICI for their outstanding leadership in crafting and delivering this well-balanced budget proposal. 
   I believe this budget blueprint is a great achievement of this Congress, and it will ensure our continued economic growth and prosperity in the new millennium. 
   Protecting Social Security, reducing the national debt and reducing taxes are imperative for our economic security and growth. Our strong economy has offered us a historic opportunity to achieve this three-pronged goal. 
   This budget conference report has showed us how we can provide major tax relief while preserving Social Security and dramatically reducing the national debt, as well as providing sufficient funding for all necessary Government functions.  
   President Clinton has proposed to spend over $158 billion of the Social Security surplus in his budget over the next five years for unrelated Government programs, instead of protecting Social Security. Remember the phrase, ``Save Social Security first''? That is not in the President's budget. 
   This budget conference report includes a safe-deposit box to lock in every penny of the $1.8 trillion Social Security surplus earned in the next 10 years to be used exclusively for Social Security. 
   Stopping the Government from raiding the Social Security Trust Funds is an essential first step to ensure Social Security will be there for current beneficiaries, baby boomers and our children and grandchildren. 
   I was pleased to join Senator ABRAHAM and others to offer an amendment during the Senate floor consideration that made this our number-one priority under this budget. 
   It is also notable, that under this budget, the debt held by the public will be reduced dramatically, much more than what President Clinton has proposed in his budget. 
   This budget conference report reserves nearly $800 billion of the projected non-Social Security surplus--those are the tax overpayments of working Americans--earmarking $800 billion for tax relief. This is the largest tax relief enacted since President Reagan's tax cuts in the early 1980s. 
   As one who has long championed major tax relief, I am pleased all Senators supported my resolution to protect this tax relief in the Budget Resolution. 
   My language offers options for middle-income tax relief such as broad-based tax relief, marriage penalty relief, retirement savings incentives, death tax relief, health care-related tax relief, and education-related tax relief. 
   The purpose of the provision is to assure the American people that we have made a commitment to major tax relief, and that there is room in this budget to fulfill this commitment while protecting Social Security and Medicare, providing debt relief and respecting some new spending priorities. 
   I am particularly pleased, Mr. President, that this budget conference report has retained my proposal which could allow us to lock in for immediate tax relief any additional on-budget surplus as re-estimated in July by the Congressional Budget Office for fiscal year 2000. 
   I believe this is solid protection for the American taxpayers. I thank the Senate majority leader and, again, Chairman DOMENICI for retaining this important provision in the budget conference report. 
   As the economy continues to be strong, we may have more revenue windfalls to come in the next 10 years that are above and beyond the Social Security surplus. We must return these tax overpayments to hard-working Americans. They should benefit from the surpluses they are paying in rather than allowing Washington to stand first in line saying, ``Let's spend your money rather than giving it back.'' 
   The logic for tax relief is fairly simple. Despite a shrinking Federal deficit and a predicted onbudget surplus, the total tax burden on working Americans today is at an all-time high. Americans today have the largest tax burden ever in history--even larger than during World War II--and the tax burden is still growing. 
   Federal taxes today consume about 21 percent of the total national income. A typical American family now pays about 40 percent in total taxes on everything they earn. That is more than it spends on food, clothing, transportation, and housing combined. So they are spending more to support Uncle Sam than they do on the basic necessities of life. It is still imperative to provide tax relief for working Americans and address our long-term fiscal imbalances. 
   Not only does this budget fund all the functions of the Government, but it also significantly increases funding for our budget priorities, such as defense, education, Medicare, agriculture, and others. 
   Although I have reservations about some new spending increases, including this conference report, I think overall the report is well balanced. 
   This conference report also retains the Senate-passed amendment that Senator GRASSLEY and I offered. This provision would reserve up to $6 billion for crop insurance reform. Including this funding increase in the budget conference report is an important step, I believe, in realizing our goal of real crop insurance reform to help ailing farmers. 
   One of the promises made during the debate of the 1996 farm bill was that Congress would address the need for a better system for crop insurance. Last year, we witnessed devastating circumstances come together in my home State of Minnesota to create a crisis atmosphere for many of our farmers and for farmers around the country, as well. We also saw the current Federal Crop Insurance Program fail for far too many farmers. Funds for crop insurance reform are the best dollars we can spend to help American agriculture, and this is a far better way to assist farmers than any of the spending that we have included in the emergency spending bills. We need to pass this. 
   Finally, Mr. President, unlike President Clinton's budget, which, again, has broken the spending caps by over $22 billion, this budget maintains the fiscal discipline by retaining the spending caps. There are those who claim we cannot avoid breaking the caps as we proceed to reconcile this budget. I say if we do our job to oversee Government programs, we will know which areas can be streamlined and which program funding can be shifted to new priorities. Let's make sure we do our job to justify all Government funds are wisely spent. 
   In closing, cutting taxes, reducing the national debt, and reforming and protecting Social Security and Medicare at the 
   same time are all possible. It is not either/or. It is not either Social Security or giving tax cuts. We can do all with what we have in the budget. This budget conference report has showed us how we can do it. 
   The bigger challenge facing us now is that we must have the strong political will to follow through on this budget. We must defend the principles and priorities highlighted in this budget blueprint through the entire appropriations and reconciliation processes, as well as in other legislative initiatives during the first session of this Congress. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues to achieve the goals set forth in this budget. Again, I commend the Senate majority leader and also committee Chairman DOMENICI for putting this budget together. 
   Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I just want to take a little time to talk today, because today is, of course, the infamous April 15 tax day. I know a lot of Americans are out there still working at the kitchen table at this time, working the pencils, trying to wade through thousands of pages, or at least dozens of pages, or all of the forms that they have trying to figure out their income tax by tonight. There are going to be long lines as people use every last minute to try to get this tax that they owe to the Federal Government in order. So that is the day that I think most Americans dread. That is April 15. 
   For many American taxpayers, it is this usual routine. By this time there are only a few hours left to complete their tax form before midnight. They are going to be rushing to the Post Office. They are going to find themselves on the late night news as their local TV stations are showing footage of all these last-minute filers dropping the envelope into the mail slot to at least meet the filing deadline and finally be done with this. 
   But even for those who file early, those who aren't going through all of this turmoil tonight, tax season, of course, is full of stress. Not only do we wade through endless paperwork but we also come face to face with the reality of just how big a bite Uncle Sam takes from us every year. 
   Mr. President, have we ever really stopped to wonder why it needs to be this way? Do we stop to consider better alternatives to the current tax system? It sure doesn't make a lot of sense to me, because our current Tax Code is outdated. It makes our tax system among the least efficient. It makes our tax system among the most oppressive in the world. Everyone knows this. And, yet, it seems to get worse every year, and we don't do anything about it. 
   When we have tried to give a little tax relief, or reform some of the Tax Code, what we have done is made it more complicated and added hundreds of pages. So we have made the tax system even worse in an effort to try to reform it and make it better. 
   Congress, of course, is the first in line to blame because of this. Thanks to a Government that does not know when to stop spending, tax collections have grown faster than our economy has grown in the past 5 years. And tax collections have grown twice as fast as the income of working Americans. So the Government is growing faster than Americans' working income. Hikes in the personal income tax--and particularly the increase in the effective tax rates--have propelled this increase in revenue. 
   As Americans are working harder to try to earn a little bit more money, our tax system is taking more away from them in doing so because our tax system pushes more of them into the higher tax brackets. 
   Since 1993, just 6 years ago, Federal taxes have increased for average workers 54 percent, which for the average taxpayer translates into about a $2,000 per year tax increase. So, if you look back at what you were paying on average in 1993 compared to what you are paying in taxes to the Federal Government today, the Federal Government is taking $2,000 a year more in taxes. As a result, Americans today have the largest tax burden, even more than in World War II, and it is still growing. 
   Federal taxes now consume nearly 21 percent of the national income. Twenty-one percent of everything produced in this country goes to Federal taxes. That is compared to just over 18 percent in 1992. So, again, over the last 6 years, Government has taken 3 percent more of national income than in 1992. 
   A typical American family today, when we say they are at the highest tax rate in history--even more than paying off and fighting in World War II--the typical American family today is paying 40 percent of its total income in taxes, more than the family spends on food, clothing, transportation, and housing combined. So they are spending more to support Uncle Sam than they are supporting their families with the necessities. And compare that to the average tax rate of only 2.75 percent in 1916 when Congress first got the  authority to level income taxes 
   from 2.75 percent in 1916 to over 40 percent for the average family today taken by Government. 
   Another comparison worth noting is that Tax Freedom Day, the day that Americans can stop working for the Government and begin working for the families: If you start working on January 1, how long into the year do you have to work to make enough money to pay the taxes that you will be responsible for for that year? For families, it was May 13 last year. Americans that started working January 1, worked until May 13 to pay their taxes, the latest date ever in history. In 1915, in comparison, Tax Freedom Day was April 3. It will probably set another record this year. 
   Despite a huge budget surplus over the next 10 years, the President, in the White House budget, has failed to offer even a single significant tax cut for working Americans. Instead, this administration's most recent budget proposes to increase taxes by at least $50 billion over the next 5 years. Even during a time of prosperity and surpluses, that is not enough for the appetite of this administration when it comes to spending. They are going to increase taxes by at least a net $50 billion over the next 5 years, $90 billion over the next decade. 
   The good news is that the budget blueprint that we passed today on the Senate floor is reserving nearly $800 billion of the nonSocial Security surplus. That is important. We are not taking any money out of Social Security dollars to use for any kind of tax relief but $800 billion of nonSocial Security surplus over the next 10 years for tax relief. 
   There are basically two streams of surplus coming into Washington: One is from payroll taxes, the Social Security money; the other is from overcharging on income taxes. We are setting aside in our lockbox the $1.8 trillion in overpayment on payroll taxes or Social Security and locking that away so it can't be spent or used for anything but Social Security. 
   The big debate is over what we will do with the other $800 billion, about 38 percent of this budget surplus. Again, the President wants to spend it, and more, over the next 10 years. We are saying it is an overcharge that should go back to the taxpayers. For Washington, this is a surplus. This is not money that Washington is entitled to. It is like finding a wallet on the sidewalk. If it has $100 in it, you can do one of two things: You can keep the money, and that would be stealing; or you could find the rightful owner and give it back. That is what Washington has done. It found the surplus and it can do one of two things: It can keep it and spend it, which would be stealing it from the taxpayers; or it can send it back to the rightful people, the taxpayers. 
   Our $800 billion of nonSocial Security surplus over the next 10 years for tax relief would be the largest tax relief since the Reagan tax cuts of the 1980s. The Reagan tax cuts in the 1980s were about $1.4 trillion over 5 years in today's dollars. This is about half and it is over twice as long. This is about 25 percent of what the Reagan tax cuts were in the 1980s, but it is something that we need to make an investment in in our society. It is like investing in research and development. We need to invest money into the economy in order for the economy to continue to grow and to produce the better jobs and the better wages that we need. We have had this unprecedented expansion in our economy over the last 18 years and most of the credit goes to the seeds that were planted with 
   the Reagan tax cuts in the early 1980s that spurred this economic growth. 
   I think that our commitment to set aside another $800 billion over 10 years to go back into the form of tax relief, investment in consumers, investment in the economy proves that this Congress is committed to providing meaningful tax relief in 1999 and, again, providing tax relief while protecting Social Security, protecting Medicare, reducing the national debt, and also funding important national priorities as well. 
   Whatever form the tax relief eventually takes, whether it is my 10-percent, across-the-board income tax cut which I have proposed in Senate bill 3, a 10-percent, across-the-board reduction in all the rates--in other words, if you owe the $4,000 in taxes this year to the Federal Government, take 10 percent off from that, keep $400 and send in $3,600. If it was $5,000, you get a $500 tax break. If it was $1,000, you get a $100 tax break. It is even, across the board 10 percent. 
   Other tax-cut provisions on the table being debated include the elimination of the marriage penalty. Again, the average couple in this country spends about $1,400 or more in taxes just because they are married. We think that is unfair. Another option is the death tax or the dreaded estate tax--cut or eliminate that. Also, a cut in the capital gains tax. Or it could be a combination of all of these or some of these. It is a fact that Washington is finally focused on tax relief. I think that is good news for Americans. 
   In our budget, we provided meaningful tax relief, earmarking $800 billion in surplus over the next 10 years to go to tax relief. Again, the $800 billion in nonSocial Security surplus represents a tax overpayment. We have to stress that. This is a tax overpayment by hard-working Americans, a tax overpayment that should be returned to them. Another way to say that, in a restaurant if your bill is $17 and you go to the counter and give $20, you expect to get the change back; if you have overpaid, you expect to get the change back. But Washington is saying, you overpaid but, jeez, like the President said in Buffalo, NY, in January, we could give the surplus back, but what if you don't spend it right? In other words, you are smart enough to earn the money, but you are too dumb to know how to spend it. The Government knows how to spend it better than you do. The Government will spend it on better things than what you could spend it on for your family--maybe braces for your children, dance lessons, to begin a college education fund, maybe repairing the furnace. Somehow, that priority does not fit into Washington's scheme, because Washington thinks maybe you won't spend it right; Washington can spend it better. 
   I believe that Americans know what is best for their families and their lives. If it is their money, they should be given the right to spend it the way they see fit to support their families. 
   A new study by the Congressional Research Service reports if we don't provide tax relief, the average household will pay $5,307 more in taxes than is needed to fund the Government. Think of what the average household can do if they could keep $5,300 more of their money, rather than sending it to Washington. Of course, maybe some believe Washington can spend it better, but the people I talk to in my home State of Minnesota believe that they would have a better place to put that money than Washington. 
   Tax relief may temporarily relieve our pain, but the Tax Code, as I said, I believe is the root of all our tax evils. It is not the employees at the IRS, it is not the agents. They are trying to labor under some very, very complicated rules and regulations of the IRS Tax Code. Again, that is Congress over the last 50 years, with one layer on top of another, on top of another, on top of another, of Tax Codes, regulations, tax breaks, incentives, special interests or whatever it might be. The IRS is trying to dig out from underneath this or at least provide the information for us to file the taxes. It is Congress that needs to get its act in gear and do something to change it. 
   We held hearings last year in the Finance Committee. Senator ROTH did a great job on showing some of the abuses in the IRS and how the code really is oppressive. It is antifamily, antigrowth, antieconomy. We did make some changes. But a few changes is like putting lipstick on a pig. The IRS still is not pretty. We need to do something more than make a few changes. 
   The Federal Tax Code stretches on for more than 7 million words. It is made up of four huge volumes, each thicker than the Bible, with another 20 volumes of regulation and thousands and thousands of pages of regulations. The Declaration of Independence took only 1,337 words to set the entire American Revolution in motion. 
   Today, we have 7 million words in our Tax Code that state how the Federal Government will collect taxes. The Government publishes 480 separate tax forms. The IRS mails out over 8 billion pages of forms and instructions  every year. Congress has revised the tax law a total of 5,400 times just since the 1986 Tax Reform Act. In 13 years, 5,400 times the Tax Code has been revised. Who could possibly keep track of all those changes? Not even the best tax lawyers and CPAs in the country understand the Tax Code completely. Not even the experts at the IRS itself can understand the Tax Code completely. Taxpayers today spend billions of dollars a year trying to comply with its dizzying rules and regulations. 
   The IRS today employs over 102,000 agents to collect taxes. Now, 102,000 agents to collect taxes, that is more agents than the FBI and the CIA have combined. So I think that is just proof that tax collection has become the primary function and goal of the Federal Government. That is the largest agency in Government, the IRS--102,000 agents to collect taxes. I guess you put the people where your priorities are. So we can see the Federal Government's priority is to collect as much in taxes from you as it can. 
   Our current tax system is antifamily, anti-economic growth; by any standards, it encourages abuse, it encourages waste, it encourages corruption. To solve this problem forever, we have to do one thing and that is uproot the current tax system. We need to replace it with one that promotes freedom, that promotes economic opportunity. We must repeal the income tax and other taxes, and we have to abolish the IRS--again, not because of the people there, but because of the system that is so complex we cannot understand it anymore. We must create a new tax system, one that is fair, a system that is simple and a system that is friendly to the taxpayers--not an adversary. There is an increasing national consensus that the current system is unfair, a system that we must end, and that the Tax Code as we know it has to be eliminated. 
   But the unresolved question is: How should we replace the Tax Code? I am a cosponsor of a bill in the Senate called the Tax Code Elimination Act, which would sunset the current Tax Code by January 1 of the year 2003--in other words, get rid of it, pull it out by the roots, say it is all done, repeal the 16th amendment, and we will start all over from scratch. 
   The White House said: That is irresponsible. How could you eliminate a Tax Code before you have something to replace it? I think we all know that Congress would never let one day go by that it did not have the ability to collect taxes. So if we had the ability to pass this bill today, Congress would work overtime, or on weekends, if it had to, in order to put a new system in place to collect that first dollar of new taxes in the year 2003. So I do not have any worries about that. 
   The biggest job is going to be finding the political will to get rid of the Tax Code we have today. There is an increasing national consensus that the current system is unfair. Ask your neighbor if he thinks this is a fair code. We must end the Tax Code as we know it today. But, again, the unresolved question is: What to do to replace the code? 
   I have been exploring alternative tax systems for quite awhile and, after considerable study of the issue, I believe the national sales tax plan is the best solution to our problems. I used to support a flat tax. I think most Americans would say a flat tax would be a good alternative. That is the one that has gotten probably the most publicity. But it needs to have a lot of examination. In fact, a couple of Congressmen in the House, Congressmen DICK ARMEY and BILLY TAUZIN, went on the road last year to about 30 different cities, doing what they called townhall meetings on tax issues and what to do to replace the current Tax Code with something else. Representative DICK ARMEY of Texas supported the flat tax, Congressman TAUZIN of Louisiana supported a national sales tax. They played to crowds of about 5,000 people or more at some of their stops. 
   So Americans are interested in this. They want to have some information, they want to know what some of the alternatives would be and how they would work. But when you 
   talk about flat tax versus national sales tax--which are probably the two leading alternatives--going into the meetings, about 75 percent said they would prefer a flat tax--again, because they have heard it most, it sounds like the most simple plan--but after an hour and a half or 2 hours of this townhall meeting, as they came out, 75 percent favored a national sales tax. 
   What we need to do is begin the debate. We need to do more than just 30 town meetings around the country. We need to do this here in the Senate. We need to be part of the campaign, to start talking about Tax Code relief or reform, so the American public at least gets some information on what the Tax Code is today, how oppressive it is, and what we can do to replace it, what are some of the alternatives. I think that is the way we need to lead in order to get some tax relief. 
   Any new tax system, I think, has to do a couple of things. First, it must restore the fundamental principles of taxation upon which this whole country was founded, and they are low taxes and limiting the taxing power of Government. It must fairly and efficiently distribute the burden of funding our Government. It must promote economic growth, not be anti-economic growth. It must present less of a compliance burden, and that is, again, not having to spend billions of dollars a year, every year, just to be able to fill out the tax forms and meet that requirement. And it has to offer every American better economic opportunity. The national sales tax would do that. 
   The national sales tax system, which I intend to introduce soon, with other Senators, I think meets these very important criteria. It is fairer, more simple, it is friendlier, it will increase economic growth, it will increase investment, it will help with capital formation, and it will create new jobs and savings. 
   Under the national sales tax system, working Americans will be able to keep 100 percent of their pay, their pension, or Social Security check. They no longer need to file a tax return with the IRS. Their family's finances are not revealed to Government bureaucrats. They will not be penalized for getting or staying married, and they will not be penalized, by the way, for dying either. Everyone will pay the same tax rate without loopholes, without any special interest groups. There will not be any hidden taxes, and everybody will easily understand the tax. They will be able to understand exactly how much they are paying in taxes. And, finally, it will abolish the IRS completely. 
   Does this sound too good to be true? It may sound that way, but believe me, it is real. Let me briefly highlight how the national sales tax legislation would be able to achieve this. 
   First, the legislation will call for the repeal of the constitutional amendment that created the tax nightmare that we find ourselves in today. Mr. President, the 16th amendment is the root of the tax evil. It abandoned our Founding Fathers' original principle of taxation by giving the Government unlimited power to tax the private income of American people. Without the repeal of this amendment, any tax system will eventually become abusive and intrusive. First and foremost, get rid of the 16th amendment. 
   Second, the legislation will repeal the income tax. It will get rid of the payroll tax, the estate tax, the gift tax, 
   the capital gains tax, the self-employment tax, the corporate tax, and all the other taxes out there. 
   Third, the legislation will impose a single rate on all new goods and services at the point of final purchase, the final point of purchase for consumption, and it will provide a universal rebate in the amount equal to the sales tax paid on essential goods and services such as food and medicines. 
   So, in other words, for low-income or whatever the income is, if you are saying you cannot do this because you are going to be charging more on foods and medicines and necessities, that is not true. There will be a rebate for that. But it is a single rate on all new goods and services at the point of final purchase for consumption. Every American will be better off under the national sales tax system. I believe it will create expanded economic opportunities for our Nation and for our people. 
   The process of implementing the national sales tax system is going to be a long one. There is going to be a lot of debate. So in the interim we must reduce the tax burden on overtaxed Americans. I think a lot of us would like to go to eliminating the IRS tomorrow if we could, and cement in  place a new tax system. But what do we do in the interim, until that debate is completed, before we can make that happen, before we can begin putting in a fair, simple, friendly tax system? I think that is why our budget includes the $800 billion of tax relief now. This is interim tax relief, but we have to make sure our residents, our workers, at least have some relief from the burden they are paying--again, the highest in the history of taxes. 
   For those taxpayers who are satisfied with the current system, I wish them the best of luck in preparing their taxes this year. For others, like the hundreds of Minnesotans who tell me they are tired of filling out the complex and endless tax forms, who tell me they do not think it is fair that the Government takes so much of their hard-earned dollars, I invite you to join me in rethinking our tax system. I think we can work together now to create a new and more fair way to fund the Federal Government, one that ultimately makes April 15 just another day, just another day of the year, and not this day that everybody dreads and hates and is now spending many hours, tonight, trying to figure out exactly what they owe in taxes. 
   Again, I do not know if 40 percent is a fair amount of income to pay to the Federal Government. I do a lot of town meetings, or talk with students. I always like to ask a question to start with: What do you think is a fair percentage of your income that should go to support government? We all need a good government. This is not about getting rid of the government. This is not getting rid of the Federal, State, or local governments. But what is an adequate amount of money to fund the Government, and what kind of services should we demand the Government provide with those tax dollars, not the waste and abuse that is in the system today. Today, if the system runs out of money, they just add more money to it, not look at where the abuse is, whether the money is being spent right. Are we overpaying for services we do not get? 
   This Government has never had to do what business has to do, and that is, look at how we can provide a service at the least possible cost. If they run out of money, they just want to raise taxes again, raise taxes again, raise taxes again. 
   When I ask this question at townhall meetings or at town meetings in high schools, of course some will say zero percent. That is not rational. But then we get into the basics, and it usually comes out, people say around 15, 20, maybe 25 percent of their income should go to support all levels of government--Federal, State, and local. But then you tell them they are spending, today, 40 percent of their income to support government. 
   So, for all of those who are filling out their taxes tonight or have time to take a look at your pay stubs, take a look at exactly how much you are spending on taxes, and then you can figure in the sales tax, your property tax, all the other taxes that you pay, and just find out how much of your income is going to support government. 
   Again, for the average family in this country, they are spending more to support Uncle Sam than they are spending on the necessities; That is, food, clothing, shelter, and transportation, and even, in most cases, recreation combined. So the Government is taking a bigger bite out of their paycheck than their family is getting. I think it is time we look at this and find how we can reduce this and allow hard-working Americans to keep a little bit more of their money in their pockets rather than sending it to Washington. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator ROTH as an original co-sponsor of legislation to amend Section 45 of the tax code for the production of electricity from environmentally-friendly methods, including poultry litter, the Poultry Electric Power Act. 
   Mr. President, our nation's poultry consumption continues to grow in rapid numbers. We now produce almost 8 billion chickens a year in the United States. My home State of Minnesota is now the nation's largest producer of turkeys, with an estimated 44 million produced last year alone. According to the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association, Minnesota turkey producers and processors earned 1997 incomes of $180 million and spinoff industries earned $374 million in 1996. In Minnesota, the turkey industry includes 2,810 jobs in production and 4,552 jobs in processing. So, Mr. President, you can see that the poultry industry is extremely important to rural Minnesota. 
   I continue to believe that we must explore a wide variety of alternative energy sources that provide a number of benefits for our nation. First, this bill will provide another market and revenue source for our farmers who so badly need diversified sources of income. Second, the bill will assist our nation in increasing our energy security. Third, this bill will help to improve the environment not only by providing a clean energy source, but by assisting in the disposal of poultry manure in an environmentally friendly way. Fourth, this bill will help create spin-off jobs for our nation's rural communities--jobs many rural communities badly need. 
   I hope my colleagues will support this legislation and I want to thank Senator ROTH for leading this important effort in the Senate.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, again, what I am talking about is supporting the middle-income tax relief included in this budget resolution. This is a crucial amendment that we all should support. 
   This amendment says that the Senate Budget Resolution places a priority not only on protecting Social Security and Medicare and reducing the Federal debt, but also on middle-income tax relief by returning nearly $800 billion of the non-Social Security surplus to those from whom it was taken. It discusses options for middle-income tax relief such as broad-based tax relief, marriage penalty relief, retirement savings incentives, death tax relief, health care-related tax relief, and education-related tax relief. 
   This amendment does not put us on record as supporting any one form of tax relief, or any particular combination. That is the task of the Finance Committee under the able leadership of Senator ROTH.  
   While many of us will discuss our own preferences for the tax relief, our job today is to support the nearly $800 billion total, recognizing the need for tax relief, and then to ask the Finance Committee to come up with specific tax relief proposals. 
   Again, Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment is to assure the American people that we've made a commitment to major tax relief, and that there is room in this budget to fulfill this commitment while protecting Social Security and Medicare, providing debt relief and respecting some new spending priorities. 
   I just heard it said in the last debate on the farm issues, ``if there is something for a tax cut,'' or ``if that is a priority''--it should be a priority. There would not be a surplus if American taxpayers had not been overcharged and paid more in taxes than they should have. What they are doing is fighting over how can they spend those dollars, rather than trying to find a way to give those overcharges back to the people who paid them. 
    Mr. President, let me highlight a few points as to why we must provide a major tax relief this year. 
   Polls showed many Americans were skeptical about whether they would ever get meaningful tax relief this year. They have good reason to be skeptical about President Clinton's rhetoric on tax relief. 
   Despite a huge on-budget surplus over the next 10 years, President Clinton has failed to secure a single significant tax cut for working Americans. Instead, he has proposed to increase our taxes by at least $50 billion in his budget over the next five years and $90 billion over 10 years. He also spends $158 billion right out of the Social Security surplus he claims to protect. President Clinton talks about helping the American people build retirement security but to offset his new spending, he has proposed many new taxes including taxing life insurance products, which will hurt the retirement annuities of millions of Americans. The President talked about helping small business, but he has proposed to tax the income of non-profit trade associations and change the tax treatment for ESOPs, which will adversely affect millions of small businesses. These are just some of his new taxes that will hurt hard-working Americans. 
   Unlike President Clinton, our budget resolution has reserved nearly $800 billion of the non-Social Security budget surplus over the next 10 years for tax relief. This is in fact the largest tax relief since President Reagan's. This amendment has once again proved the Republican majority is committed to providing meaningful tax relief in 1999 as well as protecting Social Security, Medicare, reducing the debt, and funding important priorities. 
    Mr. President, with more middle-income workers being thrown into higher tax brackets, the ``middle class tax squeeze'' is devastating. There are over 20 million workers today with annual earnings between $20,000 and $50,000. Before 1993, they paid income tax at the 15 percent rate. But most of them have now been pushed into the 28 percent tax bracket due to inflation and economic growth. Worse still, they have to pay the 28 percent federal income tax rate on top of a 15.3 percent payroll tax. This adds up to a tax rate of 43 percent, without counting state, local tax, and other taxes. So any gains they made in wages have been taken by Washington. The bigger tax bite continues to eat up more of their wages. 
   Again, my point, Mr. President, is that this non-Social Security surplus is nothing but tax overpayments, and it should be returned to the taxpayers, not spent, as you are going to hear argued here on the floor day after day, hour after hour--``let's spend it.'' It should be given back to the taxpayers. 
   How to use the remaining surplus once we wall off Social Security has been the central focus of this year's budget debate. The Democrats want Washington to spend it because they don't believe the American people can be trusted to use it responsibly. We're heard it before, but let me remind you  what the President said about the surplus during a speech in Buffalo in January: ``We could give it all back to you and hope you spend it right, [but[ if you don't *.*.*.'' You are smart enough to earn the money, but you are not quite smart enought to know how to spend it. 
   A top aide to the President, Paul Begala, said, ``We could squander the surplus by giving a tax cut.'' 
   So, in other words, we have overcharged you and taken more money from you than we should have, or you have paid more in, but to give it back would be squandering it. Washington thinks they should spend it. 
   Republicans want to give the surplus back to working Americans--those who paid too much taxes in the first place. 
   We've recently heard some claims on the Senate floor that the American people today aren't interested in tax relief. That's not what I'm seeing and hearing. Those who don't care about tax relief are a minority, especially in my state. Tax relief continues to be a major interest of Minnesotans. 
   Mr. President, let me read to you letters from just three of the many Minnesotans who have taken time to contact me: Ken Ebensteiner from Audubon, Minnesota wrote: ``*.*.*.please understand that the silent majority are sick and tired of all the taxes and regulations. We're just too busy working to voice our opinions.'' Taxpayers are working, and don't have the time to come to Washington. They can't afford to defend themselves because the government takes so much of their income. Washington's philosophy is apparently, ``Keep them poor, keep them quiet, keep them home.'' 
   Rev. Craig Palach of Fergus Falls wrote: ``With four children--two soon to be in college, one beginning to think about college, and one in a parochial school--I could sure use some of the money that goes to taxes.'' But again, the President says Rev. Craig Palach wouldn't spend it right. 
   The third letter, this one by Alicia Jones of White Bear Lake, is right on target with the story she shared. She wrote:  
   Last year, both my husband and I had graduated from college and had just begun working full time. I have never written a letter like this before, but after completing my taxes for 1998, I felt that this was my only option. 
   I can't do anything about the amount of money my husband and I will have to pay to both the federal and state governments, but I hope that you can be active in making changes for next year. 
   During 1998, my husband and I both worked full time in professional careers. We have no children and we are renting an apartment, saving to buy a house. Based on the fact that we both work, we are married, we have no children, and that we do not own a house--when we filed our taxes this year we owed approximately $700 more in federal income taxes, on top of the over $10,000 that we have already had taken out of our paychecks.*.*.*. 
   I am frustrated by this, I'm frustrated for the future--how do we get ahead, when each year we have to take money from our savings to pay more for our taxes. I hope that you will remember my concern.  
   But again, presidential aide Paul Begala says Alicia would ``squander'' any tax cut. 
   Working people have good reason to ask for a tax cut. Since 1993, Federal taxes have increased by 50 percent--50 percent. That is a tax increase of nearly $4,000 a year for a Alicia and her husband--50 percent; $4,000 more in the last 6 years. As a result, Americans today have the largest tax burden since World War II, and it is still growing. 
   Federal taxes consume now 21 percent of the total national income. A typical American family pays nearly 40 percent in total taxes. And that is more than it spends on food, clothing, and shelter combined. 
   People should go home and look at their pay stubs and find out exactly how much of their money is going to support Government, and how much they have left. And then figure out whether they should have a tax cut. 
   Mr. President, why should we continue taxing middle-class Americans at such a high rate? Who can rightfully argue that they don't need a tax cut? Who can argue that it is fair to take more than 40 percent of a person's income so Government can spend it? 
   That is why I, along with Senator ROTH and others, introduced bill No. S. 3, the Tax Cuts for All Americans Act. Our bill calls for a 10-percent across-the-board income tax for working Americans. 
   It is simple, fair, profamily, and progrowth. It will help millions of middle-income families to avoid the middle-income ``real income bracket creep'' that they have been subjected to since 1993. 
   Although I prefer broad-based tax relief, I understand this is just one of many tax relief proposals that are on the table. Again, there is nothing in this budget that endorses one proposal over the others. All we have done is to reserve some of the non-Social Security surplus for tax relief. 
   The Finance Committee will consider all tax relief proposals and decide how this reserved onbudget surplus should be distributed. 
   It is my hope that we can use the surplus to provide broad-based tax relief as well as other tax relief I support which would give families a break, and encourage savings, encourage investment, and provide incentives for higher education. 
   I remember vividly when I first proposed the $500-per-child tax credit back in 1993. The naysayers called it bad policy, even dangerous. Democrats accused us of cutting taxes for the rich. That sounds familiar, doesn't it? Every time it is a tax cut, it is for somebody else. 
   Some in Congress contended it was too costly, and others argued that we should balance the budget first. I argued then repeatedly that we could, and should, do both. And we did. As a result, we now have a balanced budget, and the largest non-Social Security surplus in U.S. history. 
   Cutting taxes, reducing the national debt, and reforming and protecting Social Security and Medicare at the same time are all possible. We can to it again. Mr. President, we must do it again. 
   That is what this budget is about, and that is what this amendment is about. I urge my colleagues to strongly support reserving this money for tax relief for working Americans. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, as we begin debating the budget which takes us into the twenty first century, I am disappointed that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to practice the Medicare politics of the past. 
   Over the course of the last week, I've heard member after member come to the Senate floor to decry the Republican budget for allegedly throwing our nation's seniors into destitution by sacrificing Medicare in order to pay for tax cuts. 
   Mr. President, as we listen to this discussion about the budget and the Medicare provisions contained within it, I keep coming back to one simple question. If the President's budget plan was so good for the country and saved Medicare, why did every member of his party on the Budget Committee vote against it? There is only one answer: President Clinton's so-called Medicare set-aside of 15 percent of the budget would do absolutely nothing to address the very real problems facing Medicare and we all know that. 
   Indeed, the General Accounting Office (GAO), which we depend upon to provide impartial testimony, investigations and research, has concluded President Clinton's Medicare plan is meaningless in terms of either the budget or the Medicare program. This corroborates the conclusions reached by the Congressional Budget Office. 
   Mr. President, Medicare has always used the 2.9 percent payroll tax on a worker's wages to pay for current benefits. It has been so since the program was enacted in 1965 and its crafters intended it to stay that way. 
   The president, by promising to use projected surpluses and general funds to shore up the 
   Medicare program, is in fact promising to use ``IOU's'' to shore up ``IOU's'' and altering the premise under which Medicare was enacted. 
   I was and is supposed to be a self-sustaining program paid for by payroll taxes. It is not funded by general revenues, therefore Democrat charges that our tax relief out of the non-Social Security surplus comes at the expense of Medicare is just not true. Our tax relief returns overpaid income taxes. It does not cut the Social Security or Medicare payroll tax that funds Social Security or Medicare. The use of general funds to prop-up the program reverts it to a general welfare-type program which was soundly rejected in the early 1960's. 
   So adding more IOU's, as the President would like us to do, does nothing but add more meaningless pieces of paper which don't represent any new cash within the program to pay for health care services. In short, it is a hoax played upon the American people by its government which doesn't save Medicare. 
   The budget resolution before us today provides for $10 billion more for the Medicare program than the President requested. It locks away Social Security surpluses to protect them from being spent on non-Social Security programs. It also prepares us for the real task at hand--reforming Social Security and Medicare to ensure they will be self-sustaining for future beneficiaries. 
   Under our plan, all of the projected Social Security surpluses are saved solely for Social Security. Of the non-Social Security surplus, over $100 billion is set-aside in the event it is needed during the important process of reforming the Medicare program we will soon address. The $100 billion set-aside is real money, not paper promises. It represents real assets which can put us on the road to modernizing a crucially important health care program that has been struck in the 1960's.  
   The practice of medicine has changed dramatically since the Medicare program was enacted. It's time we reformed Medicare to more accurately reflect our health care system, which still provide the most efficient and sought-after care in the world. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to working with Senator BREAUX, who ably co-chaired the Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare, to address the long term solvency crisis in Medicare. I whole-heartedly agree with my colleague from Louisiana when he said that ``Medicare cannot, should not, and must not be a `wedge' issue. That is old politics and the old way of looking at this problem. Looking at it in that fashion has led us to never solve it with any serious reform since it was passed in 1965. The issue for the 1990's and the 21st century cannot be a tax cut versus saving Medicare. That is an improper statement of the problem facing this Congress....... It is not an either/or situation and should not be made to be so.'' 
   Clearly, Senator BREAUX and my colleagues have the best interest of the Medicare program in mind as we consider this budget. He understands tax relief does not conflict with our goal to reform Medicare. By setting aside over $100 billion for the express purpose of funding the reformation of the Medicare program, we do more to ensure the viability of the health care program for our nation's seniors than the President's budget full of empty promises. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to support this responsible, truthful and meaningful budget resolution. It protects Social Security and Medicare, provides major tax relief and debt reduction and it continues important spending priorities. It represents a tremendous step in the right direction for the United States and its people.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of sending a strong anti-drug message during consideration of the Fiscal Year 2000 Budget Resolution. 
   As we approach the new millennium, one of the most difficult challenges facing our country is the sale, manufacture and distribution of illegal drugs. Drug abuse is a daily threat to the lives of young people and the health and safety of our families. We must strengthen our resolve to developing and innovative and effective drug strategy. 
   The National Institute on Drug Abuse recently reported that 54 percent  of high school seniors reported illegal use of a drug at least once in their lives, 42 percent reported use of an illegal drug in the past year and 26 percent reported use of an illegal drug in the past month. Clearly the American people need Congress to recommit this nation to ridding our schools and streets of drugs. 
   I believe that our nation can reverse these troubling trends in drug abuse and decrease the number of Americans who use drugs. First and foremost, we must enforce our existing drug laws. Second, we must make a commitment to public education and community-based prevention programs, as well as effective treatment for those drug abusers who are motivated enough to accept treatment. We must ensure that local communities and law enforcement agencies have the tools to develop effective drug prevention and education programs. In my view, adequate funding for programs such as the Byrne grant program, the federal ``Weed and Seed'' initiative and the ``Drug Free Communities Act'' program is critical to providing resources and guidance to local communities in my home state of Minnesota to help develop solutions to this problem and expand their anti-drug education and prevention programs. 
   And finally, we must actively support the eradication and interdiction of drugs before they reach our borders. Illegal drugs are easy to find and cheap to buy. And there is no doubt that contributes to the high rate of drug use among our nation's children. We've got to invest this nation's resources in making sure more of these drugs never reach our shores. If we can reduce the supply of drugs, the price will go up. If we can reduce the supply of drugs, they'll be harder to find, and fewer American children will fall into drug use. That is why the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act and the Drug Free Century Act is so important. A counter-drug strategy which does not give sufficient weight to international interdiction and eradication efforts cannot succeed. 
   The federal government must continue to work closely with local officials to combat the threat of illegal drug use, trafficking, and manufacturing to our children's future. A united commitment by Congress, parents, schools, city councils, faith-based organizations and medical institutions will help to create a drug-free America. Failure to act will only increase the likelihood that we will lose control of our neighborhoods to drug-related crime and violence.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I join Senator ABRAHAM, Chairman of the Judiciary Immigration Subcommittee, Mr. President. Minnesota and Michigan are two states which share a common border with Canada, and so I am proud to join my colleague, Senator ABRAHAM as co-sponsor of his bill to ensure Canada will continue to receive current treatment of its traveling citizens by requiring a feasibility study of Section 110 of the IIRIRA bill. There has been great concern, especially in Minnesota as to how the immigration law we passed in 1996 will affect the northern U.S. border. Right now the fear is the law is being misinterpreted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
   Minnesota has about 817 miles of shared border with Canada and we share many interests with our northern neighbor--tourism, trade and family visits among the most prevalent. In the last few years, passage back and forth over the Minnesota/Canadian border has been more open and free flowing, especially since the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) went into effect. There were 116 million travelers entering the U.S. from Canada in 1996 over the land border. As our relationship with Canada is increasingly interwoven, we have sought a less restrictive access to each country. 
   The Immigration Bill of 1996 was intended to focus on illegal aliens entering this country from Mexico and living in the United States illegally. The new law states that ``every alien'' entering and leaving the United States would have to register at all the borders--land, sea and air. The Immigration and Naturalization Service was tasked with the effort to set up automated pilot sites along the border to discover the most effective way to implement this law, which was to become effective on September 30, 1998. 
   The INS was quietly going about establishing a pilot site on the New York State border when the reality sunk in. A flood of calls from constituents came into the offices of all of us serving Canadian border states. Canadian citizens and the Canadian government, also, registered opposition to this new restriction. It became quite clear that no one had considered how the new law affected Canada. Current law already waives the document requirement for most Canadian nationals, but still requires certain citizens to register at border crossings. That system has worked. There have been very few problems at the northern border with drug trafficking and illegal aliens. 
   In an effort to resolve this situation, I joined other Senators in a letter to INS Commissioner Meissner asking for her interpretation of this law. Other bills were introduced addressing this issue in the last Congress and action was taken extending the implementation of this Section until March 30, 2001. 
   However, today, we must make it very clear that Congress did not intend to impose additional documentary requirements on Canadian nationals; Senator ABRAHAM's bill will restore our intent. 
   This legislation will not precipitously open the flood gates for illegal aliens to pass through--it will still require those who currently need documentation to continue to produce it and remain registered in a new INS system. This will allow the INS to keep track of that category of non-immigrant entering our country to ensure they leave when their visas expire. Senator ABRAHAM's bill will not unfairly treat our friends on the Canadian side that have been deemed not to need documentation--they will still be able to pass freely back and forth across the border. 
   But this bill will enable us to avoid the huge traffic jams and confusion  which would no doubt occur if every alien was to be registered in and out of the U.S. Such registration would discourage trade and visits to our country. It would delay shipments of important industrial equipment, auto parts, services and other shared ventures that have long thrived along the northern border. It will discourage the economic revival that northern Minnesotans are experiencing, helped by Canadian shoppers and tourists. 
   Mr. President, I do not believe Congress intended to create this new mandate. We sought to keep illegal aliens and illegal drugs out, not our trading partners and visiting consumers. Through the Abraham bill, we will still do that while keeping the door opened to our neighbors from the north. The bill is good foreign policy, good public policy and good economic policy. We all will benefit while retaining our ability to keep track of non-immigrants who enter our borders. 
   Mr. President, I thank Senator ABRAHAM for his leadership on this important matter. Many Minnesotans, through letters, calls and personal appeals, have showed their opposition to a potential crisis. This is, also, an unacceptable burden on our Canadian neighbors and those who depend upon their free access that effects the economics of all border states.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for increasing public awareness about the dangers of inhalant abuse. I am proud to be a cosponsor of S. Res. 47, recently passed by the Senate, which designates this week as ``National Inhalants and Poisons Awareness Week.'' 
   Our nation's drug control policy correctly places emphasis upon finding solutions for combating the illegal sale, manufacture and trafficking of well-known abused substances such as cocaine and methamphetamine. However, I believe Congress and the President should do more to focus attention on an emerging but equally dangerous threat--inhalant abuse. 
   As my colleagues may know, inhalant abuse is the intentional breathing of gas or vapors for the purpose of reaching a high. Most people are familiar with common household products such as furniture polish, paint thinner, glue, felt tip markers, and deodorants. However, many families are not aware of how misuse of these inhalants by children can result in sickness or death. 
   Far too often, these inhalants have caused heart, brain, and liver damage in thousands of children across the country. Sadly, many children have died as a result of inhalant abuse, a condition known as Sudden Sniffing Death Syndrome. In 1990, four young people in my home state of Minnesota died in separate incidents after experimenting with inhalants. Continued misuse of these products may also lead to additional illicit drug use. 
   Additionally, the National Institute on Drug Abuse reported in 1996 that one in five American teenagers have used inhalants to get high. Over the  last few years, our nation has witnessed an increase in new inhalant abusers from 382,000 in 1991 to an estimated 805,000 in 1996. In my view, these troubling trends can be reversed by educating the public about the dangers of this abuse and encouraging communities to develop effective treatment and prevention programs. 
   In my view, greater awareness of inhalant abuse can best be achieved through passage of S. 609, legislation introduced by Senator FRANK MURKOWSKI that would amend the Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities Act of 1994 to include inhalant abuse among the Act's definition of ``substance abuse.'' Passage of this bill will give Minnesota and other states the opportunity to develop federally-funded inhalant abuse prevention and education programs. Importantly, these programs will be based on the active involvement of parents, teachers and local communities. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation which is an important element of our war on drugs. 
   Mr. President, the federal government should not regulate the sale of these legal and inexpensive products which are found in almost every household. Instead, communities, parents and teachers should be encouraged to develop local solutions to this problem. A united effort toward this epidemic will help the United States make significant progress in our fight against drug abuse.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I wanted to take about 15 seconds. 
   We have heard time after time from speaker after speaker on the other side of the aisle that somehow the Republican budget doesn't protect or set aside money for Social Security. We set aside all the Social Security surpluses. It is earmarked in a lockbox for Social Security. So that is not what we are saying. One good thing about our budget is we don't spend it. The President, under his budget, spends $158 billion of the Social Security surplus. Our budget doesn't. So I think we do a better job on securing and saving Social Security. 
   I would like to yield to my friend from Missouri.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the safe-deposit box amendment to lock in any future Social Security surpluses to be used only for Social Security benefits, Social Security reform and national debt reduction. I am pleased to join Senators ABRAHAM, DOMENICI, and ASHCROFT in offering this amendment. 
   Mr. President, we all agree that Social Security is facing a fast-approaching crisis and fundamental reforms are needed to save and strengthen the nation's retirement system. The question is, how do we proceed? 
   President Clinton unveiled his Social Security proposal under his FY 2000 budget. The bottom line on his plan is that it allows the government to control the retirement dollars of the American people by investing it for them. 
   It does nothing, however, to save Social Security from bankruptcy. Worse still, despite his rhetoric of saving every penny for Social Security, President Clinton has proposed to take $158 billion in Social Security dollars to finance government programs unrelated to Social Security. Let me say that again--under the President's budget, he proposes to take $158 billion from the Social Security surplus fund and spend it on other unrelated government programs. That is not saving Social Security first. 
   The only positive aspect of his proposal is that the President has admitted the insolvency of Social Security and has recognized the power of the markets to generate a better rate of return, and therefore improve benefits. 
   The fundamental problem with our Social Security system is that it's basically a Ponzi scheme--that is, a pay-as-you-go pyramid that takes the retirement dollars of today's workers to pay benefits for today's retirees. 
   It has no real assets and makes no real investment. With changing demographics that translate into fewer and fewer workers supporting each retiree, the system has begun to collapse. 
   Social Security operates on a cash-in and cash-out basis. In 1998, American workers paid $517 billion into the system, but most of the money, $391 billion, was immediately paid out to 44 million beneficiaries the same year. That left a $126 billion surplus. The total accumulated surplus in the trust fund is $750 billion. 
   Unfortunately, this surplus is only on paper. The government has consumed all the $750 billion for non-Social Security related programs. All it has is the Treasury IOUs that fit in four ordinary brown accordian-style folders that one can easily hold in both hands. 
   So when Social Security begins to run a deficit, the government has to do a couple of things. The government has to either tighten its belt, raise taxes, or borrow more from the public, or it has to lower benefits or raise the retirement age. 
   There is a lot of double-counting and double talk in President Clinton's Social Security framework. The truth of the matter is the President spends the same money twice and claims that he has saved Social Security. 
   All the President has done is create a second set of the IOUs to the trust fund. It is like taking the money he owes Paul out of one pocket and applying it to the money he owes Peter in the other pocket, and then pretending that he has doubled his money and is now able to pay them both. 
   In addition, the President has proposed to spend $58 billion of Social Security money in FY 2000 for his new government spending. Over the next five years, he will spend $158 billion of Social Security money. 
   President Clinton's plan does not live up to his claim of saving Social Security. He has not pushed back the date for when the Social Security trust fund will begin real deficit spending. That date is still the same--2013. Social Security will have a shortfall that year and it the shortfall will continue to grow larger year after year. 
   By 2025, the shortfall will be over $360 billion a year and by 2035, it will explode to $786 billion, but by 2055, the deficit will run as high as $2.07 trillion. 
   Since the government has spent the surplus and has not set aside money to make up for this shortfall, it will have to raise taxes to cover the gap--something that economists estimate will require a doubling of the payroll tax. 
   The proposal by the President to have the government invest a portion of the Social Security Trust Funds is no solution. It would give the government unwarranted new powers over our economy, and it will not provide retirees the rate of return they deserve.  
   In last year's Humphrey-Hawkins hearing, I asked Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan whether we should allow the government to invest the Social Security Trust Funds in the markets, and if this is the right direction in which we should be going. Here are his exact words: 
   No, I think it's very dangerous ..... I don't know of any way that you can essentially insulate government decision-makers from having access to what will amount to very large investments in American private industry ..... 
   I am fearful that we are taking on a position here, at least in conjecture, that has very far-reaching, potential danger for a free American economy and a free American society. 
   It is a wholly different phenomenon of having private investment in the market, where individuals own the stock and vote the claims on management, (from) having government (doing so). 
   I know there are those who believe it can be insulated from the political process, they go a long way to try to do that. I have been around long enough to realize that that is just not credible and not possible. Somewhere along the line, that breach will be broken.  
   Mr. President, Chairman Greenspan is right. We should never venture out onto what the Chairman calls ``a slippery slope of extraordinary magnitude.'' 
   It is going to take real reform, not Washington schemes, to help provide security in retirement for all Americans. The first essential step is to stop raiding from the Social Security Trust Funds, and truly preserve and protect the Social Security surplus to be used exclusively for Social Security. This is exactly what this safe-deposit box amendment will achieve. This amendment would first take Social Security completely out of the Federal budget and it requires the surplus to be used only for Social Security benefits, Social Security reform and debt reduction. It creates a super-majority point of order for using this surplus for other purposes. The amendment also ensures all Social Security benefits will be paid in full. 
   Many of us in Congress agree with the President that we should, and indeed must, devote the entire Social Security surplus to saving Social Security, not just to talk about it, but do it; not spend the money, but to set it aside. However, his plan does not do what he says while ours does. Again, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to strongly support the tax relief and debt reduction lockbox amendment offered by my good friend, Senator CRAPO of Idaho. We have worked a long time together, as he mentioned, both in the House and now in the Senate. We need to continue to push these efforts to reduce the tax burdens on Americans. 
   This amendment would lock in any additional non-Social Security surplus into the outyears for tax relief and/or for debt reduction. 
   Before I speak on this amendment, I would like to take this opportunity to commend Chairman DOMENICI for his leadership in crafting and delivering this well-balanced budget. I believe this budget blueprint is a great achievement of this Congress and it will ensure our continued economic growth and prosperity as we move into the next century. 
   Mr. President, protecting Social Security, reducing the national debt and reducing taxes are imperative for our economic security and growth. Our strong economy has offered us an historic opportunity to achieve this three-pronged goal. 
   Chairman DOMENICI has ably showed us in his budget how we can provide major tax relief while still preserving Social Security and dramatically reducing the national debt. 
   President Clinton has proposed to spend over $158 billion of the Social Security surplus in his budget over the next 5 years for unrelated Government programs, instead of protecting Social Security. 
   This budget includes a safe-deposit box to lock in every penny of the $1.8 trillion Social Security surplus earned in the next 10 years to be used exclusively for Social Security. 
   Stopping the Government from raiding the Social Security Trust Fund is an essential first step to ensure that Social Security will be there for current beneficiaries, baby boomers and our children and grandchildren. I am pleased that this is the No. 1 priority under this budget. 
   It is also notable, Mr. President, that under this budget, the debt held by the public will be reduced dramatically, much more than what President Clinton has proposed in his budget. 
   This budget also reserves nearly $800 billion of the projected non-Social Security surplus--the tax overpayments of working Americans--for tax relief. This is the largest tax relief that has been enacted since the leadership of President Ronald Reagan. 
   As one who has long championed major tax relief, I am pleased that we have finally achieved some meaningful proposal in reducing our tax burden again. 
   Not only does this budget fund all the functions of the Government, but it also significantly increases funding for our budget priorities, such as defense, for education, for Medicare, for agriculture, and others. 
   In addition, Mr. President, unlike President Clinton's budget, which has broken the spending caps by over $22 billion, this budget maintains the fiscal discipline by retaining the spending caps. 
   There are those who claim we cannot avoid breaking the caps as we proceed to reconcile this budget. But I say if we do our job to oversee Government programs, we will know which areas can be streamlined and which program funding can be better shifted to new priorities. Let's make sure we do our job to justify all Government funds are wisely spent. 
   I am particularly pleased, Mr. President, that this budget has included one of my proposals which would allow us to lock in for immediate tax relief any additional on-budget surplus as re-estimated in July by the Congressional Budget Office of fiscal year 2000. 
   I believe this amendment offered by Senator CRAPO and myself is solid protection for the American taxpayers. I thank Chairman DOMENICI also for including my proposal in his budget as well. 
   As the economy continues to be strong, we may have more revenue windfalls to come in the outyears that are above and beyond what this budget resolution has assumed. We also need to lock in these windfalls and we also need to return these tax overpayments to hard-working Americans. 
   The logic for this amendment is fairly simple. Despite a shrinking Federal deficit and a predicted on-budget surplus, the total tax burden on working Americans is at an all-time high. It is still imperative to provide major tax relief for working Americans and address our long-term fiscal imbalances. 
   We need to give back any additional on-budget surplus generated by economic growth to working Americans, and we need to do it in the form of tax relief and debt reduction. 
   That is exactly what our amendment intends to achieve. This amendment would lock in any additional non-Social Security surplus--again, not Social Security surplus, but income tax surplus--that may be generated in the outyears which exceed the levels assumed under this budget. 
   All we are saying is, if our economic growth produces more increased revenues than we expect, these revenues should be reserved and protected for the taxpayers in the form of tax relief and/or debt reduction. It should not be there for the Government to spend it as it pleases. 
   One question we should ask ourselves before we decide how to spend any non-Social Security surplus is where the budget surplus comes from. The CBO has showed us precisely where we will get our revenues in the next 10 years. 
   The data indicates that the greatest share of the projected budget surplus comes directly from income taxes paid  by the taxpayers. Again, this is their money. There is no excuse not to reserve it and then return it to the people who paid it. 
   If we don't lock in this surplus to the taxpayers, we all know that Washington will soon spend it all, leaving nothing for tax relief or the vitally important task of maintaining our long-term fiscal health. 
   Such spending will only enlarge the Government. It will only make it even more expensive to support in the future. And it will create an even higher tax burden than working Americans bear today. 
   Mr. President, I applaud the creation of the safe-deposit box for future Social Security surpluses to protect retirement security for our Nation's retirees. 
   But I also believe we need to create a safe-deposit box of a similar mechanism to lock in any additional on-budget surplus for tax relief and/or debt reduction beyond the fiscal year 2000 re-estimate that is in the resolution. 
   The Congressional Budget Office reports that by 2012, we will have eliminated all the debt held by the public and we will begin to accumulate assets. By 2020, the share of net assets to GDP is expected to reach 12 percent. This is great news. 
   However, I believe we should use some of the on-budget surplus from the general fund to accelerate debt reduction. Currently we pay about $220 billion a year in interest. We saw from Senator VOINOVICH, in his charts, tonight how much we are spending every year just to pay the interest on the debt. 
   The sooner we eliminate the debt, the more revenue we will have in hand to reform Social Security, to reduce our tax burden and to finance our priority programs. This amendment will help us to achieve that goal. 
   We have also heard some say that Americans do not want tax relief. I hear that often: ``Americans don't want tax relief.'' Clearly they are completely out of touch with working Americans, and this is not what I hear when I listen to Minnesotans when I am at home. 
   A poll conducted by Pew Research Center shows that 53 percent of the American people say that the budget surplus should be used for a tax cut. Fifty-three percent want a tax cut. Only 34 percent say that it should be used for additional Government programs. 
   An Associated Press poll taken by ICR is even more specific. The following question was asked:  
   President Clinton and Congress have predicted big budget surpluses in the next few years. Both sides want to set aside more than half of the surplus to bolster Social Security, but they disagree on how to spend the rest.  
   The question goes on:  
   Which one of the following uses of the remainder of the surplus do you favor most: paying down the national debt, cutting taxes, or spending more on government programs?  
   The results of that survey: 49 percent said cutting taxes, 35 percent said to pay down the debt, and only 13 percent said that they wanted to spend more on Government programs. 
   There was another question that was also asked. And the question was:  
   Some Republicans want a 10% tax cut for everyone. President Clinton prefers tax credits for specific things like child care or taking care of disabled parents. Which approach do you like better?  
   And the answer: 50 percent said they want a 10-percent cut for everyone, 44 percent want tax credits for specific things. 
   Mr. President, Americans' message is loud and clear. They want--and deserve--major tax relief. 
   Again, my biggest fear is that without the lockbox, the Government will spend the entire additional on-budget surplus generated by working Americans. Last year's omnibus appropriations legislation was a prime example of how the Social Security surplus was spent by Congress. 
   This year's supplemental threatens to be equally abusive if we cannot agree on any offsets. 
   Mr. President, as I conclude tonight, we must protect the interests of our taxpayers. We must secure the future for our children's prosperity. This amendment would allow families, again, the opportunity to keep just a little more of their own money and to provide a good downpayment on debt relief. I urge my colleagues strongly to support this amendment. 
   Thank you very much. I yield the floor. 
   Mr. CRAPO addressed the Chair.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, at this moment, U.S. forces under NATO command are conducting air strikes against Serbia. And they have my full support and endorsement as they go into battle. We all hope that bombing Serbia ends the cycle of violence between the Serbs and ethnic Albanians in that region. 
   Yesterday, I voted against authorizing the use of force because the President refused to explain to Congress and the American people how his goals would be achieved by bombing, and what our plan would be after the bombing stops--if Milosevic refuses to yield. I still do not see how bombing Serbia will bring about peace or end the atrocities being committed. I do not see how bombing Serbia will lead to the Administration's goals of greater political autonomy to Kosovo, the withdrawal of most Serbian military forces, protection of minorities, and a more equitable ethnic representation among local police. That being said, I fully support our troops and I'm confident they will carry out their mission successfully. 
   We should all support our troops and hope that we have not started down a slippery slope where the President insists that in order to protect our credibility or NATO's credibility we have to send in U.S. ground troops. The U.S. officially recognizes that Kosovo is part of Serbia, which along with Montenegro, forms the sovereign state of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. And Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has made it clear that Serbia does not want foreign troops on its soil. President Clinton, however, is bombing Serbia in order to force Serbia to agree to a peace accord which U.S. troops would be put on the ground to enforce--as an occupation force, not a peacekeeping force. 
   There is an ongoing civil war between the Serbs and the ethnic Albanians and the combatants have not exhausted their will to fight. So when the President talks about sending 4,000 American military men and women to Kosovo, he is talking about making peace not keeping peace. The Kosovo Liberation Army is fighting for independence; the Serbs are fighting for complete control by Belgrade. While the Kosovars have accepted the U.S.-supported plan, neither side enthusiastically embraces the U.S.-supported plan of limited autonomy. This is a recipe for disaster. 
   The President's decision to use NATO to attack Serbia fundamentally changes the nature of NATO. NATO has never attacked a country that has not threatened its neighbors or a member of the alliance. I do not think we should fundamentally change the nature of one of the most successful military alliances in history without a debate. 
   Mr. President, I support our troops. And the best way that I can support them at this time is to declare that I will do everything in my power to make sure that U.S. troops are not put on the ground in Kosovo.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise this morning to introduce a bill dealing with the security of our embassies around the world. 
   Mr. President, we all remember the horrible day of August 17, 1998, when U.S. embassies in Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania and Nairobi, Kenya were destroyed by car bombs. We all mourn the passing of the 220 people who lost their lives to these heinous terrorist acts. But it is not enough to mourn. We in Congress have a separate responsibility--to conduct proper oversight to expose weaknesses in our embassy security requirements and to ensure the resources given to this Administration are being allocated in ways to maximize their effectiveness. 
   In reviewing the conclusions of the State Department Accountability Review Boards chaired by Admiral William J. Crowe, I was disturbed to find that they are strikingly similar to those reached by the Inman Commission which issued an extensive embassy security report 14 years ago. Clearly, the United States has devoted inadequate resources and placed too low a priority on security concerns. 
   And I regret to say, the President's response to the Crowe Report simply is not adequate. The Administration has asked the Congress to provide for an advance appropriation of $3 billion with no strings attached. That funding does not start next year, it starts in 2001. And the bulk of the money is proposed in the out years. Those kind of budget games shouldn't be played when the lives of U.S. government workers are at stake. It's wrong to state that embassy construction is a priority, while refusing to make funds available for that purpose. 
   As Chairman of the International Operations Subcommittee, which has oversight responsibilities for embassy security issues, I have looked into the mistakes that we made in the past, and I am committed to making sure they do not happen in the future. Our 
   embassies are not vulnerable because we lack security requirements. They are vulnerable because over three-quarters of our embassies have those requirements waived. Now, I understand that when the Inman security standards were put forward in the 1980's, a number of existing embassies did not meet the criteria. But I was surprised to find many of the embassies built and purchased since that time do not meet the Inman standards either. While I do not want to micromanage the State Department's construction program, given State's record in this area, certain external constraints are warranted.  
   Unfortunately, under the Administration's plan, we are doomed to repeat some of the same mistakes that were made following the Inman recommendations. The funding structure makes it impossible to achieve efficiencies in embassy construction. There is just not enough funding in the next three years to permit a single contract to design and build an embassy or a single contract to build multiple embassies in a region. Furthermore, the back loading of the funding means it could be a decade before secure embassies are up and running. Clearly, that is not acceptable. 
   Mr. President, I am introducing a 5-year authorization bill that makes sure the money set aside for embassy construction and security is not used for other purposes. It provides $600 million a year, starting in fiscal year 2000. And the Secretary of State is going to have to certify these funds are being used to bring these embassies into compliance with specific security standards, because 14 years from now, I don't want any finger pointing. I don't want the Congress to revisit this matter and find that funds were diverted and U.S. personnel put at risk. 
   The security requirements in my bill reflect some of the lessons that we learned from 
   Nairobi and Dar Es Salaam. While these requirements may not have prevented lives being lost in the bombings, they could prevent the loss of life in the future. For example, under my bill, the Emergency Action Plan for each mission will address threats from large vehicular bombs and transnational terrorism. And the ``Composite Threat List'' will have a section which emphasizes transnational terrorism and considers criteria such as the physical security environment, host government support, and cultural realities. 
   Furthermore, in selecting sites for new U.S. diplomatic facilities abroad, there will be a set back requirement of 100 feet and all U.S. government agencies will have be located on the same compound. State Department guidelines currently state that ``[a]ll U.S. Government offices and activities, subject to the authority of the chief of mission, are required to be collocated in chancery office buildings or on a chancery/consulate compound.'' Unfortunately, these guidelines are often ignored. Indeed, after the August terrorist bombings, in violation of State Department guidelines, A.I.D. headquarters decided not to move its missions in Kenya and Tanzania into the more secure embassy compounds that are going to be built. A.I.D. only reversed itself after hearing from the Congress and U.S. officials in Kenya and Tanzania. 
   Working abroad will never be risk free. But we can take a number of measures, like these, to make sure that safety is increased for U.S. government workers overseas. We can also put forward requirements to ensure we have an effective emergency response network in place to respond to a crisis should one arise. My bill requires crisis management training for State Department personnel; support for the Foreign Emergency Support Team; rapid response procedure for assistance from the Department of Defense; and off-site storage of emergency 
   equipment and records. These are prudent steps which should be taken to ensure we have an effective crisis management system in place if our embassies are attacked in the future. 
   My bill also calls for the Secretary of State to submit three reports to Congress. The first report would be a classified report rating our diplomatic facilities in terms of their vulnerablity to terrorist attack. The second report would be a classified review of the findings of the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel which would recommend whether any U.S. missions should be closed due to high vulnerability to terrorist attacks and ways to maintain a U.S. presence if warranted. The third report would be submitted in classified and unclassified form on the projected role and function of each U.S. diplomatic facility through 2010. It would explore the potential of technology to decrease the number of U.S. personnel abroad; the balance between the cost of providing secure buildings and the benefit of a U.S. presence; the potential of regional facilities; and the upgrades necessary. 
   Finally, my bill enables the President to award the Overseas Service Star to any member of the Foreign Service or any civilian employee of thegovernment of the United States who--after August 1, 1998--was killed or wounded while performing official duties, while on the premises of a U.S. mission abroad, or as a result of such employee's status as a U.S. government employee. These sacrifices for our nation by U.S. government workers abroad no longer should go unrecognized. 
   Mr. President, I believe with the approach outlined in my bill we can better ensure that we are providing a safe environment for U.S. government workers abroad. We can also be confident that should another terrorist attack occur, we will be ready for the aftermath. I understand that there is a trade-off between security and accessibility. But there are obvious steps that we should be taking to provide a higher level of security in this age of transnational terrorist threats. I hope this bill will not just provide a blueprint for the steps we must take now, but guidance on how we should proceed in the future. We must acknowledge the world is changing and doing business as usual is not going to work. We need to think outside the box and explore new ways to confront new challenges. I hope the State Department sees my bill as an opportunity rather than a burden. I am committed to making sure that embassy security is treated as a priority, and this bill is a good first step.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the bill managers for accommodating me--and more importantly the elderly and disabled residents of the St. Paul Public Housing Agency--by accepting an amendment I was prepared to offer which is intended to right a wrong which has been imposed by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) upon elderly and disabled public housing residents in St. Paul, Minnesota, as well as nearly 50 other cities in America. As you may be aware, the Service Coordinator Program administered by HUD has succeeded where many Federal programs have failed. It has enabled some of our nation's most vulnerable citizens--the elderly and disabled--to live independently in public housing with dignity. Mr. President, most elderly and disabled public housing residents are not helpless individuals, but rather are people who simply need a little assistance doing the day to day tasks we all take for granted. However, without someone to help with these tasks, many of these people may be forced to move into more expensive assisted living or nursing facilities. The Service Coordinator Program provides basic support services to these residents to enable them to live independently. 
   Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, HUD has again proven its incompetence by bungling a recent round of funding of this popular and highly successful program. In a June 1998, funding announcement, HUD stated that the $6.5 million available for public housing agency service coordinators would be allocated through a lottery, but HUD also noted that expiring three year grants would be funded first before the general lottery. Unfortunately, the $6.5 million HUD set-aside was well short of the $9.9 million in applications received and rather that funding all renewals at a prorated level, HUD quietly selected some applicants through a lottery and rejected others. 
   Although this may simply seem like an inconvenient administrative glitch, to the residents of the St. Paul public housing agency which have thrived under this program, it is devastating. That is because St. Paul PHA was one of the fifty or so PHAs which were passed over by HUD. As a result of HUD's blunder, the St. Paul public housing agency will have to release three of their service coordinators within the next month, resulting in the disruption of countless elderly and disabled residents' lives. 
   In order to correct this problem, my amendment transfers $3.4 million from the Department of Housing and Urban Development administrative expenses account to fully fund the applications which HUD rejected due to their miscalculation. I believe this amendment appropriately keeps our promise to the elderly and disabled public housing residents with the burden being borne by the agency which created the problem.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Federal Facilities Clean Water Compliance Act of 1999. I would like to thank Senator COVERDELL for bringing this important legislation forward again in the 106th Congress. 
   Quite simply, this legislation would force federal agencies to comply with the provisions of the Clean Water Act--something I believe most citizens assume already takes place. Unfortunately, when Congress passed the Clean Water Act in 1972, it left an out for federal agency compliance with the law by allowing them to claim ``sovereign immunity'' for protection against state actions or fines. So when federal agencies are not complying with provisions of the Clean Water Act, they can state in court that they are above the law. 
   I have always believed that the government must live under the same rules that it forces everyone else to live under. Any government which attempts to subvert the law or hide from responsibility by claiming ``sovereign immunity'' from environmental protection requirements, is a government that is above the people it serves, rather than a servant of the people. This legislation would reverse that trend, and force the federal government to waive sovereign immunity when a state brings an action under the Clean Water Act. And the bill ensures that any money that state receives as a result of such an action is placed back into programs that protect the environment or defray the costs of environmental protection or enforcement. 
   I believe it is important that federal agencies comply with the environmental standards Congress mandates everyone else must comply. By passing the legislation we are offering today, we can restore a degree of certainty to the American people and to our states and localities that their federal government is not exempt from protecting the environment and that their federal government is not above the law. That is why I am proud to cosponsor this legislation. I look forward to working with Senators COVERDELL, DEWINE, and BREAUX over the coming weeks and months in bringing this matter before the full Senate for debate and a vote.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in introducing the Nuclear Waste Policy Act amendments of 1999. 
   First, I would like to thank Senators MURKOWSKI and CRAIG for once again authoring this legislation and for their combined efforts in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee on matters related to nuclear waste storage. 
   As we all know, Washington's involvement in nuclear power isn't new. Since the 1950's ``Atoms for Peace'' program, the federal government has promoted nuclear energy, in part, by promising to remove radioactive waste from power plants. Congress decisively committed the federal government to take and dispose of civilian radioactive waste beginning in 1998 through the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, and its amendments in 1987. These acts established the DOE Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management to conduct the program, selected Yucca  Mountain, Nevada as the site to assess for the permanent disposal facility, and established fees of a tenth of a cent per kilowatt hour on nuclear-generated electricity, and provided that these fees would be deposited in the Nuclear Waste Fund. Furthermore, it authorized appropriations from this fund for a number of activities, including development of a nuclear waste repository. 
   Eventually, publication of the standard contract addressed how radioactive waste would be taken, stored, and disposed of. The DOE then signed individual contracts with all civilian nuclear utilities promising to take and dispose of civilian high-level waste beginning January 31, 1998. Other administrative proceedings, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Waste Confidence Rule, told the American public that they should literally bank on the federal government's promise. 
   Because of these promises and measures taken by the federal government, ratepayers have paid over $15 billion, including interest, into the Nuclear Waste Fund. Today, these payments continue, exceeding $1 billion annually, or $70,000 for every hour of every day of the year. 
   Up until recently, however, the administration has acted as if there is no problem. They have maintained a hands-off approach to the issue and when they have engaged Congress on nuclear waste storage, it has only been to issue a veto threat against this legislation. 
   As a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee last year, I had the opportunity to question Secretary Richardson on nuclear waste issues during his Senate confirmation hearings. Unfortunately, his answers to my questions were generally incomplete and contained little substantive discussion on the very real problems facing our nation's utilities, states, and ratepayers. 
   Mr. Richardson did, however, write some interesting things about nuclear power in his responses. Let me share with you a few of those responses. They read:  
   Nuclear power is a proven means of generating electricity. When managed well, it is also a safe means of generating electricity. * * * * * 
   It is my understanding that spent nuclear fuel has been safely transported in the United States in compliance with the regulatory requirements set forth by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Department of Transportation. * * * * * 
   The widely publicized shipment last week of spent fuel from California to Idaho is proof that transportation can be done safely. The safety record of nuclear shipments would be among the issues I would focus on as Secretary of Energy.  
   I asked Mr. Richardson to tell me who would pay the billions of dollars in damages some say the DOE will owe utilities as a result of DOE failure to remove spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998. After writing about the DOE's beliefs on their level of liability, he wrote: ``I will give this issue priority attention once I am confirmed as Secretary of Energy.'' 
   I asked Mr. Richardson if he felt the taxpayers had been treated fairly. Again, after telling me about the history of the Department's actions to avoid its responsibilities, he wrote: ``I share your interest in resolving these issues and I will continue to pursue this once I am confirmed.'' 
   Now, Mr. President, let's look at how then-nominee Federico Pen 6a responded to my question regarding the responsibility of the DOE to begin removing spent nuclear fuel from my state. He said in testimony before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee:  
   ..... we will work with the Committee to address these issues within the context of the President's statement last year. So we've got a very difficult issue. I am prepared to address it. I will do that as best as I can, understanding the complexities involved. But they are all very legitimate questions and I look forward to working with you and others to try to find a solution.  
   Does that sound familiar? I suspect Secretary O'Leary had something equally vague to say about nuclear waste storage as well. Secretary Pen 6a, I believe, said it best when he stated, ``I will do that as best as I can, understanding the complexities involved.'' Those complexities, Mr. President, are not that complex at all. Quite simply, the President of the United States, despite the will of 307 Members of the House of Representatives and 65 Senators, last year refused to keep the DOE's promise. 
   Now, Secretary Richardson has come before the Senate and offered a ``new'' approach to the nuclear waste storage crisis. He believes we should leave the waste at sites across the country 
   and merely transfer title, or ownership, to the federal government. The federal government would then be responsible for the costs associated with maintaining each of the 73 interim storage sites in 34 states, including the Prairie Island facility in Minnesota. To pay for this, Secretary Richardson is suggesting we raid the Nuclear Waste Fund, which was created to pay for the removal of that same spent nuclear fuel. 
   While I am glad to see the Administration is finally engaged in the nuclear waste debate and that Secretary Richardson has finally been allowed to address the issue before the U.S. Senate, his proposal is a ``year late and several billion dollars short.'' It does nothing to actually move the waste out of our states and into an interim storage facility. It is unclear whether his proposal would do anything to prevent the premature shutdown of nuclear facilities in states like Minnesota. And the one thing we know it will do, is take money from the Nuclear Waste Fund that was supposed to pay for the removal of spent nuclear fuel, not the indefinite continuance of a failed approach to nuclear waste management. 
   Mr. President, I want to be very clear that I am sincere in these complaints. My concern is for the ratepayers of my state and ratepayers across the country. They have poured billions of dollars into the Nuclear Waste Fund expecting the DOE to take this waste. They have paid countless more millions paying for on-site nuclear waste storage. Effective January 31, 1998, they began paying for both of these costs simultaneously, even though no waste has been moved. 
   When the DOE is forced to pay damages to utilities across the nation, the ratepayers and taxpayers will again pay for the follies created by the DOE. Some estimate the costs of damages to be $80 to $100 billion or more. The ratepayers will also have to pay the price of building new gas or coal-fired plants when nuclear plants must shut down. And, if the Administration gets its way, my constituents will pay again when the Kyoto Protocol takes effect in 2008--exactly the same time Minnesota will be losing 20 percent of its electricity from clean nuclear power and replacing it with fossil fuels. 
   That is why we must move forward, pass the legislation introduced today, and send it to the President for his signature. If he refuses to sign the bill, then I believe we will be able to find those last two votes we need to override his veto and remove the cloud hanging over our nation's ratepayers. There is no scientific or technical reason why we should not move this bill forward and pass it into law. 
   The administration has admitted nuclear waste can be transported safely. They have admitted they neglected their responsibility. They have admitted nuclear power is a proven, safe means of generating electricity. And they have admitted there is a general consensus that centralized interim storage is scientifically and technically possible and can be done safely. If you add all of these points together and hold them up against this Administration's lack of action, you can only come to one conclusion: politics has indeed won out over policy and science. 
   Mr. President, I am proud to once again support these amendments to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act and urge my colleagues to move this bill quickly through committee and onto the Senate floor where it will once again be approved by an overwhelming majority.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today the Senate debates an important bill designed to facilitate education administration and free more resources for our students. The ``Education Flexibility Partnership Act of 1999'' would extend the ``Education Flexibility Partnership Demonstration Program,'' otherwise known as ``Ed-Flex.'' Ed-Flex allows eligible local school districts to forgo Federal red tape that consumes precious education resources. In return, States must have sufficient accountability measures in place and continue to make progress toward improving student education. States must also comply with certain core Federal principles, such as civil rights. The concept of Ed-Flex is simple, yet the benefits would be significant. In other words, let's put more money into educating our kids in the classroom rather than lining the pockets of bureaucrats. 
   The Ed-Flex demonstration program is currently in place in 12 States. The ``Ed-Flex Act of 1999'' would allow all 50 States the option to participate in  the program. With good reason, the program has been very popular. Unnecessary, time-and-money-consuming Federal regulations are rightly despised by school administrators. Did you know that the Federal Government provides only seven percent of local school funding, but requires 50 percent of all school paperwork? That is ridiculous. Again, let's put money into the classroom instead of bureaucracy. 
   Ed-Flex is a step toward allowing more localized decisionmaking authority--the power to decide when the Federal regulations are more troublesome and expensive than they are worth. Today, there are simply too many regulations which are despised by school administrators. 
   Giving more decisionmaking authority to States and local school districts is good common sense. Naturally, those who are closest to our students are in the best position to make the most appropriate and effective decisions concerning their education. One-size-fits-all legislation may work well in other areas, but not in education. Some of the most successful classrooms across our Nation vary tremendously in their structure, functioning, and appearance. 
   In my home State of Minnesota, for instance, we have very rural communities, urban communities, and everything in between. We have got farm kids, suburban kids, and city kids. And all of these kids are students. And I know this sort of rural-to-urban community-mix is typical for most States. How much sense does it make then, to require local school districts and classrooms--all with their own particular strengths and weaknesses--to follow, in lock-step, the homogenized, uniform routine of Federal bureaucracy? Not much. 
   We have some opportunities before us to do something meaningful for our children's education. A complementary possible amendment to Ed-Flex which promotes local decisionmaking power is Senator GORTON's block grant amendment, as well as Senator HUTCHINSON's Dollars to the Classroom Act. Under these proposals, many federally funded K-12 programs would be consolidated and the dollars sent directly to states or local school districts--free from the usual Washington red tape. This helps to ensure that our education dollars go to students, as opposed to bureaucrats. 
   Similarly, Senator COVERDELL's Education Savings Accounts and School Excellence Act is an important step forward in restoring decisionmaking authority to parents and families--where it is needed. The bill simply allows families to save for their children's education, without tax penalty. It would expand the college education savings accounts established in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 to include primary and secondary students. It would also increase the annual contribution limit from $500 to $2,000 per child. The money could be used without tax penalty to pay for a variety of education-related expenses for students in K-12, as well as college expenses. 
   This is a simple, straight-forward initiative for families and students. Common sense would have had us pass the Education Savings Accounts bill long ago. Unfortunately, tired, groundless attacks continue. The charge I hear most frequently is that ``education savings accounts and tax breaks for parents would shift tax dollars away from public schools.'' That is simply not the case. 
   More education dollars under parental control would promote education by encouraging parents to save, invest in, and support programs and materials that facilitate and provide the right option for a child's education. 
   We all want the best education available for our children, and to improve the state of American education and schools for all children. It would be nice to think that we could solve the problems of education by spending more and more money. Unfortunately, that doesn't work. The United States is the world leader in national spending per student. Yet our test scores show that our system is failing our children. 
   Test results released last year show that American high school seniors score far below their peers from other countries in math and science. We are at rock bottom. It is going to take more time and effort to solve these problems--and the most important work will be done by those in the best position to do so: parents, teachers, and local administrators. We must give them the freedom they need to accomplish the job. This freedom comes with the authority to make decisions based on a variety of specific needs. I will continue to support measures like the Ed-Flex legislation that return money and control--from Washington--to parents, teachers, and local school districts. After all, they know best how to spend education dollars.

   Mr. GRAMS. Today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until 2 p.m. Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 280, the education flexibility partnership bill. Under a previous order, the Senate will vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the Jeffords substitute amendment at 5 p.m. this evening. Therefore, Members have until 4 p.m. today to file second-degree amendments to the Jeffords amendment. As a reminder, a second cloture motion was filed last Friday, and therefore a cloture vote will occur tomorrow unless an agreement can be reached between the two sides on how to proceed expeditiously with this bill. 
   Mr. President, also under rule XXII, Members must file first-degree amendments today to qualify for the second cloture vote tomorrow. I thank my colleagues for their attention. 
   Mr. President, I believe, under a previous order, I have control of the floor for the next 30 minutes or until 12:30.

   Mr. GRAMS. I wanted to take a few moments this morning to talk a little bit about birthdays and anniversaries. As we know, basically they are happy remembrances of events we should celebrate. Eighty-six years ago today, the Internal Revenue Service began to levy and collect a personal income tax on the American people. 
   I believe this is nothing to celebrate. To borrow a phrase from Ronald Reagan, you will excuse the taxpayers if they don't celebrate the daily mugging that we call the Tax Code. 
   As we note the sad occasion, I rise to call upon Congress to take immediate action to end the Federal Tax Code as we know it and replace it with a new system that is fairer, simpler, and friendlier to the taxpayers. I also call upon Congress to take immediate action to reduce the ever-increasing tax burden by providing meaningful tax relief for every working American. Now, that, Mr. President, would be something to celebrate. 
   This great Nation was born out of a tax revolt. The revolt didn't come about because our Founding Fathers were selfish but because they didn't want to be shackled by Government regulations, intrusive bureaucracies, abusive taxing powers, and the unjust policies of their homeland. They didn't want to send their hard-earned money to an English Parliament that wasted every penny of it without any respect for those who earned it. 
   The Boston Tea Party was the result of a one-half of 1 percent tax that was levied on the Colonies. Put that in terms of today's tax burden. 
   This tax revolt was about freedom; it was about liberty; it was about a person being able to own more of the fruits of his labor rather than being strangled by the albatross of taxation. 
   Our Founding Fathers understood well that low taxes and freedom were directly related. To protect individual liberty from future abuses, they crafted clause 4 of article I, section 9 of the U.S. Constitution, that is, rejecting all direct income taxes that were not appropriated by each State by its population. 
   This clause, as originally adopted in the Constitution, reflected the genius, the wisdom, and the experience of our Founding Fathers--protecting individual liberty by limiting the Government's power to tax.  
   For more than 100 years following the founding of this Nation, the American people enjoyed tax freedom and did not pay any income taxes. The Supreme Court defended this freedom and held the income tax to be unconstitutional. Unfortunately, under the direct influence of the rise of socialism in Europe at that time, on February 3, 1913, the 16th amendment to the Constitution was ratified, giving the Government unlimited power to tax. And then on March 8, 1913, the IRS began collecting personal income tax. The ratification of the 16th amendment and the enactment of the first Tax Code fundamentally eroded our individual liberty. Initially, less than 1 percent of all Americans paid any kind of income tax. Only 5 percent of Americans paid any income tax as late as 1939 before the beginning of World War II. 
   Times, as we know, have changed dramatically. Today, the Federal tax burden is at a historic high. Federal taxes now consume nearly 21 percent of national income. A typical American family pays $9,000 a year in Federal tax. A median-income family can expect to give up nearly 40 percent of all of its income in Federal, State and local taxes. And that is more than it spends on food, clothing, transportation and housing combined. 
   Mr. President, every year the tax system pushes more and more Americans into higher and higher tax brackets, and that is to meet the demands of ever-increasing Government spending. It is an old saying, but it has never been more true, that ``Government is an endless pursuit of new ways to tax.'' 
   The tax system has created a monstrous bureaucracy--the intrusive, abusive Internal Revenue Service. More than $7 billion in taxpayers' money annually goes to support the operations of the Internal Revenue Service. Those dollars have built a tax system that is extremely complicated and difficult for anyone to try to understand. The Tax Code originally was only 14 pages when it was first enacted, but today it has grown to more than 10,000 pages. And it costs hundreds of billions of dollars for taxpayers to comply with its dizzying requirements. 
   There is a growing national consensus that the current Tax Code is antifamily, it is antieconomic growth, it is unfair, it encourages abuse, waste and corruption, and it needs to be terminated. 
   I thank my colleague from Arkansas, who plans on introducing legislation--he did introduce legislation last year--that would do just that, that is, eliminate the Tax Code as we know it. I was proud to join him as an original cosponsor, and I look forward to supporting his efforts once again this year. 
   The next question to answer is, How will we replace the Tax Code since there is a need for Federal revenues to fund defense and foreign policy needs as well as some Federal programs? 
   Mr. President, I have been exploring alternative tax systems for quite a while. After considerable study of the issue, I believe the national sales tax plan that has been developed by Americans for Fair Taxation is the best replacement for the Tax Code. 
   Any new tax system must restore our fundamental principles of low taxes and limited taxing power. It must fairly and efficiently distribute the burden of funding our Government, promote economic growth, simplify compliance, and offer every American better economic opportunity. 
   The Fair Tax system, which I intend to introduce soon, meets these important criteria. It is a fairer, simpler, friendlier tax system. It will increase economic growth, investment, capital formation, and the creation of jobs and savings. 
   Under the Fair Tax system, working Americans keep 100 percent of their pay, pension, or Social Security check. They no longer need to file a tax return with the IRS. Their family's finances are not revealed to Government bureaucrats. 
   They will not be penalized for getting or staying married--or dying, for that matter. Everyone pays the same tax rate without loopholes for special interest groups. There will not be any hidden taxes and everyone will easily understand the tax and how much tax they are paying. And finally--the good news--it will abolish the IRS. 
   Mr. President, does this sound too good to be true? It may sound that way, but believe me, it is real. Let me briefly highlight how my Fair Tax legislation will achieve this. 
   First, the legislation will call for the repeal of the Constitutional Amendment that created the tax nightmare we find ourselves in today. As I noted earlier, the 16th Amendment is the root of all tax evil. 
   It abandons our Founding Fathers' core principle by giving the Government unlimited power to tax the private income of the American people. Without repeal of this Amendment, any tax system will eventually erode into the very system we have today. 
   Second, the legislation will repeal the income tax, the payroll tax, the estate tax, the gift tax, the capital gains tax, the self-employment tax, and the corporate tax. 
   Third, the legislation will impose a single rate on all new goods and services at the point of final purchase for consumption, and it provides a universal rebate in an amount equal to the sales tax paid on essential goods and services, to help lower-income individuals. 
   Every American will be better off under the Fair Tax system than they are under the system that today holds them captive. I believe it will create expanded economic opportunities for our Nation and for our people. 
   I realize it will take some time to pass tax reform, so in the meantime, I strongly support reducing the tax burdens of overtaxed Americans. 
   The American people have good reason to ask for a tax cut. 
   Since 1993, Federal taxes have increased by 50 percent. They have grown twice as much as Government spending and as a result, Americans today have the largest tax burden since World War II, and it is still growing. 
   What is most devastating is the ``middle-class tax squeeze.'' More and more middle-income workers are being thrown into higher tax brackets. There is no excuse to continue taxing middle-income Americans at such a high rate in an era of budget surpluses. 
   More Americans are working harder and are earning more today. But a large share of the higher incomes of hard-working Americans are not being spent on their families' priorities, but are instead being siphoned off by Washington. 
   This is not fair. People work hard and are then penalized for their work. With punitive taxes, Washington makes the American dream of working hard for a better life more difficult to achieve for many--and impossible for some. 
   That is why Congress needs to take immediate action to provide meaningful tax relief for all working Americans. 
   Our exceptionally strong economy will generate an enormous non-Social Security surplus over the next 10 years. 
   This surplus enables us to provide a broad-based tax cut for overtaxed Americans--again, without new red ink, and without spending any of the Social Security surplus. The surplus will also allow Congress to retire some of the national debt every year. 
   If we do not return the surplus to the taxpayers, Washington will spend every penny of it to expand the Government. 
   In addition, broad-based tax relief is an insurance policy for the American economy, helping to keep it strong and healthy. 
   Most economists, including Chairman Greenspan, agree that an across-the-board tax cut is good for America. I will be addressing S. 3, my 10 percent across-the-board tax cut legislation, later this week in more detail. 
   Today, I want to remind my colleagues about the anniversary of the income tax and the hardship the Tax Code has placed on our people--again, an anniversary I do not think worth celebrating. 
   So, I urge my colleagues to join me in a pledge that we will not let another anniversary come and go before we dedicate ourselves to replacing the Tax Code with a better system, and at the same time do everything we can to reduce the existing tax burden on the overtaxed American people. 
   Mr. President, I see my colleague from Arkansas is on the floor. I would like to yield to him, Senator HUTCHINSON.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arkansas for joining me this morning in talking about anniversary, as he mentioned, as not really a time to celebrate but to remember. As Senator HUTCHINSON noted, it was he and I who, back in 1993 when  we were both in the House, worked to enact the $500-per-child tax credit. We first 
   introduced it in 1993, and finally got it signed into law in 1997. Today it makes up about 75 or 80 percent of all tax relief this Congress has enacted in 4 years. It is just a small start, I think, of what we really need to do as far as reform and additional tax relief. I thank him for his help and all his support in getting it passed. 
   Again, I will just remind people why we are here talking about this. It was in 1913, 86 years ago today, that the first income tax was levied in this country, despite provisions laid out in the Constitution against that. It was passed in 1913. At that time it was only, as Senator HUTCHINSON said, a minor tax. Only about 1 percent of the people in this country came under this income tax provision. 
   The first Tax Code was only 14 pages long. Today, as we know, it is well over 10,000 pages, so complicated that even the most sophisticated tax lawyers cannot figure it out. As the Senator from Arkansas mentioned, if one calls the IRS for information or a question, they have about a 50/50 chance of getting a correct answer. What we have is a Tax Code, a tax system that is so complex, so abusive that it is no longer efficient. To try and make even some minor reforms or adjustments to it, I always say, is like trying to put lipstick on a pig. We cannot make it pretty. The thing we need to do is change it completely. We have talked about pulling it out by the roots and replacing it. The Senator from Arkansas will be introducing the Tax Code Elimination Act which would sunset the current Tax Code as we know it and the IRS by January 1 of the year 2003. Some people may say that is a little irresponsible because we don't have a Tax Code system with which to replace it. 
   We have many ideas. I will be introducing a fair tax plan that would be basically a national sales tax plan. It would eliminate all the payroll, the income tax, the estate tax, the corporate taxes, capital gains tax. It would basically eliminate all of those and replace them with one simple tax at the point of sale, a consumption tax. One would never have to file a tax return again. We wouldn't consume those billions of dollars worth of hours it takes just to comply with the IRS regulations. 
   When people say we are irresponsible because we should have a Tax Code in place before we repeal the code, I always say that Congress loves to spend so much that it would not go 1 day without the ability to tax. If we can eliminate the Tax Code, Congress will work overtime to get a new Tax Code in place. I think it is something we need to start doing and working on today. 
   Our income tax now has generated not the 1 percent of taxpayers, but over 21 percent of this Nation's income now goes to taxes. As I referred to earlier, the Boston Tea Party was over one-half of 1 percent. Taxation without representation led to the tax revolt which built this country. Yet today, we are taxed at these high rates. 
   I see my colleague from New Hampshire is here. I would like to recognize him for any time remaining.

   Mr. GRAMS. I thank my colleague from New Hampshire for talking about the creative ways of taxing. This Congress has been so creative in figuring out new ways to tax; I hope we can be creative in figuring out ways to get rid of the tax.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, today I am submitting a Senate Concurrent  Resolution expressing the sense of the Congress that guaranty fees charged by the Government National Mortgage Association--or Ginnie Mae--should not be increased as a means of offsetting additional Federal spending. I am pleased that my colleague from Washington, Senator GORTON, is joining me in submitting this resolution. 
   As the Federal budget process proceeds over the next few months, there will inevitably be attempts to manipulate revenues to fund pet projects. Unfortunately, what Washington calls revenues, Americans call taxes. This resolution serves notice that taxes on American homebuyers--in this case through higher fees on the securities used to fund the loans--should not be used to fund general government. 
   I am pleased that a companion resolution--H. Con. Res. 10--has been introduced in the House. I urge my colleagues to join in expressing their sense that increased taxes on homebuyers to fund general government spending are inappropriate, and I invite my colleagues to add their name to this resolution.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to help increase the public's awareness of mental retardation as we focus on the needs and abilities of the nation's 7.2 million Americans with mental retardation. The Arc, the nation's largest organization of volunteer advocates for people with mental retardation, consists of more than 1,000 local and state chapters. For 21 years, the Arc has sponsored the recognition of March as National Mental Retardation Awareness Month. 
   The Arc began in 1950 as a small army of friends and parents in Minneapolis, Minnesota came together to create the National Association of Parents and Friends of Mentally Retarded Children. From this spark in 1950, Arc members have become advocates not only for their own children, but all children and other Americans denied  services and opportunities because of mental retardation. 
   According to Arc, a person with mental retardation is one who, from childhood, develops intellectually at a below-average rate and experiences difficulty in learning, social adjustment and economic productivity. Otherwise, he or she is just like anyone else--with the same feelings, interests, goals, needs and desire for acceptance. This intellectual delay requires not only personal support, but environmental support for them to live independently. 
   There are more than 250 causes of mental retardation. Among the most recognized are chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down syndrome, and prenatal influences, such as smoking or alcohol use by a pregnant mother, which may lead to fetal alcohol syndrome or other complications. Malnutrition, lead poisoning and other environmental problems can also lead to mental retardation in children. 
   Experts estimate that 50% of mental retardation can be prevented if current knowledge is applied to safeguarding the health of babies and toddlers. Some of the keys are abstinence from alcohol use during pregnancy, obtaining good prenatal care, education programs for pregnant women, and the use of child seats and safety belts for children. 
   The theme for this year's observance is the elimination of waiting lists for community-based services. In a study conducted by the Arc, more than 218,000 people were identified as waiting for placement in a community-based residential facility, a job training program, a competitive employment situation or other support. 
   In Minnesota, over 6,600 members in fifty chapters make up the Arc network, each working to both prevent the causes of mental retardation and lessen its effects. With the guidance of the Arc, it is these local and state chapters working at the grassroots levels which have made and continue to make the greatest impact for Americans with mental retardation. 
   Mr. President, I truly appreciate the unabated commitment to the needs and abilities of people with mental retardation the Arc has demonstrated over the years and am honored to help further public awareness.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, at the beginning of this session, I, along with Senator ROTH and others, introduced S. 3, the Tax Cuts for All Americans Act, which calls for a 10 percent across-the-board tax cut on the federal income taxes of hard-working Americans. 
   If enacted, this will be the largest middle-class tax relief since President Ronald Reagan's 1981 tax cuts. I believe this legislation is imperative for our economic security and growth in the new millennium. I will address this issue more fully later this week. 
   But today I also rise to introduce four bills representing some other tax relief priorities on which I hope we can also focus in this Congress. These bills will help reform our tax system and will help to terminate some unfair and unjust tax provisions in the Tax Code, again, with the aim and the goal of allowing working Americans to keep a little bit more of their own money rather than sending it to Washington. 
   Mr. President, the first bill I am introducing today, the National Tax Rebate Act, requires the Government to refund taxes collected to taxpayers when Federal revenue grows faster than the income of working Americans. 
   The rationale for this legislation is simple: and that is, the Federal Government's taxes should not grow faster than working Americans' income. Our  growing tax burden should not reduce the standard of living that we work hard to achieve. This legislation will ensure that it does not. 
   Eighteen of the last 19 Democrat-controlled Congresses passed tax increases. President Clinton's whopping $241 billion tax increase in 1993 was the largest tax hike we have had. We had only two Federal personal income tax rates at that time. They were 15 and 28 percent, those under President Ronald Reagan. 
   Today, after President Clinton has been in office for 6 years, we have five Federal tax brackets. The top one has reached nearly 40 percent. More hard-working, middle-income families have been pushed into higher tax brackets because of an unfair tax system. So we have gone from two brackets of 15 percent and 28 percent to now five tax brackets, the highest being nearly 40 percent. No wonder Washington's income is growing and growing much faster than the income of the taxpayers. That is one reason why we have a surplus in Washington today, because incomes have gone up for Americans, and Washington has taken a larger share of that in the form of taxes. 
   Thanks to our exceptionally strong economy, more Americans are working today, and are earning more than ever before as a result. Government data show that real median family income is now at a near-historic high and per capita income is at a record $19,241. 
   We should not be here penalizing those who work long and hard to achieve the American dream of higher earnings and better jobs by slapping higher taxes on them. 
   Unfortunately, a large share of the newly earned income of hard-working Americans has not been spent on family priorities but siphoned off by Washington. 
   The progressive Federal tax system created by Washington allows Federal Government income to grow faster by taking a larger bite from any newly earned income increases. That is because it pushes us into one of these higher tax brackets. 
   According to Scott Hodge, a leading economist at Citizens for a Sound Economy, total personal income since 1993 has grown by an average of 5.2 percent a year, while Federal taxes have grown by 7.9 percent a year--so taxes have grown 52 percent faster than personal income growth. 
    In fiscal year 1998 alone, federal taxes grew 70 percent faster than personal income. 
    Mr. President, this is not justifiable. Uncle Sam's income should by no means grow faster than the income of the people who earn it. 
    While broad-based tax relief for every American, such as S.3, would certainly correct the unfairness of the tax system, we need a mechanism that ensures Washington's income will never grow faster than the income of taxpayers. 
    This is all my legislation does. It limits federal taxes by prohibiting the growth rate of federal revenues collected for any fiscal year from exceeding the average growth rate of personal income of working Americans. 
   Set a guidepost. Set a marker as to how fast Washington should grow in the money it collects and spends. 
   It requires a two-thirds vote of both the House and the Senate to waive this limit. Whenever Washington's tax revenues grow faster than the personal income of working Americans, an automatic national tax rebate will be triggered as a result. 
   The federal government must refund taxpayers the excessive taxes pro rata based on liability reported on federal income tax annual returns filed in the previous tax year. 
   The national tax rebate is not a new idea. A number of states, such as Florida and Missouri, have either statutory laws or constitutional amendments requiring state governments to give back tax money if the revenue exceeds these limits. 
   My own State of Minnesota is currently deciding how best to refund excess tax collection to Minnesota taxpayers. 
   If it works at the state level, there is no excuse for the federal government not to adopt a similar mechanism. 
   By passing this simple tax limitation and rebate legislation, taxpayers will be fully protected and better represented in Washington. 
   Mr. President, this piece of legislation would repeal taxation of our senior citizens' Social Security benefits. 
   As you know, Mr. President, Social Security benefits were exempt from the federal income tax since the creation of the program. 
   They were never taxed by the Federal Government. Retirement benefits shouldn't be. 
   But as Social Security encountered a financial crisis in early 1980s, Congress began taxing Social Security benefits, and thus causing financial hardship to many seniors. 
   The amount of taxable benefits was the lesser of one-half of Social Security cash benefits or one-half of the excess of the taxpayer's provisional income over the thresholds of $25,000 per single person and $32,000 for couples. 
   In 1993, when President Clinton needed more money to fund his new spending programs, he increased the taxable proportion of Social Security benefits from 50 to 85 percent for Social Security recipients whose threshold incomes exceed $34,000 for singles and $44,000 for couples. 
   These two tax increases have seriously injured a significant number of senior citizens. In fact, a quarter of recipients are affected by this provision, creating enormous financial hardship for them as well. 
   I believe taxation on Social Security benefits is wrong and unfair because Social Security benefits are earned benefits for many senior citizens. Federal income tax is paid when Social Security contributions are made to the program. Taxing Social Security benefits is clearly double taxation. 
   In other words, those benefits are paid when the money is put into Social Security, and now the government wants to tax them again as it takes the money out. 
   In addition, Congress never intended to tax Social Security benefits when it first established the program. In fact, for half a century Social Security benefits were exempted from federal taxes. 
   Millions of senior citizens who planned for their retirement based on their understanding of the Social Security law were penalized. As the tax rate continues to grow, the incomes of more and more senior citizens are falling along with their standard of living. 
   This tax hurts seniors who choose or must work after retirement to maintain their standard of living or to pay for costly health insurance premiums, medical care, prescriptions and many other expenses which increase in retirement years. 
   It also discourages today's workers to save and invest for the future. It won't help protect Social Security for our children and grandchildren. 
   I believe this is not acceptable. 
   Repealing all taxation on Social Security benefits would reverse this trend, and help responsible senior citizens. The federal government has entered into a sacred covenant with the American people to provide retirement benefits once contribution commitments are made. 
   It is the government's contractual duty to honor that commitment. The government cannot and should not change the covenant without consent of the people whom these changes would affect.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, this bill deals with a relatively smaller tax matter. This bill calls for exemption of additional charitable gambling activities from the Federal unrelated business income tax (UBIT). 
   As you know, Mr. President, the fundamental difference between charitable gambling and regular gambling is where and how the profit is spent. 
   Most of the income derived from charitable gambling games is spent in communities to fund charitable activities such as the Boy and Girl Scouts, Head Start, and many city and school programs that help local residents and students. 
   In my State alone of Minnesota, more than 1,500 local charities conduct a variety of games such as bingo and pull tabs, and in doing so contribute some $75 million per year to their local communities. 
   Beneficiaries include youth recreation and education, as well as organizations serving the sick and disabled, and many other community programs, as well. 
   My state leads the nation in charitable non-profit gaming, but some 35 other states are involved in similar activities. 
   In 1978, President Carter signed into law a bill that classified bingo income as related business income.  
   As a result, this charitable game is not subject to the Federal UBIT. But the law did not include other forms of charitable gambling. Consequently, the income of these charitable gambling games is taxed under the UBIT. 
   Taxes take a big bite out of charitable gambling income and seriously undermine the ability of nonprofit organizations to provide charitable assistance. 
   Now, while the IRS has not collected UBIT on these charities as they anticipate Congressional action, without my legislation, the IRS could begin collections in the near future. My legislation would remove this uncertainty as charities attempt to go on with their good works. 
   This legislation is not controversial. It should have bipartisan support. In the last Congress I introduced a similar bill with Senator WELLSTONE which the Senate adopted. I hope we can pass it again in the 106th Congress. 
   The last bill I am introducing today would provide a tax incentive for small business employers to set up pension plans for their workers. 
   Working Americans' retirement security is based on Social Security, private pensions, and personal savings. But even though Social Security is fast approaching a financial crisis, our national savings rate remains among the lowest, and many workers do not have company pension plans to help make up the Retirement Benefits. 
   Despite recent congressional action to improve private pension plans, the complexity of qualification requirements under current law and the administrative expenses associated with setting up retirement plans, including the SIMPLE plan, remain significant impediments to widespread implementation of employer-based retirement systems, especially for small business. 
   This is particularly true for small employers with less than I 00 employees, for whom the resulting benefits do not outweigh the administrative costs. 
   Consequently, only 42% of individuals employed by small businesses now participate in an employer-sponsored plan, as opposed to 78% of those who work for larger businesses. 
   To address this problem, I am introducing the Small Employer Nest Egg Act of 1999. This legislation will create a new retirement option for small business owners with 100 or fewer employees. 
   It would allow the same level of benefits both to employers and employees as larger employers who maintain traditional qualified plans. Upon retirement or separation of service, employees would receive I00% of their pension account value. 
   To offset the high costs associated with starting a pension plan, my proposal calls for a tax cut equal to 50% of the administrative and retirement education expenses incurred for the first five years of a plan's operation. 
   Mr. President, small businesses are the lifeblood of our communities, providing millions of jobs nationwide. Small business owners want to help their employees save for their retirement. 
   Yet, because of the costs, many are unable to do so and, also, because of the rigid Government policies and, again, the administrative costs that go with it. 
   This legislation, I believe, will help millions of workers begin building their retirement security. I urge the support of my colleagues for the four bills I have offered today.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to those men and women who have made the world we live in a better place through their advances in engineering. February 21-27 is the 49th annual observance of National Engineers Week to increase public awareness and appreciation of the engineering profession and of technology. Thousands of engineers, engineering students, teachers, and leaders in government and business participate each year. 
   Engineering is so intertwined in our everyday activity that it can often be taken for granted. The National Society of Professional Engineers and a consortium of more than 100 engineering, scientific and education societies and major corporations are working to increase the public's awareness during this week. 
   This year's theme, ``Engineers: Turning Ideas into Reality,'' will focus on participants interesting with children from elementary to high school through demonstrations and question and answer sessions. Seventh and eighth-grade students are invited to design future cities and build three-dimensional scale models with the help of their teachers and volunteer-engineer mentors. The National Engineering Design Challenge will team up high school students to design, build, and demonstrate a working model of a new product. And the Discover E program will reach more than five million elementary, junior and senior high school students to help them discover how engineering is applied in math, science and technology. Over 40,000 engineers nationwide will work with these students through hands-on activities in the classroom. 
   In Minnesota, ``Discover E! in Minneapolis'' was held on February 23 with the help of engineering students from the University of Minnesota and engineers from local businesses visiting 5th and 6th graders. The students were able to explore mechanical, biomedical, and environmental engineering through demonstrations and discussions about work and studies. 
   This week honors the birthday of one of the nation's first engineers, a surveyor named George Washington. It also recognizes the countless other engineers who have influenced nearly every aspect of our lives with their dedicated work and numerous technological advances. Their contributions to science include discoveries, for example, that have resulted in the development of ultra-lite materials such as Kevlar, and environmentally beneficial technologies such as a wastewater treatment system that effectively recycles 100% of all wastewater. 
   Schools have focused their teachings on the body of scientific knowledge, often times neglecting the process of discovery that engineers use to help create the new advances for our modern world. With the support of groups such as NASA and Minnesota-based 3M, programs during Engineers Week will integrate this process of discovery and the use of technology into mathematics, science, language arts, and other topics. I am a strong supporter of exposing our children to the world around them and hope this awareness will get them involved and spark interest in the future of engineering.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I wish that I could say that Congress and the President of the United States are doing everything possible to protect the American people and preserve the values that we hold dear. But that is not the case. 
   At this time, the United States is defenseless against a ballistic missile attack. Clearly, that is an unacceptable state of affairs. Recent events demand the United States move forward and deploy, as soon as technologically possible, an effective National Missile Defense (NMD) system which can defend U.S. territory against any limited ballistic missile attack, whether from an accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate launch. 
   It is my sincere hope that President Clinton's recent decision to request $6.6 billion over 6 years for missile defense research in his budget reflects a new commitment to deploy the most extensive, effective national missile defense system in the shortest amount of time. I am pleased the President finally understands the need for a missile defense system and hope he will continue that commitment. Any President sworn to protect our Nation must support the deployment of a system that would protect Americans from annihilation. 
   We know that the threat of a missile attack is growing stronger as more emerging powers, such as North Korea and Iran are developing long-range ballistic missiles that could reach the United States. As recent events have shown, we cannot rely on the intelligence estimates this administration has been using as a security blanket. Remember, our intelligence community projected that Iran could not field its medium-range ballistic missile (the 800-940 mile range Shahab-3) until 2003, but Iran flight-tested this system 6 months ago. We were also surprised by North Korea's test firing of a two-stage missile over Japan last August. It is simply not reasonable to assume that the United States will get 3 years' advance warning, thus allowing 3 years to deploy a limited defense under the Clinton administration's ``3+3 deployment readiness program.'' 
   As the congressionally mandated bipartisan Rumsfeld commission noted, Iran has acquired and is seeking advanced missile components that can be combined to produce ballistic missiles with sufficient range to strike all the way to St. Paul, Minnesota. As the Senator from Minnesota, I must say that I take that threat to heart. In addition, North Korea is close to testing a new missile that will have sufficient range to strike the continental United States. When that occurs, the threat to  the United States could increase exponentially, because North Korea has announced that it had and would continue to sell ballistic missiles and production technology to any interested buyer. 
   We live in a very dangerous world that is growing more and more volatile--a world where rogue regimes and terrorist groups are developing and purchasing the means to attack our Nation. We have to make a choice. We can rely on leaders like Saddam Hussein to show restraint, which seems unlikely--or we can develop a national missile defense that will provide the United States with means to counter a ballistic missile attack. 
   America can no longer afford to hide behind the outdated ABM Treaty. It does not offer any protection from the threats emerging at the end of this century. It was negotiated and ratified to address the cold war era when the Soviet Union was our major threat. At present, rogue states consider ballistic missiles valuable instruments to intimidate countries that are unable or unwilling to defend themselves. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who supports a strong leadership role for the United States in the global arena, I am concerned that the U.S. vulnerability to missile attack could undermine our Nation's capacity to defend our national security interests abroad. For the sake of our Nation's security, I hope this administration will move forward to embrace the most effective national defense system possible. The future of our great nation literally depends on it.

    Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the brave men and women who risked their lives fighting in the Persian Gulf War. 
   February 27 marks the eighth anniversary of the end of the Persian Gulf War and the liberation of Kuwait. After  seven months of Iraqi occupation resulting in a six-week war, and cumulating in 100 hours of land attacks, Iraq was forced to withdraw from Kuwait. When it was all over, 697,000 U.S. troops had been deployed to the area and had helped gain freedom for the Kuwaitis. We honor the courageous men and women who fought in the war and especially those who lost their lives while fighting to protect the ideals America stands for; that is, freedom and liberty for all. 
   As Americans, we enjoy many freedoms. When our Forefathers declared independence from Britain, they cited the ``right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness'' as the rights of all citizens. These inalienable rights cannot be taken away by anyone. After America won its independence and had drafted a constitution, a section was added to secure certain rights of all Americans. This addendum was called the Bill of Rights, and it ensures all citizens freedom of speech and freedom of religion. Unfortunately, we sometimes take these freedoms for granted and forget that not all people around the world enjoy the same inalienable rights that we do, nor can they protect themselves from aggressors who threaten to take away their liberty. 
   When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, he took away their freedom and threatened to oppress the people. As a promotor of freedom and liberty, the United States stepped in to defend the rights of Kuwaitis. Although war is a grave option, all people deserve the chance to live without oppression. Before turning to war, our first move is to find a solution peacefully through negotiations. Yet, sometimes this option fails. As much as we want to achieve world peace through diplomatic means, the unfortunate reality is that sometimes we face many complicated international problems, which must be dealt with in other ways. 
   Because of the actions of Saddam Hussein, the Persian Gulf War was unavoidable. The U.S. Armed Forces came together with our Allies to fight for the rights of the people of Kuwait. We should be proud of the heroic men and women, including the members of the Minnesota Reserve and Guard, who fought for the freedom of others. These men and women put their lives on the line without hesitation. 
   Mr. President, eight years ago, American soldiers bravely won freedom for a small country in the Middle East. I am honored today to pay tribute to these courageous men and women who fought in the Persian Gulf War.

   Mr. GRAMS. Despite the handicaps placed upon the House managers, I feel they did an excellent job in presenting their case in support of the articles of impeachment and laying out the facts. I listened to them carefully, as I listened to the White House Counsel and the President's lawyers in their vigorous defense of William Jefferson Clinton. 
   I have heard some of my colleagues say that it was one particular fact or incident that led them to their conclusion. That was not the case with me. I needed to listen to all the facts throughout the trial, before I truly could decide how I would vote. 
   But after carefully weighing all the evidence, all of the facts, and all the arguments, I have come to the conclusion--the same conclusion reached by 84% of the American public--that President Clinton committed perjury and wove a cloth of obstruction of justice. 
   Lead presidential counsel Charles Ruff said in testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, and here during the Senate trial, that fair-minded people could draw different conclusions on the charges. 
   I disagree in one aspect, but agree in another. I personally feel there is no room to disagree on whether the President is guilty of the charges in both Article One and Article Two; he committed perjury and he clearly obstructed justice. But I agree we will  differ on whether these charges rise to the level of high crimes which dictate conviction. Again, I believe they do and have voted yes, on both articles. 
   The President was invited by letter to come and testify before the Senate. As the central figure in this trial, he alone knows what happened, and if truthful, he could have addressed the compelling evidence against him. He refused. 
   It has been said that many have risked their political futures during this process. Perhaps--yet I will not hesitate telling constituents in my state how and why I voted the way I did. With a clear conscience, I will stand in their judgment and I will live with and respect whatever their decision on my political future may be. 
   But remember, those who vote to acquit--that is, to not remove this President--will have the rest of their political lifetimes to explain their votes. They also will be judged. 
   Collectively too, we will have to await what history will say about this trial and how it was handled. Will this Senate be judged as having followed the rule of law; that is, deciding this case on the facts, or will we be remembered as the rule-making body who deferred to public sentiment? The polls say this President is too popular to remove. If we base our decision on his popularity rather than the rule of law, we would be condoning a society where a majority could impose injustice on a minority group, only because it has a larger voice. A rule of law is followed so that justice is done and our Constitution is respected, regardless of popularity polls. 
   The foundation of our legal system, I believe, is at risk, if the Senate ignores these charges. The constitutional language of impeachment for judges is the same as for the President. Judges are removed from the bench for committing perjury, and also face criminal charges, as do ordinary citizens. We must not accept double standards. 
   The prospect of such a double standard was raised countless times by the House managers. Consider the irony created by a two-tiered standard for perjury. A President commits perjury, yet remains in office. But would a cabinet member who committed perjury be allowed to keep his or her job? Would a military officer who committed perjury be allowed to continue to serve? Would a judge who committed perjury remain on the bench? They would not, and yet our President, the nation's chief law enforcement officer, is allowed to keep his office after having committed the same offense. 
   Again, in my view, this is a double standard and is completely unacceptable for a nation that prides itself on a legal system which provides equal justice under the law. 
   As to our final duty, the final vote, I believe the so-called ``so what'' defense has controlled the outcome. ``He did it, but so what'' we have heard it a thousand times from a hundred talking heads. We have heard it from our colleagues, too, in both chambers. Well, for this Senator, ``so what'' stops at perjury and obstruction of justice. I will cast my vote with sorrow for the President, his family, and for the toll this trial has taken on the nation, but with certainty that it is the only choice my conscience and the Constitution permits me to make.

   Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator. I appreciate the Senator from Georgia putting this effort together. I think it gets the information out about what this budget really does and does not entail. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to make a few observations about the President's millennium budget. 
   After a brief review, my conclusion is this: 
   First, in his quest to continue to offer something for everyone, the President's budget offers a lot of smoke and mirrors and a lot of accounting gimmicks. 
   Secondly, this budget is chock full of new spending, earmarks, and dozens of new ways for Washington to spend the tax dollars earned by working Americans. It is a blueprint for an even bigger federal government. 
   Thirdly, while I agree that the 62 percent of the projected surplus that belongs to Social Security should be reserved for Social Security, I do not agree with what the President seeks to do with the 38 percent of the surplus that represents tax overpayments. 
   He chooses to spend the vast majority of it and leaves only pennies on the dollar for very minor, tightly targeted tax relief plan that he was offered in the budget. 
   His plan is basically only token tax cuts that sound big, but the bottom line is it provides little or no tax relief. 
   Fourth, he proposes new taxes and user fees and takes tobacco settlement money from the states. Can you believe it--in times of surplus, he actually proposes to raise taxes even higher, and his budget spends the Social Security surplus he claims to wall off. 
   Finally, the President's budget does not save Social Security from bankruptcy. 
   Let me be a little more specific. 
   You don't have to look further than the way in which the President's budget deals with spending caps to determine if this is an honest budget. 
   As you know, President Clinton has repeatedly broken the statutory spending caps in the past to spend more for new and expanded government programs. Last year alone, the President and the Congress spent over $22 billion of the surplus for alleged ``emergency spending'' in the Omnibus spending legislation. 
   Nearly $9.3 billion in regular appropriations was shifted into future budgets. In my judgment, both of these efforts broke the caps, and that is why I opposed the Omnibus bill. 
   Also, I wish that Congress and the President could be as creative in cutting spending and cutting taxes as the President is in finding ways to spend more money for more programs. 
   According to the CBO, last year's budget--when alleged emergency spending is included--exceeded the spending caps by $45 billion. Even without counting the emergency spending, we still exceeded the spending caps by $29 billion. 
   Last year's irresponsible spending has made the spending caps even tighter for this year. In order to stay within the caps as required by law, we must cut spending by $28 billion. This would require an approximately 5-percent across-the-board reduction of this year's discretionary spending. 
   Instead of cutting spending to comply with the law, President Clinton actually proposes significant spending increases to expand many of the existing programs and create many more new programs. These spending increases total over $130 billion. Yet the President claims his budget does not break the spending caps. 
   How can President Clinton have it both ways? How can he have his cake and eat it, too? It is simple. He does it by budget gimmicks. 
   The President imposes new user fees and raises existing ones by $21 billion, and then counts these taxes as ``negative spending'' rather than as revenues. 
   He also devotes presumed receipts from the state settlements with the tobacco companies and a 55 cents-per-pack federal tax on cigarettes to a variety of programs to avoid the spending caps. 
   However, it is far from certain these taxes will be accepted by Congress, so what we have is new spending without reasonable offsets. 
   The President also reclassifies the increased discretionary spending for expanded military retirement benefits, again, as mandatory spending. In addition, President Clinton speeds up the FCC's collection of spectrum auction payments. 
   Like last year, the President has again shifted some program funding--such as the Northeast multispecies fishery--into so-called ``emergency spending'' to further bust the budget. And he has severely under-funded some major programs such as Medicare, knowing Congress will restore the funds. 
   These decisions by the President are troubling. The more I review this budget, the more questions I have about how the President can propose so much new spending and claim that he will not break the budget. 
   President Clinton proposes to funnel 62 percent of the projected budget surplus which represents the Social Security surplus to the Social Security Trust Funds, 15 percent to Medicare, 12 percent to the so-called Universal Saving Accounts, and another 11 percent to increase other government spending. 
   The OMB estimates that we would have a $12 billion on-budget deficit--that is without. Social Security excess Surpluses--in FY 2000. This means we don't have any on-budget surplus to spend this year. All of the $117 billion unified budget surplus is, in fact, Social Security surplus. 
   I don't know how I can say this more clearly. Despite the President's promise to save Social Security first, he is proposing to spend all of the Social Security surplus. 
   Moreover, not only has the President manipulated the numbers, but he has also included enormous increases in existing programs and created many new programs, including entitlement programs. 
   Without counting government user fees, the actual size of the government has reached $2 trillion, not $1.8 trillion, as the President claimed in his budget.  I am sure there is much more hidden spending and hidden taxes in this 2,600 page budget. 
   With all of these spending and tax increases, President Clinton fails to provide any meaningful tax relief for working Americans. His targeted tax cuts reward only a few, with too few dollars. And again, in times of surplus, the President is proposing to raise taxes. 
   Now, I would like to just show a little cartoon that I brought with me that I think kind of explains this. As the cartoon suggests, President Clinton doesn't want to give any of the non-Social Security surplus to hard-working, overtaxed Americans because he believes he can spend it better on his own priorities. As the cartoon says: It seems we have grossly overcharged you, so let me explain how we intend to spend the money. 
   When you go to a restaurant and overpay the bill, you expect to get the change back. Here the taxpayers have overpaid, and I think they can rightfully expect that they should get the change back and the surplus should go to the taxpayers and not to the bureaucracies in Washington. 
   In fact, satisfying the President's spending appetite would squeeze an additional $80 billion from working Americans as tax increases. So, in times of surpluses, tax increases. 
   Mr. President, Americans today are taxed at the highest level in history, with nearly 40 percent of a typical family budget going to pay taxes on the Federal, State, and local level. 
   They tax it when you earn it. Tax it again when you save it. Tax it again when you spend it. Tax it again when you invest it. And tax it yet again when you die. 
   No wonder Americans feel overtaxed! 
   But under the President's budget, the Government will collect more taxes from working Americans in the next five years. Total taxes will reach over $10 trillion. Federal tax revenues will grow faster than spending, consuming 20.7 percent of GDP, a historic high since World War II. 
   This is wrong. More spending and more Government is not the answer. The answer lies in tax cuts that return power to the taxpayers and leave a little more of their own money in their pocket at the end of the day. 
   That is why I, along with Senator ROTH, introduced S. 3, the Tax Cuts for All Americans Act, the one bill that will do the most to help America's working families. Our plan will cut the personal tax rate for each American by ten percent across the board. 
   The broad-based tax cut is simple and fair. It is pro-family and pro-growth. If President Clinton wanted to make a strong statement for working Americans, he should have made this broad-based tax cut the centerpiece of his budget. 
   My last point is that despite his claim to have made Social Security solvent, and despite the fact that he will pour general funds into Social Security, Mr. Clinton's budget does not and will not save it. This budget does nothing to address its long-term unfunded liabilities. 
   In what Chairman Greenspan has called a very ``dangerous'' approach, it has the Government invest any surpluses in the stock market for Social Security. 
   In my home state of Minnesota, taxpayers are already expressing their frustration with the notion that, in the case of retirement security, Washington knows best. 
   Let me quote one thing here. Patrick Garofalo of Apple Valley wrote the following letter in yesterday's St. Paul Pioneer Press: 
   I am a big boy. I no longer live with my parents. The government trusts me to own a gun. 
   It trusts me to choose my state and congressional elected officials. It trusts me to make decisions about the welfare of both of my children. If it trusts me to make these important decisions, why does not it trust me to decide how I want to save for my retirement? 
   Please don't tax me to death while you ``help'' me. Let me keep my money. I will decide where and with whom to invest my nest egg.  
   I could not have said it better myself. 
   Mr. President, the Administration's budget will not meet the challenges of a new millennium but rather lead us down the path of fiscal disaster. Congress can and will do better. 
   We will produce a budget that preserves and protects the Social Security surplus; we will give the non-Social Security surplus back to taxpayers as major tax relief and debt reduction; we will have a blueprint that leads this nation into the 21st century. 
   I appreciate the Senator from Georgia yielding me this time.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to rename the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness (BWCA) in Minnesota and in doing so, salute the father of our Nation's wilderness system, the late Senator from Minnesota and Vice President, Hubert H. Humphrey. My bill would redesignate the BWCA as ``The Hubert Humphrey Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.'' 
   Mr. President, my home state is known for a number of things uniquely Minnesotan. If you've seen the movie ``Grumpy Old Men'' you're aware of our love of ice fishing. If you've flown into Minneapolis, you've seen the Mall of America. If you watched the national weather maps, you've seen our bonechilling winter temperatures. And our new Governor--well, we are proud to say that he is uniquely Minnesotan as well. But if you've ever visited one of our Nation's wilderness areas, you would not necessarily have realized that its creation was due in large part to another uniquely Minnesotan individual, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey. 
   In the early 1960s, right here in these halls and in this Chamber, then-Senator Humphrey lead the charge in helping Congress recognize the wisdom of creating a wilderness preservation system in the United States. Senator Humphrey, as a member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, authored the 1964 Wilderness Preservation Act, and by doing so, created the BWCA. Many in our state feel that if it weren't for Senator Humphrey's tireless commitment, there would be no wilderness system and no BWCA. Senator Humphrey worked closely with the people of Northern Minnesota to win their trust and gain their acceptance of a federally designated wilderness area--one that would surely change the way they recreated and the way they lived. In fact, Senator Humphrey's legislation was very controversial and took several years to complete. Last year's passage of legislation to restore two motorized portages in the BWCA was consistent with both Senator Humphrey's vision for the BWCA and his promises to the people of northern Minnesota. Through his dedication and willingness to address the concerns of everyone, we now have a wilderness system that is the envy of the world. 
   Through Senator Humphrey's hard work and dedication to the National Wilderness Preservation System, Americans today have countless protected wilderness areas throughout this country in which they can experience nature as it was 50, 75, or 100 years ago, knowing with certainty that these precious areas will be left intact for generations to come. 
   Senator Humphrey's vision endures to this very day, and Minnesotans are proud to claim the BWCA, one of the nation's true national treasures, as our own. Boy Scouts wait every year for their trip into the Boundary Waters. Families know that every summer they can get away from their jobs, their studies, their cars and their phone, and enjoy at least a few days of peace and quiet. And elderly folks know that their favorite fishing hole is still a fishing hole and still accessible for them and their grandchildren. 
   Like Paul Bunyan, lutefisk, and our State Fair, the Boundary Waters is something uniquely Minnesotan and uniquely identifiable as our own across the country. It is for that reason that I believe it should bear the name of the father of the Wilderness system and be redesignated, ``The Hubert H. Humphrey Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.''

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Taxpayer Oversight of Surplus Property Act. I am pleased that Congressman JOHN PETERSON of Pennsylvania will soon introduce companion legislation in the House of Representatives. 
   Among the many programs administered by hundreds of federal agencies, there are some initiatives that depend  upon the active involvement of both the federal government and the states in order to ensure the wisest use of taxpayer dollars and meet the needs of the American people. One such effective partnership involves the distribution of federal surplus personal property to states and local organizations. 
   In 1976, President Ford signed legislation which established the current system for the fair and equitable donation of federal surplus personal property. Personal property declared ``surplus'' consists of items other than land or real property, naval vessels, and records of the federal government. This includes office supplies, furniture, medical supplies, hardware, motor vehicles, boats, airplanes, and construction equipment. 
   Under the federal personal property utilization and donation program, the General Services Administration is responsible for the transfer of federal surplus personal property to the states. Each state agency for surplus property receives the transfer of property and distributes these items to eligible recipients. Property that is not selected by the states is offered for sale to the general public. Importantly, the interests of the American taxpayers guide this entire process. 
   Mr. President, there are close to 70,000 recipients of federal surplus property located throughout the United States. Each day, cities, counties, Indian tribes, hospitals, schools, and public safety agencies are among the public and nonprofit organizations that look toward the state agencies for surplus property to help meet their needs. 
   Last April, I had the opportunity to visit the Minnesota surplus property agency, where I was joined by the lieutenant governor, the executive director of the Minnesota Sheriffs Association, and the commissioner of the state Department of Corrections. While there, I quickly became more familiar with the success of the donation program throughout Minnesota. I am very confident that my Senate colleagues will find that the donation program has achieved a comparable level of success in each of their states. 
   In fiscal year 1997, the Minnesota surplus property agency donated equipment and supplies with an original federal 
   acquisition cost of $7.7 million to 1,700 eligible recipients, saving precious tax dollars if these items had been purchased new or on the open market. I was impressed to learn that 414 cities, 80 medical institutions, 19 museums, 237 public schools, 110 county entities, 160 State agencies, and 353 townships are among the active participants in the donation program. 
   Equally impressive is how effectively the state agencies for surplus property and the GSA have worked together to respond quickly and efficiently during times of natural disasters. Together they have successfully identified and transported sandbags, blankets, cots, tools, trucks and other items to disaster sites. I know that Minnesotans who suffered through the 1997 Midwest floods are gratified to have received over $3.7 million worth of federal surplus property to assist flood relief efforts during that horrible time. 
   Quite simply, the donation program has provided taxpayers with the equipment, supplies and material used to educate our children, maintain roads and streets, keep utility rates reasonable, train the workers of tomorrow, protect families from crime, provide needed relief during natural disasters, and treat the health of our nation's sick and needy. In fact, the original acquisition value of property distributed through the state agencies for surplus property totaled over $1.5 billion between fiscal years 1995 through 1997. 
   Because of the importance my constituents place upon the availability of this property, I am very concerned about current programs which limit the donation of property to the states. My concern is based in part upon comments expressed to me by constituents such as Mayor Richard Nelson of Warren, Minnesota. 
   Mayor Nelson recently wrote,  
   When we inquired about the shortage of heavy equipment we were told that a large majority of that equipment is shipped overseas to other countries for humanitarian aid. I feel that our taxes paid for this equipment and it seems only fair that we should have the first opportunity to benefit from it. Being the mayor of a community that has suffered from four floods within two years, I believe that we have unmet needs in this country that need to be addressed before we can look at any outside interests.  
   Mr. President, Mayor Nelson's concerns go to the heart of the legislation that I am introducing today. I believe that the volume of distributed federal surplus property would increase if the intent of Congress when it passed the 1976 reforms was more closely followed. 
   If Congress continues to allow surplus federal property to go abroad, or not make its way through proper channels to eligible recipients, taxpayers such as those in the community of Warren will stand to lose. As someone who has always worked to ensure the wisest possible use of taxpayer dollars, this gives me great 
   concern. The legislation I am introducing will help to address these concerns through the following provisions. 
   First, this measure would ensure that when distributing surplus federal personal property, domestic needs are met before we consider foreign interests. It would, however, grant the President the authority to make supplies available for humanitarian relief purposes before going to the states, in the case of emergencies or natural disasters. 
   Under the Humanitarian Assistance Program (HAP), the Secretary of Defense is permitted to make nonlethal Department of Defense supplies available by the State Department to foreign countries as part of humanitarian relief activities. I was disturbed to learn that over $1 billion worth of excess supplies was made available to the State Department between fiscal years 1987 through 1997 before GSA had been given an opportunity to review the property and make it available for donation to the states. 
   Mr. President, I understand that some officials may argue that the Humanitarian Assistance Program is an important part of our nation's foreign assistance efforts. Many foreign countries and organizations clearly have benefited from nonlethal Department of Defense excess property finance by American taxpayers. Although I have serious concerns about this initiative, my legislation does not eliminate the Humanitarian Assistance Program. 
   However, I believe we must prioritize the needs of disaster victims in Minnesota, rural hospitals in Arkansas, police departments in Washington state, school districts in Idaho, homeless assistance providers in Florida, and other communities and organizations which have invested their tax dollars in government property and the donation program. For these reasons, I oppose the continued priority status granted to foreign recipients under programs such as the Humanitarian Assistance Program. 
   Second, my bill would amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to prohibit the transfer of Government-owned excess property to foreign countries or international organizations for environmental protection activities in foreign countries unless GSA determined that there is no federal or state use for the property. 
   Third, this legislation would require GSA to report to Congress on the effectiveness of all statutes relating to the disposal and donation of personal property and recommend any changes that would further improve the Donation Program. 
   Mr. President, my bill is based on the principle that eligible recipients should be able to maximize their tax dollars through expendable federal property that meets their needs. It takes an important step toward stopping publicly-owned property from being shipped abroad and given to other organizations before it is distributed through each state agency for surplus property. 
   My legislation will fulfill the public's right to know how and where their tax dollars are being spent. In many ways, it will serve as the second phase of the reforms overwhelmingly passed by Congress in 1976, by preserving the active role of states in the handling and distribution of surplus federal property. 
   Members of Congress and state and local officials all have an obligation to see that the government distributes this property fairly and equitably, ensuring accountability to the taxpayers. Too often, federal agencies forget that the owners of this property are the American people--the federal government is merely its public custodian. 
   Mr. President, the best interests of America's taxpayers have always been at the top of my agenda. I look forward to improving Congressional oversight  of government property and securing passage of this legislation during the 106th Congress.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the State and Local Government Participation Act of 1999. I would like to thank Senator THOMAS for introducing this simple, but very important piece of legislation. 
   As Senator THOMAS said in his introductory remarks, this legislation would make state and county governments ``cooperating agencies'' in the National Environmental Policy Act process. For example, when the Forest Service decides to undertake a timber sale, it will have to by law consult and obtain the input of state and county governments during the NEPA process. Current law, however, only requires the federal government to consult with other federal agencies. 
   The underlying concept of this legislation is something most people would assume already takes place. Average Americans assume that the federal government considers state and local governments partners in all land-use and environmental decisions. After all, it is an established fact that local citizens and officials can best meet local problems with local solutions. And in those matters, people expect the federal government to help out where needed and take the lead where appropriate. But average Americans, unfortunately, often aren't aware of the complete picture. 
   Too often, the federal government adopts its ``I know best'' philosophy and ignores the input of local officials or even excludes them from the decision making process. One of the first things locally elected officials in the northern part of my state--an area which deals with the National Environmental Policy Act regularly--say to me when we sit down to talk is that the federal government doesn't care about their needs. They feel the federal government, be it the Forest Service, Park Service, or EPA, just doesn't seem to realize that counties are having a tough time making ends meet and providing basic services to its residents in an era of increased land-regulation and decreased logging, mining, and access. And when they show you the numbers and make their case, it is impossible to disagree with them. 
   There are a number of counties in northern Minnesota which are predominantly federally owned. St. Louis County is 62 percent federally owned, Cook County is 82 percent federally owned, and Lake County is 92 percent federally owned. They are home to the Superior National Forest and the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness. Not far away is Voyageurs National Park and not far from that is the Chippewa National Forest. Not surprisingly, they are often placed in the  middle of many disputes over land-uses. They continue to see their PILT payments funded at barely 50 percent of authorized amounts. They continue to witness more and more restrictions on the use of lands within their counties and the Forest Services declining timber sales. And they continue to see their populations declining as a result of lost economic opportunities. They deserve to be heard when the federal government is going to take actions in their communities. 
   Mr. President, it is clear that in the last half of this century power has shifted from our nation's cities and states to Washington, DC. No one disputes that. And while many of us would like to see that shift back the other way, it may take some time to get it done. But what we should all be able to agree upon, is that locally elected officials should have a seat at the table and should be treated as equals and as partners by federal agencies. They know what is happening on their land and they know the people who will be impacted by changes in the law. They also know what the impact will be on a county or state budget. But most importantly, Mr. President, county and state officials are closer to the people. Their phone numbers are actually in the phone book and they aren't a long distance call away. They answer their door when someone comes knocking. And they aren't a bureaucrat hidden away in Washington, DC, making one size fits all policy decisions. 
   As I stated earlier, I think those people deserve a role in the NEPA process and I think the American people would agree. I urge my colleagues to protect their state and local government's right to participate by supporting this important piece of legislation.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I have a number of bills I want to introduce today. I want to start out by talking a little bit about the three bills dealing with budget reform, and then also an important bill leading to crop insurance reform. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce these bills that would reform the Federal budget process, strengthen fiscal discipline and restore Government accountability to ensure that taxpayers are fully represented in Washington. 
   I commend Leader LOTT and Chairman DOMENICI for including budget process reform as one of the top five priorities in the 106th Congress. I believe this should be our immediate priority as we prepare to make our budget process work better. 
   Mr. President, the Federal budget process has become a reckless game in which the team roster is limited to a handful of Washington politicians and technocrats while the taxpayers are relegated to the sidelines. 
   This has not only weakened the nation's fiscal discipline but also undermined the system of checks and balances established by the Constitution. 
   The most recent example of this abusive process was the 1998 Omnibus Appropriation legislation. The bill included $520 billion in funding for many essential Government programs, representing 8 out of Congress' 13 annual appropriations bills. 
   But the entire negotiations were exclusive, arbitrary, and conducted behind closed doors by only a few congressional leaders and White House staff. 
   Few Members of the Congress had any idea what was in the bill but were asked to approve it, without debate, without adequate review, without amendments, and without roll call votes. 
   As a result, Washington broke the spending caps mandated in last year's Balanced Budget Act by spending more than $21 billion of the surplus for so-called ``emergency'' purposes. 
   Budget negotiators magically invented a new smoke and mirrors budget term--``forward funding'' which shifted $9.3 billion into future budgets. Long-criticized ``backdoor spending'' thrived: for example, lawmakers sneaked $1 billion to fund programs to achieve initiatives under the Kyoto treaty. The White House has not sent up the Treaty and the Congress has many reservations about it. 
   Without any policy consideration, hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars went to fund such pork programs as, amazingly, caffeinated chewing gum research. 
   The budget process is seriously flawed. Twenty-five years ago, Congress tried to change its budget practices and get spending under control by passing the Congressional Budget Act. Yet, over these 25 years, our national debt has grown from $540 billion to $5.6 trillion. 
   Spending is at an all-time high, and so are taxes. The budget process has become so complicated that most lawmakers have a hard time understanding it. Of course, that hasn't stopped the proliferation of budget gimmicks to circumvent the intent of the Congress. 
   Before the situation explodes completely, Congress must immediately reform the budget process to ensure the integrity of our budget and appropriations process. We can begin in the 106th Congress by taking a few simple steps. 
   The first step is to ensure our government's continued operation without any interruption. Last week, I introduced important legislation that would continue funding for the Government at the prior year's level when Congress and the President fail to complete appropriations legislation.  
   Mr. President, we all still have a fresh memory of the 1995 Federal Government shutdown, the longest one in history, which caused financial damage and inconvenience to millions of Americans when the President refused to support a Balanced Budget Act and tax relief for Americans. 
   However, the most serious damage done by the 27-day shutdown was that it shook the American people's confidence in their Government and in their elected officials. 
   I am concerned that President Clinton would use this technique again to force Congress into spending more money. I believe we can do better for the taxpayers and believe my legislation, the Good Government bill, will help to do that. 
   In May of 1997, I first proposed this as a stand-alone vote in an effort to pass the flood relief bill for Northern Minnesota. The Senate Democratic leader agreed and supported my proposal. I was able to obtain a commitment from the Senate leadership of both parties to pursue the legislation separately in the near future. 
   Last summer, I sought to offer it as an amendment to an appropriations bill. This amendment, originally sponsored by Senator MCCAIN, would have created an automatic procedure for a CR at the end of each fiscal year. Unfortunately, my efforts were not successful. 
   If I had succeeded, we would not have had to go through the debacle last year's omnibus spending bill. 
   Mr. President, we all have different philosophies and policies on budget priorities, and of course we will not always agree. 
   But there are essential functions and services of the Federal Government we must continue to fund regardless of our differences in budget priorities. Program funding must be based on merits, not on political leverage. 
   This legislation would continue funding for the Federal Government at 100 percent of the previous year's level when Congress and the President fail to complete appropriations legislation at the end of any fiscal year. 
   The virtue of this legislation is that it would allow us to debate issues concerning spending policy and the merits of budget priorities while we continue to keep essential Government functions operating. The American taxpayer will no longer be held hostage to a Government shutdown. 
   Mr. President, there are still plenty of uncertainties involved in our budget and appropriations process, particularly this year. We must ensure that this good-government contingency plan is adopted to keep the Government up and running in the event a budget agreement is not reached. 
   Another step we must take is to control our emergency spending. Emergency spending is spending over the budget allotment and is supposed to cover true emergencies, such as natural disaster relief. 
   Instead, Congress and the Administration have used this as an opportunity to bust the budget for a lot of spending that is not emergency related at all. Most of this spending can be planned within our budget limits. Even natural disasters happen regularly--why not put something in our budget to pay for them? 
   That is why I am introducing the ``Emergency Spending Control Act'' today as well. This legislation would require the President to submit a line item in his budget for natural disaster relief funding. The funding levels for this line item would be based on the average spending of the last five years on natural disaster relief. 
   The amount in this line item would not be subject to the current spending caps. The funding of this budget line item must be used exclusively for natural disaster relief--any use for non-natural disasters is strictly prohibited. 
   Mr. President, as a Senator whose State has been previously devastated by the 1997 flood of the Red and Minnesota Rivers, tornadoes, snow, ice and other natural disasters, I know how important enacting this legislation is not only for Minnesotans, but for all Americans. 
   Fortunately, city mayors, the State of Minnesota, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency acted quickly in the Red River Valley, and the rebuilding process moved relatively fast. 
   Local governments continue to work closely with my office and with State and Federal agencies to answer the many questions that still arise as people seek to rebuild their homes, their businesses, and the rest of their lives. 
   We owe it to these Minnesotans and other Americans who have been faced with a natural disaster to require the President to submit a line item in his budget for natural disaster relief funding. 
   Local and State officials should not be required to come to Washington and lobby for funding every time that a natural disaster occurs. We should not have to consider and pass separate ``emergency'' legislation which becomes a magnet for other so-called emergency spending. Disasters occur every year, we should budget for them. 
   Mr. President, the second to the last bill I am introducing today is a bill to enforce and expand the statutory spending caps. Spending limits are a good tool to control spending--if the President and lawmakers stick to them. But since the establishment of statutory spending limits, Washington has repeatedly broken them. 
   Washington set forth new spending caps in 1990 after it failed to meet its deficit reduction targets. In 1993, President Clinton broke the statutory spending caps for his new spending increases and created new caps. 
   But in 1997, the President could not live within his own spending caps, and he broke them again. Last year, President Clinton proposed over $22 billion of so-called ``emergency spending'' in the omnibus spending legislation and again broke the caps. 
   Again and again, Washington lowers the fiscal bar and then jumps over it at the expense of the American taxpayers. 
   This is wrong. Mr. President. If we commit to living within the statutory spending caps, we must stick to it. We must use every tool available to enforce these spending limits. 
   My legislation will help Congress to enforce its fiscal discipline by creating a new budget point of order to allow Congress to exceed spending limits only if two-thirds of its members vote to do so. 
   In addition, my bill would extend the limits beyond the year 2000. Doing so will ensure that spending increases won't grow faster than the income growth of working Americans. 
   There are many other budget process reforms I support as well, promoted by other Senators. One I would like to highlight is the biennial budget, which is proposed by our distinguished colleague, Senator DOMENICI. Biennial budgeting will allow us to examine our fiscal discipline as well as providing valuable time for our oversight responsibilities. 
   If the Congress adopts each of these changes, it will ensure a budget process that serves the best interests of the nation, allows careful policy and spending deliberation, and strengthens our political institution of government through representation as established by the Constitution. 
   Mr. President, finally I want to take a few minutes to introduce a bill which takes an important step toward improving the nation's federal crop insurance program--and that is a bill that I have introduced, the ``Crop Insurance Reform Act.'' 
   Last year, we witnessed devastating circumstances come together to create a crisis atmosphere for many of our nation's farmers. I know that in my own state of Minnesota, multiple years of wet weather and crop disease--especially scab--coupled with rising production costs and plummeting commodity prices have devastated family farms in record numbers. 
   With the increased opportunities that accompany Freedom to Farm come increased risks. We've seen this first hand. 
   Freedom to Farm can work, but a necessary component of it, as I have argued repeatedly, is an adequate crop insurance program. This component has been missing so far. One of the promises made during debate of the 1996 Farm Bill was that Congress would address the need for better crop insurance. 
   We must not let another growing season pass without having instituted a new, effective crop insurance program. 
   This overhaul is a major undertaking, and instituting a program of comprehensive reform should be and is now a legislative priority.  
   In fact, the President has included a number of ideas for reforming the federal crop insurance program in his recent budget proposal. Most importantly, the President has suggested increasing the federal subsidies on crop insurance premiums and eliminating disparities in subsidy rates. Essentially, this is similar to legislation I introduced last year and am introducing again today. Unfortunately, while the President claims to support crop insurance reform, he has failed to identify any money in his budget to fund it. However, now that he has recognized the urgency of the situation, I hope we can work together to accomplish meaningful reform. 
   Furthermore, we must resume the debate now so that we can have the best system in place in time, and that we can do it in time for the year 2000 crops. The bill I am introducing today is a first step. It is the result of months of work from my Minnesota Crop Insurance Work Group. 
   The Work Group consists of various commodity groups, farm organizations, rural lenders, and agriculture economists. We have also worked closely with USDA's Farm Service and Risk Management Agencies. But it was my primary intention to assemble a committee of farmers and lenders--people who know the situation and have seen the problems firsthand. 
   The Crop Insurance Reform Act is designed to address the coverage decision a farmer must make at the initial stages of purchasing crop insurance. Producers have been telling us that they need better coverage, but that it is currently too expensive. 
   My bill will allow more options for producers to choose from when making risk-management decisions. It essentially provides farmers with an enhanced coverage product at a more affordable price. 
   Currently, producer premium subsidies range from nearly 42 percent at the 100 percent price election for 65 percent coverage, to only 13 percent at the 100 percent price election for 85 percent coverage. Although the Risk Management Agency has recently provided better product options, the relatively low subsidy levels at the higher ends of coverage make them cost prohibitive. 
   My bill will put in place a flat subsidy level of 31 percent across the 100 percent price election and at all levels of coverage. 
   This will adjust the producer premiums to make better coverage more affordable, thereby removing the incentive from purchasing lesser-grade coverage. The Crop Insurance Reform Act puts the focus of the coverage decision on what really matters: and that is the type of coverage which would be needed in the event of a disaster or loss, rather than simply making the decision based upon up-front costs. 
   When farmers are armed with the necessary risk management tools, I believe everybody will save. The government saves in ad hoc disaster payments, arguably the most expensive way to address any kind of financial crisis. But more importantly, the family farmer saves. 
   This bill is part of a continued effort to reform Federal Crop Insurance. 
   Over the next few months, I will continue to work with my Crop Insurance Work Group, and my colleagues, Senators LUGAR and ROBERTS, to craft a comprehensive program which directly benefits producers and also will be here to protect the taxpayers.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, the second bill I am introducing with my good friend, Senator CRAPO of Idaho, is lockbox legislation. 
   Before being elected to the Senate in 1998, MIKE CRAPO led the fight to enact the Lock Box legislation in the House of Representatives. His version of the Lock Box legislation was passed by the House of Representatives on four different occassions, both as a free standing bill and as an amendment. I am pleased to have Senator CRAPO as a partner on this legislation in the Senate. 
   Mr. President, our short-term fiscal situation has improved greatly due to the continued growth of our economy. It is reported that we may end up with a unified budget surplus of over $80 billion this year and a $4.5 trillion surplus in the next 15 years. 
   Of course, tax dollars are always considered ``free money'' by the big spenders here in Washington, and the thought of all that new ``free surplus money'' is creating a feeding frenzy on Capitol Hill. 
   If we don't lock away this increased revenue for the taxpayers, the government will spend every penny of it. Despite the rhetoric about reserving it all for Social Security, Washington has already spent $30 billion of last year's budget surplus. 
   We need a lockbox to dedicate any increased revenue in the future and return it to the taxpayers as tax relief, debt reduction, and Social Security reform. 
   Since the unexpected revenue has come directly from working Americans, I believe it is only fair to return it to them. The tax burden on the American people is still historically high. It's sound policy to use our non-Social Security surplus to lower the tax burden and allow families to keep a little more of their hard-earned money. 
   Over the past 30 years, as I mentioned, we have amassed a $5.6 trillion national debt thanks to Washington's culture of spending. A newborn child today will bear over $20,000 of that debt the moment he or she comes into the world. Each year, we sink more than $250 billion into the black hole of interest payments, which could be better spent fighting crime, maintaining roads and bridges, and equipping the military. It's sound policy to use part of any surpluses to begin paying down the national debt and reducing the financial burden on the next generations. 
   The budget surpluses also give us a great opportunity to address our other long-term financial imbalances. Federal unfunded liabilities could eventually top $20 trillion, bankrupting our government if no real reform occurs. 
   It's vitally important that we use the entire Social Security surplus exclusively for Social Security, and we should even use a portion of the non-Social Security surplus to finance Social Security reforms. 
   If we don't lock in the surplus, Washington will spend all of it to expand the government. That's what they are doing now. Last month alone, President Clinton proposed 41 new programs. The spending increases he outlined could reach $300 billion a year, the highest increase proposed by any President in our history. 
   Mr. President, we must never, never, never repeat the mistake we made in 1997 and 1998, and allow Washington take a huge bite into the taxpayers' money. We must do everything we can to ensure we reserve any increased revenue for Social Security, tax relief and debt reduction.

   Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Georgia for organizing this time and giving us an opportunity to speak on some of the subjects that I think are very important to this Congress. 
   Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in offering our perspective on the State of the Union--on both last night's speech by the President, and also the direction I believe we are headed as a nation. 
   Let me begin with the speech. 
   What we heard from the President last night was vintage Bill Clinton. And that is lots of promises, lots of poll-tested proposals, lots of talk, but that all adds up to more spending and more Washington control. In fact, in about 77 minutes he made about 77 new promises of spending for Washington. 
   Each of us want good schools for our children, security for our retirement years, a tax system that lets us meet important family obligations, and more opportunities for Americans to sell their products around the world. But empty promises from Washington are not going to help. 
   The President believes the answer in part lies in targeted tax cuts that try to regulate behavior. It is a way to bribe the taxpayers with their own money by saying, ``If you do this for me, I will cut your taxes in return.'' 
   That is the wrong approach. It is aimed at a certain political segment, and because of that, 90 percent of the people in this country will not benefit. The tax cuts proposed by the President add up to too few dollars that only a few people would benefit from. 
   If we are truly going to pursue economic freedom for all, the real answer is to reduce the roadblocks to success. That, I believe, begins with our continuing efforts on cutting taxes for everyone. 
   Yesterday, I joined Chairman ROTH in introducing S. 3, the Tax Cuts for All Americans Act. Our legislation, one of the top five priorities of Republicans in the 106th Congress, would offer a ten percent across-the-board tax cut for every American, instead of the President's targeted tax scheme that ignores most working families. A ten-percent cut is meaningful tax relief for all, not token tax relief for just a few. 
   Mr. President, in one word, the state of the union is ``overtaxed.'' 
   American families are taxed at the highest levels in our history, even higher than during World War II, with nearly 40 percent of a typical family's budget going to pay taxes on the federal, state and local levels. Over $1.8 trillion of their income will be siphoned off to Washington this year. 
   Certainly, the taxpayers are in desperate need of relief. 
   Freedom for families means giving families the freedom to spend more of their own dollars as they choose. 
   Our bill will cut the personal tax rate for each American by 10 percent across the board. It will increase incentives to work. It will increase incentives to save and invest. It will help to improve the standard of living for all Americans. 
   The 10 percent across-the-board tax cut will not only benefit families, but it will also have a substantial, positive impact on the economy as a whole. It will increase the financial rewards of hard work, entrepreneurship, innovation, and productivity--the very foundations upon which this nation has thrived. 
   If the state of the union is overtaxed, the President did not help much with the laundry list of new initiatives he proposed last night that would expand the size and scope of the already enormous federal government. 
   It was about 2 years ago that we heard the era of big government was over. Well, the era of big government is now alive and well. In fact, it is a mammoth new government under the proposals of President Clinton last night. Many of these programs sound good, but what the President did not spell out is exactly who is going to pay for it--and, of course, we all know that its the taxpayers. In other words, I say he led Americans into the candy store last night and said, ``you can have anything you want.'' The only problem is he didn't tell you who is going to have to pay for it. The White House ``spinmeisters'' suggested the President's proposals would, ``knock your socks off.'' Instead, those proposals will pick your pockets. 
   Mr. President, let me say this as clearly as I can: I will strongly oppose any proposals that are designed to build the President's popularity at the expense of the American taxpayers. 
   I am also disappointed by the comments made by the President last night about the ailing Social Security system. 
   We heard a lot of vague promises that ultimately leave the government in control of your retirement dollars and do nothing to save Social Security from bankruptcy or create a better retirement system for the next generation. The President is worried about saving a failed retirement system that promises small benefits when he should be working to create a system that  provides larger benefits and more security for everybody. Let us worry about people, and not expend precious time and resources trying to save a dying government program. If we are truly serious about offering Americans the opportunity to achieve wealth and security in their retirement years, legislation I have introduced that would allow workers to set up personal retirement accounts is a far better approach. Mr. President, the American people now have a choice: empty words and poll-tested promises on one hand, and a real taxpayers' agenda of freedom and opportunity on the other. The state of the union can be improved, as my colleagues and I have so vigorously suggested today. And the people are depending on us to lead the way. I thank the Chair. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 3, the Tax Cuts for All Americans Act, along with Senator ROTH, Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. 
   First, I'd like to commend the Senate Majority Leader for including this important legislation as one of the Republicans' top 5 agenda items and Finance Committee Chairman ROTH for making this a committee priority. This emphasizes the importance and commitment by Republicans to provide meaningful tax relief for working Americans. 
   Mr. President, American families are taxed at the highest levels in our history, even higher than during World War II, with nearly 40 percent of a typical family's budget going to pay taxes on the federal, state and local levels. 
   Today, the Clinton Administration consumes over 20.5 percent of America's entire gross domestic product. That's the highest level since 1945 when taxes were raised to pay for the war. 
   The average American family today spends more on taxes than it does on food, clothing, and housing combined. If the ``hidden taxes'' that result from the high cost of government regulations are factored in, a family today gives up more than 50 percent of its annual income to the government. 
   At a time when the combination of federal income and payroll taxes, state and local taxes, and hidden taxes consumes over half of a working family's budget, the taxpayers are in desperate need of relief. 
   Americans today are working harder but taking home less. Over $1.8 trillion of their income will be siphoned off to the federal government this year. It is more critical than ever to provide meaningful tax relief for working Americans. 
   Freedom for families means giving families the freedom to spend more of their own dollars as they choose. This tax relief would give Americans more freedom and create more economic opportunities for them and their children. 
   That's why I am introducing this legislation today. Tax relief should benefit all Americans, not just those who have been targeted in the past. My bill, S. 3, will do just that. 
   My bill will cut the personal tax rate for each American by 10 percent. It will increase incentives to work, save and invest. It will improve the standards of living for all Americans and permit the growth in our economy we expect to continue and it will encourage Americans to work harder and produce more. 
   By enacting the 10 percent across-the-board tax cut, we can begin turning back the decades of abuse taxpayers have suffered at the hands of their own government, a government too often eager to spend the taxpayers' money to expand its reach over more of our economy and personal lives. 
   It was John F. Kennedy who observed that ``an economy hampered with high tax rates will never produce enough revenue to balance the budget just as it will never produce enough output and enough jobs.'' 
   Twenty-seven years ago, President Reagan enacted a 25 percent across-the-board tax cut and in 1986, President Reagan signed a landmark piece of legislation to reduce the marginal tax rate to a simple two-rate income tax system: 15 percent and 28 percent. 
   What resulted was nothing short of an economic miracle. Our nation experienced the longest peacetime economic expansion in American history, the benefits of which we are still enjoying today. Ronald Reagan fought for tax cuts, not to bribe special interest groups to buy their votes--but because individuals have a right to spend their own money. 
   President Reagan was right. When we enact the 10 percent across-the-board tax cut, we will make our economy more dynamic, and our families more prosperous as we approach the 21st century. 
   While I prefer a total overhaul of the tax system and will shortly introduce a bill to repeal the current system with a consumption tax, this is a much-needed first step we should all agree is our first priority for this Congress.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the ``Powder Cocaine Sentencing Act of 1999'' sponsored by Senator SPENCE ABRAHAM of Michigan. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this important legislation that will toughen federal policy toward powder cocaine dealers. 
   As we begin the legislative business of the Senate this year, we must strengthen our efforts to stop illegal drug use and drug-related crime and violence. We must fulfill our moral obligation to communicate the dangers and consequences of illegal drug use. Continuing our fight against the threat of drug abuse is one of the most important contributions the 106th Congress  can make toward providing a promising future for the young people of America. 
   Under current law, a dealer must distribute 500 grams of powder cocaine to qualify for a 5-year mandatory minimum prison sentence, and distribute 5 grams of crack cocaine for that offense. These sentencing guidelines result in a 100-to-1 quantity ratio between powder and more severe crack cocaine distribution sentences. This disparity has caused a great deal of concern among members of Congress and the administration. Unfortunately, the Clinton administration fails to see the dangers in changing the federal crack cocaine distribution law. 
   During the 104th Congress, the U.S. Sentencing Commission recommended a lower threshold under which a convicted person may receive a 5-year mandatory sentence in cases involving the distribution of crack cocaine. Through the leadership of Senator ABRAHAM, Congress overwhelmingly passed legislation which rejected the Sentencing Commission's proposal. At the signing ceremony for this legislation, President Clinton expressed the strong message its enactment would send to our Nation and those who choose to deal drugs throughout our communities. 
   President Clinton remarked,  
   We have to send a constant message to our children that drugs are illegal, drugs are dangerous, drugs may cost you your life--and the penalties for dealing drugs are severe. I am not going to let anyone who peddles drugs get the idea that the cost of doing business is going down.  
   Regrettably, the Clinton administration continues to promote a federal sentencing policy for crack cocaine offenses that fails to recognize the dangerous and addictive nature of this illegal substance and its impact upon violent crime throughout our communities. In an April 1997 report to Congress, the Sentencing Commission unanimously recommended an increase in the mandatory minimum trigger for the distribution of crack cocaine. 
   I share the views expressed by the administration and community groups in my home state of Minnesota that the current penalty disparity in cocaine sentencing should be addressed. However, I disagree with the ill-advised manner in which the administration seeks to achieve this goal by making the mandatory minimum prison sentences for crack cocaine dealers at least five times more lenient than they are today. 
   Mr. President, the legislation offered today by Senator ABRAHAM represents a fair and effective approach toward federal cocaine sentencing policy. Rather than make federal crack cocaine sentences more lenient, the Abraham bill would reduce from 500 to 50 grams the amount of powder cocaine a person must be convicted of distributing before receiving a mandatory 5-year sentence. This legislation would adjust the current 100-to-1 quantity ratio to 10-to-1 by toughening powder cocaine sentences without reducing crack cocaine sentences. 
   By February 1, Congress will receive a National Drug Control Strategy from the Office of National Drug Control Policy which will contain goals for reducing drug abuse in the United States. As part of this plan, I am hopeful that National Drug Control Policy Director Barry McCaffrey will speak out forcefully against any proposal to make sentences for a person who is convicted of dealing crack cocaine more lenient. Punishing drug dealers who prey upon the innocence of our children should be a critical component of our nation's drug strategy. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the ``Powder Cocaine Sentencing Act of 1999'' and reject lower federal crack sentences. We should exercise greater oversight of federal sentencing policy for cocaine offenses. Passage of this legislation will help give greater protection to Americans from drugs by keeping offenders off the streets for longer periods of time.

   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues for the introduction of the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System Act of 1999. I would like to thank Senator JOHNSON and Senator DASCHLE for their hard work and dedication to this project over the past two Congresses. 
   Mr. President, the Southwestern corner of Minnesota, along with adjoining areas in South Dakota and Iowa, is now served by a wholly inadequate water system which is highly susceptible to  drought, leading most of the communities in this region to impose severe water restrictions. 
   The situation has forced communities throughout the region to explore aggressively alternative water supplies. Communities such as Luverne and Worthington, both in southwestern Minnesota, have spent tens of thousands of dollars yearly in an unsuccessful search for another water source, always with the same disappointing results. Eventually, however, it was determined that by working together with communities throughout the region and in all three states, a workable solution might be found. 
   That solution is the bill we are introducing today. Under this legislation, local communities will come together with the affected states and the federal government to form a strong, financial partnership, thereby ensuring an adequate, safe water supply while reducing the cost to the American taxpayers. 
   The Lewis and Clark Rural Water System is a fiscally responsible project that invests in the future economic health of the tri-state region by strengthening its critical utilities infrastructure. With increasing population growth, economic development, new federal drinking water regulations, water demands, and shallow wells and aquifers which are subject to contamination, it is critical that the area encompassed by the Lewis and Clark Rural Water System establish a clean, reliable water source to meet the demand for future water use that cannot be met by present resources. 
   Mr. President, this legislation has been before the Senate for the last two Congresses. Last year, we were successful in passing the legislation through the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. This year, we must see this bill passed by the Senate and the House and sent to the President for his signature. 
   Providing safe and available drinking water to our communities is one of the most basic functions of government. It is not a partisan issue, and therefore I am proud to join with a bipartisan group of my colleagues and the governors of Minnesota, South Dakota, and Iowa in supporting this bill.
