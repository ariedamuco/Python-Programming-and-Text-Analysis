Mr. THOMAS. I strongly agree with my colleagues regarding the importance of the Section 29 tax credit. Wyoming has some of the nation's largest coal reserves and this tax credit gives producers an incentive to develop new and innovative technologies for the use of coal. I am disappointed that an extension of the Section 29 tax credit was not included in the Omnibus Appropriations package and urge my colleagues to make this matter a top priority during the 106th Congress.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as the world is catapulted into the electronic information age, the United States has a rare opportunity not only to participate in a truly international legal database but also to sustain a leadership role in setting the highest standard for the creation and maintenance of such a database. It is also a fortuitous moment for the Congress to encourage and support an effort that will inure to the direct benefit of the Congress in its legislative functions by having access to foreign laws contemporaneously with or shortly after publication in the country of origin. This effort, conceived and developed by our own Law Library of Congress, is the Global Legal Information Network, popularly referred to as `GLIN.' 
GLIN is an international, cooperative, non-commercial database of legal information contributed to by governments of member nations in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas. As a mission-driven project, GLIN was developed by the Law Library as a way to organize and gain access to legal information so that the Law Library could respond to requests from Congress in a timely, efficient manner since the Law Library is responsible for doing research and analysis on the laws of other nations, comparative law, and international law. This continues to be the goal of the Law Library's participation in GLIN. 
The database comprises abstracts of legal material, full texts of laws and regulations, and a legal thesaurus. The GLIN database is structured so that the full range of legal material including constitutions, laws and regulations, judicial decisions, parliamentary debates, scholarly writings, and legal miscellanea can be added to the database over time as countries are able to make these contributions. 
Since 1995, GLIN has become a truly `global' legal information network and the Law Library has trained technical and legal teams from numerous countries plus a team from the United Nations. These countries are at various stages of compliance with the GLIN standards for organizational, technical, and telecommunications capabilities. 
GLIN is the centerpiece of the Law Library's transition from a paper-based library to one that effectively exploits the advantages of electronic sources of information. The amount of time and resources needed to acquire, process, and store foreign legal material make GLIN a top priority for the Law Library, and as the United States station for the network it has also undertaken the task of putting United States law into the database using the same high standards demanded of other nations. To date, the Law Library has not received appropriated funds for work on GLIN. 
What other Parliaments around the world are doing concerning many of the issues we face is vital for our legislative functions. A 1886 treaty, still in force today, recognized the important need for the exchange of official journals, parliamentary annals, and documents. Congress needs access to the most reliable, current legal information available. GLIN can provide this information, but only if it is developed and maintained properly. With limited resources, and using the only technology and technological support available from an already strapped technology support staff in the Library of Congress which is consumed by other Library programs, participation by the Law Library in GLIN is at a critical point. The system now requires urgent updating and upgrading to enhance the performance of the Network and to attract additional countries, particularly those that are of interest to Congress. To best serve Congress, it is essential that the Law Library retain a leadership role technologically and content-wise. To facilitate such participation, the Law Library needs a special appropriation to bolster its staff and technological infrastructure on its own without being dependent or in competition with other Library of Congress programs. 
Besides affording the Law Library the ability to bolster resources to meet this important growing initiative, this special appropriation will permit the Law Library through development and training to fulfill its natural role as the largest law library in the world to set the highest of standards for the form and content of legal information to be exchanged between nations to ensure that such material is accurate and complete, and thereby totally reliable. It also fosters interparliamentary cooperation.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today and come to the floor to thank the Senate and the House for the passage of S. 1693, the Vision 2020 bill, national parks reform. I think it is a great day for the Congress and for our national parks. Parks are one of the real resources, one of the real treasures that we have in this country that I think all of us have feelings for. There are lots of different parks and lots of different kinds of parks, but they are all our heritage. They are our culture. 
I think we have known for some time that the parks have needed some assistance. They are more visited now than ever. They are more utilized, as they should be, by Americans than ever. The Park Service, on the other hand, thinks that they are at least $10 billion in arrears in infrastructure costs and they need to change. I think there is a willingness to change on the part of the Park Service. So through hard work and bipartisan compromise we forged a bill that will preserve and help protect our parks now and well into the next century. 
I have a special place in my heart for parks. I grew up right outside of Yellowstone Park near Cody, WY. We have the first park, Yellowstone, that is more than 125 years old now, also Grand Teton Park, which is, of course, a spectacular and unusual place, Devil's Tower. So parks are very much a part of the West. They also are very much part of the rest of the country. Right here in Virginia, last week my wife and I went to Philadelphia, Independence Park, one of the great treasures of our history. So I am very pleased with this legislation and I think it will be helpful. 
Let me mention a few of the major provisions of S. 1693. First, it requires the Department to develop a strategic plan and comprehensive budget for the individual units. It is a large business. The budget is $1.2 billion. So there has to, now, in addition to the management of resources, be management of a large financial issue. We need plans. We need a Park Service that has transparency in terms of its plans and in terms of its budget. There needs to be a budget. There needs to be assurance that the expenditures are the same as the appropriations requests. That has not always been the case. 
We need to establish a process for developing new parks. There are criteria for parks and they need to be followed. We have a proposition where there would be a study to see if, indeed, that park does square with the criteria that we have set forth. Too often, I think, Members of Congress have been able to bring parks into the system to be supported by Federal dollars when, frankly, they really perhaps did not meet the criteria that they should. 
The bill provides for enhanced training opportunities for Park Service employees. Many of them have very specialized jobs, very specialized work to inventory and to understand what the resources are and to protect them. In my experience of working with Government and in this Government, I don't know of an agency that has a more dedicated staff than does the Park Service. They are people who are really committed to what they are doing and committed to the preservation of parks and making them useful. We need to help with opportunities for training. 
We are providing for increased scientific study and research to ensure park resources are inventoried and they are, indeed, protected. 
There are two purposes: The first purpose of the park, of course, is to maintain the resources, whether they be cultural or natural resources. The second is to provide for its owners, the American people, to visit. One of the elements of that, of course, is the concessions that provide the services that are necessary. 
We have worked at changing the concessions policy and making it more competitive so that new businesses can have an opportunity to provide them, to provide them more efficiently, to provide more of an opportunity, and to pay some of the income to the park as a means of sustaining it. 
We have eliminated the preferential right of renewal so that there is competition for those services as they are renewed. 
We have authorized the new national park collectible passport which provides an opportunity for supporters of a park to pay a little something and to have in their car window or their house window this attractive passport that will allow us to help support the parks. 
We provide for increased philanthropic support for individual units to help Friends of Yellowstone, for example, to raise money, and they raise significant amounts of money for parks. 
We have authorized some studies for the Park Police which is necessary. We have some 400 Park Police right here in the Capital who have large responsibilities. 
These are some of the changes that we have worked at. This is the first time in 18 years that we have had a generic parks bill that is designed not to deal with some specific park but rather to deal with the whole idea of a system that will preserve and strengthen the parks. It is the culmination of more than 2 years of work by the subcommittee. We have had hearings coast to coast. We have been in Colorado. We have been out in San Francisco. There are many different kinds of parks. We had the same reaction at the hearings: that there needs to be more resources; they need to be managed better; we need to have more support; we need to deal with gateway communities; and have better communications. I think these things will be strengthened. We passed a bill that, I think, will do much of that. 
I want to take a moment to thank some of the people who were involved. We hear a lot about the difficulty of passing legislation, and it is difficult. Everyone has, legitimately, different ideas about how things ought to be done; indeed, philosophies of how they might be done. The media, of course, emphasizes the conflicts that we have, and we have conflicts. Here, although most everyone will agree with parks, there are conflicts about how we resolve these things. 
I am so pleased we had an opportunity to come together with people on both sides of the aisle, with people in the administration, with people in the Congress. No one got everything they wanted. We had to make concessions. We had to make changes, give up some things, add some things. But that is the way the legislative process has to work. 
I particularly thank Senator Murkowski, the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, for all of his guidance on this legislation. Without his help, of course, we wouldn't have had this bill before the Senate. The chairman went out of his way to ensure that negotiations stayed on track. As you know, Alaska has some unique things. He helped to make this thing work. 
I also thank Senator Bumpers, the ranking minority member of the committee. I know personally that he has worked on some of these things. He has worked on the issue of concessions in particular for at least 10 years. He made some concessions on this issue. Without him, frankly, we wouldn't have a bill, particularly over in the House where he worked at it. I just say to the Senator from Arkansas that I really appreciate his help and appreciate the attitude that he brought here to this debate. 
I thank Secretary of Interior Bruce Babbitt. It is no secret that we don't always agree with a lot of things, like public lands. Bruce Babbitt worked as hard as anyone could be asked to work. He came from California to work with our staff on this. He helped form a compromise. 
Also, I thank Assistant Secretary Don Barry--these folks worked very hard--as well as Bob Bennett. There is a whole list of people. Over in the House, Jim Hansen and Chairman Don Young worked very hard as well. 
Finally, I thank the staff, of course, at all levels in the Senate, in the committee, particularly my personal associates: Liz Brimmer, my chief of staff; Dan Naatz, legislative director; Jim O'Toole, who is the director of the committee staff; and Steve Shackelton, a fellow, who worked originally with us on the bill. 
I wanted to come to the floor to say a couple of things. One is, I am very pleased we passed this. I think it is going to help parks. 
Second, I am impressed with the system when we really do work together and cooperate to come up with something that is a compromise and reach the goals with which we began. 
Mr. President, I thank you for the time and say, again, I am very pleased we were able to bring this to passage in the Senate.

Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
Mr. President, first of all, let me thank the Senator from Mississippi for the work that he has done on this agriculture appropriations bill. It is a very difficult one. It is a large bill of $56 billion. It is very difficult. It comes at a time when we are seeking, I think properly, to make a transition from the old farm programs with the acreage allotments and the subsidies to a market system which, in my State at least, most farmers and ranchers believe we should do. Coupled with that, of course, has come some unfortunate weather disasters, flooding and those kinds of things and crop failures as well. And certainly the Asian currency problem has had an impact in terms of available foreign markets, which is very important when nearly 40 percent of agricultural products are sold in that way. 
So now we are faced with the problem of seeking to deal with these problems. Everybody wants to do that. Everybody wants to be helpful for agriculture. Then we need to find the proper way to do it. We need to be able to do this in a way that I think does not cause us to deviate from our policy position, which is to return to a marketplace in agriculture. 
We are doing a great deal for agriculture in this bill. There will be transition payments. There will be payments for disasters. As a matter of fact, as I understand it, the figures that I have indicate that through 1996 and 1998 farmers have been paid approximately $17 billion under the old bill. That would have been $10 billion. There has been a substantial increase there. Farmers will receive approximately $500 billion from the banks in transition payments in October of this year. 
Actually all these numbers added together equal $31 billion paid to farmers and ranchers over the past 3 years. If you take the 1998 bonus in advance for 1999, we would be paying $15 billion out in this 1 year. 
There is a substantial interest being made and properly being made. There are other things, in my view, that need to be done as well. We need to do something about increasing foreign markets, of course. I happen to be on the Foreign Relations Committee and am chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia. We are trying to do some things to reclaim that market--in all kinds of ways to get those markets back, particularly for agriculture. 
We have done something about the unilateral sanctions--the idea that if something happens in Asia or Pakistan that the first thing you do is sanction off the sales of agricultural products. We have made some changes there, as indeed we should. 
I believe we should move forward in doing something with income averaging on a permanent basis for agriculture. This is the kind of an industry where you may have a very good year, or have a very poor year, and you should be able to income average. 
We need savings accounts for farmers so they hold back in good years so they are able to do better. 
Crop insurance--crop interests need to be revised the way it came out of the farm bill. That was changed and has not been effective. We need to do that. 
It is interesting. Our friends on the other side of the aisle talk about this increase, and the President is now making speeches on Saturday, and so on. It turns out that he started out asking for less than $1 billion. It went up to $2 billion, and suddenly politically he has gone up to $7 billion, and probably more. 
We have to really deal with this on that basis. 
Mr. President, I wanted to say that I am disappointed in a couple of areas. I come from a State, of course, where the major activity in agriculture is livestock--cattle and sheep. I was very much interested in our moving forward with this matter of labels; this country of origin kind of thing so that buyers could decide what kind of meats they choose to buy, whether they want to have American-made meats or meats from other countries. But they should be able to know that. We put that in the Senate bill and lost it in the conference. I am very disappointed in that. 
We also, I believe, need to have our market reporting strengthened so that all the cattle and all of the sheep that go in the market will be reported as part of the market, not those things that are held by packers and never reported that would impact the crisis. 
I am disappointed in those things. I hope that we can go forward. 
There is some indication apparently from the conference committee that we would go forward with the study of the labeling. I hope we do. 
On the other hand, I think it is going to be slow that way. I wish, frankly, that we could change it before we have to go back and do it that way. 
Mr. President, I just wanted to say that I admire very much the work that has been done. I know we must do something in agriculture. We are poised to do something. 
I wanted to point out the two areas of disappointment that I have--that of labeling in the country of origin, and that of transparency in market prices. We need something we can do about that. 
Mr. President, I thank you for the time. I yield the floor.  
Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today as chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs to express my deep concern over the recent alarming political developments in Malaysia. 
On September 2, Prime Minister Mahathir fired Deputy Prime Minister Dato Seri Anwar Ibrahim, his hand-picked heir apparent. In the past few months, as the value of the ringgit has dropped more than 60 percent against the US dollar and as the economy has shown increasing signs of going the way of its surrounding Asian neighbors', Dato Seri Anwar has been arguing with increasing frequency that the country needs to adopt meaningful economic structural reforms. This has run counter to Mahathir's insistence that the root of the country's economic ills lies solely at the feet of George Soros, and that by fixing the ringgit's convertibility and taking other similarly isolationist measures. 
This difference of economic opinion began to grow into a larger rift between the two politicians as Dato Seri Anwar began touring the country and speaking publicly. Apparently, Mahathir felt threatened both by Dato Seri Anwar's views and his popularity as a focus for growing anti-Mahathir dissent, and dismissed him from his post. That didn't stop Dato Seri Anwar from continuing to express himself. As a result, Dato Seri Anwar was arrested on September 20 and held under the provisions of the Internal Security Act (ISA). 
The ISA removes arrested individuals from the protections afforded criminal defendants under Malaysia's constitution and statutes, and consequently Dato Seri Anwar was held in an undisclosed location without any formal charges being lodged against him. On September 29, however, he was hauled into court and charged with nine counts of corruption and sexual misconduct, including four sodomy counts. The nature of the charges, as well as the vagueness of them and the fact that several of the `witnesses' have already recanted, clearly indicates to me that they were concocted by the government for maximum shock value to discredit Dato Seri Anwar in a conservative Muslim country. 
More shocking to me, however, is the condition in which Dato Seri Anwar appeared at his arraignment. He had clearly been beaten while in custody. He told the judge that on his first night of detention, while handcuffed and blindfolded, that he was `boxed very hard on my head and lower jaw and left eye . . . I was then slapped very hard, left and right, until blood came out from my nose and my lips cracked. Because of this I could not walk or see properly.' To substantiate his claims, Dato Seri Anwar then showed the court a large bruise on his arm; his black eye was already evident to everyone in the courtroom. He has not been allowed any medical treatment for his injuries. Dr. Mahathir's contention yesterday that Dato Seri Anwar inflicted the injuries to himself in order to gain a public relations coup is so absurd, so ludicrous, that it simply confirms in my mind the veracity of Dato Seri Anwar's contentions. 
Mr. President, Dr. Mahathir prides himself on having transformed Malaysia from a divided multi-racial developing nation into a model of a modern, cosmopolitan, economically sophisticated country, and not without some justification. He also prides himself on being the self-appointed forward-thinking spokesman for Asian values and upholder of Asian independence from Western `interference.' But in my opinion by his actions in the case of Dato Seri Anwar, he negates much of the progress Malaysia has made in the eyes of the rest of the world. And on a personal level, he has sadly shown himself to be just another third-world despot intent on stifling any dissent, challenge to his authority, or deviation from the party line. 
Mr. President, I call on the Malaysian government to take every step to safeguard the rights of Dato Seri Anwar, ensure that any charges brought against him are not spurious, afford him a fair and open trial, and fully investigate and prosecute those responsible for his mistreatment while in detention. I hope that all Malaysians will be permitted to express their political views in a peaceful and orderly fashion without fear of arrest or intimidation, and that the government will avoid the perception that Malaysia is looking more and more like Burma and less and less like a democracy.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I have been wanting to come to the floor for some time to talk a little bit about the situation that we are in here in the Senate, here in the Congress, the amount of work that we have to do in a relatively short time, and, frankly, to urge my colleagues that we get on with it. 
The immediate need, of course, is to deal with the appropriations, to deal with continuing to finish what has to be done this year so that we keep the Federal Government operating, so that we do the things that need to be done. 
At last count, it seems to me, out of 13 appropriations, I think only three have been passed: one prepared by the Presiding Officer, which is the only one I think signed by the President. 
In any event, we have a great deal to do. Of course, as is always the case, there are many things being talked about, some of which are amendments on appropriations. Others are freestanding bills. But a lot of things could wait. None of us like to see things wait that are ours, of course. But I guess I am prepared to say that the appropriations are what we need to do, and finish this job so that a week from Friday we will be out of here. I think that is what we really need to do. 
It is an opportune time, having had almost all year dealing with appropriations, to remind my colleagues that we ought to take a look at a biannual appropriations process where we do that every other year, where we appropriate for 2 years as they do in almost all legislatures, which not only gives the agencies more time to know what money they have to spend, but I submit to you that one of the important things that the Senate doesn't do as well as we should, which is oversight. One of the reasons is we spend all of our time on appropriations. So I hope that is something that we can do. 
I understand it is perfectly proper to promote those things that you feel strongly about. I understand that there are different points of view. That is part of the reason for this system. Substantially we have different points of view: The more liberal point of view, and the more conservative point of view. Those are valid, and we ought to promote them. But I think when we have diversionary tactics, as we have seen on the other side of the aisle over the last month, that keep us from doing what we ought to do, that we have to take kind of a long look at it. 
It has been clear for some time that has been the strategy--to move off of appropriations--a strategy of my friends on the other side of the aisle to move off of those onto other kinds of things. 
I hope the total end game is not to get us into this business of threatening to shut down the Government so that the President has leverage to tell the Congress we are going to do this or else. That is not good government. That is not what we ought to be doing. And I hope that doesn't happen. 
The Interior bill is a very important one, particularly to me. I happen to be on the Interior Committee. I stay very involved because of the large amounts of Federal lands that have been sidelined largely because of unrelated issues that have been used almost daily--issues like campaign finance reform, important as it may be. We have already dealt with that several times. It continues to come up. It continues to be threatened. Minimum wage--we have been through minimum wage, which continues to come up constantly. 
Patients' Bill of Rights. Good idea. And there are two Patients' Bills of Rights out there--one, of course, by the Senator from Massachusetts, one by the Republicans. Many of the components of the bills are the same. There are some very important differences. But that comes up constantly, and I am afraid what is happened is, it is simply being used to extend it as a political activity through the election time without really the purpose of passing it at all. I think the majority leader has said that there is a desire apparently to debate the bill as long as possible to use it as a campaign issue. 
Now, that is too bad. That is too bad. There is no one who likes to argue about different points of view better than I, but we have things to do and we ought to be moving, we ought to be moving on them. 
So the President, I think, has joined in that diversionary tactic now. His spokesman, McCurry, is saying that these appropriations bills will have to be done to the President's satisfaction. Well, I want to remind the Senate, as did our good friend, Bob Byrd, the other evening, that--let me quote from his talk to the Senate a week ago--  
The legislative branch must be eternally vigilant over the powers and authorities vested in it by the Constitution. It is vitally important to the security of our constitutional system that checks and balances and separation of power be maintained. 
He said further: 
We as legislators have a responsibility to work with the Chief Executive, but it is intended to be a two-way street. The framers did not envision the Office of President as having the attributes of royalty. 
I certainly agree with that. And that is kind of what you see as we come down to the end of the appropriations--some attributes of royalty: It is either my way or the highway. 
Well, that is not the way you do legislative business. That is not the way it turns out best, and it is not the way we ought to be doing it. 
My good friend from Arkansas spent some time the other day speaking in terms of where we are with the economy. He was talking specifically about the proposed House tax reduction and was citing the 1993 Clinton tax increase as the reason for the balanced budget. 
I take exception to that. I don't think there is any evidence of that at all. He pointed out it was the largest tax increase in history, with not a single Republican vote. But anyone can raise revenue to close down the deficit. What you have to do is hold down spending, which has never been done by the White House, has never been done by this administration, but has in fact been done by the Republican Congress since 1994. 
Really, balancing the budget is the control of spending, and that is the way it ought to be. That is the way it ought to be. We have the highest taxes now that we have had since World War II, and we ought to do something about that. The American people and the business community are the ones who have balanced the budget by successfully competing in the world marketplace, by creating jobs and paying taxes. 
I had a letter from a constituent in Cody, WY, who has a point of view not everyone would agree with, but I thought it was interesting. He was talking about President Clinton's claim to have balanced the budget, and he said--this is from his letter: 
This is an extraordinary conclusion. It is mind-boggling because President Clinton has nothing to do with the successful economy. In fact, his efforts have only created problems for the business community--overtaxation, overregulation, endless legal challenges. 
That is a point of view. In any event, I think it is necessary to really be more precise about where we are. 
It is interesting now; we hear, of course, the President speaking out several times talking about `save Social Security,' and that all the surpluses ought to be saved for that. I think we ought to keep in mind that the Social Security surpluses over time have been used for Government spending, have constantly been used by Democratic Congresses all through the years, without having a balanced budget. The idea from the White House of `saving Social Security' has been a soundbite really without any outline particularly of how that is going to happen. We have to have some ideas, and there are some out there that are legitimate and good ones. 
The idea of saving the surplus and then coming up with almost a $20 billion supplemental request out of the same fund doesn't make any sense at all. It doesn't make any sense at all. We need to do something about Social Security. I am not a big fan of tax cutting, frankly. I think it might be more important to pay off some of the debt. This year, the defense budget will be about $250 billion and interest on the debt will be almost $25 billion more than that, about $275 billion--interest on the debt, paying for things that some of us have enjoyed and these young people sitting down here are going to pay for because we put it on the credit card. 
It wouldn't be a bad idea to pay off some of that debt. It seems to me maybe that is what we really ought to do. 
There are ways to fix Social Security, even though the White House hasn't come forth with any program except to say `save Social Security.' There are some ideas that are good ones. Take part of the 12 percent, let it be made into a personal account for you and for me, and be able to invest it. And we can do that. And the return, of course, would be much greater. Furthermore, if for some reason you don't utilize all of it, it becomes part of your estate. It is something that people then would own. 
Now, that is a solution. That is more than just talking about `save Social Security' without having any plan to do that. 
So, Mr. President, I hope that we can address ourselves to this idea of completing our work here. I hope that we don't find ourselves using the special allocations beyond spending limits as a means of increasing the budget without moving the spending limits. I think we have promised ourselves we were going to do that. It seems to me that we--and this, of course, is my view; not everyone shares it; I understand that--ought to have several objectives over time, and one is to have a smaller, more efficient Government. I think we ought to constantly work for that. 
There are lots of things we are doing that the Federal Government doesn't do perhaps as well as local government, doesn't do as well as the private sector. We ought to pay down the debt so that we don't have this problem of the single largest line item in the budget is to pay interest on the national debt in this time of great prosperity. We ought to reduce taxes. We have, since World War II, the highest taxload on families in this country, and we ought to change that. Generally, in my view, they ought to be taken in that order. 
So, Mr. President, I guess I have shared my view that we have some really important things to do. We have a very short time to do it. I hope we can get the obstacles out of the way and deal with our differences. We have them, but let's resolve those questions that are our responsibility to resolve. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to talk just a few minutes on this bill, particularly with respect to rural air service and some of the problems that we face in areas with small towns and small populations. 
First, let me say that I certainly support what the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Kentucky are doing here. I think this is a valuable bill, and I think we should move forward with it quickly. 
I do want to emphasize, however, the difficulty that we have in rural America with regard to air transportation. I must confess that it is not a new problem. As we deregulate various industries--and I happen to be for deregulation and letting competition work--we find ourselves with some problems in rural areas, whether it be telephones, or the deregulation of electricity, or air transportation. The obvious effect of deregulation is that capital and facilities, in this case airplanes, move to where there is the greatest usage, where there is the highest density. 
So we have made some arrangements, for instance, in telephones with universal service to ensure that despite the fact that the real advantages of competition go to where the heavy volume is, we do continue to provide service to rural areas. 
My State of Wyoming is struggling to maintain dependable, scheduled, available air service to airline hubs like Denver and Salt Lake City. We are in the process of seeking to strengthen our economy there, to recruit businesses to move to Wyoming. Travel and tourism is one of the three major economic activities in Wyoming, and so transportation is a vital component of our future. But we are having some problems. 
Last year, for example, Mesa Airlines, which operated as United Express, pulled service from five towns in Wyoming that they had been servicing in years past. I worked with Senator Enzi, my associate here, Congresswoman Cubin, the Governor, and others, and we finally were able to keep service to these towns. In fact, we had to go all the way to the chairman of the board of United Airlines to make this happen. Unfortunately, in most of these towns, we were only able to keep Essential Air Service (EAS). This provides just a bare minimum of service and I am glad we have it, but it does not provide the kind of service that is necessary if you are really going to have economic growth and development. In addition, in other Wyoming communities we continue to face cutbacks in the number of seats that are available every day as well as the loss of jet service to some of these towns. 
Those of you who are familiar with Jackson Hole, WY, know that it is a travel town. That is where a great number of people come and go. It is just devastating to the local economy when there are not enough seats to service demand. 
As I mentioned, Mr. President, I am in favor of deregulation. I think that makes for healthy competition. But I am concerned that sometimes we have to try another approach. As I mentioned, the investment in dollars nationally--and I understand it--go to where the yield is. They go to where the traffic is. That, I do think we have to understand. But we met with Delta Airlines which serves Salt Lake City and Jackson Hole, WY, and talked a little bit about the fact that there is a need for service, and frankly if we do not have service in some of these places I think you are going to see a continued interest in going back to some re-regulation in air service. I hope it doesn't come to that. 
Part of the problem, as I understand it, is the so-called code-share agreements between the big carriers and the commuters airlines. If you go to Denver from Casper, WY, a part of that fare subsidizes the cost of the trip that takes you from Denver to Washington. 
That does not seem right. That isn't the way it ought to be. 
These airlines are basically moving toward a monopolistic situation in the large `hub' airports, served almost entirely by one carrier, which makes serving rural America very difficult because then those airlines can dictate everything--fares, schedules, you name it. 
This is kind of unusual for me. I am a marketplace guy. I am one who wants competition. But I also firmly believe that when it comes to these vital services, there has to be a way to ensure that all of America will be served. 
I have been involved, because of my chairmanship of the Subcommittee on East Asia, in the rights to go overseas--`beyond rights.' I have to think, myself, why are we spending a lot of time and energy talking about expanding air service to somewhere in China when you can't go to Cody, WY? 
So that's the situation we find ourselves in today. I don't have all the answers. But I do know that we will continue to work at this issue in Congress. The Essential Air Service (EAS) program works well. But we need to do more. Dependable and safe air travel is an economic lifeline for our State, as it is whether you are in Boston or whether you are in San Francisco. We depend on tourism and small businesses to drive our economy in Wyoming. 
We need to come up with a long-term solution to this problem. Hopefully, it will be done in the marketplace so it will be something that is not forced upon the airlines. However, it is hard for me, as I said earlier, to get excited about working on `beyond rights,' when we can't get to our own towns. 
I am glad we are considering this bill. We need to get this done so our airports can be financed. I am very involved in what is going on with Wyoming's air service. I happen to be a private pilot and have flown quite often into these airports. I know how important it is for us to have that air service. 
I commend the Senators who have worked on this bill. I suggest we always need to keep in mind those rural areas to which we find it difficult to provide service. 
I yield the floor.

 Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend and colleague, Senator Enzi, to recognize the Proclamation of the Governor of Wyoming declaring September 18 as `POW/MIA Recognition Day' in Wyoming. 
I have come to this floor several times in my Senate career to extol the great sacrifices that our fighting men and women have made to protect this country and the ideals of freedom and democracy that we hold so dear. We owe these men and women a huge debt of gratitude. And I believe, Mr. President, that debt continues until we have brought home, or accounted for, all our missing service men.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to strongly support this legislation designed to protect contracts and leases of surface patent holders for coalbed methane. This legislation, which my colleague Senator Enzi and I are jointly introducing along with our House colleague Congresswoman Cubin, is vitally important to coalbed methane producers and lease holders in Wyoming and will address a problem which arose due to an appellate court decision rendered earlier this summer. 
On July 20, 1998, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals turned years of precedent and practice on its head by ruling that coalbed methane should be classified as a coal-by-product rather than a form of natural gas. That decision was completely contrary to past interpretation, and will severely impact coaled methane lease holders in Wyoming and throughout the nation. The ruling will also delay completion of leases and drilling, which will negatively impact our state's economy. 
The court's decision is particularly troubling for producers because the Office of the Solicitor at the Department of Interior had issued two earlier opinions regarding ownership of coalbed methane in federally-owned coal, which were directly opposite to the appellate court's ruling. Both in 1981 and in 1990, the Solicitor's office issued options which stated that coalbed methane was not part of the federally-reserved coal protected under the 1909 and 1910 Coal Lands Acts. Now, leaseholders and producers, who believed they were acting in good faith and compliance with federal law, are faced with the troubling possibility that their leases may be revoked. 
The legislation that we are introducing today is designed to remedy many of the problems caused by the appellate court's decision. This bill would protect current contracts and leases of surface patent holders for coalbed methane gas. The measure does not address future leases or contracts and only deals with folks who are already engaged in the production of coalbed methane gas or who have leased land for drilling and exploration. It is a fair and reasonable proposal and would simply protect people who acted in compliance with the law as it was interpreted by the Department of Interior. 
Mr. President, I hope the Senate will take quick action on this measure and approve it as quickly as possible. Coalbed methane production is a growing and vibrant part of Wyoming's economy and we need to take action to ensure that the lives of folks who rely on stable production of coalbed methane are not completely disrupted. Producers acted in good faith and in compliance with the law as they knew it. We should not punish them for actions beyond their control and should work to ensure that the blood and sweat which they invested into their businesses is not swept away by the actions of the court.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a project that is extremely important to the city of Casper and the State of Wyoming. The National Historic Trails Interpretive Center, located in Casper, is a unique project designed to showcase the importance of Wyoming as a center for a number of historic trails in the West. The site selected for the Center overlooks the place where the Oregon, California, Mormon and Pony Express Trails cross the North Platte River. In addition, the head of the Bridger Trail and a fork of the Bozeman Trail can be seen from the spot. 
The city of Casper and the State of Wyoming have been working very hard to build an interpretive center that will attract visitors from throughout the nation and provide them with a quality recreational and educational experience. The facility will showcase the important role historic trails played in the development of the West and the incredible hardships faced by settlers as they migrated to all of the western states. The project is strongly supported throughout Wyoming and would be funded through a unique `public/private' funding program using local, state and federal sources. 
Wyoming's congressional delegation has been working on obtaining federal funds for the Historic Trails Center for many years. Throughout my time in the Senate, as well as my years serving as Wyoming's only Congressman, I have worked hard to obtain planning and architectural money for the Center and requested assistance from the Appropriations Committee in obtaining the roughly $5 million in federal funds needed to complete the project. Unfortunately, construction funds have never been included in the appropriations bill. 
This year, the House of Representatives has included $2.6 million in the fiscal year 1999 Interior appropriations bill for completion of the National Historic Trails Center. Although this is only half of the money necessary to complete the project, I am extremely pleased the House took this action and recognized the importance of constructing this facility. Currently, the Senate version of the Interior appropriations bill does not include funds for the Trails Center. I understand the difficult funding choices faced by the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee as this bill was crafted, but I am extremely disappointed that the Senate version of this legislation did not provide funds for the Center. 
As the Senate completes its work on the Interior appropriations bill and this legislation moves to a conference with the House, I plan to do everything I can to ensure that funds for the Historic Trails Center are included in the final bill. Clearly, this project has merit and would be a valuable addition to our nation's cultural and historic landmarks. Over the coming days, I plan to work with Senators Gorton and Byrd to ensure that the House funding level is protected during the conference on this legislation. 
The National Historic Trails Interpretive Center is a worthy project. I urge the Senate to recede to the House language on this important measure and begin the process of completing this outstanding facility.

Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I rise in strong opposition to the Boxer amendment. Contrary to what we have heard over there about withdrawal and cheating and all these things, there are some real issues here, issues that many of us, particularly those of us who live in public land States, have been working on for a very long time. 
That is the question--how do you have regulations that extract one-eighth of the value of Federal oil into the Federal Treasury? Nobody objects to that. That is the law. Nobody argues with that. There are some real issues here. 
For instance, what is the value in Chugwater, WY, as compared to Oklahoma City? What is the value when you are close to a collection point as opposed to having to carry the oil for a very long time? Where do you apply the value? Do you have to pay for the transportation to where it is going in order to have one-eighth of it? There are some real issues here, and we have not been able to come together with the bureaucracy to have a satisfactory solution. And that is why this amendment is there--to have a moratorium on time so that this can, indeed, be resolved. 
I have been involved in some of these meetings here in which we have tried to find a solution. I, by the way, have not 
seen any of my friends from the other side of the aisle there participating in trying to find a solution. All they do is come up and complain. I am, frankly, a little offended at the idea that seems to be promoted that somehow if you are not for this it is because you may have gotten a contribution from an oil company. I am offended by that. 
People believe in what they are doing here. They believe it is important to their communities and to their States. They believe there ought to be jobs. They believe we ought to have a domestic oil industry. These are beliefs. I do not hear anyone saying they are where they are because the environmentalists are having TV ads to support their candidacy. I suppose you could say that. I do not think that is a great idea. 
What we have is some real confusion. Let me give you a little example. We had an independent who was brought back before the agency because they did what someone in the agency told them to do. They did what the employee told them to do. And the director of MMS says, `Well, you can't go by that because that might not be what the Assistant Secretary meant to happen.' Give me a break. You mean a citizen who goes to an employee of an agency cannot rely on the information they get there because it might not be consistent with what someone said who is Assistant Secretary? That is the kind of thing we are dealing with here and the kind of thing we need to get resolved. 
We have met with MMS on a number of occasions. I must tell you, I have been working with this since I was in the House 4 years ago, where I suggested, and would suggest again, that the States do the actual collection of the mineral royalty and share it with the Feds. We are duplicating it now. 
MMS is one of the most inefficient agencies we have in this Government in terms of their cost. It is not clear what it is that they are doing. It is clear that it is not a workable situation. When you take the NYMEX and apply it to a place in Oklahoma City, and out in Wyoming, that is not a workable way to determine what the market value is. We need to do something about that. 
Mr. President, I do not think we ought to be fooled by arguments of the proponents that they are not getting a fair share of the royalties. This amendment is not about reasonable valuation, collection. This amendment is not about schoolchildren. This amendment is quite simply one that wants to attack the oil industry by those who are critical of business, those who think that this is some kind of an environmental question. And it is not. 
It is important that the MMS rule be understood, that it does not only impact large petroleum producers. If that were the case, why would the independents be involved? Why would the independents be interested in bringing some kind of court action? It is because they are very much impacted. 
We have also heard over the last several days that the Governors are not for this. I just bring to the attention of my colleagues a letter by the Governor of Wyoming. 
. . . I strongly object to Senator Barbara Boxer's amendment to the Department of Interior's Appropriations Bill. . . . The amendment would allow the Department to implement new and untested federal royalty crude oil pricing regulations. 
And it goes on, in opposition to that. 
Minerals Management has proposed rules that are complicated, that are unworkable, that result in hardship to the producer, result in a loss of jobs, a loss to the economy of our State of Wyoming, and I think a security issue to this country when we have 55, nearly 60 percent of our oil imported. We have an opportunity here. 
Simply put, this valuation rule is a job killer. We ought not to go forward without having some time to make it work. 
I think the current language in the appropriations bill is fair and reasonable. Instead of taking reckless actions and getting up in broad generalities and talking about the evils of business, we ought to craft some rules that work. We can, in fact, do this. 
Again, I urge my friends in the Senate to vote against the Boxer amendment and continue to resolve the question in a way that is workable and a way that really deals with some regulations that will cause us to be able to collect these royalties, as we are all willing to do. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Thank you. Madam President, I am going to speak a few minutes on the amendment and, in particular, on the farmers' and ranchers' situation. 
Madam President, almost all of us have farmers and ranchers in our areas. Certainly in Wyoming, agriculture is one of the three economic interests that we have, most of us do, so all of us are concerned about agriculture. And we are in a time when agriculture needs, indeed, are our concern, and more than our concern, it needs some action. Many of us have been working for some time to find some areas in which agriculture can be strengthened, in which agriculture can be helped and assisted through a very hard time. 
I have listened this afternoon to several Senators representing their constituents and talking about agriculture. Each of them has represented a point of view, and that is basically to seek to return to the farm program time, and that is the issue here. I don't think there will be a soul in this place who doesn't want to assist agriculture. There won't be anyone in this Senate who doesn't think we ought to do something to strengthen this segment of our economy, but there is a division of view as to whether we seek to do some things to help make the transition from agriculture, as we have known it over the years--with acreage limitations, with farm subsidies and those kinds of things--to a market enterprise which we are now seeking to do. 
Our real challenge is to assist in continuing to move toward market agriculture which, at least in the State I represent, is the predominant view. People know that long-term agriculture will be stronger. Agriculture will be better. Our production will be more efficient in a market economy. What we are really talking about is how can we best do this, how can we best help agriculture, how can we best pull through this kind of a situation, and at the same time continue to help agriculture move to a market economy. 
Some have spoken about their contacts over the last week and, indeed, over the last month. I spent August in Wyoming talking with farmers and ranchers about it. Interestingly enough, we have three economic areas, basically, in my State: One is agriculture; one is mineral extraction; and one is visitation and tourism. Frankly, agriculture and minerals are both in tough shape. Oil, for example, is the cheapest it has been in history, I think. So we do have some concerns. 
Let me talk to you about some of the things that agricultural producers said to me in terms of long-term recommendations. 
One is consumer demand. For instance, in the beef industry, we need to strengthen consumer demand. Certainly what has happened in Asia has an impact on agriculture, particularly on exports. Some 40 percent of agricultural production goes 
into exports. 
Meat labeling, which we are moving toward doing--we need meat labeling so we know the origin of meat, whether it is imported, whether it is domestic, so buyers can make a choice. 
In my State, we have other kinds of things. Fifty percent of our State belongs to the Federal Government and is Federal lands. We have a good deal of problems with animal damage control, with predators and these kinds of things. These are also some of the issues. 
The idea that you simply try to go back to a controlled farming program is not a solution to all of agriculture. I understand the Senator from Iowa is concerned about the basic crops--wheat and corn and grains. That is a farm program kind of a thing. 
The agricultural problem is not confined only to those commodities. I am told, with the market, in rural areas, they are talking about fast track, for example, doing something about increasing markets in South America, doing something about increasing markets in Asia to strengthen access, increase consumer demand. These are the things that were told to me by agriculturists who want to do things that will be of long-term benefit. 
We need to talk about control programs for grasshoppers. We haven't done as well. We are not funding the Grasshopper Control Program as we did. Those are things having an impact on agriculture, not simply going back to a program that we had before to increase the loan rate. That is a remedy, but that is certainly not the only remedy and, indeed, probably not the best remedy. 
We need to be doing some things now and, indeed, we are. We need to continue to do that. The $5.5 billion in transition payments and accelerated payments that have been made to farm producers designed to help make the transition from a controlled Government farm program to a market program, that is what is expected; that is what is being done. We will do something, hopefully, about fast-track negotiations which are being held up, as you know. 
The Crop Insurance Program is one that needs to be changed. Crop insurance is based on last year's production, last year's crop. If you didn't have a crop last year because of the drought, or whatever, then your crop insurance is virtually of no value. 
We need to do something about tax legislation. We need capital gains relief in agriculture. Probably of any industry, the people who are in agriculture have more money invested in their facilities for the amount of cash flow of any industry. 
There are farm savings accounts and income averaging which we passed and need to make permanent. Agriculture is traditionally profitable one year, less profitable another year. There needs to be income averaging. 
They need 100 percent deductibility of self-employed health care, which is one of the things that farmers and ranchers need to put them on an even par with others. 
These are the kinds of things that we are, indeed, talking about doing and, indeed, must do in order to allow this transition to take place. 
There has been talk about a program for an increased conservation reserve, which would cost, I suppose, $2.5 billion to actually take some of the production out of production and put into a conservation area so that we can have impact on the prices. We can do this. 
These are the things that are underway now, as a matter of fact, and have been for some time. 
Some of them were passed before we left in August. And we should continue to do that. 
So I think everyone here takes seriously the difficulties that we are having in agriculture. Everyone here knows that we need to do some things to keep agriculturists in business, to help level out income over years when it is up and down--as it traditionally is--to do something about crop insurance so that when you are put up to the vagaries of weather and those kinds of things that there is some kind of an income support that you can depend on, but one that is part of the market, the market system. 
We surely need to go back to the beginning to open more foreign markets so we can do that. We have to do something about unilateral sanctions, which we already did at least partially. And you remember in Pakistan when they fired off the nuclear thing, immediately sanctions went on, the fact that we could not sell agricultural products there. That has been changed and, indeed, should be changed so we have that market available. 
So these are the kinds of things. I hope that we take a look at what really helps farmers and ranchers make a transition into the marketplace, in which I believe strongly. Frankly, the people in my State who I talk to believe also the best long-term direction for both agriculture and producers, and for consumers, is to have a market demand so that the production is, indeed, for the market, that production is not simply for some kind of a loan in which it goes into storage and becomes an obligation of the Federal Government. We have been through that. We have been through that program. 
I happen to have been in agriculture almost all my life. My first job when I got out of the Marine Corps was with the Farm Bureau. I worked with the Farm Bureau for a very long time at the local level, the American Farm Bureau. 
I just came back from my home college, the University of Wyoming, where we had Agriculture Appreciation Weekend this weekend. This is an area about which I feel very strongly. I hope that we make some moves before we leave, as the Senator from Iowa said. We should do that. 
We have begun. We started a number of things that need to be continued now. We need to do more short-term things that will have impact this year, but also the long-term kinds of changes that allow this transition to take place, that allow farmers to produce for the market, that allow consumers to have a choice as to what it is they buy, that farmers are not dependent upon the Federal Government paycheck but indeed produce the kinds of things in the market, that we can increase these markets. We have the most efficient agriculture in the world, and there is a great deal of market available there as the world changes. 
Let me say, again, that there is no question, I do not think among all of us, there needs to be something done. The real question is, What do we do? It is a philosophical question to a large extent, not whether you help but how in fact you do it, how in fact that help will impact over a period of time as we make the transition to a marketplace. 
Madam President, I hope that we continue to talk about this. And I am sure we will.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for the time, and particularly for the effort and information that he has participated in giving during this debate. 
I am interested in the fact that our fellow Senators talk about having a discussion. How long are we going to discuss this? It seems like we have been through this every year. We have been through it three times last year; we have been through it the second time this year. I can hardly imagine that anyone can make a case that we have not had a chance to talk about this issue. 
As a matter of fact, frankly, I just think we have a lot of things to do in the next 3 weeks. I hope we focus on doing those things and not continue to repeat and discuss the same things that we have done before. This subject had three failed cloture votes in 1997. This is the second cloture vote in 1998. We had the opportunity to talk about this, and under the system in the Senate which we all use, this issue has failed to be approved. Frankly, I think it will be one more time. I heard earlier that this is something that everybody in the country is clinging to and wanting to have resolved. I have not seen that. Where people are asked to list the things that are most important to them, where do you see this on the list? If at all, on the bottom. 
I think the fact is times have changed. The fact is we do spend more money, perhaps too much money, but we want people to vote. We believe they should be educated, and if you do that, you do that through the public media, which is expensive. So we are changing those things a great deal. 
What puzzles me a great deal--and I am not here to talk about the details; others are much more familiar with them than am I--but we find ourselves with the dilemma of having a campaign finance law in place now that we seem to be unable or unwilling to enforce, and in fact what do we want to do? We want to have more laws put on top of the ones that we are not willing to enforce now. That seems to be a real difficult thing for me to understand. 
I think it would be a mistake to pile more bureaucracy, more new laws on top of the ones that we have, and then say to ourselves, `Look at all the things that were illegally done in 1997 or 1996.' We haven't enforced the laws that we have. It is strange to me there is a pitch for making more laws until we do that. 
I will not take much time. I do think there ought to be some changes. I certainly support the idea of strengthening and enforcing disclosure. I think disclosure ought to be there prior to the election, and I am for that. I would even probably support the amount of soft money that can be contributed. But I am also quick to understand that there are lots of ways to do it, and laws simply do not have the effect that sometimes we think they should. 
So, I think most everything has been said here, but I did want to rise to say that the notion if you are not for this somehow you don't care about elections, somehow you don't care about voting, that is not true. That is not at all true. All of us want to have an open declaration of spending. We want to have disclosure. We also want to have people have the opportunity to participate as fully as they choose under the first amendment, and there are some restrictions in here. 
So, we will continue to talk about this, I presume. But McCain-Feingold is not the answer, in my opinion. That doesn't mean that I don't care about elections, because I do care about them, and so do all of us. That allegation is simply not true. 
Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for the time.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, it is an interesting time, of course, for us here. Entering into the last month of this Congress, we are faced, of course, with finishing the work that we have begun, and more particularly, in closing up the appropriations process so that the Government can continue to function with a real determination and, Mr. President, to assure that that happens and that we do not get into this business of accusing one another of closing down the Government because we do not agree on issues. I am very much persuaded we will have a continuing resolution so if we do have disagreements that cannot be resolved in this time that the Government will continue to go on. If it does not, it would be my opinion it would be up to the administration to have it shut down. 
As was the case with most of the Senators here, I recently spent a month in my home State of Wyoming, having an opportunity to visit with people about things that concern them, having an opportunity, perhaps more importantly than visiting, to listen to what people believe to be the role of the Federal Government, what the people believe to be the issues most compelling to them. Of course, everyone has them. 
In my State, where we have relatively little diversity in our economy, we have three basic economic areas: One is tourism, one is mineral extraction, and one is agriculture. Unfortunately, both agriculture and mineral extraction are not in good shape economically at the moment, and we are seeking to do something about that. 
So this time I think is useful time for us. People always say, `Hey, you're on vacation.' Well, it is not vacation. It is a very busy time. But it is a useful time and a chance to perhaps stand back a little and look at some of the broader problems. And that is so important, especially, I think, in this last month when we become so focused on every detail, every little appropriations process, where we tend sometimes to sort of get away from really the fundamental issues that we are here to represent. 
So my comments today will simply represent my point of view. I do not allege to speak for anyone else. But I happen to think that one of the things that is most important to us as we deal with all issues is to have some philosophical guidance, some basic belief that you measure all these details against. Failing in that, it seems to me, it is very difficult to make decisions that are consistent, to make decisions that finally 
end up doing what you really believe in and what your philosophy ought to be. 
One of the conclusions that I have reached, not only on my own certainly, but because of what I hear in Wyoming, people having heard it of course in the media, is that this administration is basically in limbo, that it will be for some time, that we have relatively little, if any, leadership coming from the administration. We need to recognize that and to move forward with the issues that confront us. We can do that. And we need to do that. 
Frankly, we have had relatively little leadership over the last several years. This administration, in my judgment, and the judgment of others, has been one without any real basic commitment to a point of view or to a philosophy or to a direction, but rather driven more by polls and what happens to be the political thing at the moment. I suppose this is perhaps not a brand new idea, but one that I think is very dangerous and one that really does not direct us in the way that we ought to be going; that, indeed, instead we have a time of spin, an administration that is basically sort of predicated on how you can make things seem, whether they are that way or not, or whether, indeed, they are predicated on Saturday morning radio talks in which there are issues brought forth, and subsequently no real commitment to doing something about it, like the State of the Union in which things like `Social Security first' are mentioned, but then nothing is done as a followup. 
That is a concern to me, that there is no real commitment and, frankly, relatively little real belief or commitment or, indeed, character in terms of where we are going. 
I think there are some major areas that need attention and that will be continuing to need attention. We need to look into them. One is foreign affairs, foreign policy--or a lack of foreign policy. Almost daily we see that some country--mostly the rogue countries--is challenging the rest of the world, challenging the United States. Why? Because they have begun to do this, and there is no real response, there is no reason why they shouldn't. Why shouldn't Iraq thumb their nose at us in terms of doing the weapons thing that they promised to do when obviously they are not going to be required to do that? We have not finished our job in Bosnia, Kosovo. Those things are still there. 
We have the Asian currency issue, a difficult issue that impacts us, one that, again, we need to make some decisions as to where we are and let people know exactly where we are. The idea from the administration that we are going to raise that question is not a good enough answer--the most current one, of course, being North Korea, and which we have dealt with for some time, particularly through the KEDO arrangement, trying to find a way to cause them to control what they are doing in nuclear arms development in return for a substantial contribution on the part of the United States and Japan and South Korea to build light-water reactors to replace that. And yet, they seem basically to say, `Well, we appreciate what you are doing, but we are going to go ahead and do what we want to do. We are going to go ahead and fire missiles. We are going to go ahead and have underground development of nuclear weapons, nuclear materials.' 
We cannot do that, in my judgment. And I feel very strongly about it. I happen to be chairman of that subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific Rim. We are going to have another hearing this week. 
We had one just a month ago before we left and talked about the adherence to the KEDO agreement. There was certainly a notion that at that time things were being done that were not consistent with the plan. 
I think we need to give some real consideration to our military preparedness. This is not a peaceful world. One of the best ways to ensure as much as we can that it is peaceful is to continue to have a strong defense force, a strong military, to be the world's strongest military. And we are. However, there is increasing evidence that we are not putting enough emphasis into it in terms of support for it, in terms of the distribution of our troops all over the world. It is very costly. It is very difficult, then, to meet the mission that we have given ourselves, and that is to be able to work in two theaters, if necessary, at one time. Some doubt that we can do that now. So we, I think, have to deal with those kinds of very difficult issues. 
The matter of taxes is one, as you can imagine, we hear a great deal about when we go home--taxes in terms of the amount of taxation that citizens pay, the unfairness of taxes in terms of things like marriage penalty, the behavior of the IRS, which, of course, we addressed in our last session and hopefully will be useful. Perhaps even more important is the whole notion of Tax Code reform. You can deal with the IRS, you can deal with the management and the administration, certainly, of tax collection, but the real bottom line is the Tax Code. If the Tax Code is going to be so convoluted and so difficult and so detailed, it becomes increasingly difficult to do that. 
Here again, the administration has come forth with no real idea as to how to simplify the Tax Code. There is not unanimity among any of us as to what it ought to be--whether it ought to be a flat tax, a sales tax, or a consumption tax, or simply a simplification of what we have now. But we need some leadership to do that and we need something from the administration to do that. We need some ideas to do that instead of simply getting up and saying Social Security first, and then turning off the radio. 
I have a number of other items I would like to share, Mr. President, but I want to recognize my friend, the Senator from Kansas, who has come to the floor. I yield as much time as he desires for his observations.

Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Senator from Kansas very much for his comments. 
Mr. President, I guess the real issue and the thing that he and I are both talking about is the basic, fundamental functions of the Federal Government and what priority they should have. Certainly, the defense of this country has to be among the--if not the--top priorities. No one else can do that. I appreciate very much the comments the Senator has made. 
This whole idea of priority setting, this whole idea of the concept of the basic belief of what you think the better role of the Government, is of course a difficult issue but it is the basis of why we are here; it is the basis of elections to decide. People say, `What is your position with respect to the Federal Government?' There are legitimate differences of view. You can see them on this floor. There are those who believe sincerely that the Federal Government ought to be the predominant activity in government in the whole country. There are those who, frankly, have very little confidence in local governments and in State governments, and they think the Federal Government ought to do all of those things. Obviously, there are roles for the Federal Government. In my view, there are quite certainly roles that are better done at the local and State level. That is the constant issue with which we deal. 
I was talking about some of the things people talked about while I was in Wyoming. I mentioned Social Security. I would like to go back to that for just a little bit. There has been a great deal of talk about the condition of Social Security to the extent that people, many older people, are worried about, of course. But maybe even more importantly, younger people who are now just entering the workforce are saying, `I am going to be paying into this thing forever, but by the time I am ready to retire, there will be nothing there.' I think it is clear that Social Security is strong for 20 years or 25 years, and all those who will become eligible for benefits during that time will see them. But young people, like these folks sitting here, are the ones who will be paying the tab. Unless we do something, we will unlikely have a solvent Social Security program. 
We need to move forward. I am pleased that there is a considerable amount of talk about it. I hope we do something rather soon. It seems to me that if we can do it, the sooner you do it, the less severe the changes need to be. If you make rather simple changes, rather incremental changes 20 years out, it makes a great deal of difference. 
What are we talking about? Of course, one of them that is already underway is to raise the retirement age. Times have changed. People are living longer. People are working longer. That is legitimate. There will be debate about how far that goes, of course. But, more importantly, the notion that seems to be catching on is that some percentage of the payments that are made, some of the percentages of 12-percent payments that are made into Social Security, should be set aside into an individual account which is invested in equities, invested in something that will earn more interest than the current investment which is in Government securities; that that account will grow more quickly; that there will be more benefits from the same investment. And that is very possible, of course; further, that that account would be your account and my account. 
If for some reason or other you happen to pass on before you use all of that, that it, indeed, be part of your estate. There would be a substantial difference. I don't think many are talking about a full privatization of Social Security. That is something that would be a pretty big step. But to take 30 percent, for example, 3 or 4 percent out of the 12 percent, I believe that is happening. I certainly hope so. 
I already mentioned tax reform. Certainly, we will have some debate soon about what seems certain to be a budget surplus--a budget surplus on which we will have some decisions to make; choices about doing something about reducing the debt, a debt on which we pay $280 billion a year in interest; do something about reducing tax rates so that the people who own the money will be able to keep more of it. I suppose one of the considerations will be to spend more. I hope that is not a successful consideration. Others are suggesting some of it be put in for this Social Security reform and that it be used that way. 
There is nothing wrong with philosophical differences. We just need to stand for what we are for. We are for less 
government, if we are having people keep more of their own money. It is pretty clear where you stand on that issue. 
I hope the marriage penalty is considered. I saw some numbers the other day where two single persons were making roughly $35,000 a year, and they pay individually. If they are married, this is about a $1,300 penalty to the same people earning the same amount of money simply because they are married. That needs, of course, to be changed. 
Another one that I heard a lot about and I also feel strongly about is the Executive orders that have been issued. There are a good many Executive orders, some of which simply are done apparently to replace what the Congress should be doing. One on federalism created a great deal of concern. 
Basically, the President issued an Executive order that broadened the scope of the Federal Government in terms of working with States and working with counties, and instead of the good old 10th amendment where it says that those things which are specifically laid out in the Constitution will be done by the Federal Government, other things will be done by the States and by the people--this changed that. There was such a reaction to it that I understand it has been withdrawn. But the use of Executive orders is something that sort of moves away from the leadership of causing the Congress to do things, and working with the Congress. The idea of an Executive order on health care, for example, which is exactly the thing that the Republican bill has on the floor, it seems to me, is inappropriate. 
Energy--I guess I have a rather strong feeling about energy in that it is one of the things that is important to my State, but, more importantly, it is one of the things that is important to this country. We now have ourselves in the position where 57 percent, I believe, of the fossil fuel we use is imported. That puts us at sort of a security risk, it seems to me, in addition to not having the kind of domestic industry that is very important. Do we have a policy at the Department of Energy for that? No, we really do not. We really do not. 
We have a real problem with what we do with nuclear waste that is the result of nuclear power plants. Do we have a plan to do that? The administration is opposed to it. We have a responsibility to do something about nuclear waste storage. Does the Department of Energy have a plan? No. We are not moving forward. 
Those are the kinds of things that need to be resolved. One of the energy issues that is fairly knew this year and will continue next year is the deregulation of electric energy. It has a great impact on this country. 
The use of the huge monopolies--most of us would like to see us change monopolies and make them come a little more into the marketplace. Does the Department of Energy have a strong position on that? No. 
Finally, the chairman of the committee urged them to come up with a bill. But we need to do something with that. Here again, we get into the question of whether you do the same thing for every State. I can tell you that Wyoming's interest in electric deregulation is different than New York's. You have to have a system to do that. Leadership is what we need. 
The Senator from Kansas who just spoke is one of the experts in agriculture. He was, indeed, the chairman of the Agriculture Committee in the House. Agriculture is having a tough time. Agriculture is having a tough time because of the Asian situation, because of the crop failures, and because of the weather and many things. 
We are trying to do something with it and, indeed, have, but we need again some kind of impetus and leadership from this administration that has not been there. 
Previous to now, we have had accelerated payments that are the changed payments from where we had the acreage and payment program into a market system. We have had averaging, income averaging, just extended--that is good for farmers--and an IRA for farmers and ranchers. Of course, if you don't have any money, it does not help a lot. And that is going to have to be done. We did something about unilateral sanctions in countries so that we can have more markets overseas. 
These are some things, but there need to be more. We need to do something with crop insurance to make that work. We need to open more foreign markets because almost 40 percent of our agricultural product goes into foreign trade. We need to do something about agricultural credit to help make this transition from managed agriculture to market agriculture. 
So we need to work together, and we need some leadership in doing that. 
Mr. President, probably again the thing that seems always to strike me, because I guess I believe it also, is that the real issue in many of the things we do is in terms of federalism--what is the role of the Federal Government? Where can we be most efficient? Where can we get the job done more easily? At the Federal level? At the State level? Should we send block grants, for example, in some instances to the States? I think so. And the delivery system is so different. 
We held a couple of meetings on rural health care while I was in Wyoming. We have about 475,000 people in 100,000 square miles. Many people live in very small towns. We only have two towns that are over the 50-60,000 category. So you have to have a little different system for the delivery of health care than you do in Pennsylvania or than you do in New England, and that is an important kind of thing. Telemedicine, for example, is going to be very important to us. 
So all this comes into this equation of how do you best serve the people of this country. I happen to believe, as you can imagine from what I have said already, less Federal Government is better than more. I am one who thinks that the most efficient delivery system comes when it is done at the local level. I am one who thinks that the Government closest to the people is the one that provides the kind of services that people really want. 
So we need to focus, I think, on fundamentals. We need to focus on the idea that, for example, those things that are done by the Federal Government that are commercial in nature ought to be put out for bid, if that is possible, so we can do it in the private sector. It is done more efficiently that way, and it also creates more jobs in the private sector. And that is one of the fundamental things we ought to continue to focus on. 
We don't have much time remaining in this session--I think something around 20 days of activity. We have lots of things to do. I am hopeful that our friends on the other side of the aisle will address these issues that need to be resolved. I think it is clear that there are two or three issues they are going to try to insist on bringing up daily, not with the intention of completing them and finding a resolution but simply to bring them up so that they are the kinds of issues that will be involved in the campaigns that are coming up in November--patients' rights, for example. Both sides of the aisle have bills on patients' rights. Most of the elements of those bills are very similar and there is a consensus that some of those things need to be done. The leadership has offered to deal with it with a limited number of amendments so that we can get it done. 
That is not acceptable to the other side of the aisle because they want to keep this issue alive as a political issue. That is too bad. I am sorry for that. 
The minimum wage. We just have raised the minimum wage two times. It is a political issue that has to keep coming back. Campaign reform. Most of us want to make some changes in campaign reform. We have talked about it extensively in this session of Congress. It is kept alive as a political issue. We need to address ourselves to things that have to be resolved, those things that are important to the people in the conduct of the business of this country. 
So I am just really hopeful that our leadership in the Senate and the leadership in the House and this administration will address ourselves to some of these issues and that we will, in fact, during this next month be able to resolve them, conclude them, and do them in the fashion that is most acceptable and most useful to the American people. That, after all, is our job. I think it is based largely on making some decisions as to what the Federal Government does best, how it does it, how it can be done most efficiently, how we can involve the States, how we can involve local governments. Invariably, when you go home, you see things done voluntarily, you see things done on a local level, and it reminds you, fortunately, the strength of this country lies not in its Federal Government, the strength of this country lies in the communities and the people who live there, people who give leadership to issues that affect them, people who volunteer, people who address the issues and resolve them, and that is, indeed, the strength of this country. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to address briefly the McCain amendment on S. 2334. I will talk a little bit about the situation in North Korea and the bill relating to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, KEDO. I have been chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asia for almost 4 years, and we have held five hearings on North Korea during that time--more than any other single country, with the exception of China. In all of that time, I have continued to be amazed at and concerned by the dangerous, unpredictable and unbalanced nature of the regime in North Korea. Despite widespread starvation and disease, the Government continues to adhere to the very economic policies which have led to famine in the first place. Despite the worldwide reputation of communism, the Government continues to revolve around sort of a Stalinist cult of personality slavishly devoted to Kim Jong Il. 
Despite international norms and conventions, the North Koreans continue to sell nuclear and conventional missile technology to such rogue states as Iraq and Libya in violation of the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty. Despite the terms of the Agreed Nuclear Framework with the United States, North Korea continues to develop its program aimed at producing nuclear missiles. 
Mr. President, I have been sort of a begrudging supporter of the Agreed Framework since its inception. Although the agreement is far from perfect, I supported it because I believed that, in the end, it was in our best interest and in the best interest of the East Asia region to do so. I supported it through its fits and starts. I supported it when the North diverted oil deliveries to military use and when the North showed signs of restarting their nuclear program. I supported it because, on the whole, North Korean movement forward in the Four-Party Talks and cooperation in the nuclear area outweighed the North's traditional tendency to always push the envelope with us. 
Mr. President, when North Korea fired off a missile last week over Japanese air space, it was kind of the straw that broke the camel's back. This is what I consider to be a clearly belligerent act and should drive home the fact to this body that 
the Agreed Framework has been gutted by North Korea. At present, it seems no better than the paper on which it was written. Time after time, the DPRK has broken its commitment under the agreement. While the North took our oil and dragged its heels, it has constructed underground facilities to test both propulsion and warhead systems with only one purpose: the development of long- and short-range nuclear weapon capabilities. 
Frankly, I have a sinking feeling that they have used us, played us for a fool, and have played it very well. Mr. President, I intend to meet with the Defense Intelligence Agency this week, and to hold a hearing next week in our subcommittee to examine the present situation and to ask the State Department and Defense Department some tough questions. 
If these questions can't be answered to our satisfaction, and if we can't be convinced that adherence to the Agreed Framework under the circumstances are in our best interests, then our support, I am sure, will evaporate very quickly. 
I am pleased that we are considering it here. I am supportive of the McCain amendment. I look forward to having a chance to vote on it. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, if I may, I wish to make another comment or so on this amendment. 
I understand the notion that you want to make this thing work, and we have tried for quite a long time. It just seems to me that around the world right now in a number of places we are having these kinds of countries with the dictators sort of testing the United States, saying, `You have told us certain things, we have made certain agreements, but we are not going to keep them, and what are you going to do about it?' 
I feel as if that is an increasing tendency around the world, and this is one of them, as well as Iraq and some other places. So I think we want to continue to work, we would like to have the KEDO agreement, we would like to go ahead with the light-water reactor to avoid the nuclear development in North Korea, but that is the deal. And if that isn't being adhered to, then I think you have to do something. I think we have to take a tougher position than we have in the past. 
I just do not see that it is good for the United States in the future to be making agreements with these sorts of rogue countries, trying to make things better, going ahead and doing our part, and them not doing theirs. I think that is what this amendment is about. And what we are challenged with, frankly, is to say, `We have things that need to be done, we are willing to work with you, but you have to keep up your part of the bargain.' I think that is what this is all about. 
I yield the floor. 
By the way, if I may take that back, I was also listening to Senator Dodd's proposal that has to do with things in Central America that have been kept secret, and I am very much interested in part of that myself, the Sister Ortiz thing that really needs to be declassified, in my judgment. So I just wanted to comment that I speak in support of the Dodd amendment. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, all of us have been various places during the recess. I have been back in Wyoming listening to people and to a number of things that people are concerned about. We are back now, basically, to spend this month, I suppose, almost totally immersed in the appropriations process, which we must do. I have been interested for some time in making some changes in that process. It seems to me now to be appropriate, perhaps, while we are into it, to talk about the possibility of changing a bit. 
What are some of the things we are going to have confronting us now? First of all, we have talked about appropriations, in most years, for about 40 percent of the time. About 40 percent of the time the Senate and House spends in session is spent on appropriations. During this last period of time, we will be confronted with trying to move quickly to complete that work, which has to be completed, of course, for the Government to go on. And that is OK. But as part of that, we will see a great deal of nongermane amendments being put onto appropriations bills, which really have nothing to do with appropriations. They are put on there partly because the year is nearly over, and if they are going to happen, they have to happen now. 
Often it is easier to move an appropriations bill with an amendment than it is a freestanding bill. We will be confronted again, I suspect, by the administration threatening, where they don't agree with the Congress on the payments in certain areas and appropriations for certain areas, that they will close down the Government and blame the Congress. We have to guard against that. It is not the intention of the Congress to close down the Government--nor was it several years ago. But that is the pressure that is used. So what could we do to change that? 
It seems to me that we ought to consider going into a biennial budget process--a process in which every 2 years we would spend our time on the budget. We would budget for a biennial time and have the remainder of the time to do the other business of the Congress. I am persuaded that the Congress spends too much time on budget issues. 
One of the really important things, after the budget is completed, is for the Congress to ensure that those programs that have been funded and the money that has been spent is spent as efficiently as possible, spent in the way in which the appropriation was designed and for the purpose for which it was designed. That doesn't always happen. So oversight, it seems to me, is certainly one of the more important things Congress has to do. We have relatively little time to do that. 
We don't always complete our work. Since 1997, we have had 60 continuing resolutions. That means that we didn't complete the appropriations and that we simply continued what had been done in the past. As I mentioned before, we have devoted roughly 40 percent of our time to budget resolutions, reconciliation and appropriations. We have too many repetitive votes on the same issues. There are lots of things for the Congress to do and lots of things that the Congress has a responsibility to do. Many of them, I think, are neglected because we spend too much time each year on appropriations. 
There is not enough time for vigorous oversight. We continue to let inefficient and inappropriate programs continue. One of the other things that brings it to mind--and I am sure the Presiding Officer had the same experience at home--is when you hear about all these programs being operated in quite a different fashion than was the concept of the legislation, and that is part of our responsibility in Congress. 
In the last Congress, I introduced a bill that creates a 2-year authorization for appropriations and budget resolutions--partly, I suppose, because of my experience in the Wyoming legislature in which we operated with biennial sessions. Most States operate with biennial appropriations, as a matter of fact. One of the arguments against it, however, is that some of the States are going to annual appropriations. I will tell you why. They are going to annual appropriations to be consistent with the Federal Government, and there is so much Federal funding, it is difficult. If the Federal Government would do it, I think you would find these States going back to it, and it would eliminate some of the redundancy in budgeting and help to reduce the size of Government, 
and I think it would help put a bridle on unchecked Government spending. It would encourage agencies and executive branch agencies to plan for longer in the future. And I think it is difficult for an agency to have to plan one year at a time when they are doing longer term projects. They can be useful for them as well. They could help Government do it with Federal grantees to do it. 
The author of the bill, Senator Domenici, has introduced bipartisan legislation with the bipartisan support of 35 of our colleagues. It passed the Budget Committee and the Governmental Affairs Committee, and is pending on the Senate calendar. 
Bipartisan support has been expressed by Senator Lott, Senator Daschle, leaders of both sides of the Senate, and Vice President Gore and the OMB Director have all expressed support for biannual budgets. A limited time has elapsed. I suspect it is unlikely that it will pass, which is part of what I am talking about. Now we are jammed in here for 4 weeks. The leader spoke this morning about how difficult it will be to do all of the things that have to be done. As I recall, the budget is supposed to have been pretty well done by now. It is supposed to move along on a schedule. We, of course, seldom, if ever, live by that schedule. So we are in our annual sprint to avoid a Government shutdown. 
I urge my colleagues to consider some reform of legislation that would change what we do. I think there is great merit in doing it. It is not a new idea. Certainly it is not a cure-all of all Federal Government ills. But it is a process that perhaps would be helpful. 
Processes are hard to change in this institution. And I respect that. There should be a reason to change things. I am a little discouraged when you talk about making things work a little better when the response often is, `Well, we have always done it that way.' That is not a very good response. 
I think we could save time. I think we could save money. I think we could manage better. I think we could allow ourselves to do the things that we need to do. 
I suspect, frankly, that one of the reasons there is opposition is that those people and the appropriators have a little more power to exert each year rather than every other year by being on this committee and helping to decide where money is spent. That is one of the realisms of it. On the other hand, there are a lot more people who are not on the appropriations committee than there are on the committee. So that should not keep us from doing it. 
This, as I said, would not be a panacea but certainly would be a step in the right direction of what we seem to constantly talk about, and I hope constantly seek; that is, a more efficient operation, a more effective operation by spending less taxpayers' money. It seems to me that this is one of the ways to do that. 
I hope we consider it. If we don't get it done this time, we ought to bring it up early in the next session. We ought to bring it before both the House and the Senate and streamline the way we appropriate the funds for the programs in Congress. 
Mr. President, I thank you. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to follow the leadership of the floor leader and the bill leader here on this one. No. 1, it doesn't belong in this area. We are taking away all these amendments. I think that is the right thing to do. 
The second point is those of us who have been working in this area for a very long time feel as if there is a process that is going on to make things better with China, to make our relations better. 
No one disagrees with doing something about religious freedom. No one disagrees with any of these issues. The question is, How do you best do it? And the best way to do it is not to refuse to provide visas to the Chinese. 
I urge we table this amendment.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, I will lay out the plan for today. 
This morning, the Senate will be in a period for morning business until 9:30 a.m. Following morning business, under a previous order, the Senate will begin consideration of the Department of Defense appropriations bill. All Members are encouraged to come to the floor early during today's session to offer and debate any amendments to the defense bill. The first votes of today's session will occur in a stacked series beginning at approximately 2 p.m. These votes will include any remaining amendments to the Treasury appropriations bill and possibly several amendments to the defense bill. Members should expect votes late into the evening during today's session, as the Senate attempts to complete action on the defense bill. 
I thank my colleagues for their attention. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise for just a moment to thank the Senator from Nebraska and the Senator from Iowa for their leadership on this agricultural issue that we have before us. I join as an original cosponsor to the effort. 
It seems to me that clearly there are two areas that have to be pursued. The Senator from Nebraska talked about one, and that is seeking to reopen and to strengthen these foreign markets that are there that are critical to agricultural production. 
One of the areas, of course, in this matter is unilateral sanctions, of which some action has already been taken in the case of Pakistan and India. We need to do more of that. The other, of course, is to do something domestically. I agree entirely that we should not try to return to the managed agriculture that we had before, but to continue to move towards market agriculture in which our production is based on demand. But it is a difficult transition. And that, coupled with the Asian crisis, coupled with the fact that, particularly in the northern tier and in the south, we have had drought, we have had floods, we have had freezes--we have had a series of difficult things that lend to the difficulty of agriculture. 
So I am pleased that the Congress has taken some steps. I think this idea of moving forward with the transition payments is a good idea. 
Certainly we can do that for farmers. Then if we can provide a farmer savings account which will allow them to have these payments, in advance, without being taxed until they are used, is a good one. 
Certainly, as the Senator from Nebraska has indicated, I, too, favor the idea of reducing and, indeed, eventually eliminating the capital gains taxes. I just want to say I support this very much. 
There perhaps are other activities that we can undertake that will be helpful, but we do need to get started. I think this is a good beginning. I want to say again that I appreciate the leadership of the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Nebraska. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, there are a number of things that many of us feel to be very important in terms of principles. One of them is federalism, of course--making the appropriate division between those things that are done in State government and those things that are done in local government, and the role of Federal Government. Another, it seems to me, is to do those things that can be done in the private sector, and that has, indeed, been the policy of this Government for a very long time. 
I rise today to express my deep appreciation for the members of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee and staff for their time and effort in developing a consensus on my legislation to codify this 40-year-old Federal principle that has been in place. 
In the beginning of this Congress, I introduced S. 314, the Freedom from Government Competition Act. This legislation is an attempt to put in statute a workable process by which the Federal Government utilizes the private sector to do those things that are commercial in nature. This, indeed, has been the policy of the Government for a very long time. In fact, as early as 1932, Congress first became aware of the fact that the Federal Government was starting to carry out activities of a commercial nature and said that is not necessary and we should not do that. 
In 1954, a bill to address the issue passed the House and was reported by the Committee on Governmental Affairs. At that time, the Eisenhower administration said that we would take care of it administratively. Therefore, Bureau of the Budget Bulletin 55-4 was issued, and there was no further action taken. 
To make a relatively long story short, all the administrations since that time in one way or another have endorsed the idea of taking those things that could at least as well be done in the private sector as in the Government, allowing for some competition. 
There is a circular now called A-76 which has been endorsed since 1955. Unfortunately, it hasn't been enforced. Unfortunately, when it is only a bulletin or Executive order, there is no real appeal process. What we are seeking to do is to put that concept into statute--it has now been approved by the committee in the Senate; it has been approved by the committee in the House--that would simply say to agencies, we want you to take an annual inventory of those kinds of things that you do, those that are commercial in nature. There ought to be a fair opportunity for the private sector to seek to compete in those areas. 
Mr. President, we hope that that will come before the Senate and the House before this session is over; that it would, indeed, be put in statute, that concept that has been there for a very long time, the notion simply being that the taxpayers benefit from the cost, and whoever can do this the most efficiently, whether it be mapping, whether it be laboratory work, whether it be all kinds of things that are often and always done in the private sector, that can be done better and more efficiently there, will, indeed, be done there. 
To reiterate, that policy is now found in OMB Circular A-76 and has been endorsed by every administration, of both parties, since 1955. However, the degree of enthusiasm for implementation of the circular has varied from one administration to another. In fact, the issue of government competition has become so pervasive that all three sessions of the White House Conference on Small Business, held in 1980, 1986 and 1995, ranked this as one of the top problems facing America's small businesses. According to testimony we received, it is estimated that more than half a million Federal employees are engaged in activities that are commercial in nature. 
However, the purpose of my legislation is not to bash Federal employees. I believe most are motivated by public service and are dedicated individuals. However, from a policy standpoint, I believe we have gone too far in defining the role of government and the private sector in our economy. Because A-76 is nonbinding and discretionary on the part of agencies, too many commercial activities have been started and carried out in Federal agencies. Because A-76 is not statutory, Congress has failed to exercise its oversight responsibilities. Further, by leaving `make or buy' decisions to agency managers, there has been no means to assure that agencies `govern' or restrict themselves to inherently governmental activities, rather than produce goods and services that can otherwise be performed in and obtained from the private sector. 
Among the problems we have seen with Circular A-76 is (1) agencies do not develop accurate inventories of activities (2) they do not conduct the reviews outlined in the Circular, (3) when reviews are conducted they drag out over extended periods of time and (4) the criteria for the reviews are not fair and equitable. These are complaints we heard from the private sector, government employees, and in some cases from both. 
In the 1980's our former colleague Senator Warren Rudman first introduced the `Freedom from Government Competition Act' in the Senate. Later, Representative John J. Duncan, Jr. (R-TN) introduced similar legislation in the House. I was a cosponsor of that bill when I served in the other body. Upon my election to the Senate in the 104th Congress, I introduced the companion to Representative Duncan's bill in the Senate. 
On Wednesday, July 15, 1998 the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee unanimously reported a version of S. 314 that is a result of many months of discussions among both the majority and minority on the committee, OMB, Federal employee unions and private sector organizations. The amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by Chairman Fred Thompson and approved by the committee is a consensus and a compromise. 
It is important to point out that the bill that I introduced in the 104th Congress was an attempt to codify the original 1955 policy that the government should rely on the private sector. After a hearing on that bill was convened by Senator Stevens, during his tenure as chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs, it became clear to me that it was necessary to add to the bill the concept of competition to determine whether government performance or private sector performance resulted in the best value to the American taxpayer. While S. 314 as introduced, and H.R. 716 introduced in the House, was still entitled the `Freedom from Government Competition Act,' it in fact not only did not prevent government competition, but it mandated it. This was not a change that private sector organizations came to comfortably support. However, inasmuch as OMB Circular A-76 changed through the years from its original 1955 philosophical statement to its more recent iterations that required public-private competition, I revised my bill when introducing it last year to include such competitions, provided they in fact are conducted and that when conducted, they are fair and equitable comparisons carried out on a level playing field. 
I would also hasten to add that the measure reported by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, which I hope will be promptly approved by the full Senate, is significantly different than S. 314 as introduced. While S. 314 as introduced was opposed by the administration and by the Federal employee unions, the compromise measure reported from the committee is not opposed by these groups. 
Mr. President, this is important legislation that I believe will truly result in a government that works better and costs less. Certainly government agency officials should have the ability to contract with the private sector for goods and services needed for the conduct of government 
activities. This bill will not inhibit ability. However, it should not be the practice of the government to carry on commercial activities for months, years, even decades without reviewing whether such activities can be carried out in a more cost effective or efficient manner by the private sector. I believe that the drive to reduce the size and scope of the Federal Government will be successful only when we force the government to do less and allow the private sector to do more. 
During the course of our hearings, it became abundantly clear that there are certain activities that the Federal Government has performed in-house which can and should be converted to the private sector. Areas such as architecture, engineering, surveying and mapping, laboratory testing, information technology, and laundry services have no place in government. These activities should be promptly transitioned to the private sector. 
There are other activities in which a public-private competition should be conducted to determine which provider can deliver the best value to the taxpayer. This includes base and facility operation, campgrounds, and auctioning. 
There are several key provisions in the bill upon which I would like to comment. In particular, section 2(d) requires the head of an agency to review the activities on his or her list of commercial activities `within a reasonable time'. OMB strongly opposed a legislative timetable for conducting these reviews. As a result of the compromise language on this matter, it will be incumbent on OMB to make certain these reviews are indeed conducted in a reasonable time frame. These reviews should be scheduled and completed within months, not years. I will personally monitor progress on this matter, as will the Governmental Affairs Committee. I urge OMB to exercise strong oversight to assure timely implementation of this requirement by the agencies. 
This provision also requires that agencies use a `competitive process' to select the source of goods or services. In my view, this term has the same meaning as `competitive procedure' as defined in Federal law (10 U.S.C. 2302(2) and 41 U.S.C. 259(b)). To the extent that a government agency competes for work under this section of the bill, the government agency will be treated as any other contractor or offeror in order to assure that the competition is conducted on a level playing field. 
Another issue that I have been concerned about is the proliferation of Interservice Support Agreement's (ISSA's). Under the `FAIR' Act, consistent with the Economy Act (31 U.S.C. 1535), items on the commercial inventory that have not been reviewed may not be performed for another federal agency. In addition, any item on the inventory cannot be provided to state or local governments unless there is a certification, pursuant to the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31 U.S.C. 6505(a)). 
Enactment of the `FAIR' Act is a major achievement because it codifies a process to assure government reliance on the private sector to the maximum extent feasible. Further, it will put some teeth into Executive Order 12615 issued by President Reagan, which is still on the books today. 
Again, I thank the members of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee and the committee's staff, for all of the hard work necessary to forge this compromise. I look forward to working with them on thorough congressional oversight on the implementation of this bill. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep appreciation to the members of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, and the Committee's staff, for the time and effort they have dedicated to developing a consensus on my legislation to codify the 40+ year Federal policy on reliance on the private sector. 
At the beginning of this Congress, I introduced S. 314, the `Freedom from Government Competition Act.' This legislation was an attempt to establish in statute a workable process by which Federal agencies utilize the private sector for commercially available products and services. As we have learned from our research and from House and Senate hearings, as early as 1932 Congress first became aware of the fact that the Federal government was starting and carrying out activities that are commercial in nature, and that government performance of these activities resulted in unfair competition with the private sector. In 1954, a bill to address this issue passed the House and was reported by the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate. At that time, the Eisenhower Administration indicated that it could resolve the issue administratively. Bureau of the Budget Bulletin 55-4 was issued and the Senate suspended action on the legislation. The budget document established a federal policy of reliance on the private sector. It noted that the free enterprise system was the strength of our economy and that the government should not compete with private business. Rather, the Bulletin said, the government should rely on the private sector for those good and services that could be obtained through ordinary business channels. 
That policy is now found in OMB Circular A-76 and has been endorsed by every Administration, of both parties, since 1955. However, the degree of enthusiasm for implementation of the Circular has varied from one Administration to another. In fact, the issue of government competition has become so pervasive that all three sessions of the White House Conference on Small Business, held in 1980, 1986, and 1995, ranked this as one of the top problems facing America's small businesses.

I wanted to talk about credit union legislation because it is one of the most important things we will be doing, certainly, this year. I have spent many hours meeting with Wyoming citizens on both sides of the credit union legislation. In fact, in the last year and a half, I have had 32 meetings relative to this bill. So there is a great deal of interest in it. It is the kind of involvement that we ought to have in public issues. It is democracy, certainly, at work. 
I also have some kind of perspective to it, in that I helped organize a credit union, back when I was with the Wyoming Farm Bureau a number of years ago, a very small one designed to work with the employees there at the Farm Bureau. 
I think, having worked with not only the Farm Bureau but the Rural Electric Association, I am aware of the value of cooperatives, the value of people being able to come together and do some things for themselves, the ability to tailor the services that are needed in a particular place to that particular need. Certainly, Wyoming is one of the smallest--indeed, it is the smallest State in the Union with regard to population. We do have different needs than occur in New York or occur in Pennsylvania. So as we talk about services and distribution of services, it makes a good deal of difference. 
I also think credit unions have fitted themselves to these needs, as have community banks. They have fitted themselves, too. I believe there is an increasingly clear definition between some of the international banks and some of the community banks. It used to be everything was a bank was a bank was a bank. Now I think that has changed, and properly so. We need both kinds of banks. 
Wyoming has 39 credit unions and about 145,000 members in Wyoming. That represents about a quarter of our State population. So it is a unique and needed service. The median asset level in Wyoming credit unions is only $6.9 million. The smallest credit union has assets of about a half million dollars; the largest, $86 million. So we do have a unique situation. Things happen on a smaller scale there, and we need to continue to have that opportunity to serve. The things that are debated here, in credit unions, the changes that have taken place, the reason for the lawsuit, has very little to do with the kinds of operations we have in our State. 
I support the final passage of this bill. Perhaps the most important provision is to grandfather the millions of credit union members who were added to the multiple-group credit unions before the February 28 Supreme Court decision. As we know, these types of memberships were invalidated. No one wants to see the present credit union members lose their accounts, and this will ensure that they do not. 
Another important provision is to enhance the supervisory oversight of federally chartered credit unions to make sure they are sounder, safer, and more efficient. 
I think we would not be debating this legislation today if the regulatory authority, the National Credit Union Administration, had used its regulatory power to do more of those things to carry out the original intent of the Federal Credit Union Act of 1934. Arguably, the NCUA has been more of an advocate than a regulator. I think that has to change. 
As with every other federally chartered organization or institution, Federal credit unions must serve within that niche that is prescribed for them by law. I have told my friends in the credit unions that there are certain advantages to the way they are structured, certain advantages go to them as being cooperatives and being member-owned. That is good, and I endorse that. 
On the other hand, there have to be, then, some limitations to the kinds of things that they can do. I think commercial lending should not go unlimited. I support the amendment of the Senator from Nebraska which would allow for commercial lending, which they are seeking. I also support the Shelby amendment which exempts small community banks from the requirement of the Community Reinvestment Act. I hear all the time of the amount of the administrative and regulatory time spent in a very small bank; more time reporting than there is in lending. 
So I hope that not only the banks, but the credit unions can get out from under that basic paperwork requirement. The expenses of meeting these costs, as the Senator from Alabama just indicated, are, of course, passed on to the owners and depositors. 
I am supportive of the efforts to relieve those unnecessary mandates. That is what we ought to be doing whenever we can. I believe this is an appropriate place to do that. 
Clearly, banks and credit unions have a proper, legitimate, rightful, and important place in our financial system. We simply need to define what those roles are. 
Our challenge is to successfully address the Supreme Court's ruling in a way that will allow consumers access to credit and financial institutions, have fairness among them, and strengthen the regulatory and safety aspects of them. I believe this bill will do that. 
I support the unique status of credit unions, and I believe the bill before us, with amendments, maps out an appropriate role for the future. 
Madam President, I yield the floor.  
Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wanted to take the opportunity today as we gather, and before we begin debate on a specific bill, to talk a little bit about the Patients' Bill of Rights, the Republican bill that was introduced last week, a bill that I believe has a great deal of value for the American people. S. 2330, the Patients' Bill of Rights, will be the subject, I think, of our discussion this week and, indeed, should be. 
For some time now we have been hearing from the other side of the aisle with respect to a Patients' Bill of Rights, and they will have one. Hopefully what will happen, we will have an opportunity to consider both of these bills, have an up-or-down vote on each of them, and successfully pass one of these versions that will protect patients throughout the country. 
The Republican proposal is a carefully crafted plan intended to give patients and families more choices as we change the way health care is delivered in this country. And as we move toward more managed care, then there needs, I believe, to be some additional provisions put into law which will ensure that Americans and their families receive the kind of care we would like them to receive. 
There are differences between the two bills. Some of them, I believe, are significant--some of them are broad differences that are philosophical, I suppose. For example, the Republican bill deals with those health plans that are not regulated by the States. 
In Wyoming, my home State, things are quite different in terms of a health care delivery system compared to New York or California. We have a State of 100,000 square miles with 470,000 people, so you can imagine--we have small towns, and we have a different kind of system. Just this weekend I was in Casper, WY, celebrating the 15th anniversary of the Life Flight program in Wyoming. That is the helicopter, and a fixed wing as well, from the Central Wyoming Medical Center which serves the whole State. 
We have one Life Flight program for all of Wyoming. It serves the mountains in the north; it serves the towns in the south. It is quite different, for example, than you would have in New England. So I think it is important that we allow States to continue regulating those health plans that they have jurisdiction over so they may craft regulations tailored to their specific needs. The Republican Patients Bill of Rights, therefore, focuses solely on health plans outside State jurisdiction. 
Secondly, Republicans propose a different type of appeals process. The Democratic proposal says go to the courts; let's have more litigation; let's bring the lawyers in to decide health care issues. Republicans, on the other hand, say let's have a health care system where the appeals are decided more quickly, less expensively, and are made by doctors. 
I think those are very important differences. The main focus of this debate, then, will and should center around patients. That is really what health care is all about. And I think the Republican plan achieves the goal of dealing with the needs of patients. 
It includes at least six new consumer standards that I think are important for us to consider. One is access to emergency care. This is the kind of thing that I just spoke of in terms of Wyoming. As you can imagine, the Life Flight helicopter is an expensive project but very necessary. There is no other way to carry patients from a small town in the Big Horns to the medical center in Casper. This ensures that emergency care will be received. 
The prudent lay care standard is adopted where emergency health care screening is guaranteed. And this is not the case, of course, in all managed care plans. So it is very important. 
Point-of-service access, point-of-service coverage, this provides that if you choose to see a provider outside of the managed care network, the program should make arrangements for you to be able to do that. We think that is important. For continuity of care in case the physician leaves the health plan or the plan changes, patients must be notified of such changes. Patients also should have the opportunity to continue seeing that provider for at least 90 days while they make the transition to choose another provider in the health plan's preferred network. This transition period would apply to patients in their second trimester of pregnancy or for those who may be terminally ill. Again, also, that is an important issue. By the way, many of these issues are the same in both bills and that is good; there will be some agreement. 
There needs to be open discussion of all treatment options. Those of us who are in managed care need to know exactly what is coming. We need to know exactly what benefits will be covered. On the other hand, if you are going to have managed care and choose that as a less expensive option, then we can only expect to utilize the benefits that are covered. So there needs to be open discussion of all treatment options, as well as full disclosure of the health plan's terms and conditions. 
There are some key differences, and I have mentioned them, between the GOP and the Kennedy bills. Most of the areas considered are the same or are, indeed, similar, and I think that is as it should be. But I have already mentioned that there is a grievance process that replaces litigation. I happen to think that is a great idea. 
One of the real problems we have had in health care through the years is not only the cost of litigation itself, but also the types of duplicative services performed to prevent lawsuits, tests that are terribly expensive. Over the last several years, we have been able to reduce these costs. But now we find ourselves faced with similar circumstances than may raise the cost of health care again. 
Obviously, you have to have some form of appeals program. However, the key is to make sure it proceeds in a timely manner so you do not wait 2 or 3 years to get redress. You don't have the time to do that in health care. You need some decisions made very quickly. The other requirement is to make sure such decisions are made by doctors, not by lawyers. That is important. So I think there is a great deal of merit to our approach. 
So there are a number of reasons why I think the Republican approach is best. One is, it gives rights and remedies to 48 million Americans whose current coverages are unregulated. It also provides for some new provisions. It allows full deductibility for the purchase of health insurance by the self-employed, which has not been the case in the past. It outlaws gag rules placed on physicians. Most States have done that. It expands emergency room coverage. It makes it easier to get service outside of the HMO. It remove barriers to seeing obstetricians, gynecologists and pediatricians, which provides great peace of mind. It also requires the continuity of care and more information to consumers. Consumers are entitled to these standards. Standards which are designed to make managed care plans more accountable. So as we change health care in this delivery system, there needs to be some regulatory revisions, and that is what the Republican Patients Bill of Rights does. 
This bill is something we need to do. The purposes are good. The legislation is well-written. It provides quality care based on sound medical evidence, and that is something that we sorely need in this country. I urge Members of the Senate to support the Republican health care bill. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, Senator Brownback, in offering this amendment. What we seek to do with this amendment is quite simple: require the legislative branch to identify its commercial functions that are performed in-house. 
For the past several years, I have been the primary Senate sponsor of the Freedom from Government Competition Act. That legislation would codify the 40 year old administrative policy in place for the executive branch which requires: (1) Federal agencies to identify their commercial activities; and (2) Conduct public/private competitions to determine whether the private sector or government employees can provide the `best value' to the American taxpayer. Unfortunately, this policy, now found in OMB Circular A-76, is routinely ignored by many federal executive agencies. In fact, OMB recently issued another call for federal agencies' commercial inventories, its third request in the last several years. That's why Senator Brownback and I have been working to get this policy into statute. 
Today, Senator Brownback and I seek to extend some of these requirements to cover the legislative branch. In fact, we know that there are over one million federal executive branch employees engaged in commercial work. But since this policy doesn't apply to the legislative branch, we don't know how many legislative branch employees are doing commercial work, how much that work costs or whether the work could be done more efficiently by the private sector. This amendment will help us gather that information and make the legislative branch play by the same rules as the rest of the federal government. 
I urge my colleagues to support this good government, common sense reform.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, I rise this morning in support of the resolution on Taiwan. 
My expectations for the recent summit meeting in the PRC were, frankly, not high. Summit meetings such as the one in Beijing rarely provide the atmosphere for momentous policy breakthroughs. Rather, they are an important opportunity for leaders to exchange views and to discuss further avenues of bilateral cooperation. This summit then, viewed from that standpoint, met expectations. 
And I must say, that I was encouraged by the willingness of the PRC to broadcast both the Clinton-Jiang press conference and the President's speech from Beijing Daxue in Beijing. Clearly, that decision was an important step in the PRC's continuing--albeit slow--progress toward further openness. 
But Mr. President, I was disturbed by the President's pronouncements on Taiwan and the `three noes.' The PRC-Taiwan-US relationship is a very complex one. While it certainly can be argued that the President's statement was simply a restatement of actual U.S. policy on Taiwan, in a culture, on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, where nuances are everything, I believe that the statement sent the worst possible signals to both sides. 
First, the statement was the first time that a President of the United States has publicly adopted the PRC policy of the `three noes.' While--as the President's national security adviser pointed out to me in a meeting yesterday--it is true that both he and Secretary Albright have made similar statements in the past, and it is true that in many ways the statement was simply a restatement of implicit U.S. policies, the fact that the pronouncement came directly from the President gives it a special gravity in Chinese eyes. 
Second, it occurred while the President was still in the PRC, during the first visit of an American President since 1989, and more ominously for the Taiwanese, in Shanghai, the site of what they regard as the infamous Shanghai Communique. 
Third, to me the statement bore all the markings of a quid pro quo. Any outside observer looking at the give-and-take of the summit would see that the PRC gave the U.S. four unprecedented opportunities for the President to make live statements on Chinese TV and radio. What did the PRC get in return in what for both sides is always supposed to be a zero-sum game, they might ask? Well, aside from the reception in Tiananmen Square, the only other concession to the PRC I can find is the Taiwan statement. 
And let there be no doubt, Mr. President, the statement was a useful concession to the PRC. Beijing officials have stated that they intend to use the President's remarks as a lever to force Taiwan into political talks on reunification. The Foreign Ministry stated yesterday that Clinton's statement has `positive implications for the resolution of the Taiwan question.' Tang Shubei, the Vice President of the PRC's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) with whom I have discussed the Taiwan issue on several occasions, has said that the remarks helped the PRC: `This has provided favorable conditions for the development of cross-strait relations.' 
It seems to me that the President could have simply said, when asked, `There has been no change in the policy of the United States on the Taiwan question' or `The United States' position on the Taiwan question remains the same' or words to that effect. Instead, he made a conscious decision to explicitly adopt the PRC's `three noes' policy. Such a decision was hardly accidental, and so I must ask why that decision was made. And in the total absence of any other rational explanation from the White House, I and others can only conclude that the statement was some sort of quid pro quo. 
Fourth, and most disturbing to me, the President explicitly stated that the United States will not under any circumstances support the independence of Taiwan. While it could be said that this policy is implicit in the fact that the United States supports the `one China' policy and does not support `two Chinas' or `one China one Taiwan,' it is the first time in my knowledge that it has been publicly enunciated in this manner. In addition, it seems to me to completely rule out a bid for independence even if the PRC uses force to reunify with Taiwan--a course of action it has pointedly refused to rule out. 
So Mr. President, I think it only proper under these unfortunate circumstances that the Congress make clear its position on the status of Taiwan. For that reason, I support the resolution and urge my colleagues to do the same.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor, as many other Members have, to speak in favor of the IRS reform bill that is before the Senate. As the Senator from New Hampshire indicated, I want to take just a little bit of a different approach. We talk about this as one of the steps in the changes that do need to be made. 
I do come to the floor to express my support for the package. The agency, of course, has basically run roughshod over American taxpayers for too long. This is the first significant reform in this agency in over four decades. 
Congress should do more of this kind of oversight. It seems to me in this whole business of funding the Government, this whole business of appropriations, that we need to find a way to have more time for oversight. That is why I am supporting and continue to support a biennial budget in the appropriations process, so we would have off years to do this kind of thing for many other agencies. 
Basically, I guess my point is that this is an important part of the Republican agenda, of our agenda, to do things about taxes. No. 1, of course, is to have tax reduction. I think American families deserve that. I think it is good for the economy. It has to do with having less Government and a smaller Government. IRS reform is part of it, and this is a great step in that direction. 
Certainly, the third point is simplification of the Tax Code. I think, also, that is a necessary element before we find satisfaction with our Tax Code. 
So, reducing taxes, IRS reform, and simplification comprise a three-pronged agenda, one which I support. Last year we made some progress in terms of reducing taxes, reduced them in capital gains, reduced estate taxes, installed a $500-per-child tax credit, expanded IRAs, and passed other important small business tax reductions. 
I would like to go forward in that area, and I hope we shall. Further reducing capital gains, eliminating estate taxes, reducing and eliminating the marriage tax penalty are areas in which we can make progress. 
This year we will reform IRS, the Federal agency that has interaction with more Americans than any other agency. I salute Senator Roth and the Senator from New York and members of the Finance Committee for holding fast against the initial White House reluctance and opposition to reforms in this agency. His hearings, the committee's hearings, brought to light many unbelievable abuses of taxpayers by this agency. 
This reform package, then, increases the oversight on IRS, holds IRS employees more accountable, makes IRS a more service-friendly agency, puts the law on the side of the taxpayer, has some very key provisions: Taxpayer confidentiality, extends the attorney-client privilege to accountants, reverses the burden of proof from the taxpayer to the IRS, guarantees 30 days to request a hearing of disputes, gives new powers to the taxpayers who petition the courts to contest decisions, and reforms the management of the IRS. 
These are all good things. 
The third part of our agenda, which is still there and I believe is of paramount importance if we are to really change the tax atmosphere: I think we have to address the basic underlying Tax Code. Hopefully, that will take place in the next year or two. We plan to significantly reform the Tax Code and to eliminate the complexity that is now there. There seems to be some misunderstanding about one of the proposals now which would terminate the current Tax Code in the year 2001. It does not eliminate the Tax Code, it simply gives a time certain in which a new Tax Code needs to be devised. 
The IRS is responsible for creating many of the problems the taxpayers have, but Congress needs to bear the burden of fixing the current Tax Code. There are 17,000 pages of inherently confusing data that need to be changed. Taxpayers spend $200 billion and 5.4 billion hours to comply with the tax law. The IRS employs over 100,000 people, more than five times the number of the FBI. After 80 years of abuses by lawmakers, lobbyists, and special interests, the tax system is unfair, complex, it is costly and punishes work, savings, and investment. 
Certainly there is a great opportunity for basic recodification of the Tax Code. I support plans, of course, that have the basic elements of fairness, of simplicity, reducing the overall tax burden. 
It is interesting, as you go about in your State, my State of Wyoming, and ask how many people like the Tax Code the way it is now, nobody responds, of course. Then you say: What do you want to do about it? Do you like sales tax? Do you like flat tax? Do you like consumption tax? But we haven't come, yet, to a consensus on what the replacement ought to be. That is the challenge before us. 
I am pleased we are about to pass this historic bill, complete the second part of a three-pronged tax agenda. I hope soon we will move to finish the job and fundamentally reform the Tax Code. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to just mention again, as we enter into the real depth of appropriations, one of the things that we have talked about a great deal that I feel very strongly about, and I think we ought to think about as we do that, is a biennial budget. 
Each year in this institution we spend about half or more of our time dealing with appropriations, which leaves us very little time to do the other things that are very necessary--particularly oversight. Almost all legislative bodies in this country have biennial budgets, which gives an opportunity, first of all, for the agencies to have two years with which to know what their spending will be. Secondly, it allows the institution to have time to oversee the spending that is authorized. 
Rather than take more time to talk about it, I just raise the question again and urge the leadership to give some consideration to a biennial budget, where we would make a budget for two years and then have a chance for oversight, have a chance for the agencies to know what they are doing longer, and have a chance to do some of the other business that properly comes before this body.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am hopeful that today we will come to some conclusion and come to an end in the tobacco controversy that has gone on for a very long time now. I think there are several things which seem to have a consensus. One is that we should make effective efforts to reduce teenage smoking. After all, that was the beginning. That was the purpose. That, to me, is still the overriding objective of whatever we do in terms of tobacco. 
I think there is a consensus that the tobacco companies should be held accountable for the kinds of advertising that they do, for the things they say. The FDA rules should accomplish that. 
I think that most people believe we should enforce the laws against the purchase of cigarettes by teenagers. 
I think there is also consensus, quite frankly, that we have talked quite long enough about this issue. It is time to come to the snubbing post, and do something about it. I hope we do. 
I am discouraged, frankly, with the direction that this bill is moving. It is no longer focused on the real issues for which it came to public attention, teen smoking and public health. Instead, it has become a platform for talking about all kinds of things, such as replacing one tax with another, such as increasing programs over the next 25 years to the tune of maybe $800 billion, programs that will almost surely become entitlements, and when this funding has run out, will have to be replaced by other funding. Those are not the reasons we began to do this. 
There are things in the bill that I don't think anyone has even thought about or talked about. For example, $1,700 per year in college tuition for tobacco farmers and their family members, including brothers and sisters and stepbrothers and stepsisters and sons in law and daughters in law. I doubt that is what we talked about. Providing $7.5 billion to help American Indians stop smoking, or about $18,000 per person--those are not the kind of initiatives we had in mind. 
Secondly, I am opposed to the tobacco industry's marketing techniques aimed at teens, either through regulation, through law or through public opinion. That should stop. My position has been clear on these issues. But to expand the size of our federal agencies or create new ones--some reports indicate--as many as 17 new agencies will be established by this bill, is not what we had in mind, is not where we began. 
Unfortunately, we find promoters of the bill accuse those who are not enthusiastic about it of being against doing something about teenage smoking. That is not true. Everyone is for curbing the use of youth smoking. Everyone wants to do that. So we ought not to be confused by such accusations. After all, one of the real philosophies and overriding efforts in this Congress ought to be to reduce the size of the Federal Government and uphold States rights. Those things are very important. Instead, this bill goes the opposite direction, creating new government boards, guaranteed annual spending increases and a wide range of State mandates--just the opposite in terms of the principals we support. 
Fortunately, there will be two alternatives. We will have an opportunity to vote on substitutes if that is the choice of the leadership. One will be offered by Senator Gramm and Senator Domenici. That is sort of a basic bill aimed at the purpose of controlling teenage smoking. Again, that should be our primary purpose. The second one, of course, is sponsored by Senator Hatch and Senator Feinstein which goes back pretty much to the original agreement. 
So I am not going to extend the tobacco debate any longer than it already has been for 3 1/2 weeks, but I do just simply want to say that we ought to focus on the issue for which we began. We ought to do something about teen smoking, get away from this idea of bringing in everything that we can possibly think of in terms of taxes, money, and bureaucracy. It is time to deal with the issue and move on. We have a great deal to do before this session ends. We haven't even begun to discuss the appropriations bills. We have the Armed Forces authorization bill to finish. We have sorts of other legislative matters that are just as important. 
Mr. President, I simply wanted to express my view in terms of the fact that I think it is time to come to some consensus, to some conclusion, and move forward. I think this can be achieved if we would only focus on the real issue--curbing teenage smoking. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senate for approving S. 1693, the `Vision 2020 National Parks Restoration Act.' This is the culmination of over two years of work and reflects a lifetime of concern I have had about protecting our nation's parks. America's park system needs attention and it needs our help soon. I believe this bill will provide it. 
When we began this effort more then a year ago I came to the floor and challenged Senators to imagine for a moment an America without national parks. How would we feel without Yosemite, Independence Hall, or Grand Canyon protected for public enjoyment? How much of our national identity reflected in these icons--the Statue of Liberty, Yellowstone, or the National Capital Mall--would be lost? How much would be missing without the rugged, adventurous American spirit embodied in Glacier Park or Denali? That was the challenge. The U.S. Senate has risen to answer that challenge by passing this bill today. 
I'm profoundly proud of what we have accomplished. This effort has been on behalf of the millions of park visitor that flock to the wide open spaces or the rich historic sites. It's for taxpayers who expect the very best return for their money. And it's for the future generations of people, for whom we've worked hard, to preserve the very best of our public land heritage. 
I want to express my deep appreciate to the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, Chairman Murkowski, as well as Senator Bumpers and Senator Bennett, who have labored long in this area of parks support, and I thank them for all of their hard work in this legislation. The compromise we developed in order to pass this measure is in the finest tradition of the Senate. The negotiations were tough, and nobody got everything they wanted in the bill. However, we have put together a good piece of legislation that will make a positive and proactive change to help our national parks. 
I also want to recognize the hard work of the staff, particularly Dan Naatz of my staff, and Jim O'Toole of the committee staff. 
Over the last two years, we have spoken to dozens of groups interested in preserving our parks. We have traveled across the country and listened to the concerns of folks ranging from the motion picture industry to natural resource experts. We have heard the suggestions as well as the criticisms of our colleagues and worked to evaluate areas where we could make positive improvements for our parks. Throughout all of these meetings and hearings, one message came through loud and clear--the value of national parks is one of the cultural constants for Americans. 
The Vision 2020 bill provides a systematic approach to addressing the needs of the National Park Service. The restoration bill takes a broad approach, with eight titles covering the compromise bill. 
Mr. President, the Senate can be proud of passing this landmark piece of legislation. As Americans, one of the finest legacies that we can leave our children and grandchildren is the National Park System that is healthy, vibrant and alive. We have an obligation to strengthen our outstanding system of parks, the system that over 100 other nations have modeled after ours. 
Finally, I want to recognize the important contribution of the Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt, in developing this compromise bill. As folks know, the Secretary and I don't agree on all issues. However, to his credit, the Secretary recognized the important work we are doing and dedicated time and manpower of his agency to help. I thank the Secretary for his help. 
Today is a good day for our parks. It's a good day for the U.S. Senate. Our commitment is to leave our children and grandchildren these wild and historic places healthy and whole. Today we are one big step forward toward achieving that worthwhile aspiration. I once again want to thank the Senate for passing S. 1693 and urge the House of Representatives to take up this bill as soon as possible.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today as the Chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs I submit S. Res. 240, a resolution expressing the sense of the Senate with respect to democracy and human rights in Laos. 
In 1975, the Pathet Lao party supplanted the legitimate Lao government and the Lao Royal Family, and established a `people's democratic republic,' in violation of the 1962 Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos and its Protocol, as well as the 1973 Vientiane Agreement on Laos. Since that time, Laos has been under the sole control of the communist Lao People's Democratic Party. 
Although the present Lao Constitution provides for human rights protection for the Lao people, is a signatory to international agreements on civil and political rights, and has become a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations--which calls for the creation of open societies in each of its member states by the year 2020--the State Department's `Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1997' notes that the government has only slowly eased restrictions on basic freedoms and begun codification of implementing legislation for rights stipulated in the Lao Constitution, and continues to significantly restrict the freedoms of the press, speech, and assembly. 
Mr. President, would-be opposition political leaders in Laos continue to be jailed in horrible conditions solely because they espouse democratic ideals. While Laos recently conducted the country's most open elections since 1975, that is not to say that the elections came close to meeting even the minimal norms for what we would consider free and fair; Laos is still a one-party state and all of the candidates for election were vetted by the party. And the Hmong and Yao ethnic minorities continue to face discrimination and, in some cases, persecution. 
In addition, on January 30 of this year, a group of 44 people, including five foreigners, were arrested at a Bible study meeting in Vientiane. Charged with creating divisions among the people, undermining the government and accepting foreign funds to promote religion, a Laotian court sentenced 13 Christians from the group to prison on March 25. Eight were sentenced to three-year prison terms, including five Lao affiliated with Partners in Progress (PIP), a U.S.-based evangelical humanitarian aid organization. Lao authorities had prevented the prisoners from meeting with their families until the sentencing. 
Last month the Lao Foreign Ministry accused the group of making negative comments about the government and interfering in the internal affairs of the country by insulting the reputation of Lao leaders. A foreign ministry spokesman added that the three Americans, all PIP workers, had taken advantage of their non-governmental organization status to `promote the worship of Christ' to Lao nationals. 
Mr. President, Laos doesn't receive a lot of attention from the outside. It is a land-locked, impoverished country of just slightly over five million people, where only three percent of the land is arable. Subsistence farming accounts for more than half of the GDP, and provides more than eighty percent of total employment. It has few roads, no railroads, and electricity in only a few scattered urban areas. Needless to say, it is of little strategic or economic interest to the rest of the world. 
But Mr. President, that does not mean that we can or should turn a blind eye to the human rights situation in that country. We need to urge Laos to respect international norms of human rights and democratic freedoms for the Lao people, and fully honor its commitments to those norms and freedoms as embodied in its constitution and international agreements. The resolution calls on the Lao government to issue a public statement specifically reaffirming its commitment to protecting religious freedom, and to fully institute a process of democracy, human rights and openly-contested free and fair elections in Laos, and ensure specifically that the National Assembly elections--currently scheduled for 2002--are openly contested. I hope they get the message. 
Mr. President, before I close I would like to thank my good friend from Minnesota, Mr. Grams, for cosponsoring--indeed, for inspiring--this resolution. Senator Grams has significant Lao and Hmong populations in his state, and has been active in getting their message heard in Congress; I've attended several meetings, including one with members of the Lao royal family, which he sponsored. I would also like to thank my friend the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith, for his cosponsorship; there is a large Hmong population in Portland, and I know Senator Smith has followed events in Laos closely.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to speak on this highway bill. Seeing there is no one else here, I will not limit time. But I want to, first of all, congratulate the chairman of the committee and the Senator from Montana, the ranking member, at having done what I think is an excellent job with a most difficult issue, an issue where you take a vast amount of money that comes in from gas taxes and seek to put it 
into a formula that is fair to all the States, and yet adheres to the purpose of the thing, which is an interstate highway program that runs from coast to coast, that runs from Mexico to Canada, and that does all the things that an interstate program is supposed to do. So there does need to be some adjustment, in terms of the dollars, with respect to the various States. 
It is most difficult. I am here to support the bill. I think it is well done. Also, to remind Members that this committee has been working in this area for more than a year. This bill was brought to the Senate more than 2 months ago and passed, I think almost unanimously, and this proposition that comes before us today is very similar to what was passed here in the Senate. 
One of the difficult parts, procedurally, of course, is that something quite different was passed originally in the House. In order to get this done, there has to be some conference. There has to be some communication. There has to be some allocation of differences between the House and Senate, and they were extreme, those differences, particularly in the area of the so-called demonstration projects, all above the formula line. 
So it has been a very long process and one that has been tedious, one that has been difficult. I sympathize, I think, with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee in his feeling of not having been as involved as he would have liked to be. I suspect that is probably true of all of us. This is a large bill. It will be out here soon. We are saying, my gosh, we are being asked to vote in an hour or two on a bill of that kind? But the fact is, the real issues have been known for some time. The real issues have been talked about. The real issues have been in the daily reports. The real issues have been done by our staffs. So it is not a surprise. 
Of course we don't know all the details, and unfortunately I have to say: How many of these bills that are 18 inches high has everybody read on the other issues? But the principles are there. And the principle is to try to spend about the amount of money that comes in on gas tax for highways; that is fairly reasonable--or for transportation. The idea of guaranteeing that each State will have 90.5 percent of what they paid in, that is pretty basic. We know that. 
We have some things in there that I think are very important to all of us. We have increased the money that goes to national parks. All of us have national parks. And certainly if we don't have them in our State, we all use national parks and enjoy national parks. They have no other source for funding, and that is good. For Federal lands, of course, to the Presiding Officer and I, representing a State that is 50 percent Federal ownership--and some others are substantially higher--Federal land money is very important. 
So these are the principal things that are there. These are the things that we know about. I think we have to remember that the deadline for reauthorization has passed. It passed last January. We had a temporary bill that went into place until the first of May. This is something that makes it impossible, if we do not have a bill, for States to go ahead and plan. And that is particularly true for those of us who live in the northern part of the country where we have a relatively short construction time, and States need to know what kind of money they will have to deal with. So I think it is vital that we get into this bill, that we find out the basic points that we 
need to be informed on, and that we move forward and, frankly, do this before we go on this recess. 
I guess, as a practical matter, we can go on the recess and we will not know a great deal. The issues will still be about the same when we come back. The issue is not so much a matter of understanding as it is a matter of not everyone is going to be perfectly happy. In Massachusetts, for example, they had a huge allocation before, for a special project, so their formula this year looks a little strange because they don't have that huge project in. 
So there is an effort to make it that way. So I hope we move forward. We have really been through this business of talking about whether we are going to spend the gas tax on highways or not. We went through that. We voted on that. We are ready to move forward. This is a very complicated program. I believe it is a good one. I believe the committee has done very well, and I urge my friends in the Senate to move forward and complete this discussion today. 
I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I rise to talk not so much about this bill but the bills that have been talked about here that passed in the House last year. Many of them were referred to the Foreign Relations Committee, of which I happen to be chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific Rim. These were not heard because the committee did not choose to hear them. Now we find ourselves having a hearing this morning on China. We find the President preparing to go to China. 
So this bill, of course, as the Senator pointed out, was referred to Banking. I am not familiar with that one. I am here to tell you that I don't think this is the appropriate procedural place to deal with these bills. There are committees that have jurisdiction over them. They have been referred to those committees. They can be referred to those committees, and, in my view, they should be referred to those committees. So if we are going to extend the length of this debate by having each of 10 bills discussed here and voted on, then I think we need to prepare ourselves for a rather long time. 
Furthermore, I think we talked at great length this morning about China and about these kinds of issues. The point of the matter is that nobody disagrees with some of the issues that are to be done here; the disagreement is how they should be handled. To send the President off to China with language of this kind doesn't seem to be a proper thing to do. They were talking about it when Jiang Zemin came here last time. 
So I am prepared to talk about these bills if that is what we are going to do. But, procedurally, it doesn't seem to me that this is the appropriate place to deal with the bills. We can go on for a very long time if that is what is going to take place on this authorization bill. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we are not moving along too quickly this morning, so I thought I would take an opportunity to visit about an observation that I have made. We had a few moments ago the remarks by the good Senator from West Virginia about the passing of a former Senator from his State. He talked a bit about the past, a bit about the history of the Senate, and it was extremely interesting. This place, of course, is filled with history, it is filled with tradition, and that is good. 
On the other hand, there are changes that have taken place, and one of them is a little troubling to me. It does seem as if we are increasingly moving governance into more of show business and into more of political spin, more of promotion, more of advertising than really dealing with issues based on the facts and how they impact us. 
The basic principle, of course, of our historic democracy, thankfully, continues to exist, and we must insist that it does continue to exist--the idea of a government by Constitution and adhering to the basic tenets of the Constitution, the separation of institutions that provide some semblance of power division among the executive and the legislative and judicial branches; the idea of public access, that people have an opportunity to participate fully in government, that people have an opportunity to have the background and the facts that are necessary to participate; the idea of disclosure--we talk about that a lot--majorities deciding the direction that we take in this country based on facts, rule of law. In short, a government of the people, by the people and for the people, of course, and these are basic elements of democracy. 
An informed public is essential to that government of the people. Ironically, technology, which has provided us with the greatest opportunity to know more about what is happening more quickly than ever--can you imagine what it must have been like 100 years ago to be home in Wyoming and wonder what is going on in Washington? I suppose there was some comfort in that, as a matter of fact, but, nevertheless, it is quite different than what we have now. We have now the greatest opportunity in history for people to know what is happening and to know instantly what is happening. If a decision is made in Israel this morning, minutes later, the whole world, of course, is familiar with it. 
Unfortunately, the same technology that has provided us the opportunity to know so much more has accommodated and, in fact, I suppose, engendered some of the changes that are taking place in terms of the promotion of ideas and our method of governance. 
Unfortunately, spinning, promotion, and media hype have replaced real debate based on the issues, and that is too bad. It seems to me that this administration and, I must say, my friends in the minority, have perfected the idea that success is not policy or success is not finishing the job; success is having an opportunity to spin an issue on the evening news; success is getting coverage on the 5 o'clock national report. If polls indicate there is an issue out there in which people are interested and it is currently being discussed, this administration is quick to describe the problem and promise a Federal solution with lots of Federal money--`We'll fix it for you.' 
Often there is no plan presented to deal with the problem. There is generally no real proposal to implement, nothing is laid before the Congress. Frankly, there is really no expectation that anything is going to happen; that the idea is, `Here's the problem, here's what the polls have said; we'll fix it.' And if you don't agree with that, suddenly you are out of step with the world. So success is measured in media rather than solutions. Unfortunately, I think we see more and more of that. 
It is interesting to me, because, depending upon your point of view about government, there are problems and there are appropriate ways to fix them and appropriate ways to deal with them. Of course, it is true that people have different views about that. There are those who believe the Federal Government ought to be the primary fixer of whatever the problem. That is a legitimate liberal view. There are those who believe that it is more likely to find satisfactory solutions if you go to the State, the local government, or the private sector. That, I guess, is a more conservative view. 
But more important than the philosophy, I think it is appropriate that when you have something you want to deal with, we ought to talk a little bit about where it can most appropriately be fixed. 
Should it be done at the Federal Government level? Should it be the kind of program that is one size fits all? I am very sensitive about that, I suppose, being from Wyoming. We are the smallest, population-wise, State in this country. So things that work in Pennsylvania, things that work in New York, do not necessarily work in Wyoming or Nevada or Kansas. So we are better off, in many instances, to say, `Wait a minute. This service can better be delivered on the basis of a State solution, although the politics of it is, `Let's get on TV and say we'll fix it for you,' even with no expectation of having it happen. 
So I think we are finding more and more of that. And it just seems to me that it is something we ought to really evaluate, this idea that we watch the polls, find an issue, go to the TV, say we will fix it, and then beat up on everybody who really does not agree with that, without having any genuine--genuine--debate or discussion or analysis of how we best deal with the problem and where it works. 
Generally, these are things that are done certainly in a broad context. Everyone cares about children, so if you have a proposal on children--and to suggest that we do not is offensive to me. Everybody cares about child care, but where is it best dealt with? Everybody cares about health care. Where is it best provided? Everybody cares about secondary and elementary education. Where do we best deal with it? It is not enough just to say, `We've got a problem. I want 100,000 teachers; I want the Federal Government to pay for it. It will become a mandatory program, and we have more and more Federal control.' 
Those are the debates. Those are the debates. I guess it troubles me because we sort of trivialize governance with this business of applying the media technique. I understand that the minority--and Republicans have been in the minority, of course. For the minority it is easier to make proposals. It is easier to throw stones and things because you do not have the responsibility to finish it up. 
So it is, I think, an interesting kind of thing and one that I believe has some bearing on us really solving problems here. I think it is something we all ought to give some consideration to so that we begin to say to ourselves, `Here's the problem. How do we best resolve it?' not just `How do we get the best 5 o'clock news out of it?' Success should not be how much media coverage; success ought to be dealing with the problem, trying to resolve it with real debate, real desire to put it where it belongs. Many problems are best solved in the private sector, best solved in State and local government, best solved--some--by the Federal Government. And those are the decisions that we should make. 
So, Mr. President, as we move forward I hope that we do maintain the elements of democracy. I have had the occasion, being chairman of a subcommittee on Foreign Relations, to go some places where they do not have democracy. And obviously the things that keep them from that is not having a constitutional government to which people can adhere and a rule of law which enforces it, an opportunity for people to voice their opinions and an opportunity for people to be informed as they form these 
opinions. These are the things that I think are important to our democracy and I am very interested in maintaining. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to take some time while we are in a pause here to talk about something that all of us are aware of, and that is Mother's Day, which is on Sunday, but I also want to talk a little bit about a special mother, a lady from Sheridan, WY. 
This lady was selected to be Mother of the Year in Wyoming a short time ago. Just last week, she participated in the National Mother of the Year event, American mothers event. She is a lady who has done all of the things that people want to do. 
She had a long and happy marriage, a career with her husband in a small business, a leader in her church. She continues to be an elder of the Sunday school, superintendent of a Presbyterian Church, first woman president of the Sheridan County Chamber of Commerce, a scout leader, director of the National Miss Indian Pageant for 12 years, twice Worthy Matron of Eastern Star. Currently, she is serving on the boards of the Sheridan County Senior Center, Salvation Army, Lifelink and Camp Story. She is a busy, busy lady. She also has two children. 
Her name is Dorothy Enzi, and one of her children is Senator Mike Enzi from Wyoming, my associate, who went, by the way, last weekend to this national event. 
I want to take a moment to recognize this lady for all that she does, not only because she is my friend's mother and my friend as well, but because this is the time to celebrate motherhood, a time to celebrate families, a time to celebrate things that we think are so important. 
I was struck by the homey sort of poem that was written by her daughter, the other child of Dorothy Enzi. I am going to share it with you.

Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President, 
Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for arranging for time to talk about something that, of course, is probably as important to Americans as any issue, and it is probably good to talk about it shortly after the 15th of April. It is on our minds, and should be. 
So I am delighted that we are aimed towards doing something next week, doing something that almost everyone agrees needs to be done; that is, to make some adjustment in the system of collection of taxes; some adjustments with the IRS. Everyone knows that it is needed. But it has been needed for a good long time, yet we have not done anything. We have not done anything about it. We now have had, of course, hearings that have gone on for some time both in the House and in the Senate, which have brought to the attention of every one of the American people and to Members of Congress the need to make change. And, hopefully, that will happen. Up until now it seems to me, this agency, as is the case with many agencies, has sort of insulated themselves from public opinion and has sort of set themselves aside from the mainstream of America. Frankly, that is relatively easy to do in a bureaucracy. It seems to me that is one of the reasons that we need somehow to get more nonbureaucratic input into this system. 
Do we need to collect taxes? Of course, we do. Are our tax collectors ever popular? Of course not. But nevertheless there is a way to do this job that is more accountable to taxpayers. That is what we seek. 
I have been working very hard at a number of agencies. One of the things that strikes me in terms of what goes on in government as opposed to the private sector is there is really no built-in discipline. In the private sector you are competing with somebody. If you do not do the job, somebody else does it. So you are required to be relatively efficient, or else someone takes the work. You are required to please the people you serve, or they go somewhere else. Of course, that is not the case in government, and particularly in the case of the IRS. 
I think it is important that we do this. I have been involved in trying to take activities that could better be done by contract and by individuals in the private sector in all parts of government. But I have to tell you that this is one that has insulated itself a great deal. We need to do something about it. 
We find the same kind of threatening, the same kind of criminal intimidation going on in HCFA, in health care at the moment; trying to do something about fraud and abuse, which everyone supports. But the idea of challenging people, to threaten people, to intimidate people into doing it is not the best resolution. 
But that is not the best answer. So we need to find a way to do that. 
In my opinion, the underlying issue, of course, is the Tax Code. One of the problems that IRS has is to enforce a very complicated, convoluted, excessively voluminous and detailed Tax Code, and we need to change that. I think almost everyone, again, is for that change, but interestingly enough, as you talk about how specifically do you change it, then you find less unanimity. But changing the Tax Code is one thing that we must do which will help in the tax collection but it isn't the only thing. We also need to make changes in IRS, and that is what this is about. 
So there will be lots of ideas. The committee has a bill ready to go. The House has passed a bill. I think we will find there will be different views as to how best to do it. But I hope that we are driven, and I think we will be, by a vision of what we want the results to be, and then implement what it takes to cause those results to be different. Again, in the case of government, as opposed to often in the private sector, we are not result driven. We do not measure it by what it is we want to accomplish. We simply measure the process. And that ends up not doing what we would like to do. 
I think it is fair to say the IRS is out of control. The hearings we have had certainly would substantiate that. I do not think many people would argue with it. We have to do something that will cause the IRS to be more accountable to taxpayers. And this goal is too important to be partisan. Hopefully, it will not be. I hope we do not find ourselves smothered with extraneous amendments with other kinds of ideas. I think we ought to focus on how we make this IRS collection business work better and not be diverted by using this bill for lots of other things. 
I think we also need to recognize that IRS reform is a part of a changing tax culture that is maturing, I believe, in this country, certainly is maturing here. And this is one of the components of changing this whole tax scene in which we live, making it simpler, frankly, reducing taxes and making the collection a system that is consumer friendly and at the same time enforces the law. I think we have to recognize that that is what is done. 
So our agenda is simple and should, indeed, be simple. We have to ensure that the IRS serves the American people and not the other way around. That is our task. We need to consider this legislation of restructuring. Again, it is sort of interesting that as you seek to make some changes to produce different results in government, it is very difficult; the reaction you get almost generally is: Oh, things are OK. We don't need to change anything. 
There is no incentive to change in the bureaucracy. And that is what makes it difficult. I am hopeful that we can move to do some of these things. We need to give people outside the bureaucracy some oversight of the enforcement so that when you bring in the view of citizens, you bring in the view of people with expertise, so that, in fact, it can be made a part of the bureaucracy which doesn't automatically exist. 
We need to require the termination of employees who have been involved in offenses, just like you do in every other business, like you do in every other activity. We need to hold managers responsible and accountable. We should do that. It doesn't seem like a strange thing, but it is difficult. The 
people who are supervisors, who are in fact responsible to see that the job is done and done in the proper fashion, need to be held accountable to do that and, of course, have the authority to do it as well. 
We need to change the burden of proof in Tax Courts, putting it on the IRS, not on the taxpayer. We need to protect innocent spouses who are caught up in some kind of marital dilemma in which the spouse is entirely outside of that income but becomes involved. We need to extend, I suspect, the executive privilege beyond the same type that applies to lawyers to accountants and to other tax practitioners so that we have a way for people to be able to communicate among those who are helping them without causing that to be part of the problem. 
I hope this next week is productive, as we think it will be; that we can come up with some real management principles that will convert this task, this necessary task of tax collection into one that is more customer friendly, that is more accountable, indeed, is more effective and has the impact of getting this job done without the kind of offensive activities we have seen happen. 
I appreciate the time. I appreciate Senator Coverdell setting it up, and I would like to yield to my good friend and associate from Wyoming, Senator Enzi.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, this is a morning with a little bit of break between issues. It is an opportunity, it seems to me, to share some of the thoughts some of us have as priorities. Obviously, when we get involved in a particular bill, as we did last week, it took the whole week. Some of the things we care a lot about we tend to sort of set aside. 
I speak this morning briefly on a couple of issues that I think are very important, and are particularly important to me. One is the bill called Vision 20-20. It is the product of a great deal of effort that we put in in the Parks Subcommittee with respect to revitalizing our national parks. We have had one hearing in the subcommittee. We have another planned for this week. Finally, we will have four hearings and then, hopefully, bring it to the floor sometime in May or early June. 
National parks, of course, are increasingly well thought of in this country. They are increasingly popular. Visitations go up. We have more and more people taking advantage of the parks, parks that preserve either natural resources or cultural resources that have been a tradition. 
We celebrated last year the 125th anniversary of the first park, Yellowstone Park in Wyoming, as a matter of fact. Unfortunately, at the same time that we have increased our caring about parks, we find ourselves, according to the park agency, in addition to being $5 billion behind in the infrastructure, taking care of those parks and preserving those parks. The purpose, of course, of a park is to preserve those resources, whether they be natural or cultural. But equally as important, and the second issue, certainly is to provide a pleasant visit to the owners of the park who are the people of the United States. That, of course, becomes more difficult as this infrastructure needs repair. 
We are seeking to do a number of things. We are seeking to increase the resources that are available that will be supplemental to the budget money, to the tax money that all taxpayers pay, by doing things like extending the fee period where additional trial fees have been added to the parks, and to extend that for some time to see that people who enter the park can actually share more of the responsibility of paying for it. We are also talking about a stamp, collectible stamps, such as a duck stamp, in which the resources would go to the park. We are talking about those people who come on international tours to be able as part of their tour to buy a 30-day entry to parks with some of those funds going to national parks. 
We are talking about bonding many of the larger parks. Have things like streets and sewers, and it is very difficult to keep those up on annual budgets. So we are seeking to do that which is difficult since there is no real capital budget in the Federal establishment at work in doing that. 
In addition, we hope to give an opportunity for taxpayers to deduct a portion of their return--the money that comes back to them--and dedicate it to the parks, if they choose to. We think that is an opportunity to support the parks and those people who care a great deal about it. 
In addition, we are talking about the management. I think that is fair because they have more resources. There is 
evidence, of course, that management is not always what it might be. The most recent one, of course, is the cost of some of the construction there that has been extremely, unusually, inappropriately high. We are asking that there be a strategic plan, that is a national strategic plan also revisited on down to each unit, and that each unit have a strategic plan that complies with the flat plan. That has a measurable goal in it. This is a large business; there needs to be planning for it. 
We are talking about the concessions--the way that the concessions can contribute more financially to the parks. They are a commercial function within the park. We would like to see more private expertise in the management of these kinds of commercial activities within the Park Service. We also would like to have it more competitive so that people who want to get into the business can do that. We deal with the preferential right. In addition to that, of course, in order to invest millions of dollars, there needs to be some proprietary interest protecting that as well. 
These are some of the things we are doing. We are talking about education of the park employees, which I think is an advantage for them. Park employees are some of the most committed people I know of in the Federal Government to their role in the parks. 
We are excited about that, and hope that can be one of the things that this Congress accomplishes as they strengthen in making sure that the parks are going to be there for us in the next century and, therefore, our kids and our grandkids.

Mr. THOMAS. Yes. I thank the Senator very much. 
I simply want to join my friends in opposition to this amendment, for two reasons. One is that the basic facts that we set out here are not valid. More importantly, this is not the place to do that. We have been dealing with things like mining reform, and we ought to do that and we can do that. Unfortunately, to some here it is either their way or the highway, so it never happens. But this is not the place. I rise in opposition to this amendment. 
I thank the Senator.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce S. 1903, a bill to prohibit the return to a foreign country of any portion of a memorial to American veterans without the express authorization of Congress. 
I would not have thought that a bill like this was necessary, Mr. President. It would never have occurred to me that an American President would even briefly consider dismantling part of a memorial to American soldiers who died in the line of duty in order to send a piece of that memorial to a foreign country. But a real possibility of just that happening exists in my state of Wyoming involving what are known as the `Bells of Balangiga.' 
In 1898, the Treaty of Paris brought to a close the Spanish-American War. As part of the treaty, Spain ceded possession of the Philippines to the United States. At about the same time, the Filipino people began an insurrection in their country. In August 1901, as part of the American effort to stem the insurrection, a company of 74 officers and men from the 9th Infantry, Company G, occupied the town of Balangiga on the island of Samar. These men came from Ft. Russell in Cheyenne, Wyoming--today's F.E. Warren Air Force Base. 
On September 28 of that year, taking advantage of the preoccupation of the American troops with a church service for the just-assassinated President McKinley, a group of Filipino insurgents infiltrated the town. Only three American sentries were on duty that day. As described in an article in the November 19, 1997 edition of the Wall Street Journal:  
Officers slept in, and enlisted men didn't bother to carry their riffles as they ambled out of their quarters for breakfast. Balangiga had been a boringly peaceful site since the infantry company arrived a month earlier, according to military accounts and soldiers' statements. The quiet ended abruptly when a 23 year old U.S. sentry named Adolph Gamlin walked past the local police chief. In one swift move, the Filipino grabbed the slightly built Iowan's rifle and smashed the butt across [Gamlin's] head. As PFC Gamlin crumpled, the bells of Balangiga began to peal. 
With the signal, hundreds of Filipino fighters swarmed out of the surrounding forest, armed with clubs, picks and machete-like bolo knives. Others poured out of the church; they had arrived the night before, disguised as women mourners and carrying coffins filled with bolos. A sergeant was beheaded in the mess tent and dumped into a vat of steaming wash water. A young bugler was cut down in a nearby stream. The company commander was hacked to death after jumping out a window. Besieged infantrymen defended themselves with kitchen forks, mess kits and baseball bats. Others threw rocks and cans of beans. 
Though he was also slashed across the back, PFC. 
. . Gamlin came to and found a rifle. By the time he and the other survivors fought their way to the beach, 38 US soldiers were dead and all but six of the remaining men had been wounded. 
The remaining soldiers escaped in five dug-out canoes. Only three boats made it to safety on Leyte. Seven men died of exposure at sea, and another eight died of their wounds; only twenty of the company's seventy-four members survived. 
A detachment of fifty-four volunteers from 9th Infantry units stationed at Leyte returned to Balangiga and recaptured the village. They were reinforced a few days later from Companies K and L of the 11th Infantry Regiment. When the 11th Infantry was relieved on October 18 by Marines, the 9th Infantry took two of the church bells used to signal the attack with them back to Wyoming as a memorial to the fallen soldiers. 
The bells have been displayed in front of the base flagpole on the central parade grounds since that time. The bells were placed in two openings in a large, specially-constructed masonry wall with a bronze plaque dedicating the memorial to the memory of the fallen soldiers. 
Since at least 1981, there have been on-and-off discussions in various circles in Cheyenne, Washington, and Manila about the future of the bells, including the possibility of returning them to the Philippines. Most recently, the Philippine government--having run into broad opposition to their request to have both bells returned to them--has proposed making a copy of both bells, and having both sides keep one copy and one original.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, in the last few months, developments have indicated to me that the White House is seriously contemplating returning one or both of the bells to the Philippines. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the Treaty of Paris, and a state visit by President Fidel Valdes Ramos--his last as President--to the United States has been planned for this month. The disposition of the bells has been high on President Ramos' agenda; he has spoken personally to President Clinton and several members of Congress about it over the last three years, and has indicated he will do so on this visit. Since January, the Filipino press has included almost weekly articles on the bells' supposed return, including one in the Manila Times last week which reported that a new tower to house the bells is being constructed in Borongon, Samar, to receive them in May. 
In addition, inquiries to me from various agencies of the Administration soliciting the opinion of the Wyoming congressional delegation on the issue have increased in frequency. I have also learned that the Defense Department, perhaps in conjunction with the Justice Department, has recently prepared a legal memorandum outlining its opinion of who actually controls the disposition of the bells.

Mr. THOMAS. I will take some time, and I think I will be joined by at least one Member, to talk just a little bit about spending and taxes in general. 
We are coming into a time, of course, this week, and I suspect now for a number of weeks, when the focus of this Congress will be budgets, on appropriations, on spending, as it should be. I want to talk a little bit about at least my perception of some of the broader objectives that go into debate that extends beyond mathematics, that extends beyond the dollars--actually measures these dollars, about how spending really impacts on the philosophy of government, how spending impacts upon the priorities that we have here in the Congress, how spending impacts upon our whole philosophy of whether or not we want to increasingly have a larger Federal Government delving into all activities of our lives, or whether, in fact, there is a limited role for the Federal Government as opposed to State and local governments, and if so, then what does our decision reflecting spending have to do with that. 
It does seem to me that one of the real issues that we have is the extent and the role of the Federal Government's involvement in all the activities in our country. Many would argue, and I argue, that the Constitution clearly defines that there is a limited role for the Federal Government. As a matter of fact, I think it says in the 10th amendment that those things not precisely and clearly described in the Constitution are left to the States and to the people. I take that part of the Constitution very seriously. 
As we talk about problems that arise throughout the country, some of them are appropriate to take care of in the Federal Government, some are not. We find on almost everything we talk about, not always recognized, not always defined, but I think if you look through the things we talk about, it is the basic first decision that probably should be talked about. 
We talk a lot about balancing the budget. We balanced the budget last year for the first time in, what, 25 years. That was when income reached expenditures for the first time in 25 years. That is an excellent start. I think it is something this Congress ought to be particularly proud of. It is an excellent start. 
But you can balance the budget at almost any level if you continue to increase revenues, increase taxes, increase the burden of taxes on the American people. You can increase revenues and spending can go on and still be balanced, and it gets away from the philosophy of having a smaller Federal Government. So the choices that we make and the choices that we take are very often directed by spending. 
I think we find ourselves in an interesting situation, talking about surpluses. First of all, there is no surplus at this point even though there is an expectation of one. So we find ourselves in great debates over spending a surplus that has not yet appeared. Further, almost an indication that if there is a surplus, by gosh, we have to find some way to spend it. Now, that really doesn't necessarily need to be the case. We 
could apply it to the debt. We have a little debt, remember--$5.7 trillion I believe it is--a debt that we could be paying. When we don't, pages like those sitting here before the Senate will be paying for it. We put it on the credit card and the credit card is maxed out. There are places to do something with surpluses besides spending them. 
The Senator from Massachusetts last Friday arose with four or five problems he talked about: We need school repair. Of course we need school repair. We need more teachers. I suspect we need more teachers. Nobody would argue with the idea there ought to be improvements in education. There ought to be more money spent in education, but there is a philosophy and there is a question as to where that money should come from. Schools have basically been under the control of the States and local school districts and local governments. As a matter of fact, out of all the billions of dollars we spend in education, only about 7 percent is contributed by the Federal Government. That is almost all in special education. Each time there is a problem defined, it doesn't automatically mean that the best solution is to take Federal money and spend it, and spend it along with the Federal regulations that inevitably go with it. 
Mr. President, I think as we go through this next several weeks of debates and discussions about budgets and about appropriations some of the first decisions we make ought to be philosophical decisions as to what is the role of the Federal Government, 
what is the role of the Federal Government with regard to the taxes? 
I don't know about the rest of you, but I spent at least part of this lovely weekend doing some things that weren't that much fun, and that was doing my income taxes. I didn't complete it, by the way. I got to that page with 59 questions on capital gains, and I gave up for the weekend. There is some philosophy as to what we do about that, what the level of taxation ought to be, and we ought to be dealing with that. There are lots of things that we are talking about. We are talking about highway funding. A great debate is going on in the House. We have generally completed our debate here. 
We intend to spend more money on highways. Why? Because there is a need, but because there are the Federal taxes where we raise the money for highways. There was quite a large TV story the other night--on ABC, I think--about pork-barrel highway spending. They failed to mention during the whole 10 minutes that the dollars that came from there all came from the taxes you and I pay on a gallon of gas--the Federal tax that is raised for highways. There was no mention of that. I was a little distressed. 
So I would like to think, Mr. President, that as we go forward here, we give some thought to the appropriateness of programs, whether they should be at the Federal level, whether they should be at the State level, and how much government we want at the Federal level and centralized government and the things that ought to be there that are more properly done at the local level, more properly done at the State level. I have a bill that I think is very important which carries out the idea of contracting in the private sector. We have had, almost for 50 years, a policy of taking those activities within Government that are commercial in nature and giving the private sector an opportunity to bid and to contract those. We have not done it. There has been a policy, but it has not been implemented. In doing that, we would keep more activities in the private sector, we would have a smaller centralized Government, and, indeed, save money. 
These are the kinds of philosophical issues that seem to me to be important as we move forward to try to determine what size of Government we think we ought to have and is necessary at the central level--to talk about the level of taxation and the variants of taxation among the American people. These are very important issues. Also, we talk about being responsible, in terms of the $5 trillion debt, and being responsible in terms of balancing the budget, being responsible in terms of having Medicare and Social Security that will continue, which is essentially and fundamentally based on sound economics. These are the things we talk about. I know the politics of it is different. Increasingly, our politics and our governance are driven by the media, by polling. It has almost become a sideshow of political activities rather than really talking about governance, which is what politics is all about. 
Mr. President, I have been joined on the floor by my friend, the Senator from Montana, and I would like to yield to him as much time as he might use to talk some about taxation and some of the areas of taxation that are of concern to him.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, let me close by saying I hope that, as we go into this all-important time of budgets and spending, we really take a long look at how it impacts where we are going in the future and how it impacts the size and composition of Government. I hope it is not just driven by polls. I hope we don't find ourselves trying to get some political advantage by standing up when there is a problem somewhere and declaring that it is the Federal Government's obligation to fix everything by spending Federal money. I hope we don't live by sound bites indicating that these are the political things that people want, but, rather, talk really about how it impacts our future and our kids' future and our debt. I hope we don't contribute to the cynicism of Government by making it show business and sales promotion. 
Politics is the way we govern ourselves. Politics is how we take to our precincts the decisions of what kind of government we are going to have, what our spending matters will be, what our taxes will be, and what our debts will be. I think this administration has perfected the idea of using sales promotion and sound bites. I think polling has become sort of the direction for the White House and for this administration. 
Taking all the issues that people care about--of course they care. Who doesn't care about child care? Who doesn't care about education? Who doesn't care about school buildings? Who doesn't care about insurance for everyone? Social Security? Those are issues that everyone embraces. The question is how do you best deal with it? 
The White House tends to talk about the issue and declare their interest in the issue with no plans to resolve it. It is sort of triangulation. If somebody in the Congress finds some sort of a resolution to it, then the White House claims success. If it fails to happen, then the White House criticizes Congress but never has a plan of its own. I hope we move away from that. I hope we really address the legitimate question. 
There are those who support more government, more Federal Government, a larger Government, and more taxes. It is a belief--and an honest belief, I think sometimes--that that is the best way to govern, that the best way is to take the money from people, bring it here, and then spread it out as they see fit. They believe that. I happen not to share that notion. I happen to share the notion that the better government and the stronger government is closer to the people who are governed; that in fact a smaller central government and a more efficient central government is better and leaves the ability to govern closer to the people. 
Mr. President, I hope those are some of the issues and some of the really basic fundamental things that we include as we talk about budgets and as we talk about spending. 
I thank you for the time. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President. For some time now, we have had what we call a freshman/sophomore focus in which those of us who have come here in the last 2 to 4 years come to the floor to talk about some of the issues that we believe are the pivotal issues before this Congress and the American people, the ones that have the highest priority and are most difficult. We come again this morning to talk largely about the questions and problems associated with Social Security. All of us, of course, are dedicated to continuing to have a strong Social Security program. So that is the focus of our freshman focus this morning. 
I yield to the Senator from Minnesota, Senator Grams, for 10 minutes.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota, who has worked very hard in the area of deficit reduction and strengthening Social Security. And I know he continues to feel strongly about it. 
One of the interesting things--and I suppose it is true of any institution, and it seems more particularly true of government--is the difficulty in making changes. I doubt that there is anyone who is knowledgeable at all about Social Security who wouldn't agree that there needs to be some changes made; who wouldn't agree that if we do not make changes, the results will not be what we want, and, conversely, if we expect some different results, we have to do some things differently. But it is very difficult to do. So I think it is important for us to continue to talk about it, continue to stress it, and continue to point it out. 
Social Security is a major component of senior citizens' income. Thirty-seven and one-half million senior citizens depend at least partially--and many times totally--on Social Security payments. In many cases, it is the only source of retirement income. That is unfortunate, of course, because it isn't designed to be a retirement program, it is designed to be a supplemental program. 
So there is something to the idea that we need to deal with taxes and Social Security simultaneously so that we encourage people to save on their own and have opportunities to do that through IRAs, or whatever technique, and at the same time strengthen Social Security, because they do, in fact, go together. All of us, I think, on the other hand, recognize that the system as it is now set up is not simultaneous. In 8 years, the system will begin to feel the pinch of retirement and the baby boomers, and this idea of having a surplus will begin to go away, and by the year 2012 it is expected that we will be running a deficit in terms of revenues. 
What does this mean? It means, of course, that the Government will not be able to pay the benefits that are due without making some other kinds of changes. 
There is some talk about taking the money and spending it for something else, which, of course, is true. But the fact is that under this system, the surpluses can only be invested in Government securities. And, therefore, when the Government needs to borrow money, for whatever the reason, it borrows from somewhere, and if it didn't borrow from Social Security, it would borrow from us as individuals. But the problem is, when we take $100 billion a year out of Social Security and put it into debt, then, of course, when the time comes for that debt to have to be repaid, we have to do something quite different than what we have been doing in the past. 
It seems to me that the real clincher is, it is pretty clear that the longer we wait, the more difficult it will be and the more severe the changes will have to be. If we can make those changes as soon as possible, they can be more incremental and, hopefully, less painful. And change always has a certain amount of pain. 
During the State of the Union message, of course, the President brought up this notion of Social Security, and, of course, he said, `Social Security first,' which is good. And I think it is fine that this thing was brought up there. I think it is fine that the White House has committed itself to this being the issue. The unfortunate part of it is, I think, that primarily a political statement is one that people like to hear --`Social Security first.' But, unfortunately, the President does not have a plan to do anything about it. 
Someone--I think Kevin Kearns from the Council of Government Reform--indicated that it is a little like the captain of the Titanic who saw the distress signals from the Titanic but didn't do anything about it. That is kind of where we are. 
So it is a responsibility and an opportunity for the Congress, I think, to step up to the plate and to do something about changing the way that we fund this program. There are some very hard questions to be answered. Let me just share a couple of the things that are talked about--certainly the surpluses, as I mentioned; and Social Security will be about $105 billion in 1999. So the $10 billion surplus that is applied there is a relatively ineffective remedy in that it doesn't really amount to very much compared to the kind of lending that is taken. 
First, there are several ways to make changes. The idea of putting some of these funds into an investment that grows and compounds has a number of advantages. One is, we would remove the excess payroll taxes from the unified budget. In other words, if we sent 2 percent over into this investment program, those would not be available as trust funds to be loaned to the 
Government as expenditures. That would be a plus. The second is, the amount that was invested would almost surely return a higher return than maybe Government securities. Whether the market goes up or down, it also moves that way, and the private sector also, at least from the point of view of some. If we set aside a portion of this to be dedicated to our retirement funds, it would be a fund that would become an asset and, if not exhausted by the user, would be a part of transfer to heirs. That again may or may not be the case, but that is one of the arguments that we hear. 
The Washington Post, on the other hand, interestingly enough, some time ago said there are only three possible answers: Tax increases, spending cuts, or borrowing from the public. I don't believe the analyses of the answers are complete. Some of the answers are different kinds of investments, different kinds of returns, and perhaps something about age. So the idea of simply more taxes, I think, is not the answer. 
The fact is that taxes, as my friend from Minnesota indicated, have been raised, I think, some 63 times over the course of Social Security. The 15.3-percent tax rate we now have is the most burdensome tax, after all, to most taxpayers. Seventy-two percent of all Americans pay no more than 15 percent in income tax. This means that this payroll tax is the largest tax, as a percentage to Americans, that Americans pay. 
If, in fact, we don't do something, the National Center for Policy Analysis says the rising cost of Social Security and Medicare will raise the payroll taxes 53 percent by the time today's college students are ready to retire. Obviously, that is an unacceptable alternative. 
Some talk about age differentials. In 1940, the labor force participation rate for men 65 years of age was 70 percent. Seventy percent of men 65 years of age were in the work force. Today, 33 percent are in the work force. So, obviously, we have less input and more outgo in this program. 
So there are a number of things, all of which will be kind of new, all of which, I suppose, will be difficult. But, unfortunately, it is difficult to make change. The Social Security Program is not treated like a pension. Our contributions don't go into assets like stocks and bonds or mutual funds that increase in value over time, as we know. In the 1950s, there were 16 workers for every retiree, and Social Security taxes could be low and the benefits relatively high. Because of the number now, there are approximately three workers per retiree. This decline, as I mentioned, has resulted in 63 tax increases over this period of time. 
So I think the evidence that we have a problem is clearly there. Now the question is, What are we willing to do about it? One of the suggestions, of course--and I think is a good one--is to put you and me as workers in charge of some of our own funds, not simply to raise taxes but rather to make Social Security financially sound. The program was originally financed on the 6-percent payroll tax. Today, of course, the tax rate is 12.4, plus Medicare, which makes it 15 percent. In order to keep this, as I mentioned, solvent, payroll taxes will need to be 18 percent by 2020 and 50 percent by 2075. 
What are some of the ideas? Of course, to allow workers to divert a portion of their current payroll taxes to personal investment accounts; investing these funds into private securities; providing some ownership for this portion of that fee that goes there; and investing, of course, in private securities. I think it is important, on the other hand, that we continue to ensure that everyone is involved, that everyone makes some effort to prepare for their own retirement. And Social Security needs to be a concept that we continue to have. 
So both of these options--of diverting it into a personal account, investing the budget surplus funds that we might have now into private securities, as opposed to the way we do it in Government securities--are an alternative, and both of these can go hand in hand. I think it is fair to say that the investment of the current surplus into private securities will not, in fact, solve the problem but will move us forward. But can you imagine young people, such as the young people who are here today as pages and as interns, when they come into the work force and are able to invest immediately 2 percent of that fund? Over a period of time, it will amount to a great deal of money. 
So that is kind of where we are, Mr. President. We have a problem. We have some difficulties, of course. One of them that we are talking about this morning in another context is the unified budget. There is a great debate over the unified budget. As you know, all of the money that comes to the Federal Government goes into the unified budget, even though it may be in a trust fund, such as Social Security, such as a highway fund. Some say we ought to take those out of the unified budget and let the Social Security be off budget and let the highway fund be off budget. I suppose you have to say let the airport fund be off budget, and about 50 others be off budget. We would end up a bit like my State legislature, which I think has control of about 30 percent of the funds that come to the State, and all of it is earmarked for certain things. 
I understand there is merit in that. I don't favor that, however. But that is one of the debates that goes on. The other one, of course, is as we spend more than we take in, we borrow from someone. And obviously, since the law requires that Social Security has to be invested in Government securities, you borrow there. You borrow there first, which makes a pretty good deal for the rest of the programs, if you are going to spend more than you take in. But it is not a good deal for those people who have their money set aside in the trust fund such as Social Security. 
So we have, I think, a great deal to do. We have some hard topics to undertake. One of them is age. Obviously, we live longer than we did before. I already mentioned the work force at 65. We are moving towards the 67 age limit rather than 65. But I believe it is 2020 before we reach that level of gradually moving up 1 month a year. 
So that needs to be reviewed. It is very difficult. It is true that things need to be done prospectively so that people who have paid in based on one set of circumstances are not affected, particularly during their time of benefits, but that those who come into the program more recently may come in under a different set of circumstances. So if ever there was a program, it seems to me, where you really have to decide, is this something we want to go on in the future, is this something you begin at age 22 to pay into to expect to enjoy the benefits, it is Social Security. 
Polls have indicated that people in the 20 to 30 age bracket do not expect to have any benefits come to them. I think that is unfortunate. I think we have a responsibility to see that they do, so that it is not strictly a pay-go, that they are paying in for someone else with no hope of benefits. I think it can be done. I really think it can be done, and I think it can be done with relatively modest changes if we will move quickly to make those changes. The longer we wait, the more severe those changes will have to be and the more difficult they will be to obtain. 
Mr. President, I think we are going to be joined in a moment by another one of our colleagues. In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from Georgia for the opportunity to make a few comments, but more particularly for the efforts that he has put forth and the leadership that he has given in producing this bill to strengthen American education. 
I say again, as has been said before, that we must remember what the purpose of this vote is, what the purpose of this effort is, and that is to get it on the floor. This, of course, will never be resolved until we come to some agreement as to how to get it on the floor and to in fact consider it along with other kinds of issues. 
Everyone is for strengthening education. I don't know of anyone who would get up and say, `No, I certainly don't want to do that.' Of course not. All of us want to do it. The question then is, How do we best do it? How do we really approach the idea of strengthening education and preserving those things that we think are fundamental to education in this country? One of the real questions, of course, is the degree and the extent of direct Federal involvement. 
I was interested in the charts of the Senator from Tennessee this morning that showed all of the different kinds of approaches that have been taken at the Federal level--literally hundreds of programs that we have now, which still only represent less than 7 percent of the total expenditures in elementary and secondary education. Can you imagine the amount of bureaucracy? Can you imagine the amount of expense prior to that money getting to the ground? 
So what we are really talking about here is a system to provide the opportunity for families to be able to put together some money to use as they choose and strengthen the local government. 
The President, of course, has outlined the education issue largely because it is an issue that everyone cares about--I have to say largely because it is such a high winner in the polls. So the President, along with the environment and other things, continues to mention education but really doesn't have a plan for it. I guess that is part of the system: You talk about education, sit back, and somebody else puts it together. And then, of course, you claim victory because you have done something for education. That is OK. We have seen that before. 
The point is, How do we best strengthen education for all Americans? How do we get better results? That is really what the bottom line is about here. How do we maintain local control? Those are the issues. How do we get more results for the expenditures that we put out? I am persuaded that the approach taken by the Senator from Georgia--the idea of keeping it at the local level, the idea of letting people be responsible for saving and investing as they choose--is the real way to do it. 
The Senator from Massachusetts, of course, represents the legitimate point of view that bigger government ought to have enormous direct expenditures and, therefore, the controls that go with it in education. I think that is not the case. 
Basic changes: I get a lot of input into elementary education, and secondary. My wife happens to be a high school teacher. One of the things that is troublesome is the amount of time she spends on paperwork. She is a special education teacher, and she spends half the time on paperwork. We need to try to eliminate some of that. We need to offer discipline; we need to raise expectations so that children are really expected to do more; we need to have more accountability in terms of production--much of this through management. Of course, we need to provide more resources. 
So, let me say to the Senator that I appreciate very much and admire what he is doing and certainly hope we can get this bill on the floor. And we should immediately. 
I thank the Senator.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I simply want to rise to join in the congratulation of the leadership of this bill. It has been a pleasure for me to serve on this committee and on this subcommittee, and to see us coming finally to closure on a bill that I suspect is one of the most important that we will deal with in the next several years. It is certainly one of the most contentious, because it is one in which each of us seeks to satisfy our own needs, one in which we finally have to come to some accommodation for the different kinds of needs we have, and certainly no one is ever going to be perfectly satisfied. But I think we have come to a very successful conclusion in this bill. 
I hope that we can maintain basically the formulas that we struck. Obviously, the total spending is one of the issues. Obviously, the formula for distribution is one of the issues. Each of us have differences. Some of us have lots of miles and not many people; some of us have lots of public lands, and so on. So it is most difficult. 
I simply want to congratulate the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member, as well as the chairman and ranking member of the committee, and urge that we get on with it. Our States are waiting to be assured of the funds they will have, particularly in our northern States where the contracting season and the construction season is relatively short. 
All of us have properly given some credit to our staff. Each of us had a staff person. I had a young man named Chris Jahn, who did an excellent job not only working with the committee but with our State transportation department, and I am proud of what he did. 
So, Mr. President, I certainly add my congratulations and urge that we get this bill out of the Congress to the President as soon as we possibly can. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
I rise to thank the chairman for his cooperation in moving towards a solution to a problem that I think has real meaning. I have been involved in this highway transportation bill for some time, being a member of the subcommittee. So we are down now, I think, to coming to closure. I am so pleased with that. 
So I thank the chairman for his cooperation and his willingness to work on it. Certainly, I thank my friend from South Dakota for working on this as well. I think it points out the diversity of this country. We do have different needs in different places, and it is very difficult sometimes to find the formula, the Federal formula, that treats fairly all of the States that are involved.

 Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today I rise to recognize Tony Malmberg, who manages the Three Quarter Circle Ranch near Lander, Wyoming. Mr. Malmberg was recognized recently for his superior stewardship practices that demonstrate a healthy environment, such as cleaner water and thriving fauna and flora, go hand in hand with successful ranching. 
Tony Malmberg's Three Quarter Circle Ranch is the national winner of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association Environmental Stewardship Award for using innovative practices to protect and enhance natural resources, while increasing the profits of the business. With its over 900 cow/calf pairs and 1,000 yearlings, rotational grazing practices and success in showing profits while safeguarding natural resources such as land and water, Three Quarter Circle Ranch was the clear winner. 
Unique in his accomplishments, Mr. Malmberg developed a partnership with schools to provide an educational site where students can learn about wildlife and habitats, streams, vegetation, geology and archaeology, birds and riparian areas. In addition, his ranch was one of the first ranches in the west to develop a ranch/recreation program where guests are able to participate in ranch activities, including livestock herding. 
This award should come as no surprise to those who know him. The land is his most important resource and it gives him clear signals when his approaches work and do not work. Therefore, he makes many of his management decisions based on the rhythms of nature. For example, using more tolerant species of plants in meadows to decrease demand for water, reduce irrigation, and enhance stream flows and riparian conditions. Also he adjusts the timing of grazing in riparian areas to encourage beavers to build dams and changing grazing rotations each year to accommodate species diversity. 
Mule dear, pronghorn antelope and elk live on the Three Quarter Circle Ranch during the winter. A pond on the ranch is stocked with fish, and nesting structures were added to attract geese. 
Obviously Tony Malmberg feels strongly about his role as a steward of natural resources because it not only affects his bottom line, but it helps him demonstrate how ranching benefits other species and the general public. 
Three Quarter Circle Ranch was selected by a committee of representatives of the Environmental Protection Agency, USDA's Soil Conservation Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Nature Conservancy, American Farmland Trust, American Sportfishing Association, Texas Tech University, Texas A&M Research and Extension Center, South Utah University and NCBA. 
I commend Tony Malmberg for this award and for what he has accomplished on his ranch in Lander. He represents the best of the industry and the very best of working people in the West.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor, along with the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Johnson, to talk about something that we think is very important--transportation, which, of course, is what we are into now. We are talking about ISTEA. As you know, much of the Federal tax that goes into the transportation arrangement goes for highways, but a good deal also goes for mass transit transportation. That is what we will be entering into soon. 
Historically, the distribution of funds under the Federal transit program has been focused on just a few States. As a matter of fact, eight States receive about 60 percent of the program funds. At the same time, of course, there is an emerging growth and need in rural areas for services to the poor, services to the elderly, and services to the disabled. So we have prepared and have introduced and will talk about, as we go forward, the Transit Modernization Act, which will tend to make some modifications in the distribution of these transit funds which, by the way, have not been significantly modified since 1982. It will make a relatively small change, but you will see as we talk about our States that a relatively small change will make a terrific impact on those States that have not, basically, been the ones receiving the money. At the same time, those that have the greatest needs in transit will still be substantial recipients of these funds. 
We have agreed, I think, to an additional $5 billion that will go into these areas of mass transit over the next 5 years. The good news, of course, is to ensure that all of the country benefits, not just a few in favored States, and that all will receive some kind of a meaningful share of increases to respond to what, as in almost all instances, has been a long, unmet need of public transportation. 
Even in my State with relatively small towns, we still have the elderly who need transportation, and we have the disabled who need transportation. So we have needs as well. Wyoming receives about $1 million to $2 million annually out of the transit funding. Out of the total funding, frankly, that rounds out to zero; $1 million out of $5 billion does not even show up on the board. We get back about 11 or 12 cents for every dollar that is contributed to this fund from Wyoming people who buy and pay the Federal gas tax; 11 to 12 cents is returned to Wyoming. Unfortunately, that, as you might imagine, falls substantially below our needs and does not fill our needs. 
Wyoming transit offers more than 1.2 million rides per year, and it costs them from $1 million to $2 million annually to provide services. Our needs for the elderly and the disabled, the buses, the van pools, and replacements total over $12 million annually. 
Further, we have had in Wyoming--and we are proud of it--one of the most successful activities of moving people off welfare into jobs. So our demands for public transit are growing. 
The problem with the current transit program is not limited to the rural West. It also includes States like Michigan, North Carolina, Indiana, Mississippi and Kentucky. All have transit needs that are not being met. Currently, eight States receive 60 percent of the total funding, despite the growth of needs in rural areas. The transit program has not been updated since 1982. The program has not changed much, but the country and the needs of the country have. Growth areas, rural areas, and small communities are beginning to more and more have a need for public transit. Under the supposedly need-based system, these needs have not been met. 
As I said earlier, an agreement has been reached to increase transit funding by $5 billion over the next 5 years. That is good. These funds are paid in for that purpose. We will offset this, and this offset will be there for our amendment. Therefore, each State will benefit meaningfully from this. Instead of receiving 11 percent of what we pay in, hopefully we will receive some more. 
We want to do this as a result of the opportunity created by the hard work of Senators D'Amato and Sarbanes, the chairman and ranking member of the Banking Committee. In this system, it is my belief that everybody wins. 
There are several amendments that have been filed, of course, that would change it. Some affect new starts; some would provide 80 or 90 percent allocation. Another way to achieve it is what we think is a modest amendment that Senator Johnson and I have drafted. 
It will help States meet their transit challenges, but it will be a fair distribution. It will create a minimum guarantee that will increase each State's share of the transit program up to 70 percent of the State's contribution or a maximum of $12 million a year. 
Under this amendment, the vast majority of America's cities and small communities will receive more transit funds, and they will go on, of course, for years as they seek to reach that 70 percent level. It is important to note that this equitable distribution will be accomplished without substantially harming those systems currently receiving the bulk of the money. 
All States which are currently substantial donees under the program will remain substantial donees. And 93 percent of the funding will continue to be distributed under the current formula. So we are talking about a redistribution of less than 7 percent of the additional funds that come there. 
I hope we are able to take advantage of the growth in transit funding to allow all States to share in the Transit Modernization Act, as it is a protransit amendment, by allowing all States to benefit, creating stronger support for the program, and will benefit 30 to 35 States annually, including all the cities and small communities in those States. 
It will establish equity in the transit system by utilizing the growth of the transit funding. However, all States that are currently substantial donees will remain substantial donees. And that is not the case under any of the other amendments. So we believe this is a fair distribution. We believe it is one that recognizes needs. It is one that continues to support the needs of the donee States. 
Mr. President, I yield to my friend from South Dakota for his comments with respect to this joint amendment.  
Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.

Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the chairman for the time. 
Mr. President, we are here again talking about an issue that seems to come up every time there are highway bills and highway funds to be distributed. We always come up with this question of process, of who has the responsibility to make the kinds of laws that would be there. 
I am disappointed that some of the speakers just previous have indicated they don't think the States have the ability to make the decisions, that they don't think the State legislatures feel as passionately about drunken driving as we do. I think they do. I have been there. To say, `Well, this is something the States simply can't do, or aren't capable of doing, or don't care about,' it seems to me is not fair or balanced. 
I think we ought to talk about the process here. And the process is, how do we best deal with States as a Federal entity, in this case, with highway funding? This isn't the first kind of mandate that has been applied. Every time this comes up we have mandates, whether it be highways, helmets, whether it be speed limits--which, by the way, were put on in a similar kind of process and were changed later because it didn't work very well. 
There is no one in this place or no one that I know of in the whole country who doesn't want to do more about preserving safety in driving. 
There is no one here who cares more about the losses that we have. That is not the issue here. The issue is process, procedure, and what is the proper role in doing it. I think we ought to consider incentives, and we have done that; $25 million of incentives here for the States to do this. But instead we move towards penalties. 
We have been through this a number of times, and we are back at it again. I think we ought to give the leadership. And the President wants to give leadership on this issue. Why doesn't he do that as President? We can do that. If this is the proper level, and I do not disagree with it, I would support it in my State, my State legislature. But the process is what we are talking about. Should this body say to the States, `Look, if you want the money that your people pay into the fund, if you want it back, then you have to do what the Congress prescribes"? It is not as if the money came from somewhere else. This money came from the States. 
So it is a difficult one and I, frankly, have misgivings about even rising to talk about it, but I do think the system is important. The process is important here, and we ought to really consider it over a period of time, as to how much of this sort of thing we do. We do it each time this arises. 
So I think we ought to put on all the pressure that we can. I think we ought to have all the incentives that are possible to move towards safer driving, to move toward doing something about drunk driving losses. But I think we also ought to ask ourselves about where do we stop in this idea of penalizing the States if they do not properly adhere to what this body proclaims they ought to do. 
So I appreciate very much the opportunity for us to debate this. I am, of course, a great supporter of this bill, and hope we can move forward with it. I, frankly, hope we can do it without encumbering it with mandates of any kind. I thought we were going to be able to do that this year. The fact is the committee, I think it is fair to say, probably wasn't in support of doing it and therefore it did not come out of the committee that way. But now, of course, we are continuing to work on it. So I hope we can find additional ways, other ways, incentives to move towards .08. I have no objection to that. On the contrary, I support it. 
On the other hand, I do think it is necessary for us, over time, to take a strong look at the kinds of processes and procedures that we impose on the States. I am sorry I cannot make as light of States rights as has been made on the floor this morning, as if it does not pertain. It does, in fact, pertain. And we have different kinds of conditions. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the time, I thank the chairman for his time, and I look forward to the debate.

Mr. THOMAS. Thank you very much. 
Madam President, I want to say--which has already been said a number of times--how pleased I am that we are moving forward on this important legislation. I am a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and we worked very hard last year to bring this to the Senate. Of course, as you know, we found some problems, particularly with the House version, and ended up with a temporary bill. That temporary bill expires the first of May, and all of us, I think, are aware of how important it is for us to get on into the permanent reauthorization of this bill so that our various State highway commissions can go forward with their plans. 
The current ISTEA law has certainly, over the years, made some important changes in our whole transportation program, our transportation policies. It has changed things a great deal. We have come up with a national system of Federal highways. We have found a way to protect this system and to cause it to be effective. But as we move into the 21st century, we need, of course, to update this law as it was passed to make it more flexible, to make it such that the States can deal with the unique issues that they have. 
I am from Wyoming where we have probably more miles and fewer people, more miles per person than, I suspect, most any other State in the Union. So our needs are quite different than they are in California, than they are in New York or Rhode Island. And this ISTEA bill tends to recognize that with more flexibility and more efficiency by reducing some of the regulations that go with it, by putting programs together and helping us to meet the challenges that are before us. It is not perfect, of course. 
I believe ISTEA II achieves this goal of efficiency and flexibility, and creates `new rules of the road' that serve the national interest and will help us to build the highways--I hate to be repetitive--and bridges of the 21st century. I heard that somewhere before. 
At any rate, my State, as is the case with all other States, has road needs. And our roads are in a condition such that they need a good deal of repair, a good deal of maintenance. 
Again, Wyoming is unique. Wyoming taxpayers contribute more to the highway trust fund per person than any other State in the country because we drive more--nearly $200 per person in Federal gas taxes. And yet we have a deteriorating bridge and road system. According to the best figures I get from our highway department, 44 percent of our roads and bridges are in a deteriorating condition, in a fair to poor condition. So we have a great deal to do. 
These shortfalls, of course, in the roads of Wyoming, as in other States' roads, are a detriment to all taxpayers. If we are to have a national system, then, of course, you have to cross all the States to get there. 
A set of efficient and well-maintained roads is important to the cities that export goods around the country, as they are to us in Wyoming. This bill, of course, and all of the activities and dollars that go with it are a very direct contribution to the Nation's economy. These dollars move out quickly. These dollars move to fill the needs of people throughout the country, provide jobs, and are very efficiently used in a very quick fashion. So ISTEA II will help the flow of goods and services in our country. 
We worked very hard. I want to salute the chairman of the committee, Senator Chafee, who worked so hard to find, along with others, a fair solution. This is a difficult issue. Through the years, as everyone knows now, we have taken in more money from Federal highway taxes than we have spent. We kept it in the trust fund, at least partially, to help balance the budget. 
We have a unified budget, so if you spend the money, even if it is in the trust fund, you spend the money in the highway fund, then you have to reduce the spending somewhere else in order to stay within the spending caps. That is not easy. So the first discussion we have had--it has been a very difficult one--is how much of that money do you spend without impeding on the other spending? 
The second difficult one, of course, is that of the formula in which there is distribution. There is always great controversy about the formula. There are States that pay in more than they, frankly, get back. There are States that get more than they pay in. There are those who believe all the dollars should go to highways. 
There are others who believe part of the money--this is, after all, a surface transportation bill--some of the dollars ought to go for public transportation, some ought to go for Amtrak, some ought to go for bicycle trails, and those kinds of things. So I suspect, of all the bills that we deal with, No. 1, everyone wants to pass it, everyone knows that it needs to go forward. But there are so many different kinds of interests that are represented here--and legitimate, all legitimate. 
So finding a fair funding formula, based on the national interests, is most difficult. I admire very much what the leadership of this committee has done. And it is there to emphasize a National Highway System. I think that is key--a National Highway System. 
Let me talk just a minute about an issue that I guess I would have to admit is particularly important to me, but I think to others as well. I happen to be chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks. We find ourselves with national parks that are being loved to death. More and more people like to go to parks, but at the same time we find ourselves $5 billion to $8 billion in arrears in infrastructure. Nearly $2 billion of that backlog is in highways. 
And, of course, parks only have one source of revenue, really, for the maintenance of their highways, and that is 
Federal taxes. Counties do not come in to Federal parks and build roads as they do in some other public lands. The State does not contribute to the highways inside of parks. So we have found that a high percentage of existing park roads and bridges are in poor condition. And therefore, we need to do something about it. 
In my State of Wyoming, Yellowstone National Park alone is $250 million behind for the care of highways. It is very difficult. First of all, they are built in difficult places. Their season is rather short to reconstruct. So it is hard to keep highways moving. 
We are very pleased that in this particular bill we make a step forward--we make a step forward--and have moved up from about $70 million a year, which has been traditional, to about $180 million. So it makes a great deal of difference. And then the Park Service will decide where those allocations are made. 
The same is true of other Federal lands. Wyoming is 50 percent Federal lands. Some States are much higher. Nevada, for example--86 percent of that State is owned by the Federal Government. So you have BLM lands. You have forest lands. You have refuge lands. All of these are lands that we look forward to helping through this program. And they will receive a small, relatively small increase, relatively small in terms of the problem, but a sizable increase. 
Senators Chafee and Warner and Baucus have been working with us on this issue. I feel confident that these park needs will very much be accommodated. I thank the Senators for their willingness to do that.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, there are many issues in the Congress that divide us. We come from different areas. We come from different philosophies. Today I come to the floor with a bill that is an opportunity to come together collectively, introducing a bill on one of the uniquely American priorities that does, in fact, bind us together--our national parks. 
If you have felt the Earth shake and experienced the thunder of Old Faithful in Yellowstone or contemplated the patriotic enigma at Gettysburg, you can well understand my passion for support of these areas so important to our national identity. The value of national parks is clearly one of the cultural constants for Americans. As the chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, I can tell you each and every Senator needs to look at the perilous state of the parks today and act with me in developing some long-term solutions. 
The bill I introduce today, Vision 2020, the National Parks Restoration Act, is a result of a quite lengthy process of inquiry and of study. Over the last year, the subcommittee has had more than 15 park-related hearings. We have spoken to dozens of park experts--environmental groups and user groups. We have listened to the suggestions as well as the criticisms from our colleagues and have attracted activity in the House. Our purpose is and was to carefully review the state of national parks and to evaluate areas for improvement within the agencies. 
We have found that there is a system of parks tremendously popular with the public but afflicted by problems that the public sometimes only vaguely recognizes. Let me share some of the findings. Our system of national parks stands at 376 units, including over 83 million acres of the most treasured landscapes and historical sites of our national possessions. The National Park Service is charged by law with a distinctly unique mission--to protect its natural and cultural resources unimpaired for the enjoyment of current and future generations. It is a charge and responsibility that is hard to handle in the best of times. In times of fiscal constraint, that mandate requires a broad range of innovative approaches to get that job done. Each year, over 250 million recreational users enjoy our parks. Our hearings revealed that each year 12 million visitors are from foreign lands, with their visitations contributing significantly, of course, to America's $22 billion international travel trade surplus. This explosive popularity directly stimulates over $10 billion in annual economies locally and supports 230,000 tourism-related jobs. 
However, the parks face many problems. One of the most pressing problems facing the agency is the `thinning of the blood,' explained in one of our hearings by previous Park Service Director Jim Ridenour. At the same time, new parks have been added to the system without appropriations to care for them. The agency has been saddled with new responsibilities at the same time the resources have not been available for the parks already there. Collectively, the shortfall between where the Park Service is and where it should be in terms of maintenance, construction, staffing and resource protection is approximately $5 to $8 billion in arrears. Another problem is the wear and tear on roads, bridges, campgrounds and other facilities, leaving critics to observe that the parks have been `loved to death.' 
As visiting populations grow, facilities that were often built decades ago cannot stand the strain. It has become clear through our oversight process that park managers are hobbled in their ability to assess the inventory of natural and cultural resources, probably one of the primary functions of the park and the park management. The funding and cooperative cost sharing have simply not existed to catalog the resources that the parks must protect. At a time when we need the best from the Park Service managers, rangers, maintenance, scientific and administrative staff, we find there is less to offer them in terms of professional development. 
Probably as serious as any of these conditions is the problem of the public apathy. Don't get me wrong, the Americans truly like their parks. They love their parks. But as of yet, that has not really translated into a definitive call for action from the Congress or the administration. 
In my local park of Yellowstone, there has been some increase in appropriations each year, but the required changes in terms of retirement, in terms of staffing and in terms of inflation have been more than eaten up in the increase in the appropriations to where the expendable income has, in fact, gone down. 
Probably as serious as any of these conditions, as I said, is public apathy. I can tell you, the day is coming when we will have increasing problems, and I hope that we will be ahead of that game. I propose we mobilize ourselves to address these problems before we are in a crisis and have to close parks and take more costly measures. 
I continue to say if we are to have these resources in the future for our kids and our future generations, then we are going to have to do something soon, the sooner the better, in terms of coming to a solution. If we continue to do what we have been doing, we can't expect better results in the future. 
So Vision 2020 provides a broad, systematic approach to addressing the needs of the National Park Service. The restoration bill takes a broad approach, with 11 titles covering key areas of concern. Vision 2020 will enhance resource protection by extending the fee base that goes directly to park programs. This will be accomplished by expanding, extending and dedicating to the park increased demonstration projects fees that were approved last year and that have been in effect 1 year. We want to put them in all the parks where it is practical and lawful to collect those fees. We now have them in about 100 parks out of 376 that can be expanded. 
We need to harness the enthusiasm of voluntarism, and also philanthropic donations. Voluntarism is alive and well in many parks. At Golden Gate Recreation Area, 8,400 residents of the Bay Area donate time each year to support the park in a variety of ways--volunteer time and philanthropic donations can be improved by orders of magnitude to add to the solvency and expertise and the work power of parks. We need to tap the power of individual donors for local causes. 
At our hearing in Denver, I learned the charitable contributions are most successfully subscribed from individual donors on a local basis, those that visit or those that live, or those who are familiar with the park that is closest to them, where they can help monitor the direct results. As a result, we also ask the National Park Foundation to develop a formal program of orientation, strengthening, guidance, and ongoing assistance for park locales interested in developing friends and groups that are interested in supporting their local park. There are many in almost every park. We were in Gettysburg last week. Gettysburg has several groups supportive of their own park. 
We need to find ways to enhance the contribution of concessionaires. Park funding levels will be directly enhanced by asking the concessionaire to help to shoulder a more realistic portion of the park's expenses through a fee structure that closely tracks their earnings in particular parks. At present, fee schedules vary widely. Face it, people do travel in parks. They do require lodging, meals and facilities. Remember the purpose of the park? To preserve the resource and provide a pleasant and quality visit. That is what these concessions do. Many concessionaires operate in an almost noncompetitive market where the business is virtually assured. We are striving for a fee system that maximizes revenues for these businesses privileged to operate in parks--of course, recognizing the need for them to make a profit in order to be there. 
We need to improve park concession management performance. In fairness to concessionaires and park visitors who rely on their services, a dramatic change is proposed in the way concessions are managed by the Park Service in this legislation. We think the parks should utilize more of the private sector expertise in these activities that are totally commercial in nature and we would utilize a private industry asset manager to support many aspects of developing, bidding, developing prospectus and rewarding management of commercial contracts. An advisory board, made up of the agency and industry experts, would guide the director. This would be a board of three agency people, three private sector people, chaired by the Secretary of the Interior, controlled, obviously, by the agencies, to ensure that whatever is done in the commercial sector does not, in fact, damage the resource protection purpose of the park. 
In addition to that, we are going to ask that our Hollywood friends share some in the cost of maintaining parks. Hollywood will be asked to do their part through a provision that ties filming fees to a small percentage of the commercial production costs. You would be surprised how many movies are made in parks. We think that is fine, but there ought to be some contribution. We are not asking much from Hollywood, but the American public expects some return for the use of those public facilities. 
We are developing a Passport to Adventure to garner members. A park `passport system' would be created featuring annually issued collectible stamps similar to the successful duck stamp series, raising revenues which would encourage people to contribute something to their park; 
or perhaps a tax refund contribution. We thought we would make it easy for people to make a contribution, a unique opportunity for American taxpayers who want to not only talk the talk but will, as a result, have an option of dedicating part of their tax refund to the National Park Resource Protection programs by simply checking it off on their tax form. 
Promoting agency professionalism. One title of the bill concentrates on the strategy for developing more expertise among National Park Service employees. By the way, let me say that my experience personally with parks over the last year or two leads me to believe or feel that there is a great deal of loyalty among park agency employees. I don't know of an agency in the Federal Government where people are more committed or more loyal to what they do than the employees of the Park Service. Of course, to be able to do that, they do need the additional ability to have training as well as defining a system of recruitment. Future park superintendents and senior managers need to have an opportunity to become as professional as possible. 
We are interested in making sure that science is there as a foundation for the management of these resources. Vision 2020 directs support for the science necessary to guide that important work by making some shifts in the program. 
The Park Police are important. I guess I didn't realize myself until recently what a significant contribution the Park Police make, particularly here in Washington where there are over 400 Park Police to take care of the parkways, the parks, the rivers, and all of the things here, as well as in New York City. This aspect of the Park Service has often been overlooked. We are asking that there be some studies to assure that they have the resources to do the kinds of things that they are obliged to do. 
Finally, we are going to talk about an innovative area of park resources. Almost all of the large parks have the same kinds of things that small towns have. They have sewers, streets, buildings, all of which are very difficult to maintain on an annual budget. So we are going to seek to put into play, at least as a demonstration program, a bonding program where large parks like Yosemite could have an opportunity to issue bonds of $10 million--and, in fact, that will be the limit for any park--to do some kind of facility restructuring that can't come out of annual budgets, direct a stream of repayment revenue from the demonstration project so that maybe over 5 or 10 years those bonds would be retired--similar to what almost every government agency does in the whole world when they have facilities to build. 
This won't be easy. It is not customary for the Federal Government to have bonding programs. It's also, frankly, sometimes uncustomary for the Government to do anything they haven't been doing for a hundred years. So there will be some difficulty in causing that to happen. But we think it's important, and we think it will be useful. 
Basically, what we are seeking to do, Mr. President, is to recognize how important parks are, to recognize the difficulty parks have had, and are continuing to have, in maintaining those resources, to deal with some opportunities to supplement the taxpayers' appropriation support for parks by having some outside methods of raising funds that can be used in the parks. 
With those additional funds will go some requirements for additional and strengthened management, so that there is accountability for how those dollars are spent. There will be a vision plan over a period of time for the agency, with vision plans coming from each park, with measurable results in the plan. The GAO, the Government auditing office, says often we have plans and we even have appropriations where the plan is not implemented and we want to cause that to happen. And then, in addition to that, of course, we want to help strengthen the management through professionalism and do some things, such as bonding. 
So, in conclusion, I want to ask you to consider for a moment an America without national parks. How would we feel without Yosemite, Independence Hall, or Grand Canyon protected for public enjoyment? How much of our national identity is reflected in these icons--the Statue of Liberty, Yellowstone, the National Capital Mall, or Old Faithful? How much of the rugged, adventurous American spirit is still revisited by hiking the back country of Glacier or mountaineering in Alaska's Denali? What would America be without protecting habitat for bison, moose, and bighorn sheep? These are the kinds of things we have available. These are the kinds of things that challenge us to protect. 
As Americans, what would we leave our children and grandchildren if not these wild and historic places to reflect, recreate and pause for some spiritual renewal? It seems to me that we all have an obligation to a measure of national service directed at strengthening our proud system of parks--the first such system in the world--the system that over 100 other nations have modeled after around the world. 
So I am asking for the support of my colleagues for Vision 2020--not only your vote, but also your review and constructive commentary. We worked very hard to put together the bill. We don't suggest that it is perfect. We will have hearings, and there will be an opportunity to evaluate how we achieve success. That is the key. These words are not unchangeable, but the goal is to preserve the parks. 
I believe that together we can accomplish constructive changes. We have an opportunity to bring the National Park Service and our national parks into the 21st century, alive, vibrant, effective and efficient. I think the public expects us to seize upon that opportunity so that our parks will be healthy and available for them to enjoy for a very long time in the future. 
So, Mr. President, I will submit this bill. First of all, I will add Senator Spencer Abraham as an original sponsor. I submit the bill for introduction.

 Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, Sunday, February 8 marked the second anniversary of the signing of the landmark Telecommunications Act of 1996. As we take this opportunity to reflect on the state of telecommunications reform, I rise to share my concerns with the implementation of a critical provision of the historical law--the provision dealing with universal telephone service. 
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 ordered the overhaul of the estimated $23 billion in subsidies currently used to fund universal telephone service. Congress intended all implicit subsidies to universal service to be removed from rates and transferred to a new explicit Universal Service Fund to be supported equally by all carriers. 
In the face of declining telephone rate support, through federally mandated access charge reduction and new competitors targeting the most profitable markets and services, a sustainable universal service support mechanism is ever more important. I view with great concern the Federal Communication Commission's (FCC) current formula for universal service support: twenty-five percent of funding from federal sources and seventy-five percent from each state. 
Many states, like Wyoming, clearly are not in a position to bear seventy-five percent of the universal service burden alone. Universal service is a shared state-federal responsibility. The best approach to fulfill Congress' intent and ensure affordable phone service in all corners of the country is to create a national universal service fund that ensures support reaches where it is needed most. 
The fund should be based on interstate and intrastate telecommunications revenues and cover one-hundred percent of the subsidy needed to keep phone rates affordable for customers in rural and high-cost areas. With a national fund, all telecommunications service providers would contribute a portion of their revenues to support reasonable rates across the country. In other words, service providers in more urban, low-cost areas would help support affordable phone service in rural, high-cost areas. 
Leaving seventy-five percent of the funding responsibility to the states would place a disproportionate burden on consumers, service providers and utilities commissions in rural states like Wyoming. Such a burden could result in higher phone rates and reduce network investment--both of which would have a chilling effect on economic development opportunities. Since telecommunications is a vital element of commerce, disparate universal service surcharges on communications services between states would divert industries and job growth away from the rural areas that need it the most.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk a little bit about a parochial issue that is peculiar to Wyoming, but it is one that is troublesome. It has to do with the Jackson Hole Airport. I am rising to express my frustration regarding the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and its lack of action with respect to an environmental assessment (EA) regarding safety issues at the Jackson Hole Airport. 
Let me explain why the issue is so important to us in Wyoming. Jackson Hole is the busiest airport in Wyoming. It is the only commercial service airport in the country that is located within a national park, Grand Teton National Park. As a consequence, of course, the FAA and the Park Service are very careful about making safety or other improvements at this facility. And they should be. As chairman of the Senate subcommittee on national parks, I agree that all of the proposals for changes at the Jackson Hole Airport ought to be carefully examined. You won't find a bigger advocate for our national parks in the U.S. Senate than me. However, there are some significant safety issues that must be addressed quickly. 
Between 1984 and 1992, the airport had more `runway excursions,' which is a nice way of saying they ran off the end of the runway, than any other airport in the country. This includes a broad range of aircraft, from general aviation and small commuters, to large aircraft such as 757s. 
Since 1992, there have been seven additional runway `incidents' that have occurred. 
In response to these problems, the Jackson Hole Airport board began an environmental assessment in 1992. All the interested parties, including the Park Service and the FAA were at the table. In fact, in 1993, I wrote Transportation Secretary Pena asking for interagency cooperation on this important issue, including the National Park Service, the Interior Department, the FAA, and the Department of Transportation. I wrote that letter in order to avoid the kind of situation that we have now. 
In April of 1997, the airport board finally completed the assessment, after 5 years, and submitted it to the FAA. The results of the environmental assessment appeared to be very reasonable. 
It would bring the runways into compliance with current FAA runway standards. That makes sense. 
It would improve safety without increasing the length of the runways, which is very important. There is opposition by some to making the runways longer because they are in the park. And there is some opposition to making them longer because that could accommodate bigger airplanes, and some people are not anxious to see that happen. 
It would not result in any significant noise increase. In fact, I am told that the newer airplanes are less intrusive with noise perhaps than the older ones. 
If, in fact, these statements are correct--and they appear to be--then why is the proposal being delayed? The FAA has been unresponsive and uncooperative with my office on this matter.

Mr. THOMAS. I still have not received an answer to my letter from the FAA. The letter was sent in early December of 1997. All the letter asked was for a date by which we could expect a decision. I didn't ask for a decision, I didn't urge a certain outcome, just the date. 
I called the FAA Administrator several weeks ago and though she said she would check into it I have heard nothing from her or her staff. For an agency that claims safety as its No. 1 priority, these delays are hard to understand. 
This assessment is not an effort to expand the airport. There won't be longer runways, bigger airplanes or more flights. It is about safety, safety for everyone flying in and out of this airport. Time is of the essence--there is a short construction period, as you might imagine, in Jackson Hole, WY. The FAA needs to come to a decision quickly or these safety improvements will be delayed for yet another year. 
Mr. President, I guess I have to admit that I am simply expressing my frustration with this situation. The FAA's primary responsibility is safety. The Jackson Hole Airport presents an opportunity to deal with an important safety issue and we've received no response from the FAA. I, therefore, intend to be rather critical of the FAA until it decides to act and comes to a conclusion. This process has gone long enough. The FAA needs to move forward now. 
I typically am not anxious to come to the floor of the Senate and grumble about a federal agency, but I think this is something that needs to be grumbled about, and therefore I am here. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for arranging for our discussion this morning. It seems to me it is one of the most basic discussions that we will have during the year. Budgets, after all, are sort of a map as to where we go. They are without great detail, but sort of limit where we are going. They have to do with the revenue that we anticipate raising. They have to do with the expenditures, and generally where those expenditures will be. So, in terms of direction, in terms of what we really expect the Federal Government to do, the budget is extremely important. 
Let me mention that the budget basically is done by the Congress. The President has been very outgoing in claiming credit for all the things that have happened over the last few years, but the fact is the Congress is responsible for the spending. No spending can occur unless the Congress agrees to it. No spending can be made in the Federal establishment unless approved by the Congress. So the responsibility is here, and I guess also you could say if there is any credit for having done some downsizing over the past few years, it also goes here. 
But I wanted to talk about something just a little bit different and that is, frankly, my disappointment in the approach that is taken in this case, and other cases as well; I am disappointed that when we have something to decide in our Government, all of our Government, that we are not more willing to lay things out as they are. I am, frankly, a little exasperated with all the spinning that goes on from almost everyone here, but frankly particularly from this administration, in sort of trying to say that things aren't really what they are. That is so discouraging, especially when we are in a time when there is greater communication availability to all the world, and certainly to the American people, than there ever has been. So that if you ever thought of having Government of the people, for Heaven's sake, now we can do that because everyone can know what the facts are. They are there automatically. 
Yet, as we go through these things, it is really difficult to understand what is being done because they are described one way at the White House, you know, as if this is a wonderful breakthrough and we are going to contain the size of the Government; that this is the end of the era of big Government. But the fact is, it is not. It is a growth. It is larger Government. It is more taxing. But it is hard to kind of decipher these things. 
Let me read some material from James Miller, who was the OMB head in the Reagan years. He is talking about the things that have been said, and what he thinks, at least, the real facts are. Miller says we have, in `. . . the president's words, `the smallest government in 35 years[.]' And yet, in 1963, `at the height of Camelot,' he calls it, `total federal spending (in 1997 dollars'--1997 dollars, adjusted for that--was $580 billion, with 48 percent going for defense. For 1998 the federal government will spend $1,625 billion, of which 16 percent is for defense. And the President says `the smallest Government in 35 years.' 
You know, that just is not the way it is. Now we are spending 15 percent for defense, as the Senator from Texas just described. Federal spending per capita was $3,069 in 1997 dollars in 1963. It is, today, $6,000. Spending per capita has doubled. The President says we have `the smallest Government in 35 years.' The comparison is even more telling when you include State and local governments--$4,100 per capita in 1963; $9,500 per capita now. 
You know, it is really discouraging to try to deal and get people involved in making decisions as to what they think is best for this country when the facts are so distorted. There is nothing wrong with having it laid out there in real terms. This is a legitimate decision. There are those who want more Government and more taxes and more expenditures. That is a legitimate point of view. I don't happen to share it. That is the liberal agenda. That is what we debate all the time. The other alternative, of course, is to have less taxes, less spending, a less large Federal Government and move, more and more governmental functions closer to people. Those are legitimate debates. Why it is, frankly, that we tend to hide those all the time under rhetoric I am not certain. 
Let me give you another example. The President says, `Under the leadership of Vice President Gore we have reduced the Federal payroll by 300,000 workers.' According to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, between January 1993 and September 1997, Federal civil employment fell by 254,000; 217,000 of that was attributable to defense, the closing of bases, civilian workers in defense; 17,000 came from downsizing the Department of Veterans Affairs; and 14,000 more from 
completing the work on S&L's. This is not a reduction in the size of Government. But, you know, we are told that. 
So, Madam President, I am hopeful, too, we can hold the caps we agreed upon last year, that the President agreed upon. I hope we can continue to move towards making the Government smaller and more efficient. I hope we do not continue to grow and to bring in new fees that we don't recognize as taxes, although they are. So we have a great opportunity. All I ask is let us get it out there, debate it on the face of the real facts and not disguise it, trying to act as if it is something that it is really not. 
Madam President, I yield now to the Senator from Kansas to complete our discussion for this morning.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we have had this afternoon several Members rise to talk about ISTEA funding. I rise to support the things that they have said. One of the most important bills that we passed in our committee last year, and I think one of the most important elements before us now in the Senate, is the funding of the Intermodal Transportation Act. 
We worked a great deal last year. I happen to be on the Committee on Environment and Public Works, and we came up with an extension of the ISTEA bill, which expired last year, by the way. Now, of course, we are operating on a temporary arrangement, which makes it very difficult for State highway departments to make the contracts that are necessary. I think it is particularly important for States like Wyoming and the northern part of the country, where you have a relatively small short contracting and construction time, that we move to pass this bill so that the States will know what money is available to them. 
There should have been approval last year, other than an extension. Unfortunately, we couldn't come to an agreement with the House. Furthermore, right here in the Senate, as I recall, there were some things that were brought up that kept us from considering ISTEA. But now it is time to do that. 
We also have before us a proposal to extend the authority for spending, to use more of the dollars that are collected, and I agree with that. I have not yet become a sponsor of it, but I, frankly, propose to be. We have been spending in the neighborhood of $21 billion a year on ISTEA, but Federal taxes have been raising more like $27 billion. Now, of course, as a result of last year's budget, we converted the 4.3-cent tax, having gone to the general fund, to now go to the highway fund. I support that idea. So it is time for us to do that. 
I am concerned, of course, that we do it within budget guidelines. I am not interested in breaking the budget caps by simply spending. I know when you have a unified budget, if you are going to spend more money here, you have to make arrangements on the other side, too, which restricts spending. I am for that. 
I think it is necessary for us to do it. I am sorry that it has been postponed. It was my understanding that it would be the first item of business to be considered or early, at least, in this session. I know there is controversy now with the budgeteers in terms of how that works, but this is an authorization, as I understand it. It is not an expenditure, of course. It authorizes what will then be put together by the budgeteers and appropriators. 
Mr. President, I certainly want to endorse the notion that there is nothing more important or nothing that needs to be dealt with more currently than the idea of expanding ISTEA. I hope that the leader and others in the leadership will give some consideration to that. I think we can move forward. I know that there is not certainty in the House as to the direction they want to take, but I believe passage of the Senate proposal and shipment of it to the House would cause that to happen. If it is difficult, it is difficult. It is no more difficult now than it will be later. To the contrary, as we get toward the end of this session, it may be even more difficult to find time. 
I suggest, hope and urge that we bring it to the floor as soon as possible, and we resolve that issue so that we can move forward on this transportation question, which is probably one of the most important economic things we do in our States. These dollars go there, they are contracted, they go into business, and we provide a better transportation system. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. THOMAS. I appreciate the Senator from Georgia arranging for an opportunity to talk about our agenda. After all we have just returned now from recess, just returned from a time to talk with our constituents. I spent all this time in Wyoming doing a number of town meetings, talking to people about various things they are interested in. 
It is time for us, of course to talk about agendas, to talk about priorities, to talk about what it is that we intend to do during what is already a relatively short work year, during an 
election year. The thing, of course, that is on our minds today, I suppose, is the President's State of the Union Address last evening in which he laid out his agenda, not a surprise agenda, and talked about the issues he has been talking about now for several weeks, with a new proposal each week, all put together in a State of the Union Message which had, I think, about 30 different proposals of things to do. 
It seems to me that what we have to do now as a responsible Congress is to decide on those items that we think are priorities to this country, that we think are priorities for success in families in this country, economically, from a freedom standpoint, how-to-govern standpoint, and really press for those. I must say that I feel rather strongly about that. 
I felt last evening that--the President, of course, is certainly free to have his own agenda--that was an agenda that had been put together by pollsters, an agenda that had been put together to enumerate all those things that would sound good to everyone that was listening, an agenda that I think, clearly, again the President is perfectly free to move his position, move his position back toward the more liberal Democrat Party from which he has departed in the last several years somewhat to establish more support for Al Gore when the time comes. I think that is legitimate. I don't happen to agree with that. 
I think we ought to be moving forward to continue to do the things that we have begun to do over the last several years, some of the things that I am particularly proud of, frankly, that this Congress has been able to do, to bring forth a balanced budget. That, after all, is the responsibility of the Congress. We have done that. We need to continue to do that. We need to continue to try and control spending so that we can move toward this idea of a balanced budget and beyond, to begin to work on the debt that is there, to begin to do something about that $280 billion we spend on interest every year to service a $5.5 trillion debt. That, it seems to me, ought to be the real focus of what we do. 
Our responsibility now, I believe, in the Congress is--we shall meet on Friday, our friends across the aisle will meet I am sure next week--to come to grips with those kind of things we think are the priorities for our agenda. I don't think our agenda can be a laundry list of 30 or 40 things that appeal to the polls but rather ought to be the kinds of things that are terribly important to us. 
I think we ought to talk about ISTEA, for example. We ought to get out into the country to do the highway maintenance, the highway building. We didn't get that done last time because we got diverted talking about something else. ISTEA needs to be there. I think we need to continue to work on the budget. There is probably nothing more important than being responsible in the spending that we do. Again, I am pleased with what has happened with the budget over time. I am pleased for what has happened in the last couple of years on welfare reform. The Congress has moved forward, with the cooperation of the President, after a couple of vetoes. That is OK. But we need to continue to do that, to provide the opportunity to help people move off of welfare into work, which is what most people want to do, of course. We have made some progress in moving away some from the entitlement program that we have had. We have made some progress in terms of moving Government closer to people, where Government is more responsive at the State level, and do those things at the State level that we should do there. 
As I listened last night to the enumeration of things that might be done it seemed to me at least one of the considerations that has to be made is where do you do these things most efficiently? Child care--everybody is for having quality child care. Everybody wants to strengthen the child care program. The question first we ought to ask is, where is that best done? What is the role of the Federal Government in child care? What is the role of the State government in these kinds of things? 
I happened to have the privilege last night of having my Governor accompany me to the State of the Union Message. I could sense as we went through last night's State of the Union Message him saying to himself, `We can do that better at the State level. We can really make those things work.' I agree with that. 
There are a number of other things that I personally would like to see us move forward on. One of my personal areas of interest is the national parks. National parks are a national treasure for all of us. More and more people go to visit national parks. More and more people are interested. Yet we have less resources for national parks than we need. National parks, some claim, are as much as $8 billion in arrears on infrastructure. We need to work at that. That happens to be something that I am most interested in. 
I think most of all we need to be sure that we are responsible, finally. Spending continues to go up. If we are going to balance the budget--why balance the budget? Because revenues have gone up. I think the President's proposal goes far beyond what is going to be available for dollars. The President says we want to keep a balanced budget and then lists 
30 items that will cost billions of dollars plus additional tax deductions there that will reduce revenue. So we find ourselves I am sure with spending far beyond our income if we do those things. 
Those, I believe, have to be the constraints. That is what I heard from my people. That is what I heard from the people of Wyoming. They said, look, stay with that business of balancing the budget. We not only want to balance the budget, we would like to see you begin to reduce spending. This idea of the era of large Government being over is a good idea. 
I was disappointed the President had done a complete reversal from 2 years ago when he announced that would be his objective. This certainly was not an effort to reduce and to change the era of big Government. 
Spending continues to go up, 16 percent last year, 24 percent on entitlements. Over a period of time, entitlements continue to grow. Many of these programs that we talked about inevitably will become entitlements. These young people that are here on the floor as pages won't see those benefits because they will not be sustained if we continue to grow at 24 percent a year. 
Madam President, I think we have a real opportunity. As I said, I enjoyed the President's State of the Union Message. That is his agenda. Now it is our responsibility to have an agenda and to put our priorities there, put our philosophy there, our philosophy of a responsible Government, our philosophy of a financially accountable Government, one in which we limit size and move as close as we can to people to solve people's problems. 
The educational program that Senator Coverdell has recommended is one that puts the responsibility in the hands of local people, parents. That is what we need to do. Those are the kinds of things we can do here to assist in those problems. So I am excited about this year. I think we have an opportunity to do a great deal. I am very proud of having been in this Senate since 1994. I think we have made some real changes in direction. It is my hope and my desire to help ensure that we continue to move in the direction of a more responsible Government, responsive to the folks that we represent, the folks I have had a chance to visit with for 2 months and have come back with some renewed dedication to the idea that this Congress, this Government, is responsible to the people, to the taxpayers, responsible for protecting liberty, responsible for being financially responsible, responsible for reducing taxes as much as we can, to leave the money to the people it belongs to. I am excited about the opportunity. 
So my friend, Mr. Coverdell, I appreciate very much what you are doing in this time to talk. I think we should continue to talk about our agenda and talk about the reasons we are doing what we are doing. I look forward to that happening this year.

Mr. THOMAS. If I might, I certainly agree with the Senator. It isn't that difficult. 
In other words, this is what our system is all about. Our system of private enterprise, our system of limited Government, our system of allowing as much money as possible to stay in the hands of the citizens so they can invest it and create jobs, that is what our system is all about. Through the years it has been tested against socialism and big government and the government doing all these things, and throughout the world this system is the success. It is being copied everywhere. Sometimes it is scary when we see ourselves moving away from our own system that has been so successful, that everybody else has adopted. 
So the Senator is exactly right. That certainly is what creates this kind of an economic environment is the ability to take the risk, to invest, to work, to earn, to keep and to do things for yourself and your family.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to take the time that we have available this morning while we are waiting for these important closing activities--I hope closing activities--to talk a little bit about an issue that I feel very strongly about and that I think most people do, and that is our national parks and our national parks plan. 
I am chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, and we have spent almost this entire year working on a program to help strengthen the parks. Certainly, the National Park System is truly one of our treasures. 
The Park System is the custodian of some of America's most important natural and cultural resources and provides, of course, a legacy for our children and our grandchildren. 
The Park System today consists of about 374 units which are visited annually by millions of people. They stretch all the way from Acadia in Maine to American Samoa in the Pacific islands and provide a unique opportunity. 
I, of course, am particularly selfishly interested in parks because I come from Wyoming. We have the first national park which recently celebrated its 125th anniversary--Yellowstone. We also of course have Teton Park. But the whole country has a park system that we are extremely proud of. 
Unfortunately, that System is and has been under considerable stress. At the time that we have showed unusual interest in it as Americans, and have increased our visitations, the park has had increasing difficulties. We are believed to have somewhere near $8 billion in unfunded and unrealized infrastructure repairs of various kinds. That is a great deal of money. 
We also have had some stress in terms of management in many of those things. So we worked this year and intend, as a matter of fact, to have some field hearings in November; particularly we have one set for Denver and one for San Francisco, and we hope then to have one later in Florida near the Everglades, to try and bring in as much information as we can get on the issues and how they affect people. 
The issues are broken down, as you might imagine, into several categories. One of them is finance. That is one of the basic ones, of course. As I mentioned, we have an overwhelming amount of unfunded programs: $2.2 billion in road and bridge repair; $1.5 billion in buildings and maintenance; $800 million in natural resource management kinds of things. They are the kinds of things that are very difficult to manage in an annual budget. 
So we are looking for some ways to do this a little bit differently. We are looking at a number of things. One would be to extend the temporary program for fees, where fees have been raised in a number of the parks, about 100 I think out of the 375 parks. They have been very low. And it has been $10 a car at Yellowstone for a whole carload of people for a week. I think it has now gone to $20. And, frankly, we found very little resistance to that, particularly if people believe the money they are spending going to that park will be used to make that park a better place to visit. 
In addition to fees, of course, it will be our responsibility, Mr. President, as Members of Congress, to keep the appropriations growing some for that. We had an increase in appropriations this year. We need to continue to do that. 
In addition to entrance fees, we are looking at ways for people to contribute, private individuals to contribute to parks. Many want to do that. There are park foundations in individual parks. We need to find some ways for Americans who chose to, to be able to contribute more to the maintenance of parks. 
We are also looking at a way for corporate investment as well, without commercializing parks. We do not want `Pepsi-Cola' painted up on the wall of Yosemite. But there isn't any reason why there cannot be corporate donations made. For example, one of the corporations made a donation to build the walkway around Old Faithful. It is a wonderful addition. And there is a very small and unobtrusive sign there that indicates the sponsors of that. I think that is a good idea. I think we can continue to do that. 
One of the things we are looking at is a way for bonding. Interestingly enough, the larger parks, like Yosemite, like Yellowstone are basically small cities. They have to have sewers, they have to have streets, they have to have housing, the kinds of things that take long-term investment. And it is very difficult to do it, as I mentioned a moment ago, out of annual appropriations. 
So we are trying to find a way that the park could do some bonding in the private sector. I do not know whether these can be Government bonds, I do not know whether they can be tax-free bonds or taxable bonds. But in order to do that, we have a couple of problems I hope we can overcome. 
One is the scoring system here in the budget of the United States. As you know, we do not have a capital budget. And so if you issue 300 million dollars' worth of bonds, that would all go into the annual budget. That is a difficult thing. We will have to try and overcome that. We hope that there are some ways to do it. 
The other thing, of course, that is necessary to do bonding is to have a dependable and steady stream of revenue to pay off the bonds. We think we can do that. So those are a couple of the ways that we are seeking to do some things that would be good for parks. 
In addition, many of the larger parks, as you know, the services--let me go back and say, I think most people would agree that the main purpose of a park is to maintain the resources, whether it be cultural or whether it be natural resources. 
But the second and equally important part of it is to have a pleasant visit for Americans, who own those parks. To do that, by and large, we have had concessions that have been run by the private sector. I certainly support that idea. I think that is the way to do it. We have, unfortunately, kind of gotten out of sync in terms of doing the sort of contracting that is necessary. 
We went through a while, a big debate a couple years ago as to whether the Government ought to own the facilities. I think we have overcome that and decided that is not what we want to do. So we need to go back to longer term contracts for some very large facilities. 
I think there is about $700 million in gross revenue that comes from concessions in the whole Park System, which is a very sizable amount. 
On the other hand, parks are not all big-profit operations because Glacier Park, for example, in Montana is only opened a portion of the year. And the season is rather shortened. So we have to deal with questions like: How long should the contract be for sizable investments? Should there be the right of renewal? Should there be some sort of proprietary ownership in these facilities at the time the contract exchange comes? So we are working with those things. I am positive that we can find some solutions. 
I also want you to know that one of, I think, the key issues we are talking about with concessions--I mentioned to you this is a large commercial business. It is a commercial business. We think we ought to take a look at the idea of contracting with an asset manager out of the private sector who is a professional at managing hospitality things to do this. That is not really the role of a park ranger in terms of training and background. 
As you know, Mr. President, I have been working as hard as I can to see if we can't move these commercial functions of the Government over into the private sector, at least give them an opportunity to bid on it. So that is one of the things that we are seeking to do. 
I do not think that we are going to solve the financial problem out of the concessions by any means. But we ought to be able to do two things. We ought to be able to have good facilities that are kept up; and we ought to be able to have a small stream of revenue come to the parks. We think that might be one of the possibilities for doing something with the bonding revenue. 
We are looking at improved management. The Park Service, after all, is a large agency, I think, with some of the most dedicated employees of any agency in the country. The people you talk to that work for the Park Service are really, really dedicated to doing what they do. They like to preserve the parks. They like to work in the parks. But they did not always have the opportunity, for instance, to be trained. 
We are going to look at some university exchanges where folks could get some additional training and help them do their jobs. But I think more than anything it has become a large agency, and what we need is a strategic plan. 
Any business of that size, any operation of that size needs a strategic plan that has some forward ideas as to how to solve problems. Frankly, that is kind of why we are where we are. There has not been any plans presented to the Congress. And the Congress has not taken the initiative to prepare plans to accommodate these problems that we now have, and problems of increased visitation. The highways, for example, in Yelowstone Park are way behind in preparation and care. So we need a strategic plan in the agency. 
Probably at least as important then is each park, and each park manager, needs to have a strategic plan that contributes to the overall plan and one with measurable objectives and measurable goals so that you do not just have a plan that everybody thinks is wonderful but you have one that at the end of the year you can take a look at the plan and say you accomplished what you were going to or you did not. If you did not, there ought to be a reason why you did not. So we think we can do some good there. 
Let me tell you that we are working very closely with the Park Service. And a new park director is now in place, Bob Stanton. His background as a career park official has been that he was the head of the parks here in this area. It was the first time, by the way, that the park director has been approved by the Senate. That was just changed so it is an appointment that has to be approved. So we are working with him. The Secretary of the Interior has talked favorably about some of the changes that need to be made. 
Finally, one of the things we are doing is trying to take a look at the criteria for new parks. I think it is fairly well defined in terms of setting aside things that are important either historically or culturally or from a natural resource standpoint. 
But, unfortunately--I think unfortunately--we have continued to add more parks that do not necessarily fit that criteria. They are often recommended by Members of Congress who have an equivalent of a State or a county park in their area that they would like to have the Federal Government pay for. So they move it into the Park Service when it could just as well be a State park. And we find ourselves short of money to handle the 375 parks we have now, and continuing to increase with parks that may or may not fit the criteria. 
So we are not as concerned about the criteria. I believe it exists there. But we are concerned and hopefully will change the process in which the criteria moves through the Congress so that there is an opportunity to do that. 
So, Mr. President, these are the things that we are doing. We have purposely worked on it all this session. We did not intend to bring a bill this session, but we do intend to have one prepared for January. I think it is one of the things that most Americans are supportive of. Not everybody is going to be supportive of every proposal we have to do it, but I think there is general support for strengthening parks. There needs to be. 
Certainly we have more and more people wanting to participate in them. So you have to recognize that as caring. So we will be moving forward on that. I think it is something that Congress ought to undertake, and be very proud to undertake. 
There is great controversy over many of the environmental issues that go around. But there is not much controversy over this one. If we talk about what are the needs, are we going to try and fulfill those needs, most everybody says yes. Now, when you get to how you do it, obviously, there will be differences of view and debate. That is why we are here. 
But, Mr. President, I am excited about this opportunity. We call our plan `Vision 2020,' so that we can take a look at parks so that our kids, 20 years from now, and others, will be able to enjoy them with the same intensity that we have been able to. 
We look forward to having our proposition ready by January. I hope many of the Members of the Senate will join with us in seeking to resolve this important question and problem. 
Mr. President, I thank you for the time and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I rise today as a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee to express some concerns that I have about the nomination of Kevin Gover to be the new Assistant Secretary of Interior for Indian Affairs, the head of the BIA, the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
I have consistently taken the position that in my experience the BIA is an agency that is in dire need of serious reform to make it more effective and more responsive to the needs of the tribes that it is established to serve. I therefore have a certain admiration for anyone who is willing to undertake this task, because it is a tough one. It is one that is difficult. Additionally, in this particular case, Mr. Gover's personal qualifications recommend him very highly for this position. He also has a Wyoming connection, which of course I am interested in. Over several years he has represented the Eastern Shoshone Tribe in several legal and legislative matters. 
However, it wouldn't come as any surprise to my colleagues on that committee that given William Safire's recent op-ed piece on the Gover nomination in the New York Times, some questions have to be raised and are raised with respect to his nomination. According to the Safire piece, in private practice and representing the Tesuque Pueblo of New Mexico, Mr. Gover was present at one of President Clinton's infamous White House coffees. Soon therefore, the Pueblo made two contributions to the Democratic National Committee totaling $50,000. Some time later, Mr. Gover was nominated for this position. 
An examination of the nominee's FBI file leads me to conclude that he committed no illegal acts. I believe at the very least they constitute an appearance of impropriety which should make many of us uncomfortable. I have no argument, of course, with the right of individuals to make political contributions to the party of their choice. That is provided by law and should be. I personally believe, however, it is a little unseemly for tribal governments to do so, to either party. It is no secret that all but two or three tribes in this country have little, if any, extra money to throw around. The overwhelming majority, even with Federal help, can hardly meet the day-to-day needs of their members--needs like shelter, health care, or education. There is a constant press for additional funding for those needs. 
When a tribal government can't meet the basic needs of its people, then I seriously question the morality of that government making a political contribution. 
Another fact that lends itself to the appearance of impropriety in this case is the special relationship between the tribes and the Federal Government. This relationship is like the relationship between a trustee and beneficiary; the United States has a unique fiduciary responsibility to the tribes and their members. Congress has turned over responsibility for day-to-day regulation of tribal affairs to the executive branch. So I can't think of many circumstances where national campaign contributions--especially to the party of a sitting President--would not carry with them the appearance of impropriety, an appearance of unseemly influence--the idea of a beneficiary influencing the trustee in its work. 
And what about the appearance of a government body representing members of different political beliefs--in this case a tribal government--making a monetary contribution to a national political party on behalf of all of its members, whether or not that's their political belief. We prohibit Federal agencies from engaging in any lobbying efforts with taxpayer funds because it would look unseemly. We prohibit unions from making political contributions to one particular party with members' dues. Mr. President, the question might be posed that since it appears that nothing illegal took place in Mr. Gover's case, why all the fuss? My answer, Madam President, is that oftentimes the appearance of impropriety can be just as damning as an actual illegality. 
The news these days is full of examples illustrating this conclusion--the subject of Senator Thompson's hearings, which just recently ended with credible allegations against Secretary Babbitt that tribal campaign contributions influenced the denial of a gaming license to a Midwestern tribe. 
In order to get answers to some of my concerns, I met with Mr. Gover at length on November 4. Our conversation was somewhat reassuring to me, and left me feeling that my argument is not with Mr. Gover, who as far as I can tell at this time did nothing illegal, but with a system that allows tribes to make these kinds of donations. 
So, Madam President, should the Gover nomination come to a vote on the floor, I do not plan to object. The BIA has been without leadership for a long time, something that Bureau can ill afford, and Mr. Gover is eminently qualified to lead it. But he can be sure while I support him, I and other Members will be watching closely to make sure he delivers on his promises to reform the Bureau, to make it more responsible and cost efficient, and to help untangle the present mess in Indian gaming. 
Madam President, I yield the floor. 
Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Irrigation Project Contract Extension Act of 1997. I am pleased to be joined in this endeavor by Senators Enzi, Kerrey, and Hagel. 
This legislation would extend, for a period of 3 years, certain water contracts between the Bureau of Reclamation and irrigators in Wyoming and Nebraska that receive water from Glendo Reservoir. All contracts are subject to renewal on December 31, 1998. Extending these contracts is considered a major Federal action and, therefore, subject to review of the National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA] and the Endangered Species Act [ESA]. Without a short-term continuation agreement, the irrigators would be responsible for the costs of the analysis and other environmental documentation. 
Currently, the States of Wyoming, Nebraska, and Colorado--and the Department of the Interior--are in the process of implementing a comprehensive `Cooperative Agreement for Platte River Research and Other Efforts relating to Endangered Species Habitats along the Central Platte River, Nebraska.' The term of this initiative is for 3 years, with an allowable 6-month extension. Upon completion of the cooperative agreement, efforts to enact the Platte River Recovery Implementation Program can begin. This basin wide, three-State plan will help to recover the endangered whooping crane, piping plover, and least stern, and improve critical habitats in the Central Platte River Basin. 
I believe it is important for Congress to act on this measure and extend these contracts for 3 years, or until the cooperative agreement is completed. In that time, the needed NEPA and ESA reviews will be fulfilled--clearing the way for the program to be initiated. It is important to remember that the program cannot be implemented until the environmental studies are completed and the parties have agreed to the results. 
Mr. President, this bill does not avoid environmental evaluation. It merely provides some relief to the water users, while allowing the NEPA and ESA documentation to take place through the cooperative agreement process. It is my understanding that once this agreement has expired, and if the Department of the Interior and the three States decide not to pursue the program, the contract renewal process would proceed as a separate Federal action at that time. 
This is good and fair legislation. It will benefit the environment and the water users. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and House to secure its passage.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to briefly discuss a program presently being developed by the Library of Congress. 
The law librarian of Congress, Dr. Rubens Medina, briefed me this morning on the efforts the law library has undertaken in recent years to put together an international legal database containing the texts of laws of some 35 foreign countries. The data base comprises abstracts of legal material, the full authentic texts of laws and regulations, and a legal thesaurus. It is structured so that the full range of legal material including constitutions, laws and regulations, judicial decisions, parliamentary debates, and legal miscellanea can be added over time as participating countries are able to contribute the material. The material is available over the Internet in its entirety to officials of those countries who agree to participate in making their laws available on the system; in addition, a summary in both English and the language of the country of origin will be available to the general public. 
This network, called the Global Legal Information Network or GLIN, will enable Members of Congress and their staffs and the Library staff--as well as our counterparts in participating countries--to access the most current and authentic versions of other countries' laws, something that is increasingly important in this day and age when we deal so frequently with international trade and security issues. Congress should acknowledge and salute this effort by its Library, and be proud that it was created in and enhanced by the legislative branch and that the library is taking the international leadership role on the project. 
As additional recognition of the viability and importance of this project, and one that interests me as the chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Dr. Medina informed me that the Secretary of State will be proposing at the forthcoming ministerial meeting of the 18 APEC nations in Vancouver, BC, next month that each APEC country seriously consider joining GLIN and suggesting that an informational meeting on GLIN be held early in 1998. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to be involved in some way in this monumental project, one in which the joint efforts of the executive and legislative branches can capitalize on technological achievements to advance international cooperation.

Mr. THOMAS. Several of my associates and I want to take that time to talk about the Medicare Beneficiaries Freedom to Contract Act, which we think is very important to Medicare recipients and to the system. We want to talk about that. However, before we begin, and we will then share our time, I yield to the Senator from Kansas for several minutes.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we would like to scoot back now on to this focus on Medicare, the idea that Medicare patients certainly have an opportunity to choose, that we are able to strengthen the Medicare Program through this function. I will first yield to the sponsor of the bill and, frankly, the person who has carried the weight and continues to, the Senator from Arizona. 
Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we have been joined by our associate from Minnesota. Let me first say that this Medicare issue, of course, is one of the most important issues that we deal with. I think it is one of the most important issues to America. Certainly it is the most important issue to seniors. The idea is to keep it available over time so people who are now paying into part A and will pay into part A will have the benefits of it when they are eligible, to keep choice in it so that seniors will have some choice as they enter into this kind of health care; to keep it financially strong, which is the difficulty, of course--their costs have gone up in Medicare; they have finally narrowed down some, largely through the involvement of managed care, and there will be a committee or a commission appointed in December to take a look at the future of it--and to make it available in all parts of the country. My friend from Colorado just talked about that. We have small towns, we have towns in which there are only one or two physicians. So this choice thing is so important, that it be there. 
Let me now yield to the Senator from Minnesota.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the time. I appreciate being joined by my friends in support of this Medicare Beneficiaries Freedom to Contract Act. Let me just review how we got where we are. 
During the consideration of the balanced budget, Senator Kyl put in a very simple amendment which simply said that you could have this choice that did allow for physicians to treat under a private contract in addition to Medicare. Unfortunately, the administration became adamant about it. I think they followed, as the Senator from Minnesota said, the idea of turning this back into a one-size-fits-all kind of federally controlled program. The President threatened to veto the entire budget package because of this, if this 2-year prohibition was not included. So, today I am still disappointed with the administration, with HCFA, with the President's opposition to this proposition. 
We are going to continue to push for consideration of this issue before this Congress adjourns so we can eliminate this bottleneck, this thing which takes away the choice of senior citizens in their health care.

 Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from Alaska, Senator Frank Murkowski (R-AK), in introducing the `Medicare Frontier Health Clinic and Center Act of 1997.' This bill will go a long way in assuring rural families have access to emergency medical care on a 24-hour basis. 
As cochairman of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, it has been my priority to put rural health care at the forefront of any legislative package. Included in this year's `Balanced Budget Act of 1997,' is a comprehensive set of reforms that increases Medicare reimbursement rates to midlevel practitioners, improves payment levels to rural health plans contracting with Medicare and permits small hospitals to stay open even if they do not meet all of the requirements stipulated under Medicare's conditions of participation. 
It is this last provision that is particularly beneficial to Wyoming's health care community. For the first time, our hospitals will be able reconfigure their services and reduce excess bed capacity. The new entities will be called `Critical Access Hospitals' [CAH's]. They will be excused from some of the onerous staffing regulations designed with big cities in mind. In addition, they will be reimbursed on a reasonable-cost basis, which provides the extra payment needed to remain open. 
While the newly established CAH Program goes to great lengths to expand medical care in rural America, there is still more to do. That is where our bill steps in. The `Medicare Frontier Health Clinic and Center Act,' permits state certified health clinics in the most frontier areas to upgrade to CAH status. This will ensure that remote areas of the country will finally have access to hospital services. 
Too often, health care providers are forced to close their doors because they cannot contend with low utilization rates, costly regulations and inadequate Medicare reimbursement payments. But closing a hospital or a medical clinic is not an acceptable option in Wyoming. In my State, if a town loses its most important point of service--the emergency room--it is typical for patients to drive 100 miles or more to the closest tertiary care center. An alternative must be available. 
Mr. President, our bill presents communities with a viable option. It accommodates different levels of medical care throughout a state while providing stabilization services needed in remote areas. It is one in a series of measures that the Rural Health Caucus is working on designed to improve quality medical care in rural America, and I look forward to working with my colleague from Alaska to pass this important piece of legislation.

Mr. THOMAS. I come to the floor to express some feeling of sadness, some feeling of impatience, frankly, some feeling of irritation, that we are not doing more than we have been doing. 
The last 3 weeks we have come in, we have talked about things, we have set them aside, we haven't been able to proceed with the country's business. I think that is a shame. We have many things to do. We have lots of opportunities to do some things that need to be done, and here we are sort of ground to a stop. We are being held up by people who insist on having it their own way or no way, their own way or the highway. That is not really what we ought to be doing here. 
We have an opportunity to deal, for instance, with Federal funding for highways, something that ought to be done, an authorization that expired in September, and we need to move forward with it. It has been passed by the committee. It is on the floor, but because of objections we are still here and not doing a thing. ISTEA expired in September and we need to be doing it. The stalling, of course, is basically a result of campaign finance. We voted several times not to bring McCain-Feingold to the floor. That bill did not receive a majority vote. 
Many in this body, including myself, are favorable to doing something in campaign finance, but not McCain-Feingold. That is where we are. We are being held up for that, I think for a couple of reasons. One is to sort of change the image of the hearings that are taking place, to switch the hearings from the potential of the allegation of breaking the law, to changing the law. Those are two different things. But we ought to be talking about whether or not there was realism to the idea that foreign funds were taken into campaigns. That breaks the law. We ought to be talking about the changing or shifting soft money to hard money. That is against the law. The allegations of laundering money, that is against the law. That is what we are talking about there. Then we ought to be talking over here about campaign reform, fine. But McCain-Feingold is not one this body is willing to accept. 
As a result of that, we are not doing anything simply because of complaints--well, we can't go forward unless I get my way. I think the majority leader has done a great job of trying to negotiate something, trying to put campaign finance on the menu for next March--that is the thing to do--and then come up with a bill that has some support, bipartisan support, and we can do something. But that is not where we are. 
Think a minute about the agenda that we might be able to pursue, the things that people really want to do. One, of course, is ISTEA, the funding of highways. Now, some say it doesn't matter, there is enough money, there is enough cash-flow, we don't need to do it until next year. And there is probably cash-flow to finish the contracts there now, to operate, but there is not the kind of money that highway departments need to plan for next year, to go ahead and let contracts and move forward as we should. We ought to be doing that. 
IRS reform--most people want to do something about the IRS in two areas. One, change the way the agency works, and that can be done, to make it more friendly. There are proposals out there that most people agree with. The other is to start talking about changing the Tax Code which underlies the problem, which we need to be doing. 
What are we doing? We just can't move forward with anything because you are not doing it the way you want to. Come on, that is not why we are were sent here. 
We ought to be doing something to make sure that our balanced budget agreement is ready for next year. A balanced budget means more than anything else. We need to be doing something, as I mentioned, about the Tax Code to make it simpler. Most people agree with that. We can do some things, but you can't do them unless you undertake it. You can't do it by just stalling. 
We need to do something about educational IRA's to give people an opportunity to set aside money for education so they can use it not only for higher education but for elementary and secondary. Those proposals are out here and are ready to be worked on. Can't do that because you don't agree to what we want on McCain-Feingold. Give me a break. We have a lot of things we ought to be doing. 
We ought to be talking about ways to have smaller Government, ways to bring the private sector into contracting those nongovernmental activities in Government that can be done to help small business--the main thing small business has talked about in the White House meetings for the last 3 years. Can't do that, though, because we don't have it our way. 
States rights. We ought to be talking about the proper role of Government, individual freedom and responsibilities. Those are the things that we are here for. 
Mr. President, I am disappointed that we aren't able to move forward. I am disappointed that we are not able to do some useful things while we are here. That is why we are here, why we were sent here. I have no objection to disagreement. That is part of the system. Certainly not everybody is going to agree. In the first place, we have different philosophies. That is kind of why we have two parties; we represent different philosophies on things. That is perfectly legitimate. Whenever anybody has a bill, there are reasons why others don't agree. That is why we have a system to vote to decide how they will work out. There is no problem with debate, no problem with argument, no problem with disagreement. But we need to move beyond that. We need to move beyond that and do some of the things that we were sent here to do--and there are so many. As people begin to look at next year's election, the issues begin to identify themselves, as they should, and we ought to be doing something with them. We ought to be doing something with them. 
Mr. President, we will have an opportunity, I guess, this afternoon to move forward. Perhaps we can move on. At least we have six more appropriations bills to pass to keep the Government operating. We have had to extend the time twice because we haven't been able to get to them. It would be interesting at some time to have everybody in this body write down the 10 issues that they think are most important to this country and to set about to do them. Wouldn't that be interesting and useful? We can do that. 
Mr. President, I hope that when we come together this afternoon to vote, we will also bring together the Interior appropriations bill and move forward on that. There will be things we don't agree with. I can tell you one I don't agree with procedurally. You will find on the appropriations bill--it was put on there--a $400 appropriations dealing with endangered species, the jumping mouse. Well, I don't have any particular objections to jumping mice, but I do have an objection to someone putting it on the appropriations bill when it is in the conference committee, has never been talked about in either House, and they put it on there and you don't have any chance to do anything about it. That's wrong. It's the wrong procedure. We should not do that. But I am not going to try to hold the thing up because of that. It ought to go forward. So should the other things that are before us here in this conference. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues for just a few moments with respect to the question that we are addressing this morning, that question of global warming, but more particularly the specifics with respect to it. 
I am sure you already heard, but let me say again, there was a measure adopted by this Senate 95-0 that expressed two main points: One, the United States should not be signatory to any treaty that would `result in serious harm to the U.S. economy.' And, No. 2, that mandates developing countries to have specific scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions within the same compliance period. 
So we have been working at this for some time. We have had several hearings in our Committee on the Environment and Public Works and also in Energy. We have had representatives of the administration there. This goes clear back to Rio, I think, in 1992. It goes back more specifically now to Geneva about a year ago, in which promises were apparently made at that meeting with respect to what the United States would do. We called the Assistant Secretary to our committee to talk about that. He indicated, no, that wasn't true, there were no commitments made. In fact, I think there were. 
Now we move on to the meeting in Bonn, which will go on almost immediately, and then the Kyoto meeting to take place something over a month from now. 
So this is the result of a good long time in planning and a good long time in difficulty in trying to bring together the issues as they relate to developed countries, as they relate to developing countries. 
The President has finally made somewhat of an understandable statement. 
We have not had that before. 
Just 2 weeks ago we had another hearing in our committee, brought the Assistant Secretary on Global Affairs to talk to us, asked specific questions about what they had in mind without any specific answers. There was no response from the administration's witness. 
So now the President has come forth with statements. That is good. We should have had them some time before, statements which he indicates--and I quote--`Would be painless and even economically beneficial.' Of course that is what he would say. Many people disagree with that, including myself. I cannot imagine that whatever we do that is meaningful is going to `be painless and economically beneficial.' But specifically, of course we have not had time to analyze the full thing. 
It talks about reaching 1990 levels by the year 2010, emission levels that occurred in 1990, reaching back to those by 2010, with some cap by 2008. And then to move below the 1990 levels by 2020. He calls that a fairly modest proposal. 
Interesting how often these things are set out. I think if you go back, you find that the air quality statutes were given a great deal of time before implementation, so the argument was, `Don't worry, don't worry about some regulation. Don't worry about the cost because it's way out in the future.' I do not think that is a good recommendation. 
We should worry about what the impacts are on the economy, what the impacts are on costs, what the impacts are on our ability to compete in the world and worry about them regardless of the fact that they are out there. 
China, on the other hand, and some of the other countries that are developing countries, ask for a 15 percent reduction from the 1990 levels by 2010, a 7.5 percent reduction by 2025, 7.5 below 1990. Remember, the President said we will not reach 1990 until 2010. The Chinese and their group also want a 35 percent reduction from 1990 levels by the year 2020. 
The problem, of course, is, as we go into this negotiation--and those who are involved say, `Well, they've set the parameters, somehow the results will be between these two.' That is kind of scary. The President is saying, this is where we are. They are saying, we want to be way up here. And probably they will end up somewhere in between. 
I go back to the action of the Senate which 95 to nothing said we will not accept a treaty that does the kinds of things that we have already talked about. 
So, Mr. President, I know this is a difficult problem. But I agree with my friend, the Senator from Idaho. We have done a good job of emissions. 
I have been to China several times, and I can tell you, if you want to look forward to where the emissions problems are going to be, it is going to be there in those developing countries. 
I think we need to make the changes that we want to have happen in our country, encourage others. But I am very concerned about us going to this meeting in Kyoto and coming out seeking to agree to the kinds of things that have been set forth by the developing countries who wish not to have any containment put on theirs. 
So we are looking for a fair agreement. We are looking for some kind of an arrangement that will allow us to continue to do what we have done and we are proud of doing. 
I think, Mr. President, that you need to be more specific than you have been with this idea that we want you to do some things, and then we will decide later what the reimbursement is going to be, we will decide later what the incentives are going to be, which I understand is what the President said yesterday. 
So I think we need to continue. And I want to say to my friend from Nebraska that he has done an excellent job of holding hearings, taking positions, following this issue, which is one of the most important issues to the future of the country. And I commend him for that and join with him. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the floor to talk a little bit about the summit that is coming up soon--as a matter of fact, the 29th and 30th of this month. President Jiang Zemin of China will visit Washington to have a summit meeting with President Clinton. It is a good time I think for us to do two things. One is to think a little bit about our role with respect to the summit, our role as Congress. Another is that it is a good time for us to take another look at our policy and our bilateral relationships and reevaluate both of those with respect to China and its goals. 
As chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asia and Pacific Affairs, this relationship, of course, and its ramifications in the future, its impact on the United States and the world is something that is very important to me. East Asia, of course, will be a source of one of our most important economic and strategy challenges as we move into the next century. China, with 1.2 billion people and an increasingly expanding economy, will continue, and increasingly, to be a center of attention in Asia. To adequately meet those kinds of challenges, obviously, why, we need to continue to articulate and develop a workable policy with respect to China and then, of course, to all of the countries in Asia. 
This administration has and continues to refer to our China policy as a constructive engagement, which has a nice sound, a nice ring to it, but I am not sure anybody really knows what that means. Apparently, it can mean whatever one would like it to mean. If you ask 10 or 12 different people, each of them might give you a different explanation of what it is. Moreover, and probably even more important, the Chinese do not know what constructive engagement means. Many of them are not persuaded and talk often about the idea that our relationship with China is one of containment, which it really is not. 
So I think it is a good opportunity to make clear what our policy is with respect to China. And it seems to me that that policy ought to reflect those things that are of concern to us, those things that are important to us, those things that will over time allow us to have a relationship with China. I happened to have the opportunity to visit there in August. Most of the leadership was at the coast because of the summertime, but I did go there and visit with the Foreign Minister. We talked a good deal about the upcoming summit and what it is that it might be. 
I was, and am still, a bit concerned that when you have a summit there may be a compelling interest among the administration people to be able to announce great things at the summit, which would be fine if, indeed, they are based on the kind of arrangements and the kind of agreements that really need to be made in order to have great things to announce. It would be a shame, on the other hand, if we rushed to agreement on some things and came up with unsatisfactory agreements simply in order to make the summit look as good as it should. 
I agreed with the Foreign Minister that, indeed, it would be better to just have a summit to help our relationships, to talk about problems, if that is all we could do, than to have some artificial arrangements made in order to make some announcements. 
So I think that is a little bit where we are. One of the things that I believe is important is that the Congress should be involved. In most countries like China and Indonesia that have a different system, of course, the people do not really understand that Congress has something to do with foreign policy, that Congress is involved in foreign policy. That is not the case in most countries. So I am hopeful, and I am now fairly confident, there will be some congressional involvement in this summit. 
One of the things I am glad has not occurred, however, as sometimes does is that--of course, we are free here and should speak out on whatever we want--often you see a whole series of sense-of-the-Congress resolutions that are not very conducive to having a good meeting--some of them saying, well, if you do not behave, we will take away your visas and all that sort of business, which may have merit but it does not seem it is useful as we come up to a summit with the intention to try to improve the relationships we have. I think those things are counterproductive, as is the case generally with sanctions; sanctions do not work. There are less than a handful of objectives that the Chinese simply can't get somewhere else. We have sanctions on something when they are bargaining with Boeing for 777's and they go to France and buy Airbuses. That is kind of the way that works. We hurt our own relationship for no positive reason. 
Now, I am not an apologist for China. There are many things that are being done there that we think should be done differently, many things that are being done there that are not consistent with our values, but I think probably as important as anything, if China wishes to be part of the family of business in the world, then there are some rules they have to abide by or else they are not part of the family. Countries have to stay with agreements that they have, the contracts they have. 
So there are many things that make it more difficult to embrace people in the international community. In the case of China, there are concerns about Tibet, concerns about human rights, religious persecution, rule of law, intellectual property rights, relationships with Taiwan. All of those things are concerns. But the issue is how do we best deal with them. Nobody denies that there are problems we have to deal with, but as in the case of most favored nation, then you say I understand the problem. The question is how do we best deal with it. Do we best deal with it by standing away? Do we best deal with it by sanctions? Or do we best deal with it by articulating a foreign policy and then saying we are going to stay with that policy? I believe that is the best answer for us. 
There are a number of things that ought to be talked about, I believe, at this summit. I have met with Sandy Berger, who is the President's adviser and the person I think most responsible for the meeting, who seems also to be in tune with this. There are about four real issues that I hope are talked about very candidly and talked about in depth. One is nuclear proliferation --the idea of parts shipped to Pakistan, the idea that Iran and the PRC have a nuclear cooperation agreement, changes to domestic law to prevent dual use. These kinds of things. Now, we are in the course of the President certifying that these things are not in fact happening, and I hope they are not. But we need to talk about that. We need to have an understanding. We need to be able to have visibility to see if, indeed, that is happening. 
Another is human rights. I think we need to continue to speak out about religious freedom. We need to continue to speak out about personal freedom. Those are our values. We are not going to be able to tell everybody else how to live, but we can promote values that we believe are important. And among those at the top is human rights. 
Trade. China, of course, wants to belong to the World Trade Organization, and I, indeed, hope they do. I think it would be better for us so that when you have trade problems, it is not a unilateral kind of thing but, indeed, would fall within the purview of the World Trade Organization. And some measures could be put on by other countries as well as ours. 
Finally, security. We have had good cooperation from the PRC with regard to North Korea. But one of the reasons that we are involved as we are in China and in Asia is, of course, to stabilize the security of this part of the world, which is terribly important to us. I think we have been relatively successful in doing that. 
Mr. President, as this summit comes close, I am pleased that the Congress is somewhat involved. I am actually pleased that these have kind of been four issues that at least the National Security Council has set forth. I hope we have honest, candid talks with the President of China. I hope we say in very understandable terms what our policy is in regard to human rights, in understandable terms what our policy is with regard to trade. We obviously have to open up China so that our trade deficit doesn't worsen. 
So we have real problems to resolve. We do not resolve them by simply saying we are going to have `constructive engagement.' I think we need to be specific on a relatively small number of things that are important to us and then, by golly, stick with them. If we have an agreement on intellectual property and it is not adhered to, then we need to do something about it. We should not try to run everything that everybody else does in another country, but those things that are important to us I think we ought to stay with. I look forward to the summit. I hope it is a useful one. I hope it contributes to world peace. I hope it contributes to stability in world trade and perhaps most of all the improvement of human rights in that part of the world.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I came back this week after our recess very enthusiastic about moving forward on ISTEA. The people in my State are very anxious about it. It is an important issue to us, the funding of Federal highways. Our State, of course, has lots of highways and not too many people. 
I must tell you I am disappointed we are not moving along a little faster on something I think is probably the highest priority that we have now before we adjourn for the fall, the funding of our Interstate Highway Program in the ISTEA. I hope we do find a way to move forward with it. It seems like it is discouraging to us, discouraging to the American people, when we find ourselves in gridlock here in the Senate, not able to do the kind of things we want to do, the kind of things that people want us to do, the kind of things that we came here to do. 
In the meantime, however, I did want to give my thanks to our chairman, Senator Chafee, and our ranking member, Senator Baucus, for the work they have done to bring this bill to the floor. It is a bill that is not easy to manage, certainly, because it affects everyone. 
Everyone has a little different idea of what the formula distribution ought to be. I understand that. But they have, with the support of their committee, come to this floor with a bill that is, I think, a very good bill. It is one of the things that has changed America, this idea of having an Interstate Highway System. The current ISTEA has made some important changes through the years on surface transportation, but now we are moving forward into another changing time. The President has used for several years the metaphor of a bridge to the 21st century. This is, literally, a bridge to the 21st century. This is literally a movement through our transportation system to the 21st century. 
No one would argue this bill is perfect. It does not fit everybody's view of what it ought to be, but none do. This one is good and it is close. It will create some new rules of the road that I think serve the national interest and will help us to build highways and bridges to the 21st century. 
First, ISTEA is what it says, a national interstate transportation system. That means that it goes clear across the country. That means a great deal to the people in Wyoming. We are what you call a bridge State. We are between the east and the west coast. We are between the heavily populated areas. Of course, to get from here to there, you have to go through Wyoming, or Kansas, either of us which is a great treat. 
Interestingly enough, Wyoming taxpayers contribute more to the highway trust fund per person than any taxpayers in the country--it is because we do have lots of roads--nearly $200 per person. Yet we have, as do others, a deteriorating highway system, and roads and bridges that are, at best, in fair to poor condition. 
We are not satisfying national needs, either. The U.S. Department of Transportation reports this country only invests about 70 percent of what it needs to be investing in the infrastructure to maintain it. These shortfalls hurt us all as taxpayers. What we need is a set of efficient and well-maintained roads that interconnect cities. They are as important as cities. They are a part of how we export our goods and transfer business throughout the country. ISTEA makes smooth movement of people and merchandise throughout the year. 
We have a couple of areas that are difficult. One, of course, is to find the level of spending that is correct. We have, through the years, not spent as much on Federal highways as we take in in Federal highway funds, for obvious reasons. One is to help balance the budget. There will be arguments about that, and certainly we would like to spend more money, take more money out of the fund and put it into the place for which it was taxed. It will be controversial. And part of the problem is maintaining our commitment to a balanced budget. The other is the formula through which the dollars that are spent are allocated throughout the country in various States. Each of us seeks to do the best we can for our State. I understand that. 
This bill, I believe, achieves a fair funding formula. It recognizes a national system. There is an area which I have special concern that I intend to raise during the course of this and that is our Federal parks. We have considered Federal lands, and in the bill they are considered, including Indian reservations, including BLM lands, and it includes forest lands. I have to tell you the one that I think stands out the most are the national parks, for several reasons. 
One reason is forests and BLM get some cooperation and coordination with counties and States to help build roads in those areas, but the national parks do not. National parks are responsible for national park roads in national parks. They belong to all the people of this country. In addition, those who drive in the parks, and there are many miles there, each of them 
are taxed for every mile that goes into the Federal program. About 40 percent of existing parks and roads and bridges are in poor or failed condition. There is approximately $1.8 billion backlog in national park needs for roads--$1.8 billion. Yellowstone Park, the largest park in our State and indeed the country, has road needs of $250 million. It will receive only $8 million under the current law. The U.S. Department of Transportation and the National Park Service estimate that a minimum of $161 million annually should be spent on park roads. 
So we take a small step toward resolving that problem. I think we need to take a larger one. I hope we will give some consideration to that. I expect to explore those opportunities.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we have spent several days recently and this week talking about campaign finance. I would like to share some of my thoughts. It is one of those issues that have become so complicated and so convoluted that it seems to me it is very difficult for a person to really bring it down to the simple basics, particularly if you haven't listened to all of it. 
Proponents of campaign finance reform bills will have you believe this is the top issue and in the interest of Americans, that everyone on Main Street is waiting breathlessly for some significant action that would be more important than tax relief or the balanced budget--no. I think that is not so. When I go back to Wyoming nearly every week, people don't come and talk to me about campaign finance. They want to discuss health care, they want to discuss public lands, they want to discuss taxes. 
This is not to say that it is not important, certainly not to say that I am against finance reform, because I think there should be some thoughtful changes in terms of campaign financing. I just don't believe that it is a catastrophic issue. I don't believe it is an issue that is the most important thing on our agenda as it sometimes is termed. 
The steam behind the issue, as a matter of fact, is generally that of enforcing the laws that are now on the books. That is what the hearings were about. That is what brought it up. It is not new laws that are needed--enforce the ones that are now there, not merely adding more to be unenforced. 
I am in favor of campaign finance reform. I have been very involved in political systems, as a matter of fact, long before I was ever in elective office, because it seemed to me over a period of years that it is pretty clear that politics and campaigns are how we govern ourselves. That is how you and I in our precincts decide the big issues in terms of government. So I just think we need to make it the kind of a process in which people can be involved, the kind of a process in which the first amendment opportunities to speak are there and are extended to everyone--not just limited to the press. 
On the other hand, we can't overlook the defects we saw in the last campaign cycle. The answer, however, is not to marshal the powers of the Federal Government and increase governmental intervention. We can reintroduce principle, we can introduce integrity and serious compliance into this important function of governing ourselves by strengthening and enforcing the reporting and disclosure laws, by limiting the influence of soft money on the national level, by requiring that a majority of the funds in a campaign come from the district in which the election takes place, by banning compulsory contributions. 
I don't think we ought to pass a bill just because we want to go through the rhetorical process, just because we want to shift the attention from not adhering to the law to writing new laws. 
We are talking about being home, and I hear more than anything else in Wyoming, `Wait a minute, the issue is not new law; the issue is enforcing the laws we have.' I think disclosure is the most important of the election issues. In that case, voters can determine where the money comes from to go to a candidate and make their own judgment as to whether or not that is reasonable. It is a simple way to bring our system of privately financed campaigns on track by strengthening and enforcing existing disclosure laws. 
Privately financed--I think it is a mistake to move more and more to how the taxpayers finance campaigns. It seems to me that has proven not to be useful. Candidates in parties must offer fuller and more timely disclosure of campaign receipts and spending activities. Reports must be prompt and early. Now there is a period of time between the last reporting and the election in which donations and contributions are not reported until after the election is over. That is wrong. We ought to change that. Candidates' reports are often late and partial and voters are kept from knowing what they should know about contributions prior to the time of voting. People need to be better informed. We can do that and we should. 
Soft money--I am concerned about the increased amount of soft money being spent on a national level. I say again, I was very involved in my party prior to being elected, and I saw us use money of that kind to do things that I thought were useful, and continue to think are useful--party building, voter identification, voter registration, getting people to vote and participate in government. That is what soft money is for. 
Unfortunately, the receipts for campaigns have increased some 200 percent from the 1992 Presidential election to the 1996 cycle. That is a little scary. That is a lot. This money is not subject to the kind of disclosure requirements and restrictions in the kind of things that so-called hard money is. Voters have the right to be suspect of this kind of dough, it seems to me, since there are really not stringent accountability standards. We must develop, I think, a contribution limit on 
soft money. It doesn't need to be small. It can be healthy, but it should not be unlimited, and it should be for party building. 
We talk sometimes disdainfully about politics. Politics is how we govern ourselves. That is how you and I who live in our precincts are able to make an impact. I feel very strongly about that. 
Fundraising in the district--pretty evident that is the important thing. I support the idea of having at least 50 percent of the money that goes into the campaign come from the district from which the candidate runs. 
Now, I am the first to admit--and that is one of the difficulties with all kinds of election controls and election restrictions--there are ways to go around that. In my State there are large companies that run mines, for example, that contribute to campaigns from out-of-state headquarters. They will simply contribute from instate headquarters, and it will be the same money. But, nevertheless it is important. I think there is a great shift of money from one place to another outside of the eligible voters, simply because of interests that are somewhere else, that go to this campaign. I suggest that at least 50 percent come from the area in which the candidates come. 
Compulsory dues being used for campaigns I think is a real mistake. Labor unions are the only ones that really are able to do that. I think it certainly ought to be voluntary on the part of the member whether or not those dues are used for that purpose. There are some polls recently that say that is greatly supported, 4 to 1, by members of unions. I think that is right. They should not be restricted from using their money for that purpose if they choose to, but they need to choose. 
Mr. President, in summary, voting is one of the highest privileges of being a citizen. Not only is it a privilege, it is an obligation and a responsibility if we are to have a government of the people, by the people and for the people, then the people must participate, must be given an opportunity to participate. 
It is ironic to me, it seems to me we are in a time where we have the technical ability to have more information available to more people than ever in history. Can you imagine what it was like to vote 100 years ago? How much do you think people knew about national elections? Very little, I suspect. Now we know anything that happens in the world, and we know it in 10 minutes. Yet we seem not to have the kind of participation that we really ought to have in a citizen government. That is what we ought to be striving to have as we deal with election finance--voters being responsible, voters fulfilling their obligation, voters being knowledgeable, and voters being able to choose. 
One of the real meaningful ways, of course, is that individuals can contribute to that point of view that they support. We should work hard to ensure that campaign system is free of some of its current laws and yet open and free and not governed in every detail by some bureau somewhere that decides what you can say in an ad. Those kind of things are not useful and, indeed in my opinion, move us in the wrong direction. 
I hope we continue to work on this issue. I hope we do some things. I hope we stay away from the convoluted notion that we ought to have somebody in some bureaucracy, somewhere, manage all of the election activities. Here again, these kind of things belong in our communities, they belong in our States, they belong in our towns, they belong in our school boards. That is where they ought to be. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will speak briefly on a subject that is part of the bill that is before the Senate, part of the bill on Interior. It has to do with the New World Mine. It has to do with the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
I rise to support the language that is in the Interior appropriations bill requiring that any expenditures out of the Land and Water Conservation Fund to be used for the purchase of the New World Mine must be authorized by the authorizing committee. That is also true of the Headwaters Forest. 
There is some notion that there was an agreement during the debate on the budget with the administration that these funds would be available for authorization. I think it was clear the other day when the Senator from New Mexico came to the floor and spoke and indicated that there was no such agreement. I am here to congratulate the committee on that. 
First let me make a couple of points clear. One is, I oppose the development of the New World Mine. I was one of the first elected officials to oppose that. There are some places, in my view, that are inappropriate for mining. I think this is one of them. It is true they were in the middle of EIS when the agreement was made to stop the mine, but nevertheless I have opposed that long before the President signed the agreement and came to Yellowstone Park with great fanfare and stopped the development of the New World Mine. I had opposed that. So despite the rhetoric that is coming out of the White House and is coming out of the CEQ at the White House, there was not an agreement, there was not an agreement for the expenditure of this money. 
This is not an issue of whether you want to protect Yellowstone or whether you don't. We all want to do that. No one wants to preserve it certainly more than I. I grew up just outside of Yellowstone, 25 miles out of the east entrance. I spent my boyhood there. I understand the area. I am also chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, and we worked very hard and will continue to have a plan to strengthen the park and to save parks. So that is not the issue. That is not the issue. 
We will have before this Senate, as a matter of fact, at the beginning of next year, a plan called Vision 20/20 which is designed to increase the revenues that are available to parks, to do something about this $5 million in arrears in terms of facilities. So I am committed to the parks and I can guarantee you that we will have a program to do that. 
What this involves is a commitment on the part of the administration, a commitment on the part of the White House, a commitment on the part of Miss McGinty at CEQ who has become the political guru for White House natural resources to do what they indicated they would do. 
Let me read just a little bit from the agreement that was made in Yellowstone Park on the 12th day of August 1996, between Crown Butte Mines, Crown Butte Resources, Northwest Wyoming Resource Council, and a number of others and the United States of America.  
Objectives of the parties. 
As set forth in greater specificity below, the objectives of the Parties in entering into this agreement are to: (a) provide for the transfer by Crown Butte to the United States of the District Property in exchange for property interests owned by the United States having a value of $65 million; * * * 
2. The United States will, as expeditiously as possible, identify Exchange Property with a fair market value of $65 million that is available and appropriate for exchange for the District Property. 
That is what it says in the agreement. That is what is agreed to. That is what everyone thought we were doing. 
The reversal now is the White House is saying well, there was an agreement that we will take cash out of the Land and Water Conservation Fund for these items. That is not what the agreement was. There was not an agreement to do that. We are saying the White House should live up to the agreement that they signed back on August 12 of this year. 
They have claimed no property to be found. I can't believe that. I have talked to the owners of the mine and they are willing to accept most any property that they could sell and turn into cash. So that is what it is all about. 
I believe the current language in the appropriations bill is correct. There is $700 million authorized in the Land and Water Conservation Fund but the expenditure is not simply left to the discretion of the administration but, in fact, the committees of jurisdiction have an opportunity, indeed, have a responsibility for the authorization. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. 
The business of timber and timber harvest is very important to my State. I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by the Senator from Nevada. I think the amendment is not about subsidies; it is about the elimination of the timber program in our national forests. 
The timber program is part of a healthy forest. Somehow there has to be some changes made in a forest that either burns or is harvested or is eaten by insects. This would terminate that kind of thing. 
Furthermore, this is a policy issue that I believe ought to be talked about in our committee of jurisdiction, ought to be talked about in the forest plan, not one that ought to be talked about here in terms of doing it on an appropriations bill. 
Let me just say, the Senator has suggested there are winners and winners. There are losers. Those losers happen to be schools, school districts, counties, small family businesses, and recreationists. 
This, I think, has been called a subsidy. It is actually not a subsidy. Purchaser credits are an accounting method used by the Forest Service. If the cost of the road was not in there, the bid, of course, for the timber would be less. If the cost that they have appropriated and allocated to it is more than it should be, that ought to be fixed by the Forest Service. 
But, Mr. President, let me just say finally, because I know there is not much time, that this amendment really does not have anything to do with the critical issues facing the Forest Service. It is just the opposite, by depleting desperately needed road funding while reducing essential money to county road programs and school districts, as well as thousands of jobs and recreational opportunities for all Americans. 
I urge my colleagues not to support this amendment. 
I thank you very much for your time.

Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I come to the floor to introduce a piece of legislation which I will submit. It is called the State and Local Participation Act of 1997. 
What I would like to do, Madam President, is to introduce a bill that would provide for the opportunity for State, local, and county agencies to participate in the National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA]. This bill is to guarantee that local agencies have an opportunity to be identified as cooperating agencies in the NEPA process, as it takes place in the various locations throughout the country. All of us know that NEPA was passed in the late 1960's, designed to provide for full study before activities are undertaken which affect the environment, and I support that idea. It has been an interesting topic over the years. NEPA, of course, is a relatively small, simple piece of legislation--less than three pages, which is unusual in this place, to have a bill that is that short. But fortunately or unfortunately, over the period of the 20 years or more that have gone since the introduction and passage of this bill, a great many changes have been made, not by amendment, not even by regulation, but in fact by court decisions. So now we have a very complicated, very expensive, very time-consuming process that is still designed, as it was originally, to make sure that studies are completed, EIS's are completed--environmental impact statements or environmental assessments, whichever is appropriate. I support that idea. But we have been very involved, in our committee, Energy and Natural Resources--been very involved in my State of Wyoming in the use of NEPA to provide for mineral exploration, to provide for roads in the public areas, to provide for grazing, to provide for the number of uses that take place on public lands. 
As you can imagine, when you have a State that is 50 percent public lands, these kinds of processes are particularly important. We want to maintain them. We want to strengthen them, in fact. After 20 years of experience, there are some things that we can change. So NEPA was designed to ensure the environmental impacts of proposed actions are considered and minimized by the Federal agency that is responsible for taking the action. 
It is also designed to provide for adequate public participation in that decision, in the decision process that is undertaken by the Federal agencies. This sounds pretty simple. As a matter of fact, it sounds pretty basic and reasonable. And it is. Unfortunately, the regulations--have caused it to be something other than simple. 
For example, we had the question of exploring for gas in an area north of Casper, WY--a relatively small area. It would have made a great deal of difference to that county in terms of employment, a great deal of difference to that county in terms of tax base and all the things that affect a community. So the county commissioners felt as if they ought to be a part of this process, and I certainly agreed with them. They had more knowledge about that than any other agency, they had more caring about that than any other agency, yet this area was in their county so they also cared, of course, equally as much about taking care of the environment and the natural resources. 
Unfortunately the BLM, in this instance, would not make this county commission a cooperating agency. And they turned to the current law which says, basically, `Prior to making any detailed statement, the responsible Federal official shall consult and obtain the comments of Federal agencies which have jurisdiction.' 
We are simply suggesting that there be added the words, `and State and county agencies.' So it would read, `. . . obtain the comments of Federal and State agencies and counties which have jurisdiction.' We think that is a reasonable thing to do. I think it is a reasonable thing to do. As a matter of fact, most people think it is a reasonable thing to do. 
We also had a forest study that is now underway, in the Medicine Bow Forest, in Wyoming. I talked to the regional forester. And we had another forest in the Black Hills where the 
counties and local people were not made a cooperating agency. So the regional director said, `Yes, this one we will.' Unfortunately, when it came to it, they didn't. And they put them in, in some other category, but not as a cooperating agency. And as a cooperating agency you can participate with the Federal agencies, put your comments in the report rather than just submitting them as any other citizen. 
So that is basically what we do with this legislation. It is designed to provide for greater input of State and local governments in the NEPA process. This measure will be known as the State and Local Government Participation Act of 1997. It will simply guarantee that States and counties are given an opportunity to participate, and participate in the decisions that affect the areas over which they have jurisdiction, whether it be in New York, whether it be in Wyoming, whether it be in Texas. 
Madam President, I would like also to have unanimous consent that Senator Craig, from Idaho, be listed also as a sponsor.

Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair very much for the time. I certainly urge my associates in the Senate to take a look at this opportunity to provide for one of the things that we talk about as much as anything in this Senate, and that is providing local input into the decisions that are made by the Federal Government. Let me tell you, that is particularly important to those of us from the West--Idaho, Nevada. In Nevada, some 80 percent of the land in Nevada belongs to the Federal Government. So the decisions that are made on Federal lands by Federal agencies have a tremendous impact on the future of those States and the future of the economy, and on the future of citizens. It is my belief, and the belief of many others, that local governments, the people that have been elected from these areas, should be participating, cooperating agencies in the determination of the NEPA arrangement. We think that is what this bill will do and we certainly urge support for it.

Mr. THOMAS. I will talk for just a few minutes on the bill before the Senate. Of course, we are talking about the Labor, HHS, Education bill, one of the largest bills before the Senate. As a matter of fact, a total of about $270 billion of expenditure. Only about $80 billion of that are we really discussing because that is discretionary. The rest are entitlements. 
However, I do think it is illustrative of one of the things I feel very strongly about, and that is the opportunity to have oversight on the expenditure of large amounts of tax money, or small amounts for that matter. 
I want to make it clear that I will support this bill. I think the appropriations folks have worked hard on it. I have no particular quarrel with what they have done, but I want to make a point that it seems to me this system needs to be reviewed. The system needs to be changed. I cannot think of another institution in the civilized world that spends $270 billion annually and has no more oversight than we do in the U.S. Congress. We have a remedy for that. We think we ought to go to a biannual budget so that we would do this on a 2-year basis, which has some advantages. It allows the agencies to know what their funds will be for a longer period of time. But more importantly, in this instance it allows the Congress to have some oversight of the efficiency of the spending of these dollars. 
For example, Mr. President, we are talking here about drug abuse prevention and treatment programs, $2.8 billion. I am for that. We certainly need drug abuse prevention and treatment programs. But how are they working? Is the $2.7 billion giving us the kind of results we hoped it would? I do not think we know that. Now, certainly there is some oversight. 
We are also talking about Head Start, $4.3 billion for Head Start. I am a fan of Head Start. I think it is a program that brings young people, in their early formative ages, into a position of having some hope, to help form their lives. Is it doing the job? Are we spending the money as efficiently as we might? Are the dollars going to the people that really need the help? I do not know that. I do not know that. 
Job Corps; I am not a particular fan of Job Corps. Nevertheless, we are spending $1.3 billion on Job Corps. What are the results? What are we doing? Who is being helped? Is the help getting there? What is the administrative cost and the overhead? 
It seems to me those are things that we ought to be as interested in as we are in providing funding for the programs, and I think taxpayers are entitled to have that kind of oversight. 
Individuals for Disabilities Education, IDEA. I am very, very impressed with that. My wife is a special ed teacher. I was chairman of the Disabilities Council in Wyoming. There is nothing more important. But the question is, are we spending the money as well as we might? I find some administrators in schools who say, `Look, we have to change this or we will never be able to afford the kinds of services for the handicapped because we are always in court,' and we do everything to avoid courts. 
If that is the case, it seems to me we ought to take a long look at what is happening to the bucks. Who are they going to? Are they as efficient as they possibly could be? Are the regulatory constraints something that disallow the efficient spending of this money? 
With respect to the Government Performance and Results Act, which I also support and think may have some merit, this is to improve the management of Federal agencies, to require emphasis on planning, hopefully on results. Planning, I hope has in it measurable activities so we can see if we are making progress. Here is what the committee says: `We were encouraged the Federal agencies are making an effort to fulfill their requirements.' Frankly, Mr. President, that is not good enough--we are hopeful they are making an effort to fulfill the requirements. Give me a break. We are spending $280 billion, $70 billion on the things we are talking about here in discretionary spending. 
Let me make it clear one more time that I am not opposed to these ideas. These are programs we need to have but we also need to have oversight. We need to make as sure as we can, as the U.S. Congress, that those dollars are producing the best results that we possibly can. 
I hope we will take a long look--I think we should--at the idea of biannual budgeting, and give us an opportunity to have oversight. The authorizing committee should, in fact, have the opportunity to do that.

 Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who has dedicated his time, efforts and immeasurable talents to Wyoming politics. I am speaking of Byra Kite, whom I have known and respected for many years, and have had the pleasure of having as a member of my staff since I joined the Senate in 1994. 
Byra is retiring, and I would like to take this time to publicly thank him for all his hard work. He has served Wyoming well, and I am not alone in saying he is one of our State's finest sons. 
In 1965, Byra came to the Cowboy State from California to play football for the University of Wyoming. During that time, he was an All-Conference and All-American member of three conference champion teams, including the undefeated 1967 Cowboy team that played in the Sugar Bowl. Later this year, that team will be inducted into the University of Wyoming Hall of Fame. Following graduation he decided to stay in Wyoming. In Laramie he found his home, and his passion for politics. 
He made his first foray into the national political arena in 1976 when he managed Malcolm Wallop's initial run for the Senate. Malcolm won, defeating a three term incumbent senator, and Byra began a 20 year career of helping Wyoming Republicans shape their campaigns and win elections. His tireless work, dedication and vision broke new ground in terms of modern campaigning. 
In 1977 Byra began 18 years of service as Senator Wallop's State Director. During that time he helped hundreds of Wyoming folks in their dealings with the federal government. Following Malcolm's retirement, Byra joined our staff, and continued his outstanding brand of public service to Wyoming people. He, and his talents, will truly be missed. 
And so, Mr. President, I am joined by Senators Wallop, Simpson, Enzi and Representative Barbara Cubin--all of whom have been touched by Byra's hard work and dedication--in saying not only thank you, but good luck to a trusted advisor and friend.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support and, as an original cosponsor, of Senate Resolution 98, the Byrd-Hagel global warming resolution. 
I want to thank the Senate leadership and Senators Byrd and Hagel, for scheduling floor time for this important initiative before negotiators begin talks in Bonn, Germany. 
The administration's current go-at-it-alone plan regarding global climate change is grossly unfair to the United States. 
I am opposed to setting legally binding targets and timetables on the United States and other developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while at the same time exempting China, Mexico, Brazil, South Korea, and India from those identical regulations. 
This will only worsen the problem the administration claims it wants to fix. 
Developing countries are projected to continue increasing their use of fossil fuels. 
And by the year 2015, China alone is expected to surpass the United States in total carbon emissions. 
The Clinton administration's plan will also drive the economy down and send jobs overseas. 
The AFL-CIO estimates that between 1.25 and 1.5 million American jobs would go overseas. 
And the plan would put the United States at a severe competitive disadvantage and reduce our GDP by $200 billion. 
Nevertheless, the administration--led by Under Secretary of State Tim Wirth--is on a mad rush to sign a legally binding treaty in Kyoto, Japan, this December. 
This is in spite of: 
Uncertain global warming science; 
The administration's unwillingness to reveal its final targets and timetables for emissions reductions; and 
The fact that they have now thrown out their economic analysis models, which were supposed to help guide policy makers. 
The Byrd-Hagel resolution addresses these discrepancies. 
It would direct the United States not to sign any agreement that would: 
`Mandate new commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions, unless it also mandates specific scheduled commitments to reduce gas emissions for developing countries within the same compliance period'; and 
`Result in serious harm to the economy of the United States.' 
Sixty-four of my colleagues have cosponsored this initiative and I urge their support of this resolution. 
Mr. President, I strongly encourage the administration to listen to the concerns being expressed by this Chamber. 
Be honest with us and the American people, and realize that we will not ratify any treaty which commits the United States to one set of standards to reduce gas emissions, but will let China, India, Mexico, and other developing countries off the hook. 
We ought to focus on bringing all of the countries of the world to the table. Everyone ought to contribute to the cause. 
Asking all nations to contribute--within the same compliance period--will help the environment and help U.S. industries stay competitive.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I intend between now and 11 to be joined by several of my colleagues to talk about, I think, two of the issues the Senator from Georgia has talked about. One of them that is most important for us, tax relief--I appreciate his comments. The other currently is the hearings that are being held with respect to the illegal contributions for campaigns. These, I think, at least at the moment, are two of the most important issues that face the Congress, two of the most important issues, obviously, that face the American people.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask the Senator if he is aware that the subcommittee is now in the process of seeking to put together a plan, a long-term plan? All of us who understand that parks and their resources are one of the most valuable resources that we have, that there are troublesome things happening and frankly there is no plan in place and we need to have one--we need to talk about finances. There needs to be some additional resources for finances in addition to the appropriations. We need to talk about how we do some bonding, how we do some private investment, how we do some other kinds of things. In addition, we need to talk about the concessionaires. We need to get that straightened out so it moves. We need to talk, frankly, about the management of the parks so we have a plan that has measurable results so the plans that are set for the Nation will also be applied in the parks. And we have invited the administration to participate. 
Fortunately, this morning we have a nominee for the Park Service. We have not had a Park Service Director. So I want to assure the Senator that there is underway an effort to basically reform and move forward and, also, I forgot to say, to have something that defines more clearly what kind of a park is appropriate to be part of the National System so we are not taking in what is more appropriately local recreation areas to be managed by the National Park Service. 
So I couldn't share more the concerns that people have, but I wanted to tell my colleague that we are moving forward with that and intend to have a plan before this Congress by the end of the year.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I bring to the floor and to this bill an amendment which was offered last year and adopted by a bipartisan vote of 59 to 39 but was trimmed out of the omnibus appropriations bill. It has to do with the question of the Federal Government competing unfairly with private firms; agencies performing commercial, rather than inherently governmental, activities for other agencies. My amendment requires Federal agencies to demonstrate that they can perform more efficiently and effectively than the private sector before providing commercially available goods and services to other agencies. 
It has been the Federal Government's policy for over 40 years that it should not compete with the private sector. In fact, the Government should rely on the private sector to supply commercially available goods and services. However, this policy is too often ignored. 
For example, the Defense Science Board calculates that out of 850,000 full-time positions needed to provide commercial services for the military, 640,000 are held by Federal employees instead of private sector contractors. 
The Clinton administration has taken this situation one step further. Last year, OMB came out with a policy that grandfathers existing interservice support agreements from cost-comparison requirements. This change permits one Federal agency to provide goods and services to another agency regardless of cost or performance. This new policy gives Federal agencies until October 1997 to go out and recruit business from other agencies without performing a cost comparison and cost analysis. The administration implicitly argues that this entrepreneurial approach to Government will save the taxpayers money. 
However, if they don't do a cost comparison, how do they know it saves money? Some examples of existing interservice support agreements are aerial photography, mapping services, laboratory services, printing services, all of which are often provided more efficiently and more cost-effectively in the private sector. 
For example, in Jacksonville, FL, the Navy Public Works Division recently completed a state-of-the-art environmental lab to provide routine hazardous waste characterizations. These services are already available in the private sector, and the Navy intends to offer their services to other agencies. 
In Alaska last year, the State struggled to contain a large wildfire. The CIA provided needed mapping and satellite imagery. A private company was available to do the work, but they were never asked. 
These are just a few of the examples of direct Government competition with the private sector without a cost comparison. 
I want to emphasize that I am not insisting that the Federal Government use the private sector. It simply needs to compare public and private sector production to ensure the American taxpayer gets the best value goods and services, the most bang for their buck. 
Encouraging the Federal Government to compete with the private sector is philosophically wrong. Almost all of us stand up here day after day and talk about let's have less Government, reduce the size of Government, reduce the cost of Government, strengthen the private sector and, yet, continually allow this to go on. It is philosophically wrong. It hurts small business. 
In fact, the three White House Conferences on Small Business rate this as a top concern, the ability to compete for public contracts. 
Unfair Government competition with the private sector costs the taxpayers money. Numerous studies have shown that outsourcing can save the Government up to $30 billion annually. It also circumvents the appropriations process. If an agency can do work for another agency, it is likely that its resources and employees are larger than it needs to be and needs to be cut back. 
On the other hand, if an agency's appropriation is cut, it recruits business. That also circumvents the appropriations' process and the idea of focusing on priorities. 
Most of all, the policy is contrary to current law. This policy is merely a rule from the OMB supplemental handbook A-76. But it violates the Economy Act, which specifically states that one agency can provide goods and services to another agency only when a commercial enterprise cannot provide the goods and services as conveniently or as cheaply. In other words, you do have to do a cost comparison. 
I think this is an unbelievable policy for a President that has said, `The era of big Government is over,' and then to turn around and implement a policy of this kind, which does not even provide for a cost comparison. This policy is another example of the administration expanding Government, not reinventing it. 
I recently introduced a bill, S. 314, which is called the Freedom From Government Competition Act, which addresses Government competition with the private sector. It encourages outsourcing and utilizing private sector capability. It provides exemptions for national security, inherently governmental functions, situations where the Government can provide better value goods and services, and when private sector capability is inadequate. I want to stress that this amendment addresses functions that are commercial activities within the Government. We need to take some action now to implement the rules and the policy that has been in place for 40 years but have not been followed. 
My amendment is exactly the same as that which the Senate passed last year. It merely reaffirms existing law and prohibits one agency providing commercial goods and services for another unless a comparison is done. More oversight of this problem is needed. 
This amendment will create private sector jobs, help small business, save taxpayer dollars, make the Government smaller and more efficient. That is a great idea. 
My bottom line is, I want the Government to cost less and be more effective. Most people here do. My amendment will ensure that. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense, good-Government, protaxpayer reform. 
Mr. President, I ask now for the yeas and nays.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to take this time--and I am sure some of my colleagues will join me--to talk a little bit about one of the items that has been before us and will continue to be before us that I think is probably the premier legislature, and that is tax relief. 
I hope, as we move toward the conference committee agreement and as we move toward voting again in the Senate and in the House on tax relief, that we will keep in mind the big picture; the idea that American taxpayers are working harder than ever before, and the concept and the fact that the typical family is now paying more in taxes than they do for food, shelter, and clothing. Too many families have to rely on two incomes, partially because of the burden of taxes. The typical worker faces nearly 3 hours of an 8-hour day to pay their taxes. 
So that is what we are talking about. Of course, it is appropriate to talk about and of course it is appropriate to debate how this tax relief is designed. But we ought to keep in mind that we are talking about for the first time in 10 years significant reductions in taxes--tax relief for American families. 
What are we talking about? First of all, a child tax credit; $500 per child tax credit, so the families can use their own money to spend in their own way to support their own children. 
We are talking about educational tax incentives; tax credits so that tuition for higher education can be offset with tax credits. We are talking about the reduction so that families can send their kids to college. 
We are talking about retirement savings; IRA's to encourage savings to cause people to prepare for their old age, to be able to put away money and have incentive to do that by the incentive of providing for tax-free savings. 
Capital gains reduction; taxes on capital gains to be reduced in order to encourage investment so that we could create jobs and so we create an economy that is healthy and robust. 
Estate and gift tax relief. I happen to come from a State where there are a large number of small businesses, where we have lots of farmers and ranches, and families work their entire lives to put together a business or put together a farm or ranch, and when the time comes when there is a death in the family, they often have to sell these assets to pay 50 percent in taxes. That ought to be changed. 
So I hope we can focus on those things that are beneficial and those things that are useful. I hope we don't allow this idea to be politicized. I hope we don't allow ourselves to enter into this political class conflict which, frankly, the administration is moving toward. 
I was disappointed that the Secretary of the Treasury has gotten into sort of political class warfare. It seems to me if there is one office in the Cabinet that ought to be one that you can sort of depend on for facts, that it ought to be the person who is in charge of monetary policy, who is in charge of our money. Unfortunately, that has not been the case. I hope that it changes. The idea that some opposition, those who really do not want tax relief has been to make it a class warfare thing. And indeed it isn't. 
According to Robert Novak, in his article, economist Gary Robbins showed that 75 percent of the tax cuts go to people who make $57,000 or less in adjusted income. I think that is interesting. Those are the people who pay 38 percent of the total taxes. Taxpayers who get more than $200,000 in income would get but one dime of relief for every $100 in total taxes. 
This is not a tax break for the rich. Interestingly enough, in the same article he indicates--this is a congressional Joint Economic Committee using Treasury data--that the upper fifth of income now pays 63 percent of all income taxes. After the proposed tax cuts, the figure remains exactly 63 percent. 
Similarly, the share paid by the bottom two-fifths of the income earners remains unchanged. 
This is not a tax break for the rich. 
We will hear some things about the tax cuts for the rich. Actually, 75 percent of the taxes, as I said, go to families who make less than $75,000. Families with two kids making $30,000 a year, their tax bill will be cut in half; less than half. 
So, Mr. President, we have the first opportunity since early in the 1980's to have some tax relief for people who are heavily burdened with taxes. 
If in fact the era of big Government is over, then we need to have big taxes to be over as well. We have the highest percentage of gross national product paid now in taxes in history --the highest percentage. 
So, as we move away from big Government, we ought to allow American families to spend more of their own money. 
Mr. President, I yield to my friend from Nebraska.

As previously ordered, from 12:30 until 2:15 p.m., the Senate will stand in recess for the weekly policy luncheons. At 2:15, the Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on the defense authorization bill. The majority leader is hopeful that cloture can be invoked so that the Senate can complete action on the defense bill this week. 
As a reminder, Senators have until 12:30 today to file second-degree amendments on the defense bill. On behalf of the majority leader, I remind all Senators that we are now in a busy legislative period prior to the August recess. The appropriations process has begun and Senators should now expect rollcall votes occurring Monday through Friday of each week. I thank my colleagues for their attention.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I wanted to talk very briefly about an issue that is before the body with regard to an amendment on mining law reform. 
First, let me just say very briefly that I am delighted that this debate is going on. I am delighted that we are talking about tax relief for the first time really seriously in 10 years. We are going to hear a lot about different kinds of details. We will hear a lot of different views, and that is healthy. That is the way it ought to be. 
There are many here who do not support tax relief. I understand that. It is a legitimate point of view--not one I share--of those who do not want tax relief but would rather have more Government spending. We have not had tax relief since the early 1980's. It is time we do that. 
I certainly want to congratulate the chairman of the Finance Committee for bringing this package forward. It is time that we gave some relief to working families, and relieve people who are paying taxes and allow families to keep more of their own money. That is what it is all about. 
We hear people say, `Well, there shouldn't be tax relief because we need to balance the budget.' Their notion is that you have to balance the budget and continue to spend more. But what we ought to be doing is controlling spending. And that is part of what this package does. 
We heard earlier in the evening debate about mining. I wanted to talk just a bit about two aspects of that. One is there is an amendment, of course, which would eliminate the depletion allowance for hard-rock mining. However, in the presentation we heard more about the mining law of 1872 than we did about the depletion. 
Let me tell you that we would have a revised mining law of 1872 if we could get some of those who constantly complain about it to agree to something. I have been here in the House, and now in the Senate for 2 years. We have had this every year. We have been very close to having a decision. But the very folks who complain the most about not revising it are the ones who never find anything to agree to. 
I can tell you that there has been agreement on the idea of having royalties from the users, from the producers, and from nearly everyone here. There has been agreement on the idea of paying marketplace price for the land, or in fact not taking title to the land. That could well be done. And I would suggest that those who complain the most about change are the ones that cause it not to happen. 
I simply want to say that when you want to start talking about depletion allowance and talking about the fact that the minerals are there and free, I want to tell you that they are not free. They are not doing you much good unless there is a substantial kind of investment to extract those minerals--probably as much as $400,000 or $500,000 to be able to do it at all. 
The value of the resource is not there unless someone has an incentive to invest the money to do the mining. And then, of course, the idea is to create jobs. The idea is to create jobs. Some 2,300 jobs in Nevada--high-paying jobs in the neighborhood of $50,000 a year as compared to $25,000 as a national average. These are the kind of jobs that are there. With tremendous investment in these kinds of jobs there is revenue. There are taxes, and there is payment. We ought to encourage that rather than discourage it. 
The suggestion was made that somehow mining goes on and there is no reclamation of land. That is not true. There were in earlier years a lack of reclamation laws but there are not now. There are tons of laws that cause reclamation. 
So, Mr. President, I do not want to go on forever. But I do want to tell you that mining is one of the basic industries in this country--that minerals are relatively valueless unless there is someone willing to make the investment to extract them. They create some of the highest-paying jobs in this country. They generate local taxes. They generate taxes through wages. And they are very much part of our economy--an economy that tends to be forced out of this country by continuing to raise taxes. 
I suspect this issue is not a proper one to have there. But it is one we are talking about, and voting on in the morning. 
I urge my associates here in the Senate to vote against the Bumpers proposal. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we do want to talk this morning, however, about an item of great importance to all of us--the citizens and to all of us as Members of the Senate--and that is taxation, the question that will be before the Senate this week, as the Finance Committee has completed their work on the reconciliation bill, and we will now be addressing that. 
We will be talking about tax relief, which I suspect is perhaps one of the most important topics we will talk about this entire year, not only because of the tax aspect of it because, as you go into the budget process, it seems to me that budgets are much more than just numbers, they are much more than various spending proposals, they sort of set the parameters of what we will be doing in Government for at least the coming year; in this case, at least 5 years. 
These decisions will frame the size of the Government over time. If you prefer smaller governments or larger governments--I happen to prefer smaller ones--the budget has to do with that. The budget has to do with the kinds of priorities that we will set among programs, among the kinds of things that we do. Of course, if we are going to be responsible, as we should be, over time to pay for what we want--which we haven't done for 25 years--and seek to balance the budget, then revenues and expenditures and tax relief are all part of this package, and probably, in the broad sense, are the most important decisions that we will make with respect not only to taxpayers, but program recipients and everyone else over this next 5 years.

Mr. THOMAS. So, Mr. President, we will be talking about the taxes that are generally going to be in the reconciliation bill, such as some relief on the cost of education, in terms of deductions, in terms of credits for parents who have youngsters in school. We will be talking also about the family credit, the $500-per-child credit, so that families can retain and then use that money in their own way to raise their children. We will be talking, hopefully, about capital gains tax relief, the idea that investments would not be taxed at as high a level as they have been, the idea of encouraging investments so that we create jobs and so that we strengthen the economy, and capital gains has a good deal to do with that. 
Hopefully, we will also be talking about estate taxes, the kind of taxes that are levied on property and assets that people have worked their entire life to accumulate and then, in many cases, have to spend more than 50 percent of the value of those assets in taxes and are unable, often, to pass them on to their families. They are particularly important, I think, Mr. President, in areas such as your State of Kansas and my State of Wyoming, where small business and agriculture is very prominent. Often the assets of families, small businessmen, ranchers, farmers, are tied up in fixed assets, such as land and so on, and they have to sell their property in order to pay the taxes. 
So these are the kinds of decisions with which we will be dealing. I look forward to it, frankly. It has been a very long time, it has been a very long time since we have had a fundamental reduction in taxes. 
The concept in this place, in this Senate, in this Government, until the last couple of years, is let's have more taxes, let's have more money, let's have more Government, and now we have an opportunity to seek to start to turn that around and, hopefully, over time reduce the size of Government, move more and more functions to the State where they belong and can be best implemented, and then give taxpayers a break. 
We will be caught up, Mr. President, as we go into this over the next week or more, in great details, as we should be. But I hope we don't forget the concept of what we are seeking to do. We will be caught up in details. We will be caught up in the great political spin that goes on, seemingly has gone on with more fervor in the last year or two than I ever recall. Everything is sort of couched in terms that are designed to package it and sell it. It is not really basic stuff. It is all fluff. We shouldn't do that. 
For instance, we will hear the idea that every tax reduction is a tax break for the rich. Well, now, that isn't the case. If it is, then there are an awful lot of us who apparently are rich and didn't know it. People at $40,000 get some kind of tax break, and it is termed then as a tax break for 
the rich. That is not true. 
We need to talk a little bit about really what the facts are. There is a notion that will be talked about, that, `Well, we don't need any tax reductions, we need to keep the revenue coming so we can continue to spend and spend more,' and that has been the philosophy. It is not the principle philosophy of this country. The country was to have a constitutional government that does those things that are provided in the Constitution, and those things that are not provided in the Constitution should be done by the States or by the citizens. That is what the Constitution says. 
Rather than talk about the facts and philosophy of government, we will be talking about political aspects of it. We will be talking about spin. We will be talking about the message that has come over the last months from the White House with the message merchants that are the result of the polling experts. I hope we can cut through that and just talk like we do in Wyoming, frankly. I was there yesterday. Those folks don't spin it, they just say, `Hey, let's just talk about what it really is,' and that is what we ought to do here. 
One of the things we ought to understand as we take a look at taxes and tax burden for working Americans is that it is higher than it has ever been. It, as a matter of fact, represents over 30 percent of GDP--over 30 of gross domestic product in taxes. I don't think we imagined that that would be the case in this country with limited government. It is three times as high as the highest tax burden during Roosevelt's New Deal--three times as high. So we ought to be talking about some kind of tax changes philosophically. 
We will talk about income tax relief. That is what we are basically talking about, income tax relief. We are talking about people who pay it. You are not going to get income tax relief unless you pay taxes, and there is this idea that whenever we want to do anything to relieve the burden on those people who pay taxes, that somehow it is a big tax break for the rich. Everybody, of course, wants to help folks who need help to help themselves. That is not the issue here. We are not talking about how you do that. We are not talking about welfare; we are not talking about those kinds of things. We are talking about tax relief. 
We ought to talk about that. It is very legitimate to talk about helping those who need help, and we should do that and we do that. But we ought not to tie everything together and not be able to clearly look at what we are talking about. We are talking about tax relief. We are talking about tax fairness. We are talking about opportunity. We are talking about encouraging investment to create jobs. Those are the things that we are talking about. 
Tax relief is designed to allow people who work hard, people who, because they work hard, are successful to keep more of what they earn. We are talking about the incentive to work harder, the incentive to invest, the incentive to invest to strengthen the economy and to create new jobs. That is what we are talking about. So we ought to strip the other stuff away and really think about it a bit. 
Tax relief is part of, it seems to me, a historical American philosophy of limited government, of allowing people to keep what they earn after they have paid the necessary costs of the services they want from government. That is a philosophy that I think is strong. 
President Clinton in Denver this weekend boosted, as he should, about this economy, about the growth of a market economy, the growth of a free-enterprise economy, and yet, often the White House ignores the very thing that allows this economy to be stronger than the economies you see around the world, because it is an incentive-driven-private-enterprise-market economy. That is part of what we are talking about when we talk about taxes, when we talk about the level of taxes and when we talk about tax relief. 
It is tax relief from that 30 percent of GDP that is collected in taxes. Keep that in mind. Every family pays nearly 40 percent of their income in taxes. That is very hard. I am not opposed, nor is anyone I know of opposed, to taxes. If we are going to have a government which is legitimate, if we are going to do the things in government that needs to be done, we have to pay for it. That is what taxes are for. We raise revenues to pay for those legitimate functions of government and, if we are responsible, we will do that. 
We have not been as responsible as we should have been over the years. When we wanted some programs, when we wanted some services, when we wanted something to be done for us, rather than pay for it, we put it on the old credit card, and the credit card is now maxed out, of course. So you have to pay for it. There is nothing wrong with that. But there is a concept of taxation that I hope we will consider, that I hope we will take a look at. Taxation ought to generally be for the purpose of creating revenues to do the things that we are supposed to do to be responsible in government. Let's pay for it. 
Unfortunately, over a period of time, it seems to me--and we continue to do that--tax policy is designed as much to influence behavior as it is to raise revenues, so that each tax relief has a great deal of conditions attached. `If you will do this, then we will give you tax relief.' `If you behave in this way, we will give you some tax relief.' So we have created then a complicated and inefficient and, frankly, unfair tax system which brings about, of course, a great deal of debate about how we simplify the tax system. 
We are not going to talk about that much this week. That is OK. That is OK. We are dealing with the short term. We are dealing with something we have not talked about for years, and that is tax relief. We ought to do that. And I am pleased with what has been done in the budget. 
I am pleased with what has been done in the Finance Committee to move in that direction. That is not as far as we ought to go. Our next step then ought to be to take a broader look at how we simplify taxes. I do not have a favorite way of doing it. There are a number out there that are possible, whether they be flat taxes, whether they be sales taxes, whatever. But we ought to do that. We ought to see if we cannot move away from this idea that taxes are designed to impact and direct behavior and get to something that is much more simple, much more collectible, much more less intrusive on people's lives. But, as I said, that is not the issue that will be before us this week. 
The issue is to seek to get some tax relief for taxpayers in this country. You say, well, that sounds pretty simple. What is so complicated about that? Just listen over this week and you will hear all kinds of things about tax breaks for the rich, about those people do not need it, we should not have tax breaks because we ought to have more programs. And you will see all that, hear that coming from the White House and hear that coming from all over. And so it is not easy. It is not simple. The idea of tax relief, which sounds very simple, is not. 
Most everyone agrees there ought to be some progressiveness in the tax system. And there is. Today's Code is more progressive than it was in 1950. The lower half of taxpayers pay less than 5 percent in total taxes. And 25 percent of the taxpayers pay 80 percent of the taxes. Those that have over $42,000 in income are in that category. So we do have a progressive tax system. And we should have. And we will continue to. But we ought not to confuse tax relief with all of the other kinds of issues that happen. 
As I mentioned, the typical family of four forfeits nearly 40 percent of their income, more than they spend on food, shelter and clothing combined. So it is tough. It is tough to raise a family. It is tough to send your kids to school. It is tough to save for retirement. Nearly 3 hours out of every 8-hour workday are spent financing Government--money that is spent on Washington's priorities, not yours. 
More taxes, more government--that is one of the things that causes us to take a look at how you make government more efficient, that you require more efficiency, makes us take a look at the idea of private contracting rather than having an increased size of government because it is more efficient, because it costs less, but unless you have some reason to do that, the government continues to get larger. 
So we need to balance the budget, but keep in mind that you can balance the budget by raising revenues, that that is not what we ought to do. We ought to balance the budget while controlling and reducing the size of government. That is the challenge. And that is the challenge that we need to undertake. 
Unfortunately, we have not balanced our budget. But we now are in a position to do that. We now have a budget in place that will do that over 5 years. We will also allow for some tax relief. And that is what we will be talking about this week. 
I think there is a considerable amount of history that we ought to take into account. As we do it, we ought to talk about how long it has been since we have talked about tax relief. It has been a number of years. We ought to keep in mind the fact is, over the last several years that the movements in taxes have been simply to raise them. We ought to keep in mind the fact that there are ways to reduce spending. 
We have accomplished a good deal in the last little over 2 years. We have moved to change welfare from an entitlement. We moved to cause it to be moved back to the States where it can be more effectively handled. We have done something about the entitlement of agriculture and farm programs. The Presiding Officer was the Senator who had the most leadership and impact on the changes in the farm bill. That is a fundamental change that we have made over a period of time. 
We have talked in the last 2 years, and now, having moved toward essentially balancing the budget--we have not done that for a very long time--this Congress and last year's Congress have caused that movement to where we are now talking about how we balance the budget and when we balance the budget. Prior to that time, there was no talk about balancing the budget. 
So we have made a lot of progress. We have made a great deal of progress in the last 2 1/2 years. Does it go fast enough to suit everyone? Of course not. Will this tax bill suit everyone? Of course not. 
There will be arguments about whether there is enough in there for capital gains. There will be arguments if there is enough in estate taxes. There will be arguments as to why we do not do something else. I had a call from a lady yesterday in Cheyenne who is retired whose home is valued so it already comes under the estate taxes. She says, `I sent my kids to college and I didn't get a credit.' She says, `There's nothing really 
in there for me much.' Well, there are a few things. 
But it is true, it is true, it will not suit everyone. But I say to my colleagues, let us move forward with this great opportunity for the first time in several decades that really makes some meaningful kind of adjustments in tax relief, to pursue the idea that Americans should be able to keep their hard-earned money, to pursue the idea that we ought to reduce the size of government and therefore the demand on taxes, to pursue the idea that being able to keep more of the money that you work for and earn is part of the incentive in this system. 
So, Mr. President, this will be a very important week, and the week after, when we really decide the direction that we will take on budgets and tax relief and how it will be adjudicated. 
Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my friend and associate from Nebraska. 
I yield the floor to the Senator from Nebraska.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I just want to say the three of us here, and probably whoever else joins us, have not been in the Senate very long, a couple of years. Most of us came in 1994. I want to say I am very proud of what has happened in these last 2 years, not because of us entirely, but we have been here to see a substantial change in the direction that this Congress has taken. One of the reasons has been people coming, I think, in real close contact with the folks at home who want to see some change, who want to see some change in the Tax Code, who really have been able to communicate the needs that have to take place if we are going to realize the successes that we want. 
So I have been very proud of the commitment of the freshman and the sophomore class in this place over the last couple of years. We hope to continue to do that, and one of the areas is the size of government, the cost of government, the opportunity for people to keep the money that they have earned. We are pleased to be a part of that. 
One of the persons who has been very effective in doing that over these 2 years is the Senator from Arizona. I am delighted he is here to join us this morning. I yield the floor to Senator Kyl.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on East Asia and Pacific Affairs to discuss and formally state my support for the extension this year of most-favored-nation status to the People's Republic of China. I want to stress at the beginning that supporting China MFN is not an issue of approving or disapproving China's behavior. Rather, it is an issue of how we best work to influence that behavior in the future. For several reasons, I do not believe that withholding MFN is an effective tool in doing that. 
First, I firmly believe that invoking most-favored-nation status would hurt the United States more than the Chinese. It would be the economic equivalent of saying, `Lift up a rock and drop it on your own foot.' 
Simply put, we are talking about American jobs. It is estimated that United States exports to China support around 200,000 American jobs; 
the Chinese purchases now account for 42 percent of our fertilizer exports and over 10 percent of our grain exports as well. 
Last year, China bought over $1 billion worth of civilian aircraft, $700 million in telecommunications equipment, $340 million in specialized machinery, and $270 million of heating and cooling equipment. 
As China's economy continues its dynamic growth, the potential market for increased sales, of course, will grow as well. Our withdrawal of MFN would certainly be met with in-kind retaliation by the Chinese, who are fully capable of shopping elsewhere for their imports, as we have seen with Boeing and Airbus, with resulting harm to America's economy. 
Second, revoking MFN would have a damaging effect on the economies of our close allies and trading partners Hong Kong and Taiwan. The vast majority of Chinese trade passes through Hong Kong. Putting the brakes on that trade would result in a 32 to 45 percent reduction--around $12 billion worth--of Hong Kong's reexports from the PRC to the United States. 
In addition, it is estimated that there would be about a $4.4 billion drop in income to Hong Kong, a loss of 86,000 jobs, and a 2.8 reduction in GDP. 
Moreover, revoking MFN would have the greatest negative impact on the southern China provinces where Hong Kong and Taiwanese businesses have made substantial investments, as well as the United States. But I want to stress this point. It is in these provinces that the political and social changes for the better are occurring. 
Mr. President, on my last trip to China--my only trip to China--I traveled from Beijing in the north through Shanghai and on to Guangzhou in the south. In Beijing, talks with the Chinese centered solely on politics, Taiwan particularly. The vast majority of the population still ride bicycles. The availability of western goods, while increasing, is limited. The role of the party in the people's daily lives is still significant. 
But as we traveled further south, I was struck by the change in attitudes and interests. People were much less concerned about politics and ideology and much more concerned about continuing trade, their standard of living, as well as budding democratic freedoms. Western consumer goods are widely available, the minority of people ride bikes, and most instead drive cars and motorcycles. The party apparatus is much less ideologically communistic and more bureaucratic. 
In my view, there is one cause for these changes, changes in the everyday lives of the average Chinese citizens--commercial contacts with the West, especially the United States. 
Mr. President, by opening up their economy to market reforms and economic contacts with the rest of the world, the Chinese authorities have let the genie out of the bottle. If we revoke MFN, in effect cutting off trade with China, we only serve to retard this opening-up process, a process that we should be doing in every way to advance and encourage the advancement there. 
Third, revoking China's MFN status would place it among a small handful of countries to which we do not extend this normal trading status. Most favored nation is a bit of a misnomer. It is actually normal relations. But we exclude that normal relationship with Cuba, Laos, North Korea, Serbia, and Afghanistan. We would be relegating China to this grouping, and I believe it would do irreparable harm to our bilateral relationship and to the security and stability of East Asia as a whole. 
China is very attuned to the concept of face. Placing it on the same level as the world's most outcast nations, while perhaps not undeserving in some fields, would needlessly provoke a backlash from the Chinese which would frost over whatever strides we have made in the past. 
Now, I want to make it clear that I in no way condone the policies of the Chinese nor the actions. I am by no means an apologist for the PRC nor a proponent of foreign policy solely for the sake of business interests. No one can argue that China's actions in many fields do not deserve some serious response from us. The PRC has, at best, a sad, sad human rights record. It imprisons prodemocracy dissidents. It has done so in such numbers since the Tiananmen Square incident that there are no active dissidents. It prosecutes religious minorities, including Christians, focusing most harshly on the Buddhists in Tibet where it has closed monasteries and jailed monks and nuns. And it persecutes ethnic minorities, concentrating their attention recently on the Tibetans. 
The PRC consistently fails to live up to the terms of its trade agreements with us, especially in the areas of trade barriers and intellectual property rights. It has taken two separate agreements and several years to get intellectual property rights moving in the proper direction, but they are still not doing what they are supposed to do. 
It has made several decisions which call into question its commitments to preserving democracy in Hong Kong, including the most recent round involving the so-called Provisional 
Legislature. It ignores its commitments to some international agreements. 
So all in all, it is not a good situation. The question of course is, how do we best deal with that? 
Mr. President, I am the first to insist that we need to address these serious issues, but it is clear that our current China policy, which the administration characterizes as constructive engagement but has recently retooled as multifaceted is not up to the task. The Chinese will continue to walk over us as long as their actions meet with little or no credible repercussions. 
But while we need to make some response, it is equally clear to me that most favored nation is not going to solve any of these problems. As I have mentioned, its revocation would only cause more problems than it solves. Moreover, threatening MFN withdrawal has come to be hollow and meaningless. We know it and the Chinese know it. 
It is like watching a movie you have seen several times before; you know the plot, you know the actors, you know their roles and the dialogue, and indeed you know the outcome all before the movie even starts. With each cry of wolf we make by threatening to withdraw most-favored-nation status and then do not, the credibility of an already tenuous threat declines. 
Yet, without a responsible alternative, Members of Congress are forced to face the Hobson's choice between voting to revoke MFN or doing nothing. Many, with no constructive way to vent their policy frustrations, choose revocation. 
I am convinced it is time to rethink the United States-China policy and come up with a workable way to get China to act as a responsible member of the international community and to live up both to the letter and the spirit of the agreements they have reached with us. In addition, I believe the United States has to be more prepared to say what it means and mean what it says. 
On March 22, in my subcommittee, we held a hearing on exactly this topic. It was the opinion of every panelist, save one, that we need a workable alternative to most-favored-nation as a tool of American foreign policy. I hope that in the next year policymakers, both in the Government and outside it, can recognize that the old policy has failed and move on to try and formulate a new one. It will not be a quick or simple process, but the sooner it begins the better off we will be and the better for the health of our bilateral relationship. 
In closing, Mr. President, let me reiterate that I strongly support most-favored-nation renewal. But at the same time, I equally strongly urge this administration to pursue a clear, more consistent and effective foreign policy towards China. Frankly, the latter will do more toward setting our countries down the path of a strong relationship. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, we have asked to set aside a little time this morning to talk about the issue the Senator from Minnesota talks about. Each of us wants to find a way to get help to people who need it as a result of the disaster. I think there are a number of issues involved. I believe as we move toward a solution, it is useful to talk about those things. 
Certainly, there are legitimate concerns on both sides of this bill. I am satisfied that our leadership is now putting together something that will be presented, hopefully that will be acceptable. 
I think it is well to recognize that we want to get this disaster aid out, but there are certain things that are very important, as in any discussion, to both sides. One of them is to get something in that avoids the human disaster that might well happen in the future if we had another shutdown of the Government. So this can be one of those things. 
There also has to be an understanding, of course, on an issue of where there are different points of view that both sides have to be willing to make some accommodation. The idea that somehow you can't do anything unless the President approves is not the system we have here. We have a divided Government. We have the President with authority to do what he does and the Congress with the authority to do what they do. When they come to a conflict, there has to be some movement and not simply a pronouncement that the President doesn't like that and, therefore, it won't happen. That is not the way it works. 
So, Madam President, we would like to talk a little bit about that. I am joined by my colleagues. I yield first to the Senator from Minnesota.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, on behalf of the majority leader, today the Senate will be in a period of morning business until the hour of 12:30 p.m., with Senators to speak up to 5 minutes each, with the exception of three Senators. Under a previous consent agreement, from 12:30 until 2:15 p.m. the Senate will be in recess to allow the weekly policy luncheons to meet. At 2:30 today, it is the hope of the majority that the Senate will be able to discharge from the Labor Committee and begin consideration of S. 419, the Birth Defects Prevention Act. This legislation is not controversial. It is hoped that the Senate will be able to consider and pass this important bill in a short period of time. Senators can therefore expect rollcall votes during today's session of the Senate. As always, Members will be notified accordingly as any votes are ordered with respect to any legislation or executive matters cleared for action. 
I thank the Members for their attention.

Mr. THOMAS. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank my colleague for arranging this special order. 
It seems to me that this is something that is very important. I have watched this discussion with great interest, having had some experience in small business, and, I must confess, I have been very surprised by it. It seems to me that over the years, particularly the last 2 1/2 years, we have spent in this body a great deal of time talking about making things more family friendly. We have talked about how we could provide more time for families to share in the schooling of their youngsters, to share in their communities, to share in the things that make communities strong, and to work that in to our professional lives. 
Then comes a proposal to do that which allows for flextime, which allows for comptime, and we find suddenly a great deal of opposition. That is a puzzle to me. As I mentioned, I have been in a small business where you don't have many employees, and I recognize from the employer side that there has to be some communication, because you may not be able to spare someone for a certain length of time. On the other side, I think it is equally or perhaps even more important that the employee is not forced by the employer to take the time differently than they would like to. But it is my understanding and my belief that in this bill those things are protected, that it is a cooperative agreement between the employer and the employee, to come to these conclusions. 
So I was very disappointed. Even though I haven't spoken a great deal on it, I was very disappointed last week when we didn't get enough votes to vote cloture. There certainly are enough votes to pass the bill. I am disappointed that the White House has apparently indicated the President will not sign the bill, largely as a result of the labor unions to which the White House is so sensitive. This Family Friendly Workplace Act would help working Americans do the things--the very things--that the President has been talking about and made an issue of in the last election and since. And then we find there is opposition to it. 
Most Americans, I believe--the Americans that I have talked to--do, in fact, want flexibility in the workplace, would like to have the opportunity to be able to make some adjustments. We have a business in our town of Cheyenne. It is called Unicover. They are the ones who put out first-day stamps, first-day covers. The owner testified before the Senate Labor Committee a few months ago. His employees came to him and asked for comptime/flextime so there could be some arrangements. He wants to offer that to his employees but cannot, of course, until S. 4 is passed. I suppose this has been said--in fact, when you are discussing an issue like this, everything has been said --but the May 1997 survey from Money magazine found 68 percent of working women would prefer comptime to overtime pay. The Labor Department has indicated that it would help in balancing work and attention to the family, which is the No. 1 issue for working American women. 
So I am truly puzzled by the opposition to it, and I can only imagine that it is simply a political opposition brought on by the opposition of the labor unions to it, which surprises me as well, because certainly union leaders and union members want to do something with their families as well. 
Americans need the flexibility in the workplace if we are to accomplish the things that we want to, if we are to accommodate the fact that more and more women, more and more mothers are in the workplace and, therefore, since both family members often are working that there does need to be flexibility. 
Our current laws go back to 1938. Most jobs were in manufacturing; very strict. One-payroll families were the norm. That has obviously changed to where now two-payroll families are, indeed, the norm. In 1938, 16 percent of the women with children worked outside the home; in 1997, more than 70 percent work outside the home. 
This Family Friendly Workplace Act creates new choices for employees and employers. By mutual agreement, they can agree to substitute some alternatives for overtime, some alternatives to the 40-hour operation. They can take time off to do the things that they need to do or bank some hours with comptime. Federal workers, I understand, have enjoyed this flexibility scheduling now for nearly 20 years, and they can do that. Why not the rest of the working community? S. 4 protects workers' rights, and that is important, very important. Penalties for direct or indirect employer coercion are doubled from current law. Accumulated comptime may be paid in cash by year's end. 
So, Mr. President, I hope that we intend to continue to push, continue to address S. 4 in this Congress and, hopefully, get the bill passed. It meets the realities of the modern-day workplace, it meets the needs of modern-day families, and is something that I think is very favored among people in this country. 
It is a little frustrating sometimes to find this kind of 
dilemma that we are caught up in this week, quite frankly, a situation where if a bill doesn't suit the President, it has to bring us to a standstill. After all, the President is not a king; the President doesn't run the country. He has to give as well as the Congress. That is what this is about. Here we find another that is very similar. 
I hope that we find some areas of agreement that will allow us to put into place S. 4 and protect the rights of workers, protect the opportunity for options, protect the opportunity for families to have a friendly workplace. I hope we do it very soon. 
Mr. President, I thank my friend for this time and for his work and that of the Senator from Missouri on this bill. It has been exemplary. Thank you very much. I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. I say to the Senator, I think that is curious. If you have an issue where you are on different sides of the issue and opposed to one another, then you get this kind of thing. But here is one where, if you went around and talked about opportunities to have some choices in the workplace, if you talked about a way to allow people to have some flextime with their families, everybody would agree, nobody would disagree with that. 
So it is strange that having that as the premise, having that as the basis that we find instead of searching for a way to make it work, as you say, it becomes an absolute stoppage of anything happening. It is curious, and I am surprised. I guess that is why I am here expressing some surprise in the way this has turned.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about a problem that I think we have in this country in terms of the organization of Government, in terms of the future role of Government, in terms of where we want to be with respect to Government and the private sector, 
and specifically Government's competition with the private sector. This competition, of course, takes many forms, but the basic premise is that the Federal Government provides commercial goods and services in-house instead of going to the private sector and contracting out for these needs. This is called insourcing, and it leads to larger and larger Government. It is my view that given limited Federal resources we ought to set priorities as to where we spend money and find ways to meet these commercial needs more reasonably, more efficiently by contracting. 
Insourcing, of course, tends to stifle job creation in the private sector. It weakens economic growth. It erodes the tax base, of course. It hurts small businesses and costs taxpayers money. 
There is a great deal of talk that goes on in this country about downsizing, about reinventing Government, but the fact is very little of that actually goes on. The Clinton administration has talked some about how there are fewer employees in the Federal Government than there used to be, but almost all of that is a result of base closures in the Department of Defense and RTC when it finished its work with regard to the savings and loan scandal. The fact is that Government expenditures and Government continue to grow and will, indeed, continue to grow under the budget that was approved recently.

Mr. THOMAS. The FAA recently announced it was awarding a contract of about $150 million for data processing and information technology to the Department of Agriculture. The problem is that there are plenty of private-sector groups that are more efficient or more capable of doing that job. 
When you think of technology, do you think of the Department of Agriculture? I do not think so. When you talk about doing payrolls and managing the FAA's technology, do you think of the Department of Agriculture? I do not think so. That is because information technology is not part of the Department of Agriculture's core mission. 
The folks down at OMB and the Clinton administration will tell you it is a great thing; it is encouraging entrepreneurial Government. But I think we ought to be encouraging private business and entrepreneurial enterprise, not Government. By recruiting contracts from other agencies to offset budget cuts, we are maintaining big Government at the expense of businesses in the private sector, especially small businesses. We are also cheating the taxpayer. Studies have shown that outsourcing can save the Government up to 30 percent. Congressman Duncan and I wrote to the President the day this article appeared to protest his plans on reinventing Government.

Mr. THOMAS. Unfortunately, this reinventing Government is not achieving its purpose. It is recreating big Government. The current A-76 process, which is the system that is supposed to be used to decide if a function can be done more cost effectively and more efficiently in the private sector, may not even have been used by the FAA before awarding the contract to the Department of Agriculture. And when A-76 is used, it does not provide a level playing field for comparing Government and the private sector. Finally, the GAO has strongly criticized the Department of Agriculture's management of its current information technology. We shouldn't be giving them more work when they can't handle their current assignments. 
So my legislation would address these issues. The legislation would stop entrepreneurial Government dead in its tracks, create a best value comparison between Government and private enterprise based on fair accounting systems, based on qualifications, based on past performance. 
There are certainly activities within the Government that are inherently Government functions and should be done by the Government, but there are many others that are commercial in nature. They are as commercial as anything in the private sector could be. So this legislation will lead to more efficient Government, will inject fair competition into Government monopolies and continue to reserve a Government role for inherently governmental functions. It also will encourage more and more contracting with the private sector for more efficiency and giving American taxpayers more bang for their buck. 
So I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this good Government, common sense of reform. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

 Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I introduce legislation which would return a family farm in Big Horn County, WY, to its rightful owners. The family of Fred Steffens lost ownership of the property where they lived and prospered for almost 70 years, as a result of a misrepresentation by the original property owners. Mr. Steffens' relatives have explored every avenue to regain the title to their property, and are left with no other option than to seek congressional assistance. I stand before you today, on behalf of my constituents, to request help in providing a timely solution to this problem. It is my hope that in doing so, this wrong can be righted. 
Upon the death of Fred Steffens on January 20, 1995, his sister, Marie Wambeke, was appointed personal representative of the 80-acre Steffens Estate. In February 1996, Ms. Wambeke learned from the Bureau of Land Management [BLM] that she did not have a clear title to her brother's property, and she submitted a color-of-title application. Shortly thereafter, Ms. Wambeke was informed that her brother's property was never patented, so her application was rejected. 
The injustice of this situation is that when Mr. Steffens purchased this property in 1928, he did receive a Warranty Deed with Release of Homestead from the former owners. Unfortunately, these individuals did not have a reclamation entry to assign to Mr. Steffens. In fact, 2 years before selling the property, the original owners had been informed that the land they occupied was withdrawn by the Bureau of Reclamation for the Shoshone Reclamation Project. At the same time, they were notified that they had never truly owned the property. 
Unethically, this did not stop them from selling the land to Mr. Steffens in 1928. In good faith Mr. Steffens purchased the property, paid taxes on the property from the time of purchase, and is on record at the Big Horn County Assessor's office as owner of this property. Due to the dishonesty of others, his family now faces the sobering reality of losing this land unless a title transfer can be effected legislatively. 
Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today would transfer the land from Fred Steffens' estate to his sister, Marie. This property has been in their family since 1928. Through no fault of their own, these folks are being forced to relinquish rights not only to their land, but to a part of their heritage and a legacy to their future generations. I hope we can expedite this matter by turning this land over to Marie Wambeke's ownership.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we are going to, this week, enter into one of the most serious debates that we will have all year, one of the matters that I think is the most serious that we will address all year, and that is the question of the budget. As a matter of fact, it is my understanding we will talk about two budgets. One will be the appropriations for the supplemental budget, designed to deal with disaster and other matters, but then the real budget for the year which will outline the spending for this country. 
I think this is important, particularly important, because there is much more to it than arithmetic. It is not simply numbers. It is not simply what we will spend. I think it has to do with a number of things that are of particular significance. I hope that we give some consideration to these broader things as we talk about numbers, which we inevitably will do. One has to do with the size of the Government. It has to do with the potential and the opportunity to reduce the size of Government. I happen to believe that Government has become too large and that it could be smaller. It could be much more efficient. I suspect it would be more efficient if it were smaller. The budget is one of the ways that you do that. 
Government by its nature does not get smaller unless somehow there is a restriction on the amount of money available. I think it also gets more efficient when there is less money to do the job, and it is similar to what has to be done in the private sector. 
Second, it has, of course, to do with priorities. Each of us, as we spend our money, whether in business or personal and private family lives, have to set priorities. There is never enough money for everything. Certainly that is increasingly true with Government. So it is necessary to set priorities, to decide which of the many functions of Government are most important, which ones need to be financed, which ones need to be funded, which ones, indeed, could be reduced or eliminated. 
Third, it has to do with taxing. It has to do with how much money we are going to allow families to keep, to spend for themselves. Average family spending for taxes now is nearly 40 percent, 40 percent of revenue from the family. It was just recently that we had tax day, so that everything we earned up until just a week or so ago all went for taxes. 
The budget has to do with the potential, the possibility of reducing the burden on the families in this country. It has to do with the incentive for investment. Tax reduction is also an opportunity to have investments for people to put into their businesses, to create jobs, to strengthen the economy. There is a direct relationship, particularly in tax reductions such as capital gains which encourages people to invest. 
The budget gives us an opportunity to keep Medicare and entitlements available. 
I just met this morning with a great group of young people, 
high school people. We talked a little bit about entitlements. We talked specifically about Medicare. Frankly, all of them, 18 years old, said, `We really do not think there will be any Medicare for us.' Indeed, there will not be unless we make some changes. Budgets, of course, are where it is possible to do that. 
Budgets also test our willingness to be financially responsible, to balance the budget and not spend more than we take in, which we have done for more than 30 years here in this Congress. I have to say I have not done it for 30 years because I have not been here for 30 years. 
Finally, and related to that, of course, budgets determine what will we leave to our kids to pay in terms of budgets, in terms of debts. What we have done, of course, over the last few years, is we have spent more than we took in and put it on the old credit card, and it is maxed out. So we will determine how much of a debt we leave to our kids. 
That is what we are talking about in terms of budgets. It will be difficult. It will be difficult. American voters, as someone said, and I think it is true, sent two teams to do the same thing, two teams with quite different philosophies. If everyone here had the same philosophy then we would have a certain kind of a budget. If everybody believed we ought to have smaller Government, we would have smaller Government. If everybody thought we ought to have more tax relief, we would have that, but everybody does not. There are two different points of view that will have to be reconciled before anything can be done. 
So we approach a budget with, I think, a certain amount of reserve. Certainly this is not a breakthrough budget. This is not a turnaround. This is not a change, a sea change, I do not believe. I do not think it is designed for meaningful reduction in the size of Government or spending reductions. It is not dedicated to real honest-to-goodness tax relief. 
Now, on the other hand, I think in fairness, and we will have to talk about it, it does provide some of the principles that most of us have talked about for some time. It probably comes closer, and I hope it does, to a real balance than any budget in recent history over a period of 5 years, a real balanced budget. 
Now you have to keep in mind you can balance the budget in many ways. You can continue to increase taxes and increase revenue and balance the budget up here, when the real idea that most people want to balance the budget is down here, and reduce some of the spending. 
Second, it provides some tax relief. We are told that there will be an opportunity on the floor for debate of tax relief. One will be $500 per child for family relief. That is good. Another would be some relief of capital gains taxes. That is good. It will help the economy. And in the short term, at least, it will increase revenues. Some reduction in estate taxes, I think, is good. 
In my State of Wyoming, there are lots of family farmers, ranches, and small businesses. People have worked all of their lives--and many times the lives of their forebears--to put together a business or a ranch or a farm, often with relatively little flow of cash but lots of assets. Under the present circumstances, that is taxed at nearly 50 percent. Many have to sell those assets in order to pay the taxes. That ought to be changed. 
There will be some effort made at entitlement reform. That is good. It helps preserve Medicare for people who will be on it in the future. There has to be some changes made to do that. So it is a kind of a mixed bag, it seems to me. 
There are some other items I would like to see changed. I would like to see some incentives to increase the capital gains so that there is incentive to invest in the economy. 
I would like to see some real long-term meaningful changes in Medicare so that our kids will have a chance. 
The President has sort of tinkered around the edges, and takes down the providers' cost a little here and there to avoid any real tough decision, but he is doing a little something. We have to make them. The sooner we make them, the less costly they will have to be. We need to allow families to keep more of their dough. 
We need to be careful about balancing the budget and about making very optimistic projections in the future. Suddenly, there was $200 billion-plus because of the projections for the future. 
We ought to make kind of a level projection, it seems to me. And then, if we are fortunate enough to have revenue growth, why not apply that to the debt? Wouldn't that be a nice idea? But no, we put that on so that we continue to spend and see the Government grow larger. 
These are some of the things we will be grappling with this week. I think they are very difficult ones, and some things I hope we do regardless of what we do with the tax bill, regardless of what we do with the budget. I hope we move on past that to reform the tax system. The tax system needs to be changed. 
People are increasingly complaining about the IRS. And I understand that. The tax issue is not going to change the IRS a great deal until you change the system that they have to enforce. We ought to do that. 
This budget should not mean we are going to leave it as it is for 5 years. We need meaningful reductions in taxes. 
We need a smaller Government. We need to change the situation so that the Government doesn't compete with the private sector in those things that the Government does that are commercial in nature. We ought to allow for contracting, and let private small businesses be able to compete to do things that the Government does that are basically commercial. 
Mr. President, there is something else that I think we ought to do that would help us. We ought to have a biennial budget. 
We spend almost all of our time with this budget. We started this thing just about this time in January when the Congress came in. We will be very fortunate if we are through by the middle of September or the 1st of October. And, as you know, Mr. President, it has been longer than that in the past. 
It wouldn't take any longer to do it on a biennial basis. We could know those figures just as well. The agencies would have 2 years of knowing where their money is going to be. But, most important of all, we could have the budget one year and the next year do oversight. That is part of Congress' responsibility, to oversee the things that the Government is doing. We can accomplish a great deal, if we can do that. 
So, Mr. President, I look forward to this week's debate and discussions. I am confident we will come out of it with something better than we have had. 
Thank you for the time. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am sorry we have moved into some of our time, but I will be very brief and cover the points I want to make. I am real pleased today to be joined by three of my associates in support of H.R. 1122, the Partial-Birth Abortion Act. I am going to be very brief. It has been talked about to a great extent. Everything, probably, has been said. But there is one thing that sticks in my mind that I think is important about this discussion and this vote that will come up. 
We did this last year, you will recall. It passed by significant numbers in the Senate. President Clinton vetoed the bill that was passed in the 104th Congress. I just want to mention the reasons that he gave for vetoing the bill. 
First, he said it was only necessary in `a small number of compelling cases.' The fact is that is not factual. The fact is that has changed. The fact is, there are facts that show, for instance, in New Jersey, that there were more than 1,500, just in the one State. So that reason for vetoing is not true. It is not true. 
The second one was to protect the mother from `serious injury to her health.' The fact is, in the vast majority of cases when the partial-birth technique is used, it is for elective purposes, and that, also, has been shown to be true. 
Third, the President said, to avoid the mother `losing the ability to ever bear further children.' The facts have now shown it is never necessary to safeguard the mother's health or fertility; that there are other procedures that are available. I think these are compelling, compelling arguments. These are the reasons the President vetoed the bill that have subsequently been found not to be factual. 
I yield time to the Senator from Nebraska.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to take just a couple of minutes to rise in support of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. I have a particular interest in this bill in that I have been involved for a very long time with disabilities, chairman of the disabilities council in Wyoming, my wife teaching special kids, and so I wanted to comment very briefly. 
I rise in support of the current bill to reauthorize IDEA, the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act. The Federal Government, in my view, should and does play a rather limited role in elementary and secondary education. This is the responsibility generally of communities, those of us who live there. State and local control, I think, is the strength of our educational system, and yet I believe strongly that this is an appropriate Federal responsibility. This is dealing with that kind of a special problem which exists in all places to ensure that every child has the opportunity to be the best that he or she can be. 
IDEA helps local schools meet their constitutional responsibilities to educate everyone, and that is what we want to do. Today nearly twice as many students with disabilities drop out of school compared to students without disabilities, and that is what it is about, to have a program that helps keep students in school.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Electric Utility Restructuring Empowerment and Competitiveness Act of 1997. This legislation, which gives states the authority to order the delivery of electric energy to all retail consumers, is based on the idea that less government intervention is the best way to achieve affordable, reliable and competitive options for retail electric energy services. 
This is a substantially different approach from other measures that have been introduced in both the House and Senate to restructure the nation's electric utility industry. I do not believe that a federal mandate on the states requiring retail competition by a date certain is in the best interest of all classes of customers. I am concerned that this method could result in increased electricity rates for low-density states or states that have relatively low-cost power. Electricity is an essential commodity critical to everyday life in this country. It is also an industry heavily regulated at the Federal and State levels. If the Congress is going to make fundamental changes to the last major regulated monopoly, its role should be to help implement competitive changes in a positive manner, rather than interject the heavy hand of government with a `Washington-knows-best' mentality. 
This legislation comes down on the side of States' rights. Having been involved in the electric power industry, I understand the unique characteristics of each State. As most everyone knows, California was the first State to pass a retail choice law. Since that time, Arizona, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Texas, Montana, Oklahoma and others have followed suit. 
According to Bruce Ellsworth, President of the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners [NARUC], `more than one-third of the Nation's population live in states that have chosen within the last year to move to open-access, customer choice markets.' All told, every state except one is in the process of either examining or implementing policies for retail consumers of electric energy. States are clearly taking the lead--they should continue to have that role--and this bill confirms their authority by affirming States' ability to implement retail choice policies. 
This initiative leaves important functions, including the ability to recover stranded costs, establish and enforce reliability standards, promote renewable energy resources and support public benefit and assistance to low-income and rural consumer programs in the hands of State Public Service Commissions [PUC's]. If a State desires to impose a funding mechanism--such as wires charges--to encourage that a certain percentage of energy 
production comes from renewable alternatives, they should have that opportunity. However, I do not believe a nationally mandated set-aside is the best way to promote competition. Likewise, individual states would have the authority over retail transactions. This ensures that certain customers could not bypass their local distribution system and avoid responsibility for paying their share of stranded costs. 
One of the most important aspects of this debate--assuring that universal service is maintained--is a critical function that each State PUC should have the ability to oversee and enforce. In my legislation, nothing would prohibit a state from requiring all electricity providers that sell electricity to retail customers in that state to provide electricity service to all classes and consumers of electric power. 
Mr. President, at the wholesale level, my proposal attempts to create greater competition by prospectively exempting the sale of electricity for resale from rates determined by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [FERC]. Although everyone talks about `deregulating' the electricity industry, it is really the generation segment that will be deregulated. The FERC will continue to regulate transmission in interstate commerce, and State PUC's will continue to regulate retail distribution services and sales. 
When FERC issued Order 888 last year, it allowed utilities to seek market-based rates for new generating capacity. This provision goes a step further and allows utilities to purchase wholesale power from existing generating facilities, after the date of enactment of this Act, at prices solely determined by market forces. 
Furthermore, the measure expands FERC authority to require non-public utilities that own, operate or control transmission to open their systems. Currently, the Commission cannot require the Federal Power Marketing Administrations [PMA's], the Tennessee Valley Authority [TVA], municipalities and cooperatives that own transmission, to provide wholesale open access transmission service. According to Elizabeth Moler, Chairwoman of FERC, approximately 22 percent of all transmission is beyond open access authority. Requiring these non-public utilities to provide this service will help ensure that a true wholesale power market exists. 
One of the key elements of this measure is streamlining and modernizing the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 [PURPA] and the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 [PUHCA]. While both of these initiatives were enacted with good intentions, and their obligations fulfilled, there is widespread consensus that the Acts have outlived their usefulness. 
My bill amends section 210 of PURPA on a prospective basis. Current PURPA contracts would continue to be honored and upheld. However, upon enactment of this legislation, a utility that begins operating would not be required to enter into a new contract or obligation to purchase electricity under section 210 of PURPA. 
With regard to PUHCA, I chose to incorporate Senator D'Amato's recently introduced legislation in my bill. As Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction over the issue, he has crafted a proposal that I believe will successfully reform the statute and I support his efforts. Under his proposal, the provisions of PUHCA would be repealed 18 months after the Act is signed into law. Furthermore, all books and records of each holding company and each associate company would be transferred from the Securities and Exchange Commission [SEC]--which currently has jurisdiction over the 15 registered holding companies--to the FERC. This allows energy regulators, who truly know the industry, to oversee the operations of these companies and review acquisitions and mergers. These consumer protections are an important part of PUHCA reform. 
Mr. President, an issue which must be resolved in order for a true competitive environment to exist is that of utilities receiving special `subsidies' by the federal government and the U.S. tax code. For years, investor-owned utilities [IOU's] have claimed inequity because of tax-exempt financing and low-interest loans that municipalities and rural cooperatives receive. On the other side of the equation, these public power systems maintain that IOU's are able to receive special tax treatment, not offered to them, which amounts to a `tax free' loan. The jury is still out on how best to deal with this thorny and, undoubtedly complex matter, but make no mistake about it, changes will be made. 
A viable option the Congress should consider is to `build a fence' around governmental utilities. Sales in existing service territories could continue to be financed using current methods. However, for sales outside of their traditional boundaries, these systems should operate on the same basis and play by the same rules as other competitors. 
The Congress should also address existing tax structures to determine if the `benefits' tax-paying utilities receive results in unfair advantages against their competitors. While tax initiatives, such as accelerated depreciation and investment tax credits, are available to all businesses that pay income tax, if this amounts to `subsidies' reforms may have to be made. 
My bill would direct the Inspector General of the Department of Treasury to file a report to the Congress detailing whether and how tax code incentives received by all utilities should be reviewed in order to foster a competitive retail electricity market in the future. Furthermore, I am pleased that Senator Murkowski, Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, requested a report by the Joint Committee on Taxation to review all subsidies and incentives that investor-owned, publicly-owned and cooperatively-owned utilities receive. 
Mr. President, I believe EURECA is a common-sense approach that attempts to build consensus to solve some of the critical questions associated with this important issue. The states are moving and should continue to have the ability to craft electricity restructuring plans that recognize the uniqueness of each state. This legislation is the best solution to foster the debate and allow us to move forward with a better product for all classes of consumers and the industry as a whole.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I come to the floor this morning to talk about one of my top priorities for the 105th Congress. That is the Freedom From Government Competition Act. 
I am struck by the fact that we are considering now the supplemental appropriations bill and debate on it will last, I am sure, all week. Then next week we will consider the budget which will take at least another week of debate. During these deliberations, we will talk about funding the essentials of Government which, of course, is one of Congress' most important tasks. But, unfortunately, it seems to me that we spend an awful lot of time on the budget and on appropriations and funding the Government in the form it is currently in, and less time than we should talking about the changes that we ought to make in the Government. 
So, while I am on the floor today, I want to mention a couple of bills I have sponsored to change the role of the Federal Government. One is the biennial budget. I think we really ought to consider going to a biennial budget in this Congress as we do in many States so that we can deal with the budget once every 2 years. Agencies would do a better job with 2 years of funding because they would have some stability in their funding levels. Certainly we can look at least 2 years ahead in terms of budget, so that Congress has a whole year to talk about some of the reforms that ought to take place; that ought to change in Government. 
I am persuaded that without some overt changes, without fundamental changes brought about by the Congress, that Government just continues to go on, just continues to grow, just continues to expand. It is the nature of government. 
Quite frankly, according to one of the studies by GAO regarding one agency that I just read this weekend, there is no real accountability in terms of spending. So that accountability in terms of what you do with the money and the results that you have in the Government agencies are largely the responsibilities of the Congress. 
Congress does not have time to do that. We spend too much of our time with the budget, too much of our time with appropriations. One of the other things that we ought to do, in my opinion, is to ensure that the Government is not competing with the private sector in areas that are basically commercial in nature that could better be done and could more cheaply be done through outsourcing. 
My legislation, the Freedom From Government Competition Act, has the potential to open up a $30 billion market for our Nation's businesses, mostly small businesses, to have an opportunity, by contract, to fulfill the commercial needs of the Federal Government. It would level the playing field for thousands of our Nation's businesses that span the economic spectrum of this whole country, from mundane things to very high tech things, from janitorial services, hospitality and recreation services, to engineering services, laboratories and testing services--those functions that are commercial in nature that are now done by the Government that could better and likely more inexpensively be done in the private sector. 
The bill is quite simple, as a matter of fact. It simply says that OMB would take a look at all the activities and functions of Government, would identify those that are commercial in nature, and then create a fair and competitive process to outsource those activities to the private sector. Of course, not only does the bill answer the call of the American people to limit the size of Government and encourage the private sector--but it has a great deal of value in terms of the Federal budget. The taxpayers could save many billions of dollars. The interesting part of this concept is that it has been around for a very long time. For over 40 years we have been dealing with this issue. It has been the Federal Government's policy to contract out for over 40 years. Unfortunately, it has not worked. The evidence is that it has not worked. In fact, I recently ran across an excerpt of a 1954 Congressional Quarterly Almanac that details how the current policy came into existence.

Mr. THOMAS. In 1954, the House of Representatives passed a bill numbered H.R. 9835, legislation to require the executive branch to increase its reliance on the private sector--1954. Among the concerns addressed by the bill were manufacturing, construction and service activities of the Federal Government. Final action on the bill was dropped only upon assurance from the Executive Branch that it would implement the policy administratively. Bureau of the Budget Bulletin 55-4 was issued in 1955, prohibiting agencies from carrying on any commercial activities which could be provided by the private sector. Unfortunately, today we face exactly the same problems Congress faced in 1954. The Federal Government continues not only to compete with the private sector by providing its own goods and services but it also competes with the private sector to provide those goods and services for some other unit of Government or to other private sector entities. Of course, that unfair competition kills private-sector jobs, stifles the economy, erodes the tax base, and hurts small business. 
One of the top issues the last several times the small business community has held their White House conference--in 1980, 1986, and 1994--was provision for an opportunity to fairly compete. To do that, of course, you have to have a process which takes into account all of the costs for the Federal Government and the private sector and consider other issues like past performance in order to have a fair comparison. It also means over time an agency, if it were going to do a lot of contracting, would change its structure. Instead of being designed to perform these functions and contract out, you would pare the agency down to where its real expertise would be in oversight and supervision of functions that were to be done. 
The bill that we have introduced, which I would like to encourage my fellow Senators to consider, codifies the policy that the Government should rely on the private sector for its commercial needs. There are exceptions, of course--inherently governmental functions and exemptions for national security concerns. In addition, the Federal Government, if it can provide a better value to the taxpayer, should do it. But if the private sector can provide a better value to American taxpayers, it should have a chance to do it. 
It also provides for OMB to examine these issues and establishes an office of commercial activities within OMB to implement the bill. 
Mr. President, I hope that we do consider some of these kinds of changes. The climate is right for action. Congressman Duncan, with whom the Senator from Kansas and I both served in the House, has introduced a companion bill. The Senate is already on record in support of this bill. Last year, the Senate voted 59 to 39 in favor of an amendment to the Treasury, Postal appropriations bill that would have prevented unfair Government competition. Unfortunately, it was dropped from the omnibus appropriations bill. It should be a high priority. We ought to be doing some of these things that create fundamental change in the Federal Government. We are going to seek to balance the budget. We will see in the future the benefit of setting those kinds of priorities. If we could save $30 billion annually through this concept, that is a sizable amount of savings which could be transferred to something else or help balance the budget. 
In summary, let me say again I think it is a shame we simply go on year after year talking about the same agenda over time, the same kind of Government operation, without taking a look at some of the ways it could be changed. The private sector operates differently, it has to evolve over time. If it does not change, it bows out; it goes out of business. 
So there is a compelling reason to make the changes. The Government by its nature--and there is nothing wrong with the people; it is the nature of the beast--does not change unless there are changes forced upon it, and, frankly, programs are developed and they have an advocacy in the country and they just do not change. I think that is our responsibility. It is our responsibility to evaluate the effectiveness, to evaluate not only what is done or how many dollars are spent but results. We are in the process now of implementing a result-oriented law that was passed a couple of years ago, and by this spring each agency is to have a fundamental, systemic plan that measures results. My bill is consistent with that effort. 
Mr. President, I urge my fellow Members of the Senate to consider some fundamental changes in the Federal Government which would allow for many of our small businesses to meet its commercial needs and provide a better value to American taxpayers than they are currently getting. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President. 
First, let me say how much I have appreciated the efforts of the Senator from Georgia in promoting this legislation, this Volunteer Protection Act of 1997. I think probably most everything about the bill has been said. I am delighted to hear that there has been an agreement. I can hardly imagine that anybody does not agree with the concept of making it easier for people to volunteer, of taking away some of the kinds of threats that have inevitably been there when someone does volunteer to serve. So I am very pleased about that. 
I think it is true--and I guess I will probably be saying some of the same things again--it is true that the nature of this society, this democracy, requires that people care. It is a Government of the people and by the people, and designed to be a relatively minimal Government in that it sets a framework for us to do the things that we think should be done, for us to take the leadership to cause our communities to be strong. 
The Federal Government clearly has a role. But, you know, the more I am here, Mr. President, and the more I see what I think is the role of the Federal Government, the more I am impressed with the fact that you and I make our communities strong there. And much of that is because we are willing to volunteer. I think it was the Frenchman de Tocqueville who came to examine and to explore and to look into this new idea of democracy. One of the things that he observed and found to be most important was this was a country, this was a society that was doing things together for each other voluntarily. And that still is--that still is--the root, it seems to me, of our society. The role of the Federal Government is minimal in that. 
I was pleased with the President and the several Presidents last week who raised the image and raised the visibility of voluntarism. But the fact is, national voluntarism is not really the key. It is in Casper, WY, or Gillette, WY, or Louisville, KY. That is where voluntarism works and that is where it will continue to work. 
So I think this bill is something we all should support. I am so delighted that the sponsors have done this, worked on it. I am delighted that we will be able to vote and vote positively on it in a few minutes. 
I see some others wishing to speak, Mr. President, so I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, we want to take some time this morning to talk a little bit about an issue that is very current, is always current, but particularly current because the trustees of Medicare have given their annual report. So we want to take some time and talk a little bit about an issue that all of us are very much interested in. I think, universally, we want to keep health care for the elderly. But the difficulty has been in facing up to some of the realistic changes that have to be made if, indeed, we are going to continue to have Medicare. 
The conflict has always been a political one, frankly, between those who say Medicare is the third rail of politics--touch it and you are dead. So nobody wants to talk about it. At the same time, there is a growing recognition, a growing certainty, that unless you make some changes, this program will not be available for the elderly in years to come. So there will be several of us talking about that. 
First, I would like to yield to my friend, a very strong spokesman on this and other issues, the Senator from Idaho.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for coming this morning to talk about Medicare. I want to take a couple of minutes to sum up and make some comments with respect to my views on Medicare. 
First of all, I cannot think of a more important issue to deal with, one that is more difficult to deal with, one that has been put off politically because of the difficulty of dealing with it. But certainly the time has come to which we have to face up to doing it. I think it is likely that we will. 
Over the last several years, particularly in the last election, it was used as an election issue. The President and the administration generally said those Republicans simply want to do away with Medicare, want to cut it. That is not the point at all. I think most everyone knew at the time that was not the point at all. Some very unfactual things were said. Now most anyone who has paid any attention at all to the system, to the status, has to say, `Look, we have to make some changes. If we do not make changes we will not have the results we need.' And the results we have seen are an increasing challenge to the validity of the program, and the fact that the program will not last over another 4 years. 
So the report of the trustees is there--trustees appointed, most of them, by the President--who have laid out the facts, who have said the good news is that it still will expire in 2001, the same year it was said to expire last year. The bad news is that it is no better than it was and we are 1 year closer to it. That report is there. It is projected that the program will go broke in 4 years. This confirms what we have known over a period of time. Now the time has come to do something. We ought to take advantage of this opportunity. We can make some changes. I think both the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Texas indicated we have a difficult issue, but we can make some changes. The longer we wait, the more difficult it will be to rectify the problem. 
We have already begun to move into the area of giving some choice to seniors. I think that is a great idea. If we are going to have choice of managed care, for example, which has brought down the costs in many cases, we have to do something about the payments that are made currently. The payments for Medicare, HMO's in some counties in New York are $750 a month. Those same payments in Wyoming, and in North and South Dakota are $220. We do not have the opportunity in our States to use managed care. Furthermore, those high payments have allowed the benefits in this New York county to be greater than the benefits in Wyoming for a program that has all been financed by the same payments from everyone--2.9 percent. That is unfair. We need to change it. There are aging and disabled persons who depend on it. We need to do something. We need to give some flexibility. We need to be able to use some managed care plans. 
We also need to take a long look at fraud and abuse. We had some hearings a couple of years ago, and I am sure things have not changed, where nearly 10 percent of this enormous fund was lost in fraud and abuse. We can do something about that. 
Mr. President, I simply again want to thank my friends for coming here. I think we have to focus on this program. The sooner we find some solutions, the less severe any changes will have to be. We can, indeed, do that. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want to talk about a subject that is very important and close to my heart, and that is national parks, for at least two reasons. One is I grew up right outside of Yellowstone Park in Wyoming. We have Teton Park in Wyoming as well. 
I am also chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks. We have had a series of two hearings on the future of the National Park System, and, as chairman, I am committed to the formulation of a proparks agenda which will allow us to enrich parks well into the next century. 
Before speaking on the issue of the future, however, let me briefly discuss the current status of the system and some of the real problems that do confront us. Today's National Park System is comprised of 375 park units and is visited each year by millions of visitors. The parks are immensely popular destinations, of course, intended to protect and commemorate this country's most significant natural, historical, and culture resources. 
According to recent testimony from our hearings, this diverse collection of units stimulates over $10 billion annually in revenue to local economies and supports 230,000 tourism-related jobs. Each year, 12 million foreign visitors are drawn to our parks, contributing significantly to a $22 billion international travel trade surplus. So, in addition to protecting our most precious resources, they are also an economic stimulus, of course. 
The Park Service is currently authorized to employ 20,342 full-time workers. This system includes approximately 80.2 million acres. The 1997 budget is authorized at roughly $1.4 billion. 
This relatively small agency, managing a large land base enjoying unparalleled popularity and generating significant tax and business revenues, faces a pressing dilemma. At a time when the American taxpayers are serious about smaller Government and lower taxes, Americans have also demonstrated an equally serious interest in their parks. Unfortunately, their interest has not, as yet, been translated into a serious and long-range plan nor commitment for the care of parks. The result is a legacy of critical problems plaguing the National Park Service. 
Today, we face an overwhelming inventory of unfunded National Park Service programs. Over the years, the National Park Service has been pulled in a wide variety of directions. Each change, each new direction, each new responsibility has caused an adverse effect in the system. 
The Park Service has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that you can do more with less. But, in adding new areas and new responsibilities, the agency is forced into a scenario of doing less with less in terms of service and protection. As a result of decisions made by the Congress and the administration, we face an unbelievable backlog of unfunded Park Service programs. The budget shortfall is staggering. Let me touch briefly on some of the problems. 
Within the 375 units of the Park Service we have approximately $1.4 billion of authorized land acquisitions. These are private lands that are authorized within authorized park boundaries, but these lands have never been acquired. There are 823 billion dollars worth of national resource management projects which have gone unfunded. It is almost impossible to make a sound management decision based on scientific evidence if we are lacking the basic information on the extent and the condition and the inventory of these valuable natural resources. 
It is more than difficult to protect something if you do not have a clue as to what you are protecting. 
In the area of cultural resource management projects, the unfunded backlog is $331 million. Again, these valuable cultural resources are not protected or stabilized. 
There are 1.5 billion dollars worth of building-related projects for which there is no budget provision. For the benefit of my colleagues, I would like to point out that if Congress decided to fully fund this item, we would only provide needed repairs to existing deteriorating facilities. No new facilities would be constructed under this scenario. 
There are $304 million of utility systems that are in advance states of disrepair throughout the system. Potable water and sewage systems that meet specifications are an absolute necessity if we want visitors to continue to come to our parks. 
In the identified resource protection work that needs to be accomplished, $1.8 billion would begin to arrest the digression of natural resources of our parks before we lose those resources that we are committed to protect. 
Mr. President, $2.2 billion is required for road and bridge repair and transportation systems. In my own State of Wyoming, the cost of road repair in Yellowstone Park exceeds $300 million. This cost will automatically increase if the road repairs are ignored. 
I might add, in the last few years, something like $8 million has been committed to this $300 million deficit. 
In many cases, employee housing is substandard. There are parks where the occupants of the National Park Service need not look outside to see if it is snowing. They only have to check the snow level in their living room. The pricetag to get employee housing to an acceptable standard is $442 million. If we cannot afford to take care of the caretakers, then there is something radically wrong. 
The total unfunded backlog in maintenance, resource stabilization, infrastructure repair and employee housing is $8.7 billion. This price tag does not include the concessions which also need, of course, to keep pace. 
Mr. President, $8.7 billion is a major problem. We need to take positive steps to correct this deficiency. Forward-thinking, new, innovative approaches will be required. It is a problem that cannot be resolved in the short term. 
I am happy to report, however, that there is, I think, reason for optimism and a favorable prognosis. It is going to be difficult, but I think we can do it. 
As a result of our hearings on the future of the parks, there are many ideas to be discussed and evaluated, but now is the time to address the long-term solutions and to reinvigorate the National Park Service so that our park system will stand as an example to the world well into the next century. 
Most importantly, we need to ensure that we are conserving and protecting the resources, protecting the natural and historic objects and the wildlife, while at the same time ensuring that the parks will be visited and will be an enjoyable experience. 
Within the next few weeks, we plan to circulate a strategic plan to our colleagues and to the administration which will chart a course to deal with this serious dilemma, a plan to serve as a foundation for a program to reinvigorate the parks by the year 2010. 
The Thomas plan--we have not thought of a better name--will contain some proposals for legislative initiatives, as well as some concepts that the administration can implement. As a result of our hearings on the future, it became very apparent that we need to incorporate some of the best ideas. 
Several financial concepts will, out of necessity, be discussed. As a start, the plan will include a bonding initiative. Many of our parks are essentially small villages or towns. In essence, they are towns that are required to have roads and utility systems and infrastructure. It seems to me we cannot expect to bring those up to operating condition out of annual operating funds. So the municipalities can show us the way. They have over the years bonded to do that. We do not have the money. 
The process is relatively simple. We can establish a Federal corporate entity within the Department to administer the bonds. We need to establish a dependable system to pay off the bonds, and we can do that. There are additional options that ought to be considered. 
I anticipate our plan would be built on the fine work of Senator Gorton in the last session making the fee demonstration permit and extending it to all units of the national parks, a proposal where the revenues collected in those parks stay where they are collected. 
A number of our witnesses spoke about establishing a strict criteria for the establishment of new additions. When we are $8.7 billion behind, we need to be careful about the additional authorizations we make. This is not suggesting we should delete any of the units, but we ought to be careful about the new ones and, frankly, not make a political decision that a State park or 
local park be converted to a Federal park so the Feds will take over. The Park Service was never intended to be a redevelopment agency. 
There are other programs, of course, that need help. Our plan will include a concession reform which turns away from the failed practice of trying to repair and refurbish the existing and inadequate law. We will take an innovative approach and, hopefully, there will be some higher fees paid to maintain the parks. 
We should turn to the private sector for expertise in the management and operations of concessions. These are multimillion-dollar programs. 
As a result, we ought to have an asset manager in the Park Service--it is a huge financial operation--someone who is experienced and who has a background and training in assets. We can do that. 
On a different issue, our hearings revealed the need for better employee training. We can do that, largely with the use of universities and schools that are there. 
We need to continue progress made in more cost-effective management, insisting on efficiency-oriented management goals, linked with the reduction of the size of the Washington office and put the folks in the parks where they really need to be. I am not suggesting a personnel reduction, but I am suggesting a reallocation. 
Many of our parks are funding maintenance departments that would be the envy of small towns. There are ways to streamline this. There is no reason why the private sector cannot be contracted to do many of these things and do them more efficiently and save money. 
Mr. President, the Park Service identifies backlogs and other problems. It is fine to do park planning, but the process and the content needs to be timely and realistic. Park general management plans have been sitting on the shelves for years. It is time to update, implement and really go forward. 
This is an ambitious agenda, but, in my opinion, there are concepts that can be enacted. We can collectively achieve a great victory in the preservation of something that we all support. 
My home State of Wyoming is now famous for its parks--Yellowstone, Tetons, Devils Tower. Like most Americans, I take great pride in those. So we want to set a standard for national parks for the 21st century. We have invited, of course, the administration to join with us. Among other things, I have sent a letter to the President asking that he appoint a park director. There is not one now. In order to have some plans and work together, we do need some leadership there. 
I am suggesting and want my colleagues to know I am prepared to undertake this issue, and together we can cause something constructive to happen. We have a great opportunity. The time is now, the time is right, and I am willing to work any time with anyone to bring the National Park Service into the 21st century alive, vibrant, efficient, effective, and lasting, more importantly, an agency that would provide excellent service to visitors and provide excellent service to the resource. We can do that. 
Mr. President, I thank you, and I yield the floor.  
Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, tomorrow is tax day. I guess every one of us knows that. Certainly some of us are a little sleepless from having dealt with it. So it is an appropriate time to talk, I think, about taxes. There are lots of things to talk about in the area of taxes, of course. One of them is the tax system. Obviously, most people believe the tax system needs to be changed, needs to be made simpler, needs to be made more fair. We could talk about the IRS. A lot of people talk about that, particularly in April. There need to be changes there, clearly. On the other hand, most believe, and I do as well, that if we really expect something different from the enforcement and collection agency for taxes, then we have to change the tax system which they enforce. 
But, today I wanted to take this time, along with a number of my colleagues--and I appreciate very much Senator Coverdell setting aside this time; I expect there will be six of us here over the next number of minutes--to talk about taxes, what taxes mean to us and what they mean to our constituents. It is an appropriate time, also, not only to talk about taxes, but to talk about the agenda that we have in the Senate, particularly the Republican agenda with respect to taxes: What our plans are, what we have on our menu with regard to taxes, to provide some tax relief for American families, provide an opportunity for American families and American businesses to spend the money that they earn themselves; to talk a little bit about the fact that, on the average, American families spend almost 40 percent of their total income on taxes, all kinds of taxes--Federal, State, local--40 percent. That is an awful lot of our labor that is paid to the government. So, let me make it clear that Republicans want tax relief, we want tax relief soon, we want tax relief this year, and I am hopeful--we want tax relief as part of this budget that is now being prepared. 
We hear a lot--I hear it from my constituents and I am sure my associate from Wyoming hears the same thing--that families are having difficulties getting ahead, families are having difficulties in savings, families are having difficulties paying their bills. Part of the reason is the level of taxes. So, it seems to me that it is necessary for us to respond. People in my State remind me that nearly 40 percent of their income is paid in State and local taxes, as well as Federal taxes. That is an awful lot of our money. 
Surveys have indicated that Americans are willing to pay taxes, but they perceive that like 25 percent would be a more acceptable and reasonable figure. My constituents want to know what we are doing about taxes in this Congress. Frankly, there is a great deal of opposition to doing very much of anything. I think, really, if you want to be serious about tax relief, you have to go back to the basic issue, the really basic issue. The talk about taxes and balanced budgets is more than talking about arithmetic, more than talking about balancing numbers. It represents a philosophy. It represents the point of view that people have with respect to Government. There are those in this body who believe--certainly in this country there are those who believe--the Government spends money better than individuals, that more and more money ought to be brought into the central Government so it can be disbursed for all kinds of ideas. There is a legitimate point of view that the Federal Government should be involved in almost everything that is troublesome to people in this country. As a matter of fact, I think one could say that has been the President's political philosophy, to get involved in all kinds of things, some say the kinds of things that ought to be done by the city council, that ought to be done by the school board. But the President has found those to be politically viable. So it is a philosophy. 
Those who want more and more Government, of course need to have more and more taxes. I do not agree with that point of view. I think our efforts ought to be designed toward reducing the role of the central Government in our lives. Those things that are inherently governmental, and there are some, ought to be done by government at the level closest to people. There is a role for the Federal Government. There are things the Federal Government ought to be doing. But, conversely, there are things that the Federal Government should not be doing. So my point is that when you talk about budgets, when you talk about tax relief, the response is always, we--you--cannot balance the budget; we cannot cut spending enough to have tax relief for American families. 
I suggest that we can. We have a $1.7 trillion budget, and in that budget there are many things that could be reduced. There are many things that could be combined. There are many things that could be, in fact, eliminated. It is possible to balance the budget and have tax relief. The other alternative, of course, which again is the one the administration has taken over the last several years, is let us balance the budget but 
let us do it by continuing to increase spending and raise taxes. The President's budget that is out before us now raises taxes by $23 billion. It has some tax relief in it but that is offset by more tax increases. 
So that is really the issue. We will talk about all kinds of details on the floor. Details are fine. We ought to talk about them. When you really peel it all away, you are talking about a philosophical difference of more Government versus less Government. Frankly, I think it would be sort of interesting and honest if those who want more Government would simply get up and say, `Yes, I want more Government. I think we ought to have more spending.' Seldom do you hear that. There are a million other reasons for it, but that is really the bottom line. 
So, that is what we talk about, I think, when we talk about the budget. That is what we talk about when we talk about tax relief. It is possible to balance the budget, reduce taxes and get tax relief at the same time. The two are not mutually exclusive in a $1.7 trillion budget. Can you imagine what $1.7 trillion is? There are plenty of examples of waste and abuse. There are plenty of examples and opportunities to create a smaller, more efficient Government. For a few examples, the State Department has $500 million in unneeded real estate. How to dispose of that? Repeal of Davis-Bacon would save $2.5 billion, so contracts in the Government sector are the same as they are in the private sector. There are 160 employment and job training programs in 15 different agencies--160. I cannot imagine that we could not be more efficient than to have 160 programs aimed at the same thing. In fact, we could get more money to the people who need the money if we would consolidate those, in addition to spending reductions. There are 73 Federal programs aimed at gathering statistics. 
I have introduced, along with a number of my associates, what we call the Freedom From Government Competition Act. It is a simple idea, an idea that has been policy for a very long time. It has not been implemented. That is, to identify those activities within the Federal Government that are commercial in nature and also those that are inherently Government; and those that are commercial, put them out for a bid in the private sector so they could be accomplished in the private sector, substantially saving dollars, some say as much as $30 billion, in the private sector. That is really what we all say we want to do, is to strengthen the private sector and limit the size of Government. Here is an opportunity to do that. Yet the administration drags its feet and says, `Oh, we are doing all this.' The fact is, they are not. The fact is, there are lots of things that can be contracted out that are commercial in nature. 
I happen to be chairman of the Parks Subcommittee. We are entering into a long-term study of strengthening the parks and seeing how we can provide more resources to protect the resources there, more dollar resources to protect the natural resources. One of the ways is to take some of those functions and put them into the private sector. So, we have introduced a bill to do that. 
There are all kinds of ways in which efficiencies can be found, in which Government can be smaller. The result of that can be a balanced budget and a reduced tax burden on American families. There are two that particularly come from my constituents when I am in Wyoming. One of them has to do with the estate tax. As you might imagine, a lot of our folks are ranchers and farmers and small business people, families who have worked all their lives, perhaps several generations, to put together a farm or a ranch which has asset value and, frankly, has relatively little cash flow. Yet, quite often under our current estate taxes, that family has to dispose of their assets, dispose of their ranch, on the death of the senior person in order to pay the taxes. So he or she cannot pass it on, that lifetime of work, to their family. The fact is, we spend more money in this country avoiding estate taxes than we do paying them--it is relatively minor. 
Capital gains? We would like to have a good healthy economy, of course, and it seems to me there is nothing that would provide more strength to the economy than to provide an opportunity for people to invest in businesses without having all their growth taken in capital gains taxes. This is a direct result of reducing taxes, to have investments, and, indeed, for the first several years it increases revenue. 
So that is what we are talking about here. Again, let me say I get concerned sometimes, when we seem to kind of trivialize the debate, whether this is going to produce that. We get very involved in the numbers game when beyond that, in a much broader sense, is a philosophical direction. Where are we going with the Federal Government? Do we want more? Do we want less? Do we want people to have more money to invest for themselves? Do we want to invest in the private sector to create jobs and therefore increase revenues? 
We always hear about the 1980's in which the deficit grew, and, indeed, the deficit did grow. But if you take a look at it, revenue grew exceedingly fast. It was the longest growth of revenue in history. The problem was Congress continued to spend 
more. It was not a matter of not having enough revenues; it was a spending issue, and that is what we ought to face up to, it seems to me. 
So we are talking here a great deal about the philosophy--philosophy. Do you want more Government? Do you want less? Do you want it more efficient? Do you want to continue as it is? It makes some sense to reduce the size of the budget and cause some of the agencies to have to find some better ways to do things, and they can. Specific tax cuts, it seems to me, that are most important have to do with capital gains, which helps to increase jobs, helps to allow people to have a living wage and to take care of their own families; and estate tax, which allows people to work their lives to create an asset and to be able to keep it; to provide $500 per youngster under 18 for families, so they can take care of their own health insurance for young people. It seems to me that is the direction we ought to go and this is the time to make those kinds of decisions. 
I am joined by my friend and associate, the Senator from Nebraska. I would like now to yield to the Senator.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a difficulty that we have had this winter in Wyoming and Montana in the Yellowstone Park area with respect to buffalo. Many of you, of course, have read about the problem as a result of an extremely difficult winter, freezing rain and snow, lack of feed, and I think also an excessive number of buffalo. As chairman of the Senate Energy Committee Subcommittee on National Parks, I come to the floor today to announce that we plan to hold hearings on the prospective plan for bison in Yellowstone Park next year. It is not our purpose to particularly pick apart what happened last year, but what we want to do is avoid the same thing happening in the year that is to come. 
Many of you have probably read in this weekend's New York Times some details about the conflicting and contentious perspectives regarding bison and the issue of brucellosis. The hearing I plan to have will be to spur the Interior Department to set a plan for the upcoming year. If we do not, then we might very well end up with another year of the same kinds of difficulties. 
Many buffalo in Yellowstone Park are afflicted with brucellosis, which is a major threat to the surrounding livestock States that border on Yellowstone Park, particularly, in this case, Montana. Unfortunately, the only solution that has been developed so far for the Park Service in the State of Montana is to shoot the buffalo as they come out of Yellowstone. Clearly, that solution is not acceptable. We have to find one that is a long-term solution to the problem. 
Management of the bison herd in Yellowstone is not a brand new idea. Clearly, there has to be some kind of management to a herd of this kind. There has been a great deal of interest in having a natural, free-roaming herd, which would be a nice thing. Up until about 1967, however, it was managed very closely. Then the decision was made to let the herd simply act as it would in a natural situation and be controlled by the lack of feed and predators and all those kinds of things. Unfortunately, that is not very workable in a park that is visited by 3 million people a year, in a park where other kinds of controls are not in place. So the result is the herd had grown from somewhere in the neighborhood of 1,500 bison to nearly 4,000. There are over 3,500. As long as the weather circumstances and the grazing circumstances were excellent, they were able to get by, even though most observers did note that the grazing there was damaged considerably by that number of bison. 
So the Park Service has made some efforts to address the matter. But the fact is that there has not been any real leadership for doing something over a period of time. Instead of facing the problem, the Park Service focused on the theory of natural regulation. As you can see by the events of last year, that natural regulation did not resolve the matter. Natural regulation does not work well when one Federal agency holds the threat over ranchers in the State that they will be stripped of their brucellosis-free status if bison cross into their State. At the same time, another Federal agency encourages wildlife to migrate from the park by not developing a proper management plan. This is precisely, of course, what happened. 
It is more a problem in Montana than it is in Wyoming. You at least have a buffer in Wyoming, on both the south and east sides of the park, of a forest wilderness area; whereas, in 
fact, private property grazing takes place immediately outside of the park on the Montana side. 
So, in order to avoid repeating that unfortunate situation, where a good number of bison starved to death in the park and another number was shot as they went out of the park to avoid the problem of brucellosis, we think we need to find a more innovative solution. The time for finger pointing is over. It has been sort of a tough deal out there, with everybody being involved. 
What we need is some strong leadership to face the issue. Unfortunately, the President has still not appointed a new Director of the Park Service. It is a little difficult to deal with the Park Service and Interior Department in terms of policy, in terms of the future, when there really is not a permanent Director there. So we clearly need, and it is very vital that we have, focused and solid leadership in the National Park Service. In fact, I have sent a letter today to the President urging he do that. 
Along with Chairman Murkowski, I and others on the Senate Energy Committee are willing to work with the administration to develop positive and constructive solutions. As a matter of fact, we have held a couple of general hearings on the park. Our purpose in the next several months will be to take a look at the park to find a way, a very positive way, to strengthen the National Park System. We have about 375 parks. I think they are among the most important elements of our culture and our history, and our effort ought to be increased to maintain those natural resources as well as providing an opportunity for visitors to enjoy them. 
So, we are ready to address the tough issues and launch a proparks agenda for this next year to try to make some moves to ensure that this buffalo incident does not occur next year and that we find a solution that protects not only the buffalo, protects not only the resource, but also protects the surrounding States and their very important livestock industries and allows them to remain in a brucellosis-free certification area. So we will be moving forward on that, Mr. President. I appreciate the opportunity, and I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise this morning to talk about the reauthorization of the Federal highway bill. I am very pleased to join with Senators Baucus and Kempthorne in the introduction of the Surface Transportation Authorization and Regulatory Streamlining Act for the Next Century, STARS 2000. I am also pleased that there will be 14 original cosponsors in support of this important legislation. 
This is the time for the reauthorization of the Federal highway bill, called ISTEA, that has been in place for the past 6 years and has made a very important contribution to this country and its transportation. It has made some important changes in our surface transportation policies, but as we move into the 21st century, we need to update the law and make it more flexible and more efficient in order to meet the transportation challenges of the new century. I believe STARS 2000, achieves this goal. It will create new rules of the road to help us to build the highways and bridges to the 21st century. 
With respect to the gas tax, it is a user fee, of course, that each of us pay as we buy gas wherever we are in this country. American taxpayers have been shortchanged with regard to the benefits they are getting from the gas tax. Not all of the gas taxes have been used for surface transportation. We need to get back to a user-fee system where the taxes paid, in this case by the users of highways, are used then for surface transportation. STARS 2000 addresses this problem by restoring the integrity of the fee system by spending as much out of the highway fee system as it can sustain. We have been spending less than $20 billion annually. STARS 2000 raises the authorization to $27 billion. We believe those dollars ought to go into the highway system. 
In addition, it provides a framework for any additional revenues such as the 4.3 cents that currently goes to deficit reduction. Should these user fees be transferred to the highway trust fund, they would be distributed according to the bill's formula. STARS 2000 will help my State and many States maintain a national system. 
If you are going to go from Washington to California, you obviously have to go throughout the whole country and therefore it is key to have a Federal system. In my State, a small State in terms of population but large in terms of space, we pay more per capita than any other State, nearly $200 for every person in our State for highway gas taxes, and yet we have deteriorating bridges and roads, as do many States. 
In addition, the Federal Government owns 50 percent of Wyoming. One of the principle authors of this bill and my friend, Senator Kempthorne, his State of Idaho has even larger holdings. In Nevada, it is 86 percent federally owned so we have to take Federal lands into account as we talk about a Federal system. 
In fact, Yellowstone Park, located in Wyoming, has a backlog of nearly $250 million in road repairs and maintenance that needs to be considered. Unfortunately, we are not meeting these needs. For example, the Clinton administration admits that this country only invests 70 percent of what needs to be invested just to maintain our transportation infrastructure. These shortfalls hurt all taxpayers, of course. The STARS 2000 coalition States are bridge States--people and goods cross these States to other destinations. A set of efficient and well maintained roads are as important to the cities that export goods across the country and around the world as they are to people in our States. These transactions contribute to the Nation's economy and its job creation. STARS 2000 will make a smooth flow of people and goods across the country a reality. 
One of the keys to the highway program is that each State knows best what it should be doing with the resources it has, and its priorities are. Clearly, the highways and roads in New York City are quite different than those in Wyoming or Nevada, so we need to have the flexibility for State and local officials to make the decisions there. STARS 2000 does that by significantly 
increasing the surface transportation program, the STP portion, and puts the decisionmaking authority for how this money is allocated into the hands of state and local people. 
Unfortunately, the administration bill, NEXTEA, is advertised as building a bridge to the 21st century. Unfortunately, it is my belief that in its present form that bridge will collapse. NEXTEA does not restore the integrity of the trust fund, so for the American taxpayer, there is no trust in the trust fund. It does not streamline the program. It does not make the kinds of changes that are needed. It hangs on to what we have done in the past. It also handcuffs local authorities in terms of making decisions. NEXTEA adds regulations. God knows, we need to move away from regulations and allow the highway program to be more efficient. 
STARS 2000 emphasizes the Federal component of our program and achieves a fair and equitable method of distribution. Based on a percentage share of the Federal highway program, 37 States do better and 1 tied compared to NEXTEA; 33 States do better than under the current law; 25 States higher, 6 the same compared to STEP 21. In addition, STARS 2000 addresses the donor/donee issue by creating a 95 percent minimum allocation to all States. That means all States will get at least 95 percent of what they put into the highway trust fund. 
The STARS 2000 coalition will be a significant factor in the ISTEA reauthorization debate. Without our coalition, without our States, you cannot get there from here--physically or politically. STARS 2000 is more than a marker. It is a coalition of States that are needed to make an interstate map to the 21st century. 
Quite often, in my experience in the House, the highway money flows where the votes are. But that really does not work in a transportation program. You have to have one that covers the country and is, indeed, a Federal program. The funding formulas under STARS 2000 are based on the transportation needs of the country. 
STARS 2000 maintains the integrity of the original ISTEA. It improves it by a smarter investment of taxpayers' money. It meets our growing infrastructure needs. It increases job and economic growth and increases flexibility and efficiency. We get more bang for the buck. 
So we are emphasizing the National Highway System, allowing more decisions to be made closer to home, and I certainly would submit to my fellow Members of the Senate this is a bill that we can all support and will provide a better infrastructure for highway surface transportation. 
Mr. President, I appreciate the time. I thank Senators Kempthorne and Baucus for their hard work on this legislation and look forward to working with them in the future. 
I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, several of us have asked this morning for a half hour to talk about an item that is of particular interest now, and that is taxes. It is of particular interest because we are now close to April 15, when taxes are more real to us all than they are at some other times. We want to talk about taxes because they are part of the Republican agenda. We have talked, over the years, about the idea of allowing families to spend more of their own money, allowing businesses to be able to invest and create jobs in the private sector. I think it is appropriate to talk about taxes because it has been an area of controversy--the idea of whether or not we ought to have an effort at tax relief at the same time we seek to balance the budget. 
Mr. President, I am here to tell you that having been in my home district in Wyoming over the past week, as most of us have, and having a series of town meetings, the issue that came up most often is: What are you going to do about taxes? What are you going to do about the capital gains tax? What are you going to do about estate taxes or some tax relief for families to be able to help take care of their own children? 
So I feel very strongly about it. Let me just say that too often when we talk about taxes and the budget, I think it seems that we are talking about arithmetic and bookkeeping when we talk 
about budgets. It just seems to me that when we talk about budgets, we are really talking about something quite broader than that, and that is the direction of this Government and whether or not we want to have more central Government, or whether we want to have less, whether we want to move more of our activities back closer to people at the State and local governments, or whether we want to continue to build up more and more at the central Federal Government level. 
With that concept, the philosophical direction that is inherent in those decisions is also a decision about taxes and, I suspect, if possible, although we haven't done it for 30 years, to balance the budget and to continue to spend at the same time. You do that by raising taxes. That is the way you do that. That is what the President did several years ago, to move toward a balanced budget by continuing to spend but to raise taxes. 
There is a philosophical difference of view. There are those who believe that we ought to have more Government, who believe that the Government actually spends money to a better advantage than people themselves do, who believe that we ought to have more and more functions carried on at the Federal level in the central Government. That is a legitimate point of view. I don't happen to share it. 
I think, Mr. President, that quite often when we talk about the details of issues, really at the center of it is that issue of whether you want more Government or whether you want less. It is a pretty basic philosophical issue. That is what we are talking about here. It does seem to me that--No. 1, when you have a tax burden on the American citizens that averages between 38 and 40 percent in taxes for families, that is a heavy burden. That is a very heavy burden. 
It seems to me, of course, that there are lots of ways in which we can reduce the size of the Federal Government. We can contract, we can have more things done in the private sector, and we can move more of it to the State government. There are a lot of the things out of the $1.7 trillion budget we don't have to do. Many of those things have been there forever and they just go on because they go on. I guess I am suggesting that we ought to take a long look at that budget. In my view, one of the priorities for this Congress and for this Senate ought to be to balance the budget and provide tax relief for American citizens. That is what it is all about, I believe, so we want to talk about that. 
There is a different view. There are those who, I think legitimately from a strategic point of view, say, `Let us balance the budget first.' That is OK, I guess, if you are committed then to doing the tax relief. However, I believe we ought to deal with them at the same time. I am one who signed a letter--there were 16 of us, I believe--to the leader saying that we ought to deal with the whole concept of the size of the budget, how we balance the budget and how we give tax relief to American families and to business. That seems to be what we ought to do. 
What did I hear about at home? I heard about capital gains taxes. I heard an awful lot about the idea that people would like to be able to invest in businesses if they could make some profit over time, even if it is nothing more than inflation over time, and about paying taxes on the investments for the inflation they have made. That discourages them. We have a lot of small businesses in my State, as is true everywhere. Small business is the backbone of this economy. We have a lot of farmers and ranchers and families who have spent their whole lives putting together an estate in their ranch or farm. Now we find, quite often, because those are not really cash-flow cows--there is a great deal of asset value there, but not much cash--you have to dispose of that property in order to pay the taxes. You can't pass it on to your family. There is a lot of concern about that. 
Well, Mr. President, I have been joined by several of my associates to talk for a little bit about taxes this morning. So I yield to my friend, the Senator from Arkansas.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, let me just sort of wind up on our tax thing and say that if you are like me--a weekend from now it will be April 15 and all of us I hope are beginning to think about preparing our tax returns. It is a headache, of course, and so we tend to procrastinate. We are taxed too high, I am sure. And I am sure also that people out there look at Washington and wonder if all that talk about tax relief is just talk. 
We are here to say that it is not. Tax relief for families in America, for small business, is alive and well and one of the good ideas that is coming out of Washington, I hope soon. By next year, it is our hope that as we begin to think about compiling tax returns we will have accomplished what Americans deserve and expect from Washington as a matter of fact--reforms that let families keep more of their money. Republicans want to lower the tax burden and provide some common sense to the tax system. 
Currently, according to the Census Bureau, a typical family of four spends more than 3 hours of every 8-hour day working for dollars that are dedicated to Federal, State and local taxes. That is an average of almost 40 percent of income--40 percent of our income to continue to grow a central government. You get big government and you get a bloated bureaucracy. Instead, we ought to be able to use those dollars to increase our businesses, to feed our kids, to send them to school. So we need reform, smart reform, smart tax reform. That has a nice ring to it, doesn't it? 
I hear also in town meetings more and more about the IRS. Let me tell you that at least to some extent you cannot do much about the IRS until you change the system and make it simpler. 
Which taxes to reform? Where should we start? The inheritance tax for one. We have already talked about that. Here is one that makes no sense at all. We spend more time avoiding inheritance taxes than we do paying them. People who have spent time in business and farms cannot pass it on to their own families. The current tax penalizes the development of wealth and business. That is wrong. It is really a matter of freedom. Citizens own their property and families should not be compelled to sell it if the head of the household passes away. In the West it is an environmental problem. The view of the West, the mountains will be subdivided unless we act. 
How about capital gains reduction? Entrepreneurs and small business investors take substantial risks when they open or invest in businesses. Cutting capital gains will increase economic growth. Add to that tax credits for our families with children. Grant a $500-per-child tax credit and give families the opportunity to do some things. 
When it is all wrapped up, tax reform should have to pass a simple commonsense test. Does it impose the lowest possible compliance and enforcement? Does it encourage growth? Does it work to help strengthen families? By anyone's measure, our current system does not pass this test. So we deserve a Saturday in April with our family instead of sitting with a stack of receipts and the Tax Code. We want tax simplicity. We want tax relief. 
The President's proposed budget, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the President's fiscal year 1998 budget contains a net tax increase of $23 billion over 10 years. That is not tax relief. That is more burden. That is not what we need in the future. The President needs to come to the snubbing post and join with us on taxes and reform in balancing the budget. We can do that, and our opportunity is now. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to announce today's schedule on behalf of the majority leader. Today there will be a period of morning business until the hour of 12:30 this afternoon. At 12:30, the Senate will recess until the hour of 2:15 to allow for the weekly policy conferences to be held. When the Senate reconvenes at 2:15, we will resume debate on the motion to proceed on S. 104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act legislation. Under the order, the time between 2:15 and 5:15 will be equally divided, with a vote occurring at 5:15 on invoking cloture on the motion to proceed to S. 104. 
If cloture is invoked, the majority leader hopes that the Senate will be allowed to proceed to the consideration of the bill in a reasonable time period. If cloture is not invoked, I remind all Senators that a second cloture motion was filed last night and therefore a second cloture vote would occur tomorrow. If that vote becomes necessary, all Members will be notified later today as to when they can expect that vote on Wednesday.

Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair. 
 Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the college football Bowl Alliance. I am concerned that under the Bowl Alliance structure, athletic excellence is not being recognized in postseason I-A college football play. 
Fresh in the minds of Wyoming football fans is the last game of regular season play when the nationally ranked Cowboys played against No. 5-ranked Brigham Young University for the Western Athletic Conference [WAC] championship title. Both teams went into the game believing the winner would be selected for major postseason bowl action. UW and BYU delivered a terrific conference championship game. BYU won 28-25 over Wyoming in overtime play. It was the first WAC title game won in overtime. Unfortunately, neither WAC team was invited to a major New Year's bowl. 
The 1996 selections to the New Year's bowl games shed revealing light on the college football Bowl Alliance. Invitations to the most lucrative major bowls games--the Orange Bowl, the Sugar Bowl, and the Fiesta Bowl--were largely sent to high-profile, highly marketable teams instead of worthy teams. Many sports fans were disappointed at the postseason New Year's bowl matchups. I am concerned about the closed selection process that has developed and the impact the Bowl Alliance structure will have on I-A collegiate football. 
The Bowl Alliance operates outside the purview of the National Collegiate Athletics Association [NCAA]. The Bowl Alliance was created in 1993 when the Atlantic Coast Conference, the Big East Conference, the Big 12 Conference, the Southeastern Conference and Notre Dame came together and took it upon themselves to provide and acquire teams to participate in the major bowl games. These Bowl Alliance conferences have contracts with the television networks and large corporate sponsors--Federal Express, Tostitos, and Noika. Champions from each alliance conference are automatically guaranteed a berth in one of the major bowl games. The nonalliance conferences remaining out in the cold are the Western Athletic Conference [WAC], the Big West Conference, Conference USA, the Mid American Conference and the 11 Independent teams. 
The Bowl Alliance claims its purpose is to create optimal matchups and identify and national champion. Considering the 1996 selections for the bowl games, I question if quality matchups is the true goal. Last season, TV viewers saw No. 20 Texas lose to No. 7 Penn State 38-15 in the Fiesta Bowl. Texas' record 
was 8-4. The Orange Bowl showcased No. 9 Virginia Tech losing to No. 6 Nebraska 41-21. 
Appearance in a Bowl Alliance game pays well. Each participating team takes approximately $8,000,000 back to its school. In addition, the teams get the national visibility and prestige that leads to strong athletic recruitment. Conferences outside the alliance have a remote chance of participating in one of the Alliance Bowls. Over time it will hurt the quality of the nonalliance teams who will have difficulty in recruitment. The Alliance Bowl structure will make the alliance teams stronger and relegate the nonalliance teams to a second-tier status. 
The alliance ensures its monopoly through the use of the at-large rule. Although the champions of the self-selected Alliance Bowl conferences automatically appear in one of the major bowl games there are two remaining at-large spots. It is questionable as to whether those two spots are truly at-large and open to any high-quality team that can play their way into one of the spots. A team from the WAC was deserving of one of those at-large spots last year, but the invitation never came. 
I am concerned for the future of the athletes and schools in the nonalliance conferences. That is why I joined with Senators Mitch McConnell, Robert Bennett, and Mike Enzi in writing to the Department of Justice [DOJ] and the Federal Trade Commission [FTC] to request an investigation of the Bowl Alliance. We suspect possible violations of the Sherman Antitrust Act. In 1996, the eight Alliance Bowl participants, including the Rose Bowl participants, went home with a total of $68 million. The 28 teams that played in the minor bowl games shared a pot of $31 million. We requested a formal investigation of the matter. If there is wrong-doing we want to see the DOJ and the FTC use their statutory enforcement powers to break this lock on college football. 
We are not asking for special consideration for any one team. We would like to see genuinely open competition restored to college football postseason bowls. Postseason play should be about recognizing achievement. Letting the best teams play is in the best interest of our student athletes and our schools. 
I wish to associate myself with the efforts of the Senator from Kentucky, the Senator from Utah, and my friend from Wyoming in doing some things that we think have impact in football. The Bowl Alliance has a great effect on small schools, particularly the University of Wyoming, BYU, Louisville, and others, and so we think this is an issue which needs to be discussed. I am very proud to be associated with the comments my friends will make. 
I thank the Chair.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I have a couple of things I wanted to visit about this morning. The first one of the priorities that I and a number of people have for the 105th Congress is S. 314, the Freedom From Government Competition Act. 
This is an effort, along with many other things, to seek to reduce the size of the central Government, which most people agree we should do. It is one of the reasons we try to have a balanced budget amendment, so that we can control the size of the growth of the Federal Government by our willingness to pay for it. 
One of the other areas, of course, that we have been very interested in, and continue to be, is the idea of `devolution'--kind of a new word. It means move some of the functions down to State and local governments so that we do, in keeping with the Founding Fathers, keep the size of central Government relatively limited and do those things that are essential to be done on the national level, and there are many, and yet not do the things that could better be done either at the local level in government or, indeed, in the private sector. The private sector is what I want to talk about a little today. 
In general, from the title, we are simply saying that we want to remove the competition of the Federal Government in those things that could as well or, indeed, better be done in the private sector. So S. 314 is called the Freedom From Government Competition Act. This bill is supported by a broad cross-section of business groups, and I have a list of those.

Mr. THOMAS. Let me just go over some of these folks who do support it: National Federation of Independent Businesses, U.S. Chamber, Associated General Contractors of America, National Association of Women Business Owners, Consulting Engineers Council, Business Coalition for Fair Competition, Design Professionals Coalition, and many others. 
So it is designed to say basically that in those areas of Government activities and Government operations, for those things that are done that are basically commercial, there ought to at least be an opportunity for the private sector to compete. It is designed to open the potential market of $30 billion nationally for businesses, for the private sector, both large and small. And as a matter of fact, most of the contracts would go to small business. 
It is designed to level the playing field--those are words we use a lot, but they have meaning--for thousands of businesses in the whole economy of this country from the very ordinary kinds of things to high-technology things--janitorial services, hospitality and recreation service businesses, engineering services, laboratory and testing services. 
As a matter of fact, I really became involved in this in the legislature in the State of Wyoming where we had government competing for laboratory services, where the private sector was available there to do that with the same kind of quality or even better and at less cost. So that is what we decided to do. 
It will provide for better value to taxpayers because it capitalizes on talent and expertise available in the competitive private sector. It has been Federal policy for a very long time--as a matter of fact, some 40 years--that contracting out to the private sector would be, indeed, a function of the Federal Government, but the fact is that it has not really worked out that way. So we need a legislative solution. We say we are going to do it, but we do not do it. And I understand that. Part of the reason, of course, is that in an agency you have your own operation and your own staff and would prefer to do it. 
The other is often when there has been some effort to try to determine the efficiency of it, we find that testing is really not very fair and so you end up saying, well, Government can do it cheaper, but you have not really analyzed it in a very fair way. 
We have a lot of things that the Federal Government should be doing, and they take too much time and money on goods and services, in my view, that could better be delivered by the private sector. 
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated in the past that 1.4 million Federal employees do work that is basically commercial in nature. This competition, of course, is tougher on the private sector. It kills small business, stifles economic growth, and lowers the tax base, particularly in States such as mine where 50 percent of the State belongs to the Federal Government, and it is difficult to keep the private sector and the tax base going. It hurts small business. So it has been a concern of small business. 
We have had White House small business conferences in 1980, 1986, and 1994, and in all three of these conferences this has been the major concern. 
Let me just briefly explain the bill. I indicated that for some time--like 40 years--we have had a policy to do contracting, to bring the private sector in to do things, but they really have not done that. So we are now saying statutorily there is a system for giving small business that opportunity. It does not say that it has to do that. It says that when there is a commercial activity, the private sector should be given an even chance to see if they can do it more efficiently than the Government. And there are exceptions to that, of course. There are legitimate, inherent activities of Government, and those will be the exceptions--national security, where the Federal Government can provide a better value, and we recognize that that can be. We are not asking that it be given to the private sector if, indeed, the Federal Government agency can do it more efficiently, or in the case, of course, where the private sector cannot provide the goods and services. 
So this bill establishes a system and a process where the Office of Management and Budget in the executive branch will identify those Government functions that are `inherently and basically commercial in nature.' 
It also establishes an Office of Commercial Activities within OMB to implement the bill. So now you do not have the agency that is going to do the contracting making the decision as to whether they do it or not. 
There will be an outside effort made to identify the functions that could best be done that way and to establish provisions for the transition of Federal employees if there should be some reduction there. 
The climate, I think, is right for action of this kind. Almost everybody agrees we ought to direct the money, if we can save money by better Government--there are lots of underlying issues, whether it be defense, whether it be health care, whether it be Medicare--to where we can better use those dollars rather than doing the things that someone else could do more efficiently. 
The Senate was in support of the concept of this bill; last year, the Senate voted 59 to 39 in favor of a Treasury-Postal appropriations amendment that would have prevented unfair Government competition. It was dropped, unfortunately, from the omnibus appropriations bill. 
If we are going to balance the budget, we are going to have to make some fundamental changes. The Federal Government operating commercial needs is one that we can change and eliminate and reduce. Various studies indicate that we could save up to $30 billion by utilizing private sector resources. The Heritage Foundation estimates we could save $9 billion annually. The Defense Science Board concluded the Defense Department alone could save $30 billion annually. 
So, the Freedom From Government Competition Act will help to create jobs in the private sector, help open up markets to private business, save billions of dollars and make Government more efficient. I certainly commend this bill to my associates here in the Senate, to see if we could not make a way to increase and strengthen the private sector as well as save money to be used on these things that are fundamentally Governmental in nature.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I join Wyoming's Gov. Jim Geringer, and the people of the State of Wyoming, in paying tribute to Finis Mitchell, a man whose legacy commemorates the very pioneer spirit on which our great country was founded. 
In remembrance of Mr. Mitchell's innumerable contributions to our State, Governor Geringer has issued a proclamation to designate February 15, 1997, as `Finis Mitchell Day.'

Mr. THOMAS. Finis Mitchell was in the vanguard of mountain climbing at the beginning of this century, and continued his exploration of the Wind River Mountain Range until 1985 when, at the age of 84, he suffered a debilitating knee injury. He documented his climbing experiences through extensive mapping and photography, and eventually amassed a collection of slides numbering in excess of 126,000. This intimate knowledge of the area served as a reference for the U.S. Geological Survey in drawing official maps of the Wind Rivers, and inspired Mr. Mitchell to share his love of the mountains by penning a guidebook and giving educational lectures nationwide. 
After marrying Emma Nelson in 1923, together they stocked over 300 of the region's lakes with fish and started the Wind Rivers' first recreational fishing camp. To this day, those lakes are being fished by the public. In recognition of his life-long dedication to environmental conservation, Finis Mitchell received an honorary doctorate from the University of Wyoming, in addition to other State and National awards. He also found the time to serve as a State legislator. 
Throughout his life, Mr. Mitchell demonstrated strength in his rugged individualism. Starting from a humble beginning with his wife at their post-Depression fishing camp, this spirit of determination provided Mr. Mitchell with the foundation for a lifetime of success. Finis Mitchell rose to the challenges of exploring social, educational, and political frontiers just as he made his innumerable treks into the untamed wilderness, one step at a time. 
It can be said that Mr. Mitchell's achievements were a byproduct of respect he had for the lands he called his own backyard, and those which he helped transform into a sportsman's paradise. The following passage in Finis Mitchell's own words surely echoes the sentiment of all who have had the privilege of knowing his Winds: 
Evening alone in the mountains. No one to talk to. No one speaking out . . . Only the comfort of a murmuring breeze, the goodnight chirp of the snowbird . . . the glistening of the moon on a distant glacier, the faint music of waterfalls scurrying down. Where else can a man be so close to heaven and still have his feet on the ground? 
Mr. Mitchell's extensive mapping of the Wind River region and his nationally recognized wildlife conservation efforts will be appreciated by folks from Wyoming, and others drawn to the area from all over the globe, for generations to come. We will continue to share his love of nature through the beauty of the majestic vistas and abundant wildlife that make our State like no place on Earth. 
Mr. President, I would like to close with a quote from `The Pioneer' by James Fenimore Cooper, which seems to epitomize the life of Finis Mitchell: 
None know how often the hand of God is seen in the wilderness but them that rove it for a man's life . . . 
Such a man was Finis Mitchell.

 Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, along with my colleague Senator Shelby, that exempts expenses incurred to address legislation at the State level from the current law provision that denies this deduction. This change would give lobbying at the State level the same tax deductible treatment currently given to expenses incurred to lobby at the local level. 
The provisions of this bill will allow businesses to once again deduct legitimate expenses they incur at the State level to respond to legislative proposals that can affect their livelihood and even their very existence. I ask my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this important legislation. 
As part of the Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Congress approved a proposal recommended by President Clinton to deny the deductibility of expenses incurred to influence legislation. As passed, the bill creates a `lobbying tax' by denying a business tax deduction for legitimate expenses incurred to influence legislation at both the State and Federal level. In addition, expenses incurred to influence the official actions of certain Executive branch officials are not deductible. Expenses incurred to influence the legislative actions of local governments, however, are exempt from the lobbying tax. 
When the deductibility for lobbying expenses was partially repealed in 1993, the debate centered on lobbying at the Federal level. The fact that lobbying to influence legislative actions at the local level is exempt indicates that the 1993 change did not intend to cover all lobbying activities. Lobbying at the State level was not part of the debate, even though it was included in the final legislation that was approved by Congress. 
At the State level, there is more active business participation at all levels of the legislative process. This is partly because State legislatures have smaller staffs and meet less frequently than Congress. In most States, the job of State legislator is part time. Additionally, many Governors appoint `blue ribbon commissions' and other advisory groups to recommend legislative solutions to problems peculiar to a specific State. These advisory groups depend on input from members of the business, professional, and agricultural community knowledgeable about particular issues. The recordkeeping requirements and tax penalties associated with the lobbying tax discourages and penalizes this participation. 
The denial of a deduction for legitimate business expense incurred to lobby at the State level is an unwarranted intrusion of the Federal government on the activity of State governments. While many of the reasons to restore this deduction at the State level can also apply to lobbying at the Federal level, this additional intergovernmental argument emphasizes the need to extend the current exemption from the lobbying tax at the local level to lobbying at the State level. 
Perhaps one of the best reasons for restoring the deductibility of State lobbying expenses is the paperwork burden that this law has placed on many businesses and organizations. This is especially true for the many State trade associations, most of whom are small operations and not equipped to comply with the pages and pages of confusing Federal regulations implementing this law. Compliance is both time consuming and complicated, and detracts from the legitimate and necessary work and services they perform for their members, who are primarily small businesses and who depend on these associations to look after their interests. 
This bill is very simple. It restores the deductibility of business expenses incurred for activities to influence legislation at the State level, and gives them the same treatment that exists under current law for similar activities at the local level. It is good legislation, it deserves your support, and it should be enacted into law.

 Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity and make a few comments about a bill that my colleague, Senator Max Baucus introduced yesterday. The bill, known as the Rural Health Improvement Act, is designed to help struggling, small, rural hospitals across America. 
I am pleased to join Senator Baucus as an original cosponsor of this important bill. It will go a long way in helping people served by rural facilities. 
As cochairman of the Senate Rural Health Caucus, I have worked long and hard to ensure rural families have access to quality care. This is an issue that concerns not just a select few, but all Senators because every State has at lease some low-population areas. 
Unfortunately, too many of our small hospitals are confronted with the decision of having to close because they can no longer contend with declining inpatient stays, costly regulations, and low Medicare reimbursement rates. However, closing hospitals is not an acceptable option in Wyoming. In my State, if a town loses its most important point of service--the emergency reoom--it is typical for patients to drive 100 miles or more to the closest tertiary care center. 
With the Medicare trust fund going broke, it also is understood that underutilized facilities cannot continue to be subsidized. However, an alternative must still be available. That is why it is necessary to give small rural hospitals the ability to downsize without having to maintain a full-service operation. 
Mr. President, the Rural Health Improvement Act allows facilities to reconfigure their service and reduce excess bed capacity while retaining access to emergency care. In short, the bill presents communities with a viable option. It accommodates different levels of medical care throughout a State while providing stabilization services needed in remote areas. 
The bill is one in a series of measures the Rural Health Caucus is working on designed to improve quality medical care in rural America. It is similar to legislation I introduced as a Member of the House of Representatives, and I look forward to working with Senator Baucus to pass this important, bipartisan piece of legislation.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Utah for the time, but more particularly for the effort and the leadership he has given to this issue. Interestingly enough, it is one of the toughest issues. One would think moving to a balanced budget, ensuring a balanced budget, ensuring financial responsibility would not be such a tough issue. But this has been going on for a very long time. So I appreciate very much the job that has been done. We come to the vote on the issue finally. We have talked quite a little about it this year. We, of course, have talked for a number of years before. 
We can talk about a balanced budget if you choose, but what we are really talking about is financial responsibility. It is interesting to me to hear those who oppose it--and for good reason--who have been here for 20 years and say, `Let's just do it, take the tough votes.' But they haven't done it for 20 years. The monument in front of the leader's desk represents 28 years of unbalanced budgets. Yet, we hear all the time, just do it, take the tough votes and do it. Well, the evidence is that isn't what is done. 
We hear the same words every year: `I am for a balanced budget, but * * *' and then they go on to say why it can't be done. They go on to find reasons for not voting for the kind of discipline that it clearly takes to balance the budget. That is not a brand new idea. It is something we do in most of our States. We do it in my State of Wyoming, and we are proud of that. The legislature doesn't spend any more, under the constitution, than they take in. 
I am always interested in how we seek to shift this to some kind of a partisan thing and talk about the Presidents. Frankly, the Presidents don't decide the budget. That is specifically, under the Constitution, the prerogative and the role of the Congress. It starts in the House of Representatives. Spending--the President cannot do any spending without the Congress. So we say, oh, Reagan did this, and Bush did that, and Bill Clinton did this. I think we ought to get real with ourselves and say, wait a minute, it is the Congress that does the spending. But we hear the same thing. Then Senators go home and talk about balancing the budget, but then come and say, `But, gosh, there is this little thing, and I cannot accept it in this present form.' How many times have we heard that? 
Well, today, we have a chance to vote. I am very proud of the fact that there will be 55 Republicans and 11 Democrats voting aye, voting for fiscal responsibility, voting to say $5.5 trillion debt is more than we want to send off to our kids and grandkids. Other than defense, interest is the largest item in the budget--interest on the debt. We pay $270 billion in interest on the debt. 
So the real issues here, it seems to me, are broader than the details of the amendment. They are broader than whether we are going to balance the budget. They really have to do with your view of how large and inclusive the central Government is 
going to be. There is a very real relationship between the size of spending, the size of the deficit, and the size of Government. 
When I go home--and I think it is true of every other place--I hear that we have too much Federal Government. Every night on TV, we see all these things that are being spent. Nearly everyone believes that. Yet, spending continues to go up. The Senator talked about the great amount of courage it took to move, in 1993, to seek to balance the budget. How? The largest tax increase in the history of the world. So you see Government grow as that tax increase grows. So the real basic issue is more than just the amendment, more than just arithmetic, more than just the budget, it is how much Federal Government do you want in your lives and what are the proper roles of State and Federal Government and the private sector? Those are the real issues. So it divides pretty clearly between those who want more Government and want to spend more and whether or not people ought to be able to keep their own money. After all, the Government has no money except what it takes from us. 
So we hear constantly, `Let's just do it.' But the monument stays right in front of us. We haven't done it. Then we hear, `Well, but we are going to do it now.' But the President's budget has not moved toward balance. The President promised us a balanced budget, and it is not a balanced budget. No one would agree it is a balanced budget by 2002. On the contrary, there will probably be a $50 billion to $70 billion more deficit then. It will go up from where it is now. 
Furthermore, we don't have the kinds of things we would like to have that are targeted to needed tax relief for families. We need permanent tax relief that is not triggered. We need capital gains to encourage the economy. Instead of that, we have a budget presented--and we are to accept that as movement toward a balanced budget, by having a 75-percent backload; temporary tax cuts of $98 billion, but tax increases of $76 billion? Taxes go up the first year, and the tax cuts are not phased in until later. More entitlement spending, more Government--$60 billion in new entitlement spending. 
Is that called balancing the budget? It is, if you want to continue raising taxes. That is the real choice you and I have as voters and taxpayers. If you want more services, you have to pay more. That is the way that works. You know the best example of a really good government, I suppose, is on the local level when the school board says we need a new science room for the high school and it is going to cost you $50 a year and you get to vote on it and you balance it. You say, is it worth it, yes; is it worth it, no. Do we get to do that in the Federal Government? Oh, no, of course not. 
So what we are talking about here is really direction, whether we have less Government or whether we, on the central level, move more Government to States and local communities, 
whether we in fact are able to spend more money for our families as we choose or whether we spend more total tax--now the average family in the country spends 39 percent--on our income. I saw a poll the other day in which almost unanimously they said 25 percent is the maximum that we ought to pay. We are paying nearly 40. 
So, Mr. President, this is our opportunity. This is our chance to put our money where our mouth is. If we are going to balance the budget, this is the way to do it. The evidence is that we can't do it any other way. 
So I hope we have our vote this afternoon and it passes. If it doesn't, it is not the end. We will continue to do this. We will have to. It is the only way that we can be financially and fiscally responsible for the future. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. I thank the Chair. 
Let me, too, thank the leaders who have been in the Chamber for some time. 
Again we are asked to vote on a balanced budget amendment. This is the most important and vital action that any of us will take this year if we are to be financially and fiscally responsible. 
This is more than just a balanced budget. This is more than just arithmetic. It is more than numbers. It has to do with character. It has to do with our willingness to face up to the realization that you cannot keep spending more than you take in. 
It has to do with debt. We now have a debt of $5.5 trillion, which we have put on our credit card for young people to pay. Our card is maxed out. It has to do with interest payments. Probably, next year, the largest item on the budget will be interest on the national debt--$270 billion a year in interest. 
It has to do with priorities in the Government. We have not had to choose what we think is most important for Government. We have simply said, `Let's do it and put it on the tab.' That is not responsible for any of us. 
It has to do with smaller Government. There is a relationship between how much money you spend and how much Government you have. I can tell you, the folks in my State would like to have less central Government, less activity. It has to do with savings for families, if we can reduce the interest payments on their cars and on their kid's college. 
It is the right thing to do. I am proud of the 55 Republicans who will vote `aye' and 11 Democrats who will join them to vote `aye' on this issue. I am proud of the fact that Members of this institution have talked the talk, and now are ready to walk the walk. That is important for us to do.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will not, myself, use 30 minutes. 
I rise today to talk about a bill we introduced this week, introduced the day before yesterday, along with several of my friends from rural areas, including the Presiding Officer and Mr. Grams, who joins me, the Senator from Minnesota. We will talk a little bit about the Medicare Payment Equity Act. 
I come from a place called Wapiti, WY. It is actually a post office between Cody and Yellowstone Park. This is a rural area. So, the unique problems of rural medicine are near and dear to my heart. 
We have in the Senate what is called a rural health caucus which, actually, 77 Senators have shown an interest in. I do recall the rural health group in the House, as well, which was very active and, as a matter of fact, the Senator from Kansas, now presiding, was cochairman of that group. 
So, we have a bill that deals with rural health care. And there are unique problems in rural health care. Other sponsors include Senator Burns from Montana, Senator Grassley from Iowa, and Senator Kempthorne from Idaho. 
Basically, it is a question of fairness. All Americans pay the same rate into the payroll tax for Medicare, and I believe, as I think all would believe that each, then, deserves the same kind of health care and the same kind of health care choices, the same kinds of services for having paid that. But that is not the case. The payments for Medicare, managed care within Medicare, are greatly different throughout the country. They are greatly different largely because they were put into place, as a matter of history, as a matter of utilization in the fee-for-service area. So they vary a great deal. 
This chart will give some idea of what they are. Remember, each of these folks who receives these benefits has paid in similarly. However, the payments for managed care in Medicare, in Arthur, NE, are $221 a month. On the other hand, in Richmond County, NY, $767 a month. You can see the changes that exist here, and they are basically the highly utilized areas, the Floridas, the New Yorks and others who, in history of payments, have had high utilization so have a history of higher payments. The costs are not necessarily the same, but they are not that much different. What has happened is these risk contracts have basically been set on history and give enough additional services to take up that additional dollar. Not only do they get more money but they get more services. 
Here, in Blue Earth County, MN, the yearly payment is $600. Portland, OR, had $500; the beneficiary has to pay additional money, as is shown in the yellow. However, in Dade County, in Florida, the payment is $8,200 dollars a year. Not only do they get the additional payment, they have unlimited prescription drugs, a $700 credit for hearing aids, and have a great deal of additional benefits. Remember, all of them pay the same into the program. So what we have is a bill that would, over time, tend to equalize or at least levelize these kinds of payments. 
There are cost differences. The costs in New York City for rent and other kinds of things are higher than they are in Greybull, WY. We are willing to take that into account. However, expertise, medicines, and other kinds of things are just as valuable in Kansas as they are in Florida. 
So, what we propose to do and what this bill does is, rather than to continue this kind of reimbursement that is so 
out of place, it would gradually bring into account not only the costs that differentiate, but also a national average, intending to level these out. We do not propose to reduce the costs that are in place in the higher levels but we do propose to lift the increases, bring the increases up in the bottom levels so Wyoming providers will have an opportunity to compete, to provide these kinds of care. 
The other effect, in addition to not getting the kinds of services that are available through this inequity, is that users, seniors in Medicare who would like to have the option of managed care, really do not have it in rural areas because it has not come, due to the payments. For example, where is there growth in managed care and Medicare? Only 3.6 percent in rural areas have an opportunity for this. On the other hand, it is over 70 percent where the benefits are high, in the larger areas. 
So, our proposal is to equalize, at least move to equalize these payments, to move to equalize these benefits to reflect the fact that everyone pays the same and that there ought to be some equity with respect to the benefits that are provided. It is a fairness bill. It is one we have talked about before and, indeed, was part of the omnibus bill last year which was vetoed by the President. 
So we come back with it singled out to show that there is a problem, there is an inequity, there is an unfairness between rural and more populated areas. This bill, the Rural Medicare Payment Equity Act, will move to remove that inequity from Medicare and managed Medicare to all seniors of this country. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I want, first of all, to congratulate the Senator from Idaho for his leadership in this matter. I don't think there is a more important issue before us than the idea of being financially and fiscally responsible. I say that also to my friend from Florida, who supports this concept of accountability as well. Certainly there will be a lot said--there has been a lot said, maybe everything has already been said but maybe not everyone has said it--but it is broader than the books, it is broader than the numbers, it is broader than math. It is a question of being responsible to ourselves, being responsible to our children, being responsible to the future. It is a question of priorities. It is a question of, really, dealing with the issue rather than what has been done over the last 30 years, by saying, yes, we are going to balance, yes, we are going to balance the budget, yes, we are going to do it, and not doing it. 
I think one of the ironies is many of those who oppose this balanced budget amendment say, `Oh, yes, we are going to do it,' and point to the President's budget--which does not do it. It does not achieve balance by 2002 and stay in balance. It does not provide permanent tax relief. It does things in Medicare that are strictly gimmicks. It spends $21 billion more on welfare and raises taxes by $80 billion. It has $60 billion in new entitlements. 
So let us be clear that, if we want different results, we have to change the way we do things, and that is what this amendment is all about. 
Let me yield to my friend from Missouri. We have approximately 18 minutes left, and I will yield as much time as he requires.

Mr. THOMAS. I shall be brief. 
Continuing with this important discussion on the balanced budget amendment, I specifically, as was the case with most of us, spent last week in our home districts. I spent last week in Wyoming at town meetings in places like Sheridan, Buffalo, and Casper, to talk about what people think about what is happening here. 
Of course, the balanced budget was one of the prime issues there, and continues to be. I think people are increasingly concerned about our lack of financial fiscal responsibility, of having 28 years without balancing the budget, of continuing to have a government that grows in size, continuing to spend more than we take in. I was persuaded, certainly from those who came to my town meetings, from those I talked to who say, `Look, you need to get this job done.' They say, `You all collectively in Washington have been saying every year, yes, we will balance the budget, I want to balance the budget. You have not done it. You have not done it.' Now they continue to say, `Well, we do not need a constitutional amendment. We just need to balance the budget.' We have not done it. Even those who have been here for a very long time and have gone through this whole thing have not balanced the budget. 
The idea you do not need to do something rings a bit hollow to people at home. The Wyoming Legislature is currently meeting. Wyoming has a constitutional requirement that the legislature not spend more than it takes in. It works very well. We will have, I think, certainly a series of amendments, all of which are designed to simply detract from what we are seeking to do, all of which are designed to give an option and an opportunity to not vote for a constitutional amendment, to say, `Well, I am for it, 
but--' We have been through that before. We will see that again today. `I am for it, but . . .' `. . . but we do not want Social Security included.' 
Now, we like the President's budget, we are moving toward it. Is Social Security in there? You bet it is. You bet it is. And it would not balance without. It does not balance as it is. So we are moving toward continuing to have an unbalanced budget in this President's proposal. 
I feel even renewed, Mr. President, in my quest for a balanced budget amendment, having been home, having talked to people who say, `We do not want more and more spending. We do not want more and more of a central government.' Really, when it comes down to it, that is the decision. That is really what it is. Those who want to see Government continue to grow larger, obviously are not for a balanced budget amendment. Those of us who think that the real message over the last number of years from home has been, look, we want less central Government, we want less spending, we want less taxes, those kinds of activities that can, should be moved to the States, and that is really the core issue. That is really what it is all about. 
I am hopeful we will continue this debate this week and have a chance to finally vote, have a chance to pass a constitutional amendment, have a chance to have the discipline that is required to do the things that everybody says they want to do and have it done. 
I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think it is useful for us to talk a little bit about the relatively little debate that goes on here. I think it is appropriate to talk a little about that. I know my friend from Nevada, whom I respect greatly, is sincere in his view. But I don't agree with what he has had to say. That is what this is all about. So I think we ought to talk about a combined budget, and talk a little bit about off-budget kinds of things. Again, my experience comes from Wyoming. The Wyoming Legislature has control over about 30 percent of the budget. All the rest of it is earmarked off to other things. I don't think that is a good idea or a good way to legislate. 
Let me, first of all, say that, naturally, if you want to sell a point, you try and get some kind of an emotional thing to say like `save Social Security.' There is not a soul in this place that doesn't want to protect Social Security. We are not talking about protecting Social Security. We are talking about the best way to protect Social Security. Two years from now, when the Social Security revenues have changed substantially, you are going to have it more protected by having it as part of the budget than you will by having it sit off by itself. 
Let me talk about this idea of spending it somewhere else. I presume my friend from Nevada would want to invest those surplus dollars so they would have some return to the Social Security fund. They are invested. They are invested in Government securities. They are invested where the law requires they be invested. It is not a matter of spending Social Security funds for other things. The fact is, when we have a deficit in the operating fund of the Government, we have to sell securities. They can sell them to Social Security, to Japan, to me, or to you. Nevertheless, we are using borrowed money. It is borrowed from the Social Security fund. This idea that you are spending it on something else is absolutely false. They are invested. They are protected. 
Now, he wants to balance the budget without it. All that takes is $700 billion of new money. Impossible. You can't do that. You just can't do that. We ought to have a combined budget, and will we be responsible for Social Security? Of course. Those funds get paid in for that purpose. They will be repaid. They have to be repaid to somebody. 
So this is a difference of view, and I understand that. But the idea that we take this off budget and set it aside and pass the balanced budget amendment is, of course, just not the case. The courts will decide. Again, we have lots and lots of States that 
have a balanced budget amendment. Do the courts decide? No, of course not. If the courts are going to come into play, they say to the legislative body, `You have overspent, and you have to find a way to reduce it.' 
And there is nothing particularly wrong with that. 
So, Mr. President, I just want to say again this sort of scare tactic that somehow if you are included in there, you are going to forget having it, not think it is important to have Social Security protected, is a fallacy, simply a fallacy. And I just think that we ought to challenge those kinds of comments. It is a little like what happened last year in the election, that the Republicans were going to do away with Medicare. Well, that is not true. The fact is if you do not make some changes in these programs, they will not exist. Just to say leave your hands off of it, leave it alone, is sure death for these kinds of programs. 
So we have a dilemma, and we solve it. We have talked about it for a very long time. It is time we move forward and make some decisions that will put us in a financially strong position, that will make us financially responsible and will include in a combined budget all those things that are there. 
I guess we ought to take the highway trust fund off; we ought to take the airport trust fund off; we ought to take off everything that has a designation. 
No, we are not going to do that. We are going to use the emotional issue of Social Security to seek to kill an amendment to the Constitution which says the Congress ought to exercise the kind of responsibility that it ought to exercise anyway and has not. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise as chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs to introduce S. 342, a bill to extend certain privileges, exemptions, and immunities to Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices located in the United States. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Robb as an original cosponsor. 
The Hong Kong Government maintains Economic and Trade Offices in several countries to represent the Colony's economic and trade interests abroad; there are three such Offices in the United States--San Francisco, New York, and Washington. As my colleagues are aware, at midnight on June 30, 1997, Hong Kong will revert to the jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China as the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region [HKSAR]. The HKSAR will purportedly, under agreements reached between the PRC and the United Kingdom, enjoy a high degree of autonomy from the central government in Beijing except in the areas of foreign policy and defense. That autonomy includes the right to maintain economic and trade ties with third countries independent of Beijing. 
The Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992 provided, inter alia, that the United States should invite Hong Kong to maintain its Economic and Trade Offices after June 30. The reasoning was not only to continue to facilitate our trade relationship with our ninth biggest trading partner; in addition, the move was meant to underscore our commitment to an autonomous Hong Kong after 1997. 
This bill would extend to these offices and employees the provisions of the International Organizations Immunities Act and the Agreement on State and local Taxation of Foreign Employees of Public International Organizations, thereby assuring that these offices are treated in the same manner as others similarly situated--such as the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Offices, Taiwan's representative in the United States. 
Identical legislation passed the Senate unanimously late last year, but was not considered by the House before we adjourned sine die. Because the June deadline looms so near, I hope that we can move this bill quickly and without amendment through both Houses before the July 1 reversion of Hong Kong to China's jurisdiction.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise as chairman of the Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs to introduce S. 343, a bill to authorize the extension of nondiscriminatory treatment--formerly known as `most-favored nation status'--to the products of Mongolia. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Robb and Senator McCain as original cosponsors. 
Mongolia has undergone a series of remarkable and dramatic changes over the last few years. Sandwiched between the former Soviet Union and China, it was one of the first countries in the world to become Communist after the Russian Revolution. After 70 years of Communist rule, though, the Mongolian people have recently made great progress in establishing a democratic political system and creating a free-market economy. Just last year, the country held its third election under its new constitution, resulting in a parliamentary majority for the coalition of democratic opposition parties. Rather than attempt to maintain its hold on power, the former government peaceably--and commendably--transferred power to the new government. 
Mongolia has demonstrated a strong desire to build a friendly and cooperative relationship with the United States on trade and related matters since its turn towards democracy. We concluded a bilateral trade treaty with that country in 1991, and a bilateral investment treaty in 1994. Mongolia has received nondiscriminatory trading status since 1991, and has been found to be in full compliance with the freedom of emigration requirements of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974. In addition, it has acceded to the agreement establishing the World Trade Organization. 
Mr. President, Mongolia has clearly demonstrated that it is fully deserving of joining the ranks of those countries to which we extend nondiscriminatory trade status. The extension of that status would not only serve to commend the Mongolians on their impressive progress, but would also enable the United States to avail itself of all its rights under the WTO with respect to Mongolia. 
I have another, more parochial, reason for being interested in MFN status for Mongolia. Mongolia and my home State of Wyoming are sister States; a strong relationship between the two has developed over the last 4 years. Many of Mongolia's provincial governors have visited the State, and the two governments have established partnerships in education, agriculture, and livestock management. Like Wyoming, Mongolia is a high plateau with mountains on the northwest border, where many of the residents make their living by raising livestock. I am pleased to see the development of this mutually beneficial relationship, and am sure that the extension of nondiscriminatory trade status will serve to strengthen it further. 
Mr. President, I introduced an identical bill in the last Congress at the very end of the legislative year, as did Congressman Bereuter in the House. We both realized that it was too late in the year to move the legislation forward before we adjourned sine die, but we hoped that by introducing the bill then that it would serve as a catalyst to serious discussion of the issue in this Congress. I was very appreciative that last year the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, indicated his willingness to favorably consider the legislation early in this Congress, and look forward to working with him.

 Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation designed to protect open space near and around Grand Teton National Park. Currently, open space near the park, with its majestic, signature vistas and abundant wildlife, continues to decline. As the population grows in Teton County, WY, undeveloped land near the park becomes more scarce. This loss of open space negatively impacts wildlife migration routes in the area and diminishes the experience of visitors to the region. The repercussions due to the loss of open space can be felt throughout the entire area. As stewards, we must act now to preserve the view and make such a value a component of our environmental agenda. 
A few working ranches make up Teton Valley's remaining open space. These ranches depend on grazing in Grand Teton National Park for summer range to maintain their operations. The original act creating the park allowed several permittees to continue grazing in the area for the life of a designated heir in the family. Unfortunately, the last remaining heirs have died and their family's grazing privileges are going to be terminated. As a result, the open space around the park, which remains available due to the viability of these ranch operations, will most likely be subdivided and developed. 
The legislation I am introducing today is designed to help continue to protect open space in Teton Valley. In order to develop the best solution to protect open space near Teton Park, my legislation directs the National Park Service to conduct a 3-year study of grazing in the area and its impact on open space in the region. This report should develop workable solutions that are fiscally responsible and conscious of the preservation of open space. The study will be conducted by the National Park Service with input from citizens, local government officials, and the landowners in the area. 
With the approach of the spring and summer grazing season, it is vital for the Congress to act on this legislation as quickly as possible. I look forward to working with the National Park Service on this important matter to preserve and protect open space in Teton Valley. Grand Teton National Park is truly one of the treasures of our Nation and this legislation will help preserve this wonderful area for many years to come.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that is one of my top priorities for this Congress. It is called the Freedom from Government Competition Act. It is I think a common sense, good Government reform bill. I am joined in the effort by Senators Hagel, Kyl, Enzi, Brownback, and Craig. 
This legislation has the potential to open up a $30 billion market for the Nation's small and large businesses. It is designed to level the playing field for thousands of businesses that span the economic spectrum of this country from the mundane to the high tech. It will also provide a more efficient Government, one that works better and costs less. 
Government competition with the private sector is a growing problem. Over the last 40 years, it has been the Federal policy of saying let us do those things that are commercial in the private sector, but it has not worked. We have not moved toward that goal. The bureaucracy has not found ways and means to procure goods and services from the private sector. For example, CBO has estimated that 1.4 million employees work in areas that are commercial in nature. We need a statutory provision to correct this problem. 
In order to reach the goal of a balanced budget, we need to rely, I believe, on the private sector for many of the Federal Government's needs. Various studies indicate that we can save up to $30 billion annually doing this. This competition, of course, not only wastes taxpayers' money but it stunts job growth in the private sector, stifles economic growth, erodes the tax base and hurts small businesses. And it has been one of the top priorities in the three meetings of the White House Conference on Small Business. 
The bill basically codifies the 40-year-old Federal policy and that is to use the private sector. There are exceptions to this policy laid out in the bill: those functions that are inherently governmental, those goods and services that are in the interest of national security, goods or services that the Federal Government can provide better at a better value than the private sector, and goods and services, of course, that the private sector cannot provide. 
This bill establishes a system where OMB can identify those functions to properly stay within the Federal establishment and those that can better be done by the private sector. This legislation establishes an office of commercial activities within OMB to do that. No longer is the agency that is charged with doing the contracting the one that makes decisions of whether it will be contracted or not. 
Certainly we are all sensitive to Federal employees' concerns should they be impacted. For those who are displaced, we have included provisions that facilitate transition to the private sector if they choose to follow that path. 
The intention of the legislation is to get agencies to focus on their core missions. This focus will ensure a better value to American taxpayers. I do not wish to abolish all Government functions. But I am saying that there is private sector expertise waiting to be utilized. 
Congressman Duncan in the House has introduced a companion bill. It also was introduced today.

Mr. THOMAS. It is interesting to stand here beside these budgets that have gone on for 26 years--this is less than that--and to then have to say we have not balanced the budget in all that time. Yet, we hear constantly that we do not need to do anything differently than we have been doing. It is hard to imagine that you are going to have different results if you do not do something different. 
I was interested in the comments of the Senator from North Dakota. Each of us has a little different idea about what has happened and what has occurred in terms of economics. Each of us has a little different idea about why we made some progress over the last several years in reducing the deficit. Certainly one reason is we raised taxes so that the average payment of taxes in this country is now about 40 percent of the income to families. You can balance the budget that way if you want to continue to let Government grow. Continue to raise taxes; that is a way to balance the budget. That is partly what this whole discussion is about. 
Interestingly enough, the Senator talked about the balanced budget amendment looting Social Security. I was going to ask the Senator, if he was still here, whether Social Security income is in the budget that he talks about that the President is going to balance by 2003. Of course it is there. All the trust funds are there that he says you cannot put into a balanced budget amendment. They are in the budget that the Senator brags about balancing. If you took the Social Security out of it, by that time you would have to raise $700 billion additional to do that. This is a unified budget. 
So, it is interesting how we seem to have different views. I guess if we did not have different views, why, there would not be any discussion about this. We would either do it or not. Basically, one of the differences, I think, between those of us here who want to have a balanced budget amendment to ensure that we, in fact, in the future have a balanced budget and have fiscal responsibility is whether you want more and more Government or whether you want a balanced budget to have something to do with holding down the size of Government and the increase in taxes. That is the choice. If you are going to use the balanced budget amendment simply to grow, and use the balanced budget, as the President has this year, to have an increase in spending by $1.5 trillion, then that is a choice. The other choice is to allow families to have more of their own money and spend it as they choose, to have a smaller central Government and move some of those activities to local governments, to States and counties. So that is the decision. 
It has been, I think, a most interesting discussion. Of course, the budget is, I think, the key to what we do here. Obviously, there are many other things that the Government must do and that the Congress must do and the administration must do, but it all pretty much turns around what you do with the budget. The budget is a guideline of where you go, what your priorities are, what your spending is. It is also a guideline of your idea of how large Government is, as opposed to a reduced size Government. It has to do with how much tax you intend to levy. So the budget is the key to where we have been. We talked about it for years and will continue to, I suppose, forever. It has a great deal to do with what you believe is the responsibility of this Congress and the responsibility of the Government, and the responsibility of you and me, Mr. President, to establish a spending pattern in which we are responsible for the spending we incur and not pass it on to all of our children and on to future generations, which is precisely what we have done now. 
I hear some on the TV saying, `Well, a balanced budget isn't that important. The deficit really isn't that important.' The interest payment on the deficit this year will be about $250 billion, almost as much as defense. It will soon be more than defense. If it continues as projected, it will be $330 billion a year out of the budget to pay interest on the debt. So it is important. It has to do with responsibility. 
The Senator from North Dakota mentioned Jefferson. Jefferson had a strong feeling about budgets. Let me quote from the desk of Thomas Jefferson: 
I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for the reduction of the administration of our Government. I mean an additional article taking from the Federal Government the power of borrowing. 
Thomas Jefferson said if you are going to use it, you ought to pay for it. And certainly he's exactly right. 
I think we need to look at the benefits of having a balanced budget. We have talked about it a great deal. It is not just a benefit to the country, it is not just a benefit to the economy, it is a benefit to you and me in our lives. 
It's a benefit to you and me in what we have to pay to do the things we have to do. On an $80,000 mortgage, the savings per year with a balanced budget amendment with a reduction in interest could be $1,272 for the average family. On a $15,000 car loan, monthly payments would be reduced by 200 bucks. It's a real benefit for us, as well as being the financially and morally responsible thing to do. 
Some say, `Just do it, we don't need an amendment.' Good idea. The evidence, however, is that that is not the case. The evidence is that we have talked about it for 26 years, through good times and bad. We say, `Well, you have to leave it flexible enough for emergencies.' I certainly agree with that, and this balanced budget amendment has that provision. But we have done it through good times and bad. We have wanted to spend more than we have been willing to pay in, and that's what it is about. 
We say, `Just do it.' I don't think there is any question but what the President's budget doesn't just do it. The President's budget doesn't get us there. The President's budget doesn't balance the budget over a period of time. 
Really, there is very little reason to oppose a balanced budget amendment. There are a number of reasons that are given, a number of excuses that are given. Social Security is one. Almost everyone who looks at it says, if you want to save Social Security, it needs to be part of the integrated budget. Right now, there is a surplus in Social Security. We know there will not be later, and we will have to make that accommodation. 
If you take Social Security out of it, I wonder how many things will be put into the Social Security Program by the Congress so they would be off budget. We have been through that before. We have seen that happen before. 
Oversight by the court? How many States are there that have a balanced budget amendment of some kind? There are 40, I believe. We do in Wyoming in my home State. The court's job is to say if you haven't balanced the budget in terms of revenues equaling expenditures, then you fix it. That is the authority that they should have. 
An emergency? It provides for an emergency with 60 votes, a supermajority. If we have an emergency, 60 votes would not be hard to get. 
Mr. President, I think we will be going forward for some time now, for a couple of weeks, talking about the balanced budget amendment, talking about the benefits that it has to this country, the benefits that it has to American families. And I am hopeful that we have now come to the position where we will say, `Look, let's pass this amendment, send this amendment to the States, and three-quarters of the States will have to ratify it.' I believe there is strong feeling among the American people, that among all things, we ought to be financially and fiscally responsible, that we ought not to pass on these debts to our offspring. 
So, Mr. President, a number of us have come to the floor this morning to talk about that. I believe very strongly that it is the responsible thing to do. I believe that the amendments that we will have are not designed to strengthen our responsibility but, indeed, to kill the amendment so that there will not be the constant of fiscal responsibility applied to our future budgeting. And, therefore, I feel very strongly that it ought to pass. 
I appreciate the opportunity to share some of those 
thoughts. I now yield to my friend, the Senator from Iowa, for 10 minutes.

Mr. THOMAS. We are going to talk about the budget--not a new idea, but, I suspect, the most important issue that we have to talk about, because everything else, everything else that is discussed here, everything else that is decided here will be a function of doing something with the budget. 
The Senator from New Hampshire, who just finished, talked about education and special education, which happens to be something that I am very interested in, but it is budgetary; it has to do with the budget. 
The budget has to do with more than just arithmetic, more than just a balance sheet; it has to do with priorities, it has to do with fiscal responsibility for our kids, and our grandkids, it has to do with deciding what our direction will be in this country in terms of the Federal Government. 
So, Mr. President, we want to talk about that this morning. I will be joined by several of my associates in the freshman and sophomore class who have come together to put a focus on events, and particularly a focus to try to talk about how what we do here with regard to the budget in this instance has to do with where we live, has to do with you and me in terms of our families, has to do with how we have the resources to send our kids to school and pay our bills. There is a direct relationship. 
So let me yield 10 minutes to my friend, the new Senator from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas. 
It seems to me that is a very important aspect of this business of balancing the budget. It is not only a mechanical matter, it is not only a fiscal matter, it is a moral matter, and whether or not we have the responsibility to balance the budget and pass on to our kids something that is as good as we had. 
Certainly the economics of it are very important, the economics in terms of the amount of interest we pay and all those things. 
But it is a moral imperative that we be responsible for what we are doing. If we are going to buy it, we have to pay for it. That is a great concept. I thank the Senator from Arkansas. 
Let me now yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Ohio, Senator DeWine.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio. You hear these arguments, and almost no one would disagree with the notion that we need to pay the bills. Few would argue with the idea that it is irresponsible for us to leave it for someone else to pay later. Yet, it has been 1969 since we have had a balanced budget. There is a legitimate argument to be addressed that we must be flexible if there is a war or a disaster. There has to be some movement, as there is in your family. But the fact is that we haven't done it. We have not done it. So we need to make some difference. You can't expect to change things if you continue to follow the same course. That is precisely what has gone on here. 
So we have an opportunity now, for the first time in some time, to do what I think most people believe ought to be done. You might ask why are the freshmen and sophomores particularly 
doing this this morning, and doing it as a focus on issues throughout the year? I think it is because we are the ones who have most recently gone through the elections, who have most recently been to Greybull, WY, and small towns in Ohio. We know that people want to balance the budget. We know that the folks where we come from say, `Look, we have to be fiscally responsible, and our State has a balanced budget amendment. We have to do that stuff, and it works.' Furthermore, we want some control of the growth in Federal Government. We don't want it to grow exponentially. We want it to be under control. Everyone in this place says, `Yes, I am for a balanced budget, but I don't want to do anything that would cause us to have to do that. I don't want any discipline applied.' I think that is the issue that we are coming upon, the issue we will deal with. Do you want a balanced budget? Yes. How do we get there? Just do it. Well, that doesn't work, and it hasn't worked for some time. 
So that's what it's all about and where we are. We are talking about a process to cause us to do the things that almost unanimously we would choose to do. Mr. President, I am glad to be joined by the Senator from Kansas to talk a bit about the balanced budget. 
I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Kansas.

Mr. THOMAS. I thank my friend from Kansas and welcome him in his initial visit to the floor. I am sure he will be back many times, and I hope that is the case. 
Mr. President, we have now an opportunity. I am optimistic about it. We all heard the President's State of the Union Message last night. He listed a great many things that he is 
interested in. Certainly most of them are positive kinds of things that, in one way or another, we want to work with as well. 
So we listened to the President. We listened to the voters. We listened to the American people. And now we are ready to work on some solutions toward really all of America. 
There is a plan soon for the congressional leadership to visit with the President, to sit down and talk about a number of things. Balancing the budget is one. Improving education, certainly, to move more and more education toward local communities and parental involvement; to provide some permanent tax relief so that we can increase investments, so that we can increase jobs, and so that we can increase the ability of families to prepare for themselves. Much of that is affected by what we do. What we do about interest rates that have a direct impact on the budget has much to do with what we do with this debt, a debt of $5.5 trillion, the interest upon which will become, if not this year, soon, the largest single line-item in the budget--$275 billion in interest, none of which is used for education, none of which is used to fight drugs, and none of which is used for investment--interest on the debt that we accumulate. 
Mr. President, I am excited that the President of the United States said to us last year that the `era of big Government is over.' He said that the Government is not the answer to everything, that we need to be responsible, that we need to be responsible to ourselves as individuals and citizens. Certainly, that is true. We need to be responsible as a Government, and we need to be responsible as people who have been sent here to deal with the budget--about physical matters. 
So that is what we are dealing with, two things: One is balancing the budget and being responsible; and then having the ability, which we have not had for 28 or 29 years, of doing it, and how do we change things to cause that to happen? We believe that it is the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, which provides, as it does in Wyoming, Mr. President--as you well know just coming from the legislature there--a requirement as a legislature and the Governor not to spend beyond its revenues. It works. Many other States have the same kind of thing. 
So we have heard for some time from our voters and our constituents that they want smaller Government, a Government that is more efficient, and a budget that is balanced. We have heard from the President that he is ready for a smaller Government, that the era of big Government is over. 
We will see his budget, I think, tomorrow, and that will be when the rubber really hits the road. It is not just talking about it, but doing it. We will be sharing that responsibility with the President to do that. 
There will be all kinds of suggestions as to how a balanced budget ought to be changed. There will be some scare tactics saying it is going to ruin Social Security. If you want to protect Social Security, you need to balance the budget. I am one who believes that we ought to have a Social Security net for the elderly. I want to continue it. I do not want to see it run out. The same is true with Medicare. The best way to do that is to balance the budget. If we do not do that, we will not have money to do any of those kinds of things. 
So we will hear a lot about it. We need a budget that is honest. We need one that is out there not one that is backloaded, where it looks good for a couple of years and all of a sudden for somebody else it is piled up at a very high rate. We need one that is honest and forthright. We do not need gimmicks. We do not need to move things from one place to another. We do not need to trigger it so that it takes over in a certain way. We do not need budgets that have tax relief in it for a little while and then they go away. We need some real honest budgeting so that everyone is confident in understanding that that is where we are. 
I hope each of us remembers the impact it has on everyone at home. Interest rates could be lower. Debt for kids to go to school could be less. Borrowing on our homes, borrowing on our cars, these are all related. This is not an abstract thing that belongs in somebody's accounting book. This is not for accountants and CPAs only. They affect each of us where we live. Families pay $1,500 a year easily on mortgage payments. So these are the kinds of things that we are doing. 
So I think all of my associates welcome the President's commitment to a balanced budget. We certainly look forward to his ideas and to how that budget will work as he releases it tomorrow. But most of all, I think we need to take the responsibility to make the changes that have to be made, and now is the time. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, it is an honor to join the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, in introducing legislation to create a 2-year budget and appropriations process. Senator Domenici has worked long and hard on this issue and I am hopeful that we can finally enact this commonsense reform this year. 
The current budget process is breaking down. Congress and the executive branch spend entirely too much time on budget issues. Since the most recent budget process reform in 1974, Congress has consistently failed to complete action on the Federal budget before the start of the fiscal year and, as a result, has increasingly relied on omnibus spending measures to fund the Federal Government. In fact, since 1977, Congress has passed over 60 continuing resolutions just to keep the Federal Government open. 
The budget resolution, reconciliation bill, and appropriations bills continue to become more time consuming. In the process, authorizing committees are being squeezed out of the schedule. There are too many votes on the same issues and too much duplication. In the end, this time could be better spent conducting vigorous oversight of Federal programs which currently go unchecked, exacerbating the Federal budget deficit. 
In response to these problems, last Congress I introduced legislation that would create a biennial budget process. I am pleased to continue this effort by joining Senator Domenici in offering this bill. It will rectify many of the problems regarding the current process by promoting timely action on budget legislation. In addition, it will eliminate much of the redundancy in the current budget process. This legislation does not eliminate any of the current budget processes--each step serves an important role in congressional deliberations. However, by making decisions once every 2 years instead of annually, the burden should be significantly reduced. 
Perhaps most importantly, biennial budgeting will provide more time for effective congressional oversight, which will help reduce the size and scope of the Federal Government. Congress simply needs more time to review existing Federal programs in order to determine priorities in our drive to balance the budget. 
Another benefit of a 2-year budget cycle is its effect on long-term planning. A biennial budget will allow the executive branch and State and local governments, all of which depend on congressional appropriations, to do a better job making plans for long-term projects. 
Two-year budgets are not a novel idea. Nor will biennial budgeting cure all of the Federal Government's ills. However, separating the budget session from the oversight session works well across the country in our State legislatures. It is a solid first step toward restoring some fiscal accountability in our Nation's Capital. I am hopeful this bill will be a catalyst for action on this commonsense, good Government reform.

Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, it is sort of exciting to begin to move into a new Congress, the 105th Congress. You and I and others came first here to the Senate 2 years ago with some dedication to principles that we still hold. Now, we have a new opportunity to continue to work toward the implementation of those things that we came away from the election 2 years ago thinking that people in our States wanted, and people in this country continue to want those things. So we have a great opportunity now. 
I think we had success, particularly in the last few months of the last session, as we moved toward doing something with health care. We did something about a couple of Federal mandates, Federal programs that were in place, such as welfare and farm programs, which have been changed now--and I think are more useful and effective--moving them closer to the States. I think that is a good thing to do. 
So I hope that we can continue to follow on our efforts in the 104th Congress, efforts that will lead us to a smaller Federal Government, a Federal Government that is more defined in terms of its role, a Federal Government that is more efficient and effective in delivering services, one that is closer to the people that are governed, closer to the people who receive the services and benefits, more efficient in the delivery of those services, less bureaucratic and more accountable. I think that's what all of us would like to do. These are principles that most of us agree to. 
I am pleased that the President has, in the last year, as well as in his inaugural address and other statements, indicated his support for a Government that has a balanced budget, that is financially and fiscally responsible not only to taxpayers now, but, maybe even more important, to our children and grandchildren in the future. The President has spoken of the era of big Government being passed. I think we would find a lot of agreement to that in the country and here in the U.S. Senate. 
It is very easy to talk about those concepts, and it is something else to do it. It is something else to put it into place. We have seen and will continue to see--and, of course, I understand that this is the place of great debate, and frankly it is a place of differences of view. That is what the system is all about. That is what elections are about--to put out there alternative choices and voters choose what they support. So we will see that here, as we should--and I think we will debate, I hope, more civilly than we have sometimes those differences and come to an agreement. We will not have unanimous agreement, of course. But this place wasn't designed to have unanimous agreement. That is why we vote. That is what the system is all about. But it is very easy to talk about concepts, and, yet, you will see everyone say, `Yes, I am for a balanced budget. I want a balanced budget except for * * *' and then find many reasons why we can't do it. 
So it is very difficult sometimes to move beyond the rhetoric, to move beyond the general principles and put it into place. That, I think, will be our challenge, and we are starting now to do that. So the challenge is, if these are the principles, if these are the philosophies, let us just do it. That is what I would like to talk about a little bit today. I would like to talk about doing some things within the Government that we have had as a policy for many years and really have not done, and that is more contracting in the private sector; some privatization of those kinds of functions of the Government that could well be carried on in the private sector. 
Last year I introduced a bill called the Freedom From Government Competition Act. We supported that. As a matter of fact, the Senate voted 59 to 39 on an amendment which was offered as part of the Treasury-Postal bill which required, in the instance of activities that were not inherently governmental, that agency to test the alternative of doing it in the private sector and seeing if that would be cost efficient and cost effective. 
The bill was not considered last year, but we intend this year to put it back in again. It will be something that I believe will move us toward the broader concepts that we are looking for. We can help save money. We can balance the budget. That is what it is all about. It will help eliminate some of the programs that are now there by the Government and bureaucracy that will help us move toward smaller government. The privatization of the contracting often can be done on a more local level, which moves it more, of course, toward the people who are, indeed, in the private sector. It strengthens the private sector and creates a broader tax base. These are the purposes of this kind of approach. 
For some 40 years it has been the policy of government to contract wherever possible in the private sector. Unfortunately, that has not been done. CBO estimated that in 1987 nearly 1 1/2 million Federal employees were engaged in the kinds of functions, the kinds of operations, that are commercial in nature. That is a lot of folks doing some things. 
So what we need to do is to get this principle that has been there, this policy that has been in place but not implemented, I think, in some kind of statutory language which would be fairly simple. The bill simply requires that OMB, the Office of Management and Budget, go through all the functions of government and segregate those that are inherently government--and there are some, of course, which are only properly done by 
the Government and the bureaucracy but many that are not--and separate those and then have a system in place so that the work in those areas where it can be done easily be contracted or at least be offered for contract. And if they can be done more inexpensively and more efficiently by contract, then that would be done. 
Let me add that it is a little more difficult than that in that it will take some change of culture of the agency to adjust itself to the idea of putting together specifications of bidding, the bidding process, and overseeing and carrying out of the bidding process, and it will take some changes in the agency to do that. If the agency stays the same and simply takes some of these functions and contracts, there will be nothing gained. There will just be additional things. But it can be done, and in fact is being done. The agency that probably does the most of that and does it the best is the Department of Defense. They do a number of things of that kind. 
This is not a new idea. It is an idea that was talked about and suggested in the Reagan Office of Privatization, Citizens Against Waste, Citizens for a Sound Economy, the Defense Science Board, and the Grace Commission. Interestingly enough, all three sessions of the White House Conference on Small Business, 1980, 1986, and 1994, listed unfair Government competition as one of the top issues impacting small business. So it is not new. We have worked during the last 6 months substantially with groups in the private sector who now are involved in this activity of promoting this bill, and we look forward to it. 
Lots of things could easily be done. Let me give you some examples: janitorial services, printing, map making, engineering services, surveying, and laboratory. In our Wyoming Legislature a number of years ago when I was a member there, we did this kind of thing, and the focus was sort of on laboratories. We had private laboratories that were very capable of doing these kinds of things that government labs were set up to do, and we were able to do that, and we were able to move those activities from the bureaucratic activity to a private one, which creates more jobs, creates more tax base, and creates less cost. So these are the things that we look forward to doing. 
So, Mr. President, we will have an opportunity certainly over the next number of months to look at the Government, to take the philosophy that most of us have and put it in place to decide how we can make some changes. Change is not easy to make, of course. There is great resistance to change. There will be resistance to this kind of change. There will be resistance largely from labor unions that represent some of the workers in the Government agencies. But I think that there is a reasonable and logical explanation and reasonable and logical reason for taking a look at saving money, smaller Government, more in the private sector, and more tax base. These are the kinds of benefits that will accrue to families and to America if we can move forward in this direction. 
Mr. President, we look forward to introducing the bill. We look forward to having the opportunity to implement the things that we have been talking about in general terms for the last several years. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
