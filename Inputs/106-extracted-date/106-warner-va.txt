   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say with gratitude that we have such a marvelous Chaplain, one who with great skill and such strength of feeling and emotion is able to deliver the message of prayer and incorporate those historic moments of history. 
   That election of Thomas Jefferson was one, fortunately, we avoided this time around; for Congress was involved, as our distinguished Chaplain and others know, and the vote in Congress was razor thin.

The Senate was expected to consider the final package shortly after noon today. However, the vote is now expected to occur sometime later this afternoon. Senators will be updated throughout the day on the voting schedule. 
   Following the vote, the Senate is expected to complete its business to wrap up the 106th Congress. On behalf of the distinguished majority leader and the Democratic leader, we thank our colleagues for their patience and cooperation.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the 211-year history of the United States Senate, the State of New York has one of the richest and most storied legacies. 
   Since 1789, New York has sent to the Senate 63 Senators. I have had the distinct privilege of serving with four of them, most memorably, Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN. 
   When the people of New York elected PAT MOYNIHAN to represent them nearly 25 years ago, they sent to Washington a uniquely gifted and talented man. Those are the reasons, Senator MOYNIHAN is one of only two, out of 63 Senators from New York, to have been elected to four consecutive terms in the United States Senate. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN began his service to this nation more than 50 years ago when he served in the United States Navy from 1944-1947--and he never stopped being ``Mr. Public Servant.'' He served one governor, New York's Averell Harriman, and four United States Presidents: two Democrats, Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, and two Republicans, Presidents Nixon and Ford. 
   What a record. PAT MOYNIHAN has given more than three quarters of his life to his nation and his state. This country, the United States Senate, and New York are joyously thankful. 
   He has been a leader in so many areas that it challenges one to list them all. But his impact on public architecture, monuments for future generations, are the hallmarks which this quiet gentleman reveres. 
   For over fifteen years now, I have had the privilege of serving with PAT on the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee. I have been fortunate to work closely with him and observe his tireless effort and commitment to maintaining the architectural integrity of our great public institutions. 
   Some 40 years ago, the Kennedy Administration made the decision to revive Pennsylvania Avenue and restore the Federal Triangle. It was an extraordinary stroke of fortune that PAT MOYNIHAN, a deputy to Labor Secretary Goldberg who played a primary role in the effort, had the responsibility to draft a report that contained core ideas for redevelopment. The Federal Triangle, including the Ronald Reagan Building, and the Judiciary Building--to mention just a few--are dramatic evidence of his contributions that will live for years to come in the foundation of these magnificent buildings. 
   I cannot resist the temptation to recall that Senator MOYNIHAN was fond of noting that it was Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon who initially championed the idea of reviving the Federal Triangle and establishing it as an international trade and cultural center. It took a man of PAT MOYNIHAN's talent, character and foresight to pick up and finish that vision, started in the early 1930s, in such a grand manner. 
   I would be remiss were I not to take a minute to thank Senator MOYNIHAN for his leadership and the personal courtesies he extended to me, as he took the initiative to name the departmental auditorium at the Commerce Department building, the Andrew Mellon Auditorium. It truly is a remarkable structure and aptly named. 
   Over 200 years ago, Pierre L'Enfant, as he laid plans for the new United States capital, could only hope that a man like Senator MOYNIHAN would one day work with such compassion and perseverance to keep alive the true spirit and design envisioned in the original blueprints of George Washington's federal city. 
   One of the most rewarding assignments in my own career in public service, has been the opportunity to serve with Senator MOYNIHAN as a member of the Smithsonian's Board of Regents. The talented men and women who have served on the Board are unquestionably committed to the arts and preserving this nation's cultural heritage. And I am certain, that all of them who have served with him would agree that PAT MOYNIHAN's leadership and guiding wisdom have been indispensable. 
   Beyond the physical monuments to his achievements, I will always remember PAT MOYNIHAN for his humor, his intellect, his grace, his eloquence, and his humility. 
   All of us here, before we cast the first vote, before we discharge the first responsibility, take the oath of office. We solemnly commit ``to support and defend the constitution.......'' ``Against all enemies.......'' we commit ``to bear true faith and allegiance'' and we undertake ``to faithfully discharge'' our duty. Senator MOYNIHAN was a man of his word and here in the Senate he has always been true to his principles and true to his oath.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President. I rise today to pay tribute to Senator ROBERT KERREY of Nebraska. As Undersecretary, then Secretary of Navy for over five years during the war in Vietnam, I learned first hand the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of the armed forces who served our Nation. 
   Lieutenant, USN, BOB KERREY earned our nation's highest recognition for his valor and unwavering leadership during that conflict. Those same extraordinary personal attributes BOB KERREY brought to the Senate. 
   Serving with BOB is a reward all Senators will cherish. Though the challenges of education will be his next call to duty, I predict he will someday soon be back in public office. Enjoy this respite, my friend, but harken to the bugle-call in years to come for another career to strengthen our nation with your ``brand'' of leadership. 
   I shall miss our vigorous floor debates, our trips abroad to visit our troops, our moments of levity as two old bachelors. 
   As we sailors say, ``well done sir''!

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a genuine leader in the United States Senate, my colleague and friend--Senator SLADE GORTON. 
   We have served together over his entire 18 year career in the Senate. Of the 23 men and women who have served the State of Washington in the Senate, SLADE has earned a ranking commensurate with those classic giants Senator Henry ``Scoop'' Jackson and Senator Warren Magnuson. 
   SLADE has served the State of Washington with distinction, but he has also served the nation, exceptionally well. Beginning with his service in the United States Army in 1946, SLADE has served his state and the country for nearly 40 years in a number of elected offices. 
   He has fought for balanced budgets, tax relief, and health care reforms. We served together on the Armed Services Committee, and I, as Ranking Member, was the beneficiary of his wise and steadfast counsel. 
   SLADE, you are a valued friend. I wish you and your wife Sally well in the years ahead.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a man I have worked with my entire Senate career: Senator BILL ROTH. He is a true friend and gentleman, as well as a superb legislator whose contributions to the nation are many. 
   Senator ROTH will likely be best remembered as the co-author of the famous Kemp-Roth tax cuts, initiated during President Reagan's tenure and for the Roth IRAs which have made it possible for millions around the country to invest taxable income that can be withdrawn tax-free in their retirement. 
   Senator ROTH has represented Delaware for 29 years, making him the longest serving Senator in our ``First State's'' storied history. 
   Senator ROTH is a decorated veteran of World War II, and began his Congressional service in 1966. He has served his country for almost 40 years. We all are indebted to him for his remarkable service. 
   I wish Senator ROTH and his wife, Jane, well and hope that they will cherish the years to come in the same way they have those that have past.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Senator CONNIE MACK of Florida. There are many ways to discern the character of a Senator. CONNIE MACK has made his mark with strong leadership coupled with an unusual quality of gentleness. A true gentleman of the Senate. Senatorial courtesy was his hallmark. He loved this institution; it loved him. 
   One unique, but subtle mannerism reveals the inner security of this great man--how he handled the gavel. The gavel is that symbol of authority so coveted by all Senators. As we all know, a gavel consists of two parts: the relatively small handle to hold, and the large hammer-like head to strike the blow. Senate Chairmen love the sharp ``bang'' connoting authority and decision. 
   Senator MACK is the only Senator, the only Chairman, whom I have observed in my 22 years of service who simply used the hammer head for the grip and conveyed his authority by gently tapping the end of the handle. 
   ``May we have order, please.'' Immediately following was always quiet acceptance. 
   This symbolized to me how this elegant man commanded the great respect of all in the Senate. As with the gavel, his voice was always firm, and always with the soft tone of confidence. 
   We wish him well, together with his wife and family, as they accept life's next challenge.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a colleague and friend who will be greatly missed by the United States Senate--Senator JOHN ASHCROFT. 
   Senator ASHCROFT, served Missouri and the nation with distinction. 
   In the Senate, he was a leader in passage of landmark welfare reform legislation, authoring the Charitable Choice provision. He fought for lower taxes, a strong national defense, greater local control of education, and enhanced law enforcement. 
   A popular, former two term governor of his home state, JOHN brought a real ``can-do'' sense of purpose to his work in the Senate. I have always felt that those who come to the Senate with experience as governor, have especially valuable experience that the entire nation benefits from. 
   There is a term used throughout the 211 year history of the Senate called ``Senatorial courtesy.'' JOHN won the admiration of his colleagues in many ways, especially his caring tradition of writing wonderful personal notes--not by computer--but always taking time to write them by hand. 
   We wish you, your wife and family well as you take on your new challenges.

   Senator ABRAHAM began his service in government in Washington, DC in 1990, when he had the honor of serving in President Bush's Administration as Deputy Chief to Vice President Dan Quayle. In 1993, SPENCER ABRAHAM returned to Michigan to run for the United States Senate seat vacated by Senator Don Riegle who was retiring. Senator ABRAHAM won that Senate seat in 1994 and became the first Michigan Republican elected to the United States Senate in 22 years. 
   I have had the pleasure of working with Senator ABRAHAM on a number of issues including high technology and immigration over the last six years. Not only is Senator ABRAHAM a colleague of mine, SPENCE and his family are friends as well.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen and Mrs. Janet Langhart Cohen. As Secretary of Defense for almost four years, Bill Cohen has led the Defense Department and the military services with leadership and a strong commitment. 
   In contemporary political history, persons of a political party other than the party of the Administration, have offered to serve this Nation. It takes a special courage; Bill Cohen has that courage. He has earned--with distinction--a place in history. 
   Bill Cohen and I were first elected to the Senate in 1978. We served together on the Armed Services Committee from 1979 until Bill retired from the Senate in 1996. Throughout his service with the Senate, he was recognized as a leader. 
   A prodigious student of history, diplomacy, foreign policy and national security, he was recognized as one of the most able and productive members of the Armed Services Committee. He worked hard to develop and maintain a bipartisan consensus on national security policy. For Bill Cohen, partisan politics--in the words of the famous Republican senator from Michigan, Senator Arthur Vandenberg--``stopped at the water's edge.'' 
   Fortunately, the President recognized the wealth of knowledge and experience Bill had developed during his service in the Congress. 
   Bill Cohen also had the good fortune of being the son of parents he loved and admired. That gave him inner strength. 
   In December 1996, he was nominated to be Secretary of Defense and was promptly confirmed by the Senate. 
   When Bill Cohen accepted the nomination, he undestood the extraordinary challenges that lay ahead. He understood that he would be responsible for a department and for military services that had undergone, and were undergoing, the most significant reduction in force and personnel and equipment in almost thirty years. 
   The problems associated with these reductions were 
   compounded by increasing operational commitments. Comparing the period between the end of the Vietnam War and the beginning of Operation Desert Storm to the period between Operation Desert Storm to today, these commitments have increased by over 400 percent. And there would be no foreseeable end to our extended commitments in many parts of the world. 
   It was at such a critical crossroad in the history of the U.S. Armed Forces that a leader with a strong sense of purpose and keen intellect was needed at the helm of the Department of Defense. That leader was Bill Cohen. We, in this chamber, knew very well the profound depth of his intellect and leadership through his oratory, his writings, his poems and, yes, his occasional ``doodles'' on the notepad. Like Colonel Joshua Chamberlain, a Union Army soldier and son of Maine, that Cohen revered, he likewise accepted the daunting challenge with which he was presented. 
   Upon taking the helm at the Department of Defense, Bill Cohen quickly identified those key areas that required his immediate attention. Shortly after his confirmation hearing, Secretary Cohen stated that he would dedicate his time in office to working on the quality of life for military personnel and their families and to addressing continuing shortfalls in readiness and modernization of the Armed Forces. 
   So began his four years of labor to lead the largest agency in the Federal Government--one of the largest organizations in the world. But this was a labor of love for the new secretary. Bill Cohen recently described his tenure as ``the most demanding, exhilarating experience'' he has ever had--work he would do ``forever.''  
   Sharing this experience with Bill Cohen is his wife, Janet Langhart Cohen. She has been equally enthusiastic in her role supporting him--and military personnel throughout the world--as a ``First Lady of the Pentagon.'' 
   Janet Langhart Cohen's tireless and selfless work for our men and women in uniform, and their families, has been remarkable. She has been committed to making sure that the American people's hearts and minds are fully joined with those who are wearing the uniform. Thanks to Janet Langhart Cohen, soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines have come to know how much they are appreciated by their fellow Americans. 
   To this end, Janet Langhart Cohen called on the USO--and their volunteer entertainers--to bring the message from the homefront to our forward deployed military men and women. She recognized that the USO helped those in the military who are far from home give in to laughter rather than give way to loneliness and despair. With the USO, Janet Langhart Cohen reinvigorated the spirit of our warriors. 
   Understanding the important relationship between the men and women of the Armed Forces and the USO, Janet Langhart Cohen led the effort to build a lasting exhibit to the USO in the Pentagon. Thanks to her, the tribute was unveiled just a few short weeks ago. To many, she is now also recognized as the ``First Lady of the USO.'' 
   Together, Bill and Janet have been a dynamic team. They have tackled many of the problems facing military families today. They have also circled the globe together to demonstrate their combined conviction and support for our men and women in uniform wherever they are deployed. Only recently, Bill and Janet completed their third trip to Kosovo since the June 1999 end of the air campaign. 
   In our brief years, Secretary Cohen, through tireless work, study, and travel, has continued to develop his already formidable understanding of global, economic and national security issues. And as had been the case during his 24 years of service in the Congress, Secretary Cohen's conviction for supporting the troops continued without question. 
   Anyone who has been privileged to serve in the Department of Defense, especially as the ``Top Gun,'' knows there is no more difficult a job in the Executive Branch of our government. Bill Cohen earned his place in history, alongside the best, and the men and women in uniform render a respectful ``hand salute.''

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, our distinguished colleague, Senator GRAMS, will go on to, I hope, an even greater challenge. 
   What a privilege it has been for me and I think all in this Chamber to have had his service for a few years. I was particularly impressed by Senator GRAMS' willingness to take on assignments which others felt they would rather not have because of the challenge--particularly on the Foreign Relations Committee and those relating to Africa, those relating to the United Nations, and issues which are very vital not only to our Nation but to the whole world. 
   I wish to commend the Senator. I hope that he will continue to apply his talents and his wisdom and energy to solving those difficult challenges. 
   I recently visited the U.N. with Ambassador Holbrooke. Time and time again, I was in consultation with him and other ambassadors from other nations in regard to the budget situation. Senator GRAMS was instrumental in the landmark piece of legislation, Helms-Biden. 
   I hope he will continue to apply his talents. 
   I wish Senator GRAMS and his family well.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, last Saturday, I, along with tens of thousands of others, gathered along the Mall to observe the groundbreaking ceremony for the World War II memorial. It was a most moving and inspirational moment for all who attended and, indeed, for the untold millions who followed through the medium of television. All of the speakers at this ceremony were clearly inspired by the solemnity of the occasion. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the remarks of all the speakers in attendance be printed in today's RECORD following my statement.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I should now like to list those speakers in the order in which they took part in this program. 
   First, World War II Chaplain and retired Archbishop Phillip M. Hannan, who gave a most inspirational invocation. He is a highly decorated combat veteran of World War II. What a marvelous spirit he has. He set the tone for all others who followed; 
   Gen. Fred Woerner, Chairman, American Battle Monuments Commission; 
   Ohio Congresswoman MARCY KAPTUR, who launched the effort in Congress to authorize the national World War II memorial. Her initial efforts go as far back as 1987; 
   Luthur Smith, a World War II Tuskegee Airman; 
   I am privileged to have been associated with the men and women of the Armed Forces through much of my life, but his rendition of his last mission, and how he was shot down, and how the hand of providence literally extracted him from a flaming aircraft and brought his wounded body to ground--it brought tears to the eyes of all present. That is worth the entire statement to be put in the RECORD today. 
   Tom Hanks, actor, who starred in ``Saving Private Ryan,'' has done so much work to make this memorial possible. 
   Senator Bob Dole, our beloved former colleague and the National Chairman, World War II Memorial Campaign, spoke with such moving eloquence. He, of course, I believe, deserves most special recognition for his efforts. 
   Fredrick W. Smith, founder and CEO, FedEx Corporation and National Cochairman, World War II Memorial Campaign, also a veteran, not of World War II but of subsequent campaigns; 
   Ambassador F. Hadyn Williams, Chairman, American Battle Monuments Commission, World War II Memorial Committee. 
   William Cohen, our former Senate colleague, and current Secretary of Defense; and the concluding remarks, again, a very stirring and eloquent statement by our President, William Jefferson Clinton. 
   In addition to those great Americans who spoke at the ceremonies, there were others there. I mention just those in Congress: our distinguished President pro tempore, STROM THURMOND; from the House of Representatives, Representatives JOHN DINGELL, BENJAMIN GILMAN, RALPH REGULA, BOB STUMP, JOE SKEEN, and, of course, former Representative Sonny Montgomery, who has done so much through the years for the men and women of our Armed Forces. 
   I again wish to give very special recognition and, indeed, it was by all present, to Senator Bob Dole for his inspired, relentless, and untiring efforts to make this memorial possible.  
   This memorial will be an educational reminder for future generations to the enormous commitment, at home as well as in the uniformed ranks, of the people of our great Nation. As Senator Dole often said throughout his efforts on behalf of this memorial: What would our world be today if freedom had not prevailed, had there not been the enormous commitment throughout the United States and, indeed, also, in our allies. What if freedom had not prevailed and the war had been lost? What would the world be today? That will be the question that those who visit for decades to come should ask of themselves as they quietly reflect on this magnificent structure and the symbolism of that effort.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on October 10, 2000, the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) hosted an important luncheon discussion on the European Union's evolving European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP). The guest speakers at that luncheon were Ambassador Christopher Meyer of Great Britain, Ambassador Juergen Chrobog of Germany, and Ambassador Francois Bujon de l'Estang of France. Senator LEVIN and I were privileged to sponsor this luncheon on Capitol Hill, in the Senate Armed Services Committee hearing room. Attendees at this luncheon included a prestigious group of former ambassadors and administration officials, representatives from industry, policy and research organizations, and senior congressional staff from both the House and Senate. 
   Since December 1999, when the European Union (EU) Heads of State announced at a summit meeting in Helsinki their ``determination to develop an autonomous capacity to take decisions and, where NATO as a whole is not engaged, to launch and conduct EU-led military operations in response to international crises,'' there has been a great deal of discussion and debate about the development of a common European defense identity. While I commend our European allies for their  willingness to do more militarily, I have been concerned about the impact of an ESDP on the NATO Alliance. 
   My views on the development of the European Security and Defense Policy start with the basic premise that NATO has been the most successful military alliance in history. NATO won the cold war; it is now plying an instrumental role in keeping the peace in Europe. Whatever is done in the context of an ESDP, it must not weaken NATO. 
   There are a number of questions concerning the content of an ESDP--questions I, Senator LEVIN, and others raised at the October 10 luncheon. For example, Europeans are discussing increasing their military capabilities at a time of declining defense budgets, in a number of NATO partners. How is an added military capability possible with less money? Will ESDP developments--particularly the establishment of EU military structures--take valuable and scarce resources away from NATO military capabilities? How will the EU military force interact with NATO? Will NATO have the right of first refusal--or veto power--over an EU-led military operation?

   Mr. WARNER. We hope to yield back some time because I know many of our colleagues are anxious to make commitments, but this is a very important piece of legislation. I am certain the Senators who are going to participate, whom I have identified, will do so in a manner that fits the importance of this annual piece of legislation. 
   This is the 39th consecutive authorization bill passed by the Congress, assuming it passes this Chamber. It passed the House by a vote of 382-31. 
   That will give some clear indication of the importance of the legislation and the strong support that it merits and has merited in the House of Representatives. 
   Mr. President, the Senate, as I have been with my colleagues here for the past hour or so for the voting, reflects a very somber note on this sad day for America--indeed, for all those who, throughout the world, stand guard for freedom. We have suffered a tragic loss to the U.S. Navy. This is in parallel with frightful losses taking place elsewhere throughout the Middle East. It brings to mind that this is a most dangerous world that faces us every day. Men and women in the Armed Forces of the United States go forth from our shores, serving in countries all over the world. They, of course, now are on a high alert because of the tragic terrorist act inflicted upon one of our destroyers, the U.S.S. Cole.  
   First in mind are thoughts for our sailors who have lost their lives, and most particularly their families and the families who, at this hour, are still waiting definitive news with regard to the crew of that ship. The casualties number four dead, approximately 12 missing, and some 35 to 36 suffering wounds. Still the facts are coming in. 
   This clearly shows the danger; it shows the risks the men and women of the Armed Forces are taking--not only in the Middle East region. This, of course, happened in a port in Yemen. The ship was on a routine refueling, a matter of hours, as it worked its way up towards the Persian Gulf to take up its duty station in enforcing the United Nations Security Council sanctions against Iraq. Because of the smuggling that is taking place in violation of those sanctions, those are dangerous tasks and they are being performed every day by men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces, Great Britain, and other nations. Air missions are being flown over Iraq every day, and often those missions are encountering ground fire and other military activity directed against them. We must be a grateful nation for the risks that are constantly assumed by the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and their families. 
   The Senate will have an opportunity to get further facts in the course of the day. 
   I will now direct my attention to this particular bill, and I see the distinguished President pro tempore, the former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. It is my privilege to succeed him. As an honor to our distinguished former chairman, I ask he lead off the debate on this bill today.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, of course, his request is in the unanimous consent agreement, and, of course, we will observe it. 
   Today the Senate begins consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 4205, the Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. 
   Before I discuss the provisions of the conference report, I want to report that my fellow Senators on the conference panel and I enthusiastically joined the House conferees in naming this bill. Representative FLOYD SPENCE has served as the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee for the last six years. His chairmanship, however, represents only a portion of the almost 30 years Representative SPENCE has been a tireless and dedicated supporter of the military men and women in uniform. As chairman of the committee, in particular, he has led the committee and the House of Representatives in addressing the many challenging national security issues that have confronted our nation in the wake of the cold war. Representative SPENCE has accomplished this undertaking with distinction. From this former Marine captain to a retired Navy captain, I salute him for his leadership. Under the rules of the House, he will relinquish command of the committee at the end of this Congress. Representative SPENCE will remain a member of the committee, and I look forward to continuing to work with him in the many years to come. 
   This legislation will have a profound, positive impact on our nation's security and on the welfare of the men and women of the Armed Forces and their families. For the second year in a row, the conference report before the Senate authorizes a real increase in defense spending. We have built on the momentum begun last year by authorizing $309.9 billion in new budget authority for defense for fiscal year 2001--$4.6 billion above the President's budget request. And how have we allocated this increase? This bill authorizes $63.2 billion in procurement, which is $2.6 billion above the President's budget request; $38.9 billion in research, development, test and evaluation, which is $1.1 billion above the President's request; and $109.7 billion in operations and maintenance funding, which exceeds the budget request by $1.0 billion. 
   It is said that success has a thousand fathers and failure is an orphan. The majority of credit for the successes in this bill however, can be attribute to five distinguished and decorated fathers: the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the four service chiefs. General Shelton, General Shinseki, Admiral Clark, General Jones, and General Ryan came to Congress repeatedly during this session and presented to the Senate Armed Services Committee their concerns about the state of the Armed Forces today. They also shared with us their observations about the future. They have consistently shared this information with us in a reasonable, earnest, and nonpartisan manner. We greatly appreciate their candor and contributions to this process. 
   We all recognize that our military today is over deployed and under recourced--both in terms of people and money. 
   Since the early 1990s, the U.S. military has been sent on operations overseas at an unprecedented rate; at the same time that force structure was reduced by a third and defense spending was declining. From the end of the Viet Nam War until 1989, there were 60 military deployments. From 1990 to today, there have been 343 deployments--a 571 percent increase. These statistics accurately tell the story. This trend has increased the risk to our forces and has exacerbated the recruiting and retention problems in the military. This cannot continue. 
   While the rate of military deployments is established by the President, the Congress, within our constitutional powers, is continuing to support the Armed Forces by improving the quality  of life for the men and women in uniform and their families, by providing for funding increases to address declining readiness problems, aging equipment, and recruiting and retention 
   difficulties. The conference report does this. For the servicemen and women deployed around the world, and the families at home that wait their return, they should know that the Congress is steadfastly behind them. 
   I turn now to what is one of the most important single item in this conference report--military healthcare, particularly for our retired personnel and their families. History shows they are the best recruiters of all. 
   The conference report before the Senate fulfills an important commitment of ``healthcare for life'' made by the recruiters--the U.S. Government--beginning in World War II and continuing through the Korean war and the Viet Nam war. The goal of making that commitment was to encourage service members to remain in uniform and become careerists. Simply put, a commitment of health care for life in exchange for their dedicated career service. 
   Again, this convergence report fulfills the promise of healthcare for life. I am proud of the bipartisan unanimity with which the Senate Armed Services Committee supported this initiative--an initiative never taken before by an congressional committee. 
   Let me describe for my colleagues and for our active and retired service members around the world the legislation in this conference report to authorize health care benefits for Medicare-eligible military retirees and their families, and how we arrived at this outcome. 
   For as long as I can remember, military recruits and those facing re-enlistment have been told that one of the basic benefits of serving a full military career is health care for life. We all know now that this commonly offered incentive was not based in statute, but was, nonetheless, freely and frequently made; it is a commitment that we must honor. 
   Let me briefly review the history of military health care. Military medical care requirements for activity duty service members and their families were recognized as early as the 1700's. Congressional action in the last 1800's directed military medical officers to attend to military families whenever possible, at no cost to the family. During World War II, with so many service members on activity duty, the military medical system could not handle the health care requirements of family members. The Emergency Maternal and Infant Care Program was authorized by Congress to meet this road. This program was administered through state health agencies. 
   The earliest reference in statute defining the health care benefit for military retirees was in 1956 when, for the first time, the Dependent's Medical Care Act specified that military retirees were eligible for health care in military facilities on a space-available basis. In 1966, this Act was amended to create the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services, CHAMPUS, to supplement the care provided in military facilities. This legislation, in 1966, specifically excluded from coverage military retirees who were eligible for Medicare--a program which had been enacted by the Congress one year earlier, in 1965. 
   The exclusion of over age 65, Medicare-eligible military retirees from guaranteed care from the military health care system was masked for many years because the capacity of military hospitals an the military medical system exceeded that 
   required to care for active duty service members; therefore, many Medicare-eligible retirees were able to receive treatment, on a space-available basis, at military facilities. In the 1990s, we began to reduce the size of our military services and the base realignment and closure, BRAC, rounds began to close bases--and military hospitals--all across the Nation. The combined effect of fewer military medical personnel to provide care and the closure of over 30 percent of the military hospitals eliminated the excess capacity that had been so beneficial to military retirees. Also during this decade the retiree population grew dramatically, adding pressure to the military health care system. The true magnitude of the problem was finally exposed. 
   All of us have heard from military retirees who served a full career and, in so doing, made many sacrifices. Many times the sacrifices these heroic veterans made resulted in serious medical conditions that manifested themselves at the time in their lives when they were pushed out of the military health care system. As a nation, we promised these dedicated retirees health care for life, but we were ignoring that promise. 
   On February 23, 2000, I introduced a bill, S. 2087, that provided for access to mail order pharmaceuticals for ALL Medicare-eligible military retirees, for the first time. The legislation also would improve access to benefits under TRICARE and extend and improve certain demonstration programs under the Defense Health Program. 
   On May 1, 2000, I introduced S. 2486, which added a retail pharmacy component to the previous legislation, providing for a full pharmacy benefit for all retirees, including those eligible for Medicare. 
   On June 6, Senator TIM HUTCHINSON and I introduced S. 2669, a bill that would extend TRICARE eligibility to all military retirees and their families, regardless of age. Later that same day, I amended the defense authorization bill to add the text of S. 2669. This legislation provided uninterrupted access to the Military Health Care System, known as TRICARE, to all retirees. 
   While the Senate bill extended TRICARE eligibility to all military retirees and their families regardless of age, the defense authorization bill passed by the House of Representatives took a different approach. The House bill expanded and made permanent the Medicare subvention program. Medicare subvention is a program that is currently being tested in ten sites across the country. Under Medicare subvention, the Health Care Financing Agency of the Department of Health and Human Services reimburses the Department of Defense for providing health care to Medicare-eligible military retirees in military hospitals. 
   There are several problems with Medicare subvention. First, the amount of the reimbursement from Medicare to DOD falls well short of the actual cost of providing that care, causing DOD to absorb a loss for each retiree covered by the program. Second, expanding Medicare subvention nationwide would provide access to health care only for those beneficiaries living in proximity to the remaining DOD medical facilities. In contrast, the Senate bill covered 100 percent of the Medicare-eligible military retirees, regardless of where they live. 
   As many of you know, since the defense authorization conference began in late July, Senate and House conferees have been working toward the mutual goal of adopting legislation which would provide comprehensive health care to all military 
   retirees, regardless of age. I am pleased to announce that the conference report to accompany the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 includes a permanent health care benefit for retirees--modeled on the Senate bill. I am delighted that we have honored the commitment of health care for life that was made to those who proudly served this nation. This is long overdue. 
   It had always been my intent to make this health care benefit permanent. In fact, when I originally introduced my legislation in February, with the support of many in the Senate, there was no time limit on the benefits contained in my amendment. During Senate floor consideration, a discussion arose about whether a budget point of order could be made against the bill due to the mandatory costs of the amendment. At that point, I made the decision to limit the provision to a preliminary 2-year period to ensure that there would be no point of order against the authorization bill. We knew of Senators who had a legitimate interest in raising such a point of order, and I did not want to put the bill at risk. 
   All through this process, I have made clear my commitment to work to make these benefits permanent at the earliest opportunity. 
   During the defense authorization conference we had an opportunity to make my retiree health care provisions permanent by converting the benefit to an entitlement and creating an accrual account in the Treasury. This conversion to an entitlement would not occur until fiscal year 2003.  
   Let me describe how funding the health care benefit through an accrual account would work. Accrual method of financing is more of an accounting mechanism than a change in funding. Using an accrual method of financing does not, in itself, increase the costs of a program. Accrual funding is commonly used in entitlement programs; one example of an accrual account is the military retirement account. The Department of Defense would annually deposit such funds, as determined by the actuarial board, into the accrual account in the Treasury. The Treasury, which would absorb the liability for certain costs attributed to providing health care, would also make an annual deposit to the accrual account. The costs of the health care benefit would than be paid from the accrual account. 
   The net effect of funding this important program as an entitlement would be similar to funding it from within the discretionary accounts of the Department of Defense. While a significant portion of the burden of funding this program is moved from the Department of Defense budget, there is little net cost to the federal government. 
   Permanently funding the military retiree health care benefit will be seen by retirees, active duty service members and potential recruits as the nation keeping it's commitment of health care for life to military retirees. Those serving today and those who are joining the military will see that the promise of a lifetime of health care, in return for serving a full career, will be honored in perpetuity. 
   Two weeks ago, in testimony before both the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House Armed Services Committee, General Hugh Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and each of the service chiefs strongly supported making this benefit permanent and using the accrual account method of financing. The Joint Chiefs have repeatedly testified that failing to honor the commitment to our retirees has been detrimental to their 
   recruiting and retention efforts. 
   During our conference we made many tough decisions on issues that are very important to many Senators. I resisted every proposal that would potentially generate a point of order against the conference report. The accrual funding mechanism and the direct spending associated with the retiree health care benefit will make our conference report vulnerable to a motion to raise a point of order against our bill which would require a 60 vote majority to overcome. It is any Senator's legitimate right to take such an action. While I respect the right of any Senator to raise a point of order, I am urging my colleagues to consider the benefits of the health care provisions in this bill, which are fully justified. We would not want to leave our over-65 military retirees in doubt about our intentions with respect to their medical care. They must make critical decisions regarding their medical insurance plans and medical care. By making this health care plan a permanent entitlement, we are truly fulfilling the commitment made to all those who have completed a career in uniform. 
   If such a point of order is sustained, then the Defense authorization conference report will have to be recommitted to a new conference. There is simply not enough time in this Congress to commence a new conference. 
   If the Defense authorization conference report is not passed, there will be no health care benefit for Medicare-eligible military retirees. If the defense authorization conference report is not passed, this would be the first time in 38 years that the Congress has not passed a Defense authorization bill. That would be a tragedy. What a terrible signal to send to our brave men and women in uniform defending freedom around the world. 
   In addition to restoring our commitment to our retirees, the conference report also includes a number of important initiatives for active and reserve men and women in uniform today. The conferees authorized a 3.7 percent pay raise for military personnel effective January 1, 2001 and a revision of the basic pay tables to give noncommissioned officers an additional pay increase, effective July 1, 2001. I cannot understate the importance of providing our noncommissioned officers with this support. They are our career soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines; tried and true, they are the backbone of our military and are more than deserving of this pay raise. 
   We included a provision to reduce the number of military personnel on food stamps. The conference report would provide up to $500 per month in an additional, special pay for military personnel who are eligible for food stamps. By our estimates, this provision should reduce the 6,000 military personnel estimated by DOD to be on food stamps today by about half. To further assist our most needy service members, the conferees agreed to eliminate the requirement that service members pay 15 percent of their housing costs out of their own pocket and directed implementation of the Thrift Savings Program of active and reserve service members. 
   The conference report extends current and authorizes additional recruiting and retention bonuses and special pays. If the bill is not enacted into law, all of these bonuses will expire on December 31, 2000. If the services are not able to offer the recruiting and reenlistment bonuses, their recruiting and retention progress of this past year will be for naught. 
   Also important to improving the quality of life for servicemen 
   and women and their families is our continuing support for the modernization, renovation, and improvement of aging military housing. This conference report contains $8.8 billion for military construction and family housing, an increase of $788.0 million above the administration's request. More than $443.0 million of this amount is for the construction of 2,900 family housing units--800 more homes than last year. The conference report also provides more than $585.0 million to renovate and upgrade critical barracks space for unaccompanied military personnel and more than $660.0 million for vital military construction projects for reserve components. 
   This conference report also supports a group of dedicated men and women, who, while not in uniform, provided an equally important contribution to the defense of the Nation. The conference report establishes a new program to compensate Department of Energy, DOE, employees and DOE contractor employees who were injured due to exposure to radiation, beryllium, or silica while working at certain DOE defense-related nuclear facilities. This new program is intended to compensate those employees who, for the past 50 years, have performed duties uniquely related to nuclear weapons production and testing. Eligible employees would receive a lump sum payment of $150,000 and payment for all future medical costs related to the covered illness. 
   At this point, I recognize the important contributions of Senators THOMPSON, VOINOVICH, MCCONNELL, and DEWINE and their staff in crafting the final conference outcome on DOE workers compensation. Although they were not conferees, they were involved every step of the way as we negotiated this important issue with the House. They are to be commended for their tireless efforts on behalf of DOE workers. 
   I will now briefly highlight just a few of the important measures in this bill which support modernization and operations of our land, sea, and air forces, and which support our continuing efforts to identify and counter the emerging threats--information warfare or the use of weapons of mass destruction. 
   The conference report: 
   Increases funding by over $888.0 million for the primary military readiness accounts for ammunition, spare parts, equipment maintenance, base operations, training funds, and real property maintenance. While the additional funds that the conferees have provided will help with some of the most critical shortages in these areas, further efforts will be required over the next several years if we are to restore the Armed Forces to appropriate levels of readiness; 
   Supports the Army's transformation efforts by: authorizing an additional $750.0 million for this initiative; directing the Army to provide a plan that charts a clear course toward the fielding of an objective force in the 2012 time frame; and requiring an evaluation of equipment alternatives for Interim Brigade Combat Teams; 
   Adds $560.0 million to the President's budget request for ship construction;  
   Adds $15.7 million for five additional Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams, WMD-CST, which will result in a total of 32 WMD-CSTs by the end of fiscal year 2001. WMD-CSTs, formerly known as Rapid Assessment and Initial Detection, RAID; Teams, are comprised of 22 full-time 
   National guard personnel who are specially trained and equipped to deploy and assess suspected nuclear, biological, chemical, or radiological events in support of local first responders in the United States. 
   Includes a provision that would designate one Assistant Secretary of Defense as the principal civilian advisor to the Secretary for Department of Defense activities for combating terrorism. This provision--which is critically needed--ensures that there is a single individual within the Department responsible for providing a focused, comprehensive and well-funded DOD policy for combating terrorism. 
   Provides additional funding to address several of the Department of Defense's most critical shortfalls in combating cyber-warfare threats. The conference report adds $15.0 million to create an information Security Scholarship Program to address shortages in skilled DOD information assurance personnel by providing essential training and education in exchange for a service commitment, and $5.0 million to establish an Institute for Defense Computer Security and Information Protection to conduct critical research and development that is currently not being done by DOD or the private sector, and to facilitate the exchange of information regarding cyberthreats and related issues; 
   Adds $146.0 million to accelerate technologies leading to the development and fielding of unmanned air combat vehicles by 2010 and unmanned ground combat vehicles by 2015. This initiative will allow the Department to exploit the opportunities created by the rapid pace of technological development to provide our men and women in uniform with the most advanced weaponry and leverage these developments in a way that minimizes the risk to those deployed in harm's why; 
   Authorizes a net increase of $391.8 million for ballistic missile defense programs including a $129.0 million increase for National Missile Defense risk reduction, an $85.0 million increase for the Airborne Laser program, and an $80.0 million increase for the Navy Theater Wide missile defense program; 
   Reduces the congressional review period from 180 days to 60 days for changes proposed by the administration on the export control levels of high performance computers; 
   Ensures service contractors receive prompt and timely payment from the Department of Defense by requiring a plan for the electronic submission of supporting documents for contracts and the payment of interest for service contracts for payments more than 30 days late; 
   Authorizes $470.0 million in federal assistance to the Nation's firefighters over the next two years. The conference report also establishes a framework for the review and reauthorization of the program at the end of that time. 
   I would now like to take a few moments to address a provision which is not in the final conference report--the Warner-Kasich amendment on Kosovo. 
   As my colleagues know, I started the legislative effort to get our European allies to live up to the commitments they have made to provide assistance to the peacekeeping operation in Kosovo shortly after returning from a trip to the region in January. I was greatly troubled by what I saw in Kosovo--a U.N. peacekeeping mission that was out of money; a civil implementation effort that had barely begun, almost seven months after the war had ended; and U.S. and other NATO troops having to make up for shortfalls on the civilian side by performing a variety of non-military missions, from performing basic police functions to running towns and villages, to acting as judges and juries. I could not allow this situation to continue without reviewing the issue with our allies and bringing it to the attention of my colleagues. 
   The United Sates bore the major share of the military burden for the air war on behalf of Kosovo--flying almost 70 percent of the strike and support sorties, at a cost of over $4.0 billion to the U.S. taxpayer and great personal risk to our aviators. In return, the Europeans promised to pay the major share of the burden to secure the peace. European nations and institutions quickly volunteered billions in assistance and thousands of personnel for the effort to rebuild Kosovo. Unfortunately, as I discovered in January, these resources and personnel were not making their way to Kosovo--commitments were simply not becoming realities. 
   I introduced legislation that had a very clear and simple purpose: to tell our European allies that we would not allow the commitment of U.S. military personnel to Kosovo to drift on endlessly because of the failure of the Europeans to live up to their commitments. My legislation would have done no more than hold our allies accountable for the pledges and commitments they freely made. 
   For a variety of reasons, a form of the legislation that I originally sponsored failed in the Senate on a close vote. However, Congressman KASICH, after consulting with me, pursued similar legislation as an amendment to the defense authorization bill in the House of Representatives. The Kasich amendment passed the House by an overwhelming margin--over 100 votes. It was this amendment that we addressed during our conference. 
   I believe that the legislation Congressman KASICH and I jointly pursued this year has had a very positive effect. Money and personnel for civil implementation efforts are now flowing into Kosovo. Our allies are making credible progress in fulfilling their commitments. The civil implementation effort in Kosovo is now moving forward. While more clearly needs to be done, it was the feeling of a majority of the conferees--myself included--that the Kosovo legislation had largely achieved its purpose, and keeping this legislation in the final conference report could have a negative impact on relations with our allies and, perhaps, developments in Kosovo. 
   In place of the Kasich language, the conferees included a provision which requires the President to submit semiannual reports to the Congress, beginning in December of this year, on the progress being made by our allies in fulfilling their commitments in Kosovo. Such reports will allow the Congress to keep track of developments in this important area. If these reports reveal that progress again lags, it is the intention of this Senator to pursue legislation in the future designed to ensure greater burden sharing by our European allies in this crucial venture. 
   In conclusion, I want to thank all of the members and staff of the Senate and House Armed Services Committee for their hard work and cooperation. This bill sends a strong signal to our men and women in uniform and their families that Congress fully supports them as they perform their missions around the world with courage and dedication. 
   I am confident that enactment of this conference report will enhance the quality of life for our service men and women and their families, strengthen the modernization and readiness of our Armed Forces, and begin to address newly emerging threats to our security. I strongly urge my colleagues to adopt the recommendations of the conference committee. 
   Mr. President, I especially thank my distinguished friend and ranking member for the cooperation he has given me. This is the 22nd year we have served together in the Senate. We have been partners all these many years. We are proud to have the joint responsibility of the leadership of the committee that tries at every juncture to exert wisdom and decisions reflecting bipartisanship and, as in the famous words of another Senator, we check politics at the water's edge, particularly as it relates to the forward-deployed troops of our Armed Forces. 
   We are proud of that record. We have worked together very well. There was unanimous signing of the conference report which is presently before the Senate. I am very proud of the participation of all members of our committee and, indeed, the superb staffs of both the majority and minority. 
   I join my distinguished colleague, the President pro tempore and former chairman, in recognizing this bill is named for FLOYD SPENCE, the chairman  of the House committee. Chairman SPENCE has served many years. He was a World War II veteran in the Navy and rose to the rank of captain. He has had a distinguished public service record in the United States. It is most fitting that this bill be named in his honor. 
   Mr. President, I see the presence of our distinguished colleague from Alabama. Perhaps he would like to follow the Senator from Minnesota.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, unless the managers, Mr. LEVIN or myself, for some reason need to be recognized. 
   For the second year in a row, the conference report before the Senate authorizes a real increase in defense spending. We have built on the momentum of last year by authorizing $309.9 billion in new budget authority for Defense for the fiscal year 2001, $4.6 billion above the request of the President of the United States. 
   That additional funding over and above the President's request was the result of the actions of many Senators, most particularly our Senate leadership, Republican and Democratic, the Budget Committee chairman, Senator DOMENICI, the ranking member, and others, and I certainly had a strong hand in it. We had a record to take before the Senate to justify that increase, and that record, in large measure, was put together by the Joint Chiefs of Staff; specifically, the Chiefs of the Services who have periodically come before the Congress and, in accordance with the clear understanding between the Congress and the Service Chiefs, to give us their opinions with regard to the needs for their respective military departments and, indeed, the other departments. They give us those professional opinions, even though those opinions at times are at variance with the statements of the President, the Secretary of Defense, and possibly even the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
   The Service Chiefs have come forward repeatedly and told us about the needs over and above budget requests. Therefore, at this time, I specifically thank them for their service and thank them also for standing up for those in uniform and their families in their respective military departments. 
   When you are down there, whether it is an enlisted man or junior officer, looking up to those four-stars, it is a long way, but they are the leaders and they are the most trusted of all, the most unbiased. When it comes to politics, there is not a trace. They are there for the interest of our Nation and most specifically for those who every day follow their orders. I thank them. 
   They confirmed what we all know: That today, the U.S. military is overdeployed and underresourced, resource in terms of people, dollars, procurement, and O&M funds. I will go into detail about them in the course of this debate. 
   Since early 1990, the U.S. military has been sent on operations overseas at an unprecedented rate. At the same time, that force structure was reduced by a third and defense spending was declining every year up until 2 years ago. From the end of the war in Vietnam until 1989, the records of the Pentagon show there were 60 military deployments. 
   From basically 1989 until today, there have been 343 deployments in sharp contrast to the 60 in the preceding period. This represents over a 500-percent increase in our deployments. These statistics tell the story. 
   I am not suggesting in any way that most of these deployments were absolutely essential. Many were in the vital security interests of the United States. As I think quite properly, those contending for the Presidency today, both Republican and Democrat, have pointed out that they will watch very carefully what has been brought to the attention, largely by the Congress and the Chiefs, that they are overdeployed and underresourced. Those are the statistics of this period basically from 1989 until today. 
   While the rate of military deployments is established by the President, the Congress, with our constitutional powers, is continuing to support the Armed Forces by improving the quality of life for the men and women in uniform and their families, and the President, in his budget submissions, has done that. But each time in the past 3 years, the Congress has gone above the President's request to add what we can, given the budget constraints, to further improve the quality of life of the men and women in the Armed Forces, to further increase procurement, to further increase O&M funds because we are highly aware of that theme--overdeployed and underresourced. 
   The conference report takes great strides in the direction to improve, over and above that requested by the President, the quality of life of our men and women and, I may say, the retirees. 
   I am proud of our committee. The Senate Armed Services Committee, the records show, is the first committee in the Senate to recognize the need for revising the health care program for career military retirees. Basically, that is 20 years or, in the case of those who have medical retirement, earlier than 20, but the career military have long been neglected. 
   I want to credit the many organizations and many individuals who approached this chairman, who approached, I believe, every Member of the Senate, and brought to their attention the need for correction. That correction, I am proud to say, is incorporated in this conference report and will be given in great detail. 
   Basically, these retirees, in my judgment, have been entitled to this for many years. In my judgment, they were promised this. At a later point in this debate, I will go into the specifics because I have researched it way back. And now, at long last, in this 2001 appropriations, we make the start for a health care program to have the care for those retirees which they deserve and to which they have been entitled for many years. One of the most important single items in this conference report is this military health care. 
   History shows that our military retirees are the best recruiters of all. One of the direct consequences of our military being overdeployed and underresourced--I will use that refrain over and over again--has been the difficulty in recruiting the needed personnel, the difficulty in retaining the middle grade officers primarily, and the middle grade enlisted, particularly those with skills that are in direct competition with our ever-burgeoning economy in the private sector, who know full well that to get a military person--trained in computers, trained in electronics--they know they get a well-trained, well-disciplined, reliable employee. 
   That is quite a lure to these young men and women who are overdeployed, who suffer so much family separation. There has been an over 500-percent increase in these military deployments in the past decade or so. So that is the reason we are having difficulty in meeting our recruiting goals. 
   But we are beginning to put a fix in to take care of the retirees, so once again they can go out, as they have done in the past--I am not suggesting they withstood recruiting, but certainly some of the incentive has been lacking because they have not been treated fairly--and, once again, they will be in the forward vanguard of recruiting. They are the best recruiters of all. 
   I have to say on a personal note, my father served in World War I. I am very proud of his service and believe he recruited me in World War II by simply saying: It is your duty, son. Although I had very modest service at the conclusion of, the end of that war, fathers like him all throughout the country--and some mothers--were the recruiters long before we got to the recruiting station. 
   The conference report before the Senate fulfills an important commitment of health care for life, as we have determined because in World War II, history shows, and continuing through the Korean war, and indeed through Vietnam, the goal of making that commitment was to encourage service members to remain in uniform and become careerists. Simply put, there was the commitment of health care for life in exchange for their dedicated career service. 
   Let me describe for my colleagues and for our active and retired service  members around the world the legislation in this conference report to authorize health care benefits for Medicare-eligible military retirees and their families. First, our committee, we were in the forward vanguard of this. Then we were joined by the House. But let me describe what we have done in this bill jointly--Senate and House--in this conference 
   report. 
   Military medical care requirements for active duty service members and their families were recognized as early as the 1700s. That is how far back in the history of our country it goes--George Washington's Continental Army. Congressional action in the late 1800s directed military medical officers to tend to military families, whenever possible, at no cost to the family. 
   During World War II, with so many service members on active duty, the military medical system could not handle the health care requirements of many family members. The Emergency Maternal and Infant Care Program was authorized by Congress to meet that need in that wartime period. This program was administered through State health agencies. The earliest reference in statute defining the health care benefit for military retirees was in 1956, when for the first time, the Dependent's Medical Care Act specified that military retirees were eligible for health care in military facilities on a space-available basis. 
   In 1966, a decade later, this act was amended to create the Civilian Health and Medical Care Program of the Uniformed Services, called CHAMPUS, to supplement the care provided in military facilities. This legislation, in 1966, specifically excluded from coverage military retirees who were eligible for Medicare, a program which had been enacted by the Congress 1 year earlier, in 1965. 
   All of us have heard from military retirees who served a full career and in so doing made many sacrifices. Many times the sacrifices these heroic retirees made resulted in serious medical conditions that manifested themselves in a time in their lives when they were pushed out of the military health care program. As a nation, we promised these dedicated retirees health care for life, but at that period we were ignoring that promise of America. 
   On February 23, 2000, I introduced a bill, S. 2087, that provided for access to mail-order pharmaceuticals for all Medicare-eligible military retirees. This was the first time that has ever been done. The legislation would also improve access to benefits under TRICARE and extend and improve certain demonstration programs under the Defense Health Program. 
   On May 1, 2000, I introduced S. 2486, which added a retail pharmacy component to the previous legislation, providing for a full pharmacy benefit for all retirees, including those eligible for Medicare. 
   Now, I staged this purposely because throughout this period I was in consultation with the many veterans groups who came forward in that period, experts who had studied this for a long time and brought to my attention the added requirements in the legislation. 
   While I and other members of the Senate Armed Services Committee were working on this legislation, we were doing so in consultation regularly with those organizations representing the retired military and the Department of Defense. It is interesting, Secretary Cohen had some difficulty, understandably, because of his budget constraints. But I know in his heart of hearts he was concerned about the military retirees, as were the Chiefs. But the time came when the Chiefs had the opportunity to express their opinions, which, as I say, were at variance with those of the Secretary of Defense and, indeed, the President. They told us about the need for this legislation. 
   So while I thank the Senate and most particularly our committee for pioneering this effort for the first time in the history of the Congress, we owe a debt of gratitude to so many others who helped us, gave us the encouragement, and, indeed, showed us the path to follow. 
   On June 6, Senator TIM HUTCHINSON and I introduced S. 2669, a bill that would extend TRICARE eligibility to all military retirees and their families regardless of age. Later that same day, I amended the Defense authorization bill to add the text of S. 2669. This legislation provided uninterrupted access to the military health care system, known as TRICARE, to all retirees. 
   While the Senate bill extended TRICARE eligibility to all military retirees and their families regardless of age, the Defense authorization bill passed by the House of Representatives took a different approach. I respect their approach, but it was different from ours. 
   The House bill expanded and made permanent the Medicare subvention program. Medicare subvention is a program that is currently being tested in 10 sites across the country. Under Medicare subvention, the Health Care Financing Agency of the Department of Health and Human Services reimburses the Department of Defense for providing health care to Medicare-eligible military retirees in military hospitals. 
   There were two significant problems with Medicare's subvention in the judgment of the Senate, and particularly the conferees, when we got to conference. 
   First, the amount in the reimbursement from Medicare to DOD falls well short of the actual cost of providing that care, causing DOD to absorb a loss for each retiree covered by the program. 
   Second, expanding Medicare subvention nationwide would provide access to health care only for those beneficiaries living in proximity to the remaining DOD medical facilities. In contrast, the Senate bill covered 100 percent of the Medicare-eligible military retirees, regardless of where they live. 
   This is important; I emphasize that. Many of the military retirees live under very modest circumstances and have sought places in our Nation for their retirement homes which cost less and, therefore, very often are not co-located with large military facilities and military medical hospitals. They are scattered. It has been a burden on some of those people through the years to travel considerable distances to avail themselves of such medical assistance as was afforded to them prior to this bill. 
   Since the Defense authorization conference began in late July, Senate and House conferees have been working towards the mutual goal of adopting legislation which would provide comprehensive health care to all military retirees regardless of age. I am pleased to announce that the conference report to accompany the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2001 includes a permanent health care benefit for retirees modeled on the Senate's original version to have it permanent. 
   I am delighted that we have honored the commitment of health care for life that was made to those who proudly served the Nation on a permanent basis. 
   I acknowledge the strong participation by the House conferees; indeed, the Speaker of the House and the chairman of the House Subcommittee on Personnel, and Chairman Spence, Chairman Stump. I could mention many who worked on this. That was a subject of some concern in the conference because Senator LEVIN and I, when we had our bill on the floor with provisions which would, in an orderly way, have enabled us to have permanency to this program, were going to be challenged on a point of order. That may occur again today. Frankly, I would rather have it occur today than when this bill first was on the floor 2 months or so ago for various reasons. 
   So the conferees made the decision--a bold one--that they would make this permanent, and we now present that to the Senate. It had always been my intent to make this health care permanent. In fact, when we originally introduced the legislation in February, with the support of many in the Senate, there was no time limit on the benefits contained in the early Senate bills and amendments. I have covered the history of how we have gotten where it is now permanent. 
   The net effect of funding this important program as an entitlement would be similar to funding it from within the discretionary accounts of the Department of Defense. There is little net cost to the Federal Government. Permanently funding the military retiree health care benefit will be seen by retirees, active duty service members, and potential recruits, both enlisted  and officers, as the Nation keeping its commitment to health care for life to military retirees. Those serving today and those who are joining the military will see that the promise of a lifetime of health care in return for a career will be honored by America. 
   Two weeks ago in testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House Armed Services Committee, Gen. Hugh Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and each of the Service Chiefs strongly supported making this benefit permanent and using the accrual account methods of financing. While I respect the right of any Senator to raise a point of order, I am urging my colleagues to consider the benefits of the health care provisions of this bill which are fully justified. We would not want to leave our over-65 military retirees in doubt about our intentions with respect to their future medical care. 
   This issue is on the 1 yard line, ready to be carried across for a touchdown by the Senate, hopefully within a matter of hours. 
   These retirees must make critical decisions regarding their medical insurance plans and medical care. By making this health care plan a permanent entitlement, we are truly fulfilling the commitment made to all those who have completed a career in uniform and to those contemplating a career in the future. 
   I am going to yield the floor at this time so as to move along. I will return to my remarks at a later point. 
   I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague. Again, I thank Senator LEVIN for his untiring efforts on our behalf to create this historic piece of legislation.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the annual Armed Forces bill should really become almost an omnibus bill because so many amendments can be attached under the rules of the Senate, which I support. I do not criticize any Member exercising his or her rights under the rules of the Senate to put on bills, subject to a vote, such legislation as they deem appropriate. 
   There are other rules that preclude that in certain areas, but in this instance we had a freestanding, amendable piece of legislation on the floor. Senator KENNEDY courteously informed me, the ranking member, and others that he was going to raise the issue of what is generically referred to as the hate crimes legislation. Senator HATCH likewise said he had a version and he was going to put it before the Senate. Both Senators brought those bills. Both bills passed. Both bills went to conference as a part of the Senate bill. 
   My decision, as chairman of the conference, was made to drop those pieces of legislation--both of them; Senator KENNEDY's bill, Senator HATCH's bill--because I looked upon it as my duty to get this bill passed and enacted into law. That is my principal responsibility as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, working with my ranking member and other members of the committee. 
   I have been here 22 years. I understand Senators quite well. I respect their rights, and I know when they speak with sincerity. I was advised, not by one, not by two, but by many Senators on both sides of this issue, of the gravity of the issue and the seriousness of the issue. It was made clear to me that if this legislation--either Senator KENNEDY's bill or Senator HATCH's bill--were left in the conference report, in all likelihood we would have a series of filibusters. And given the very short period of time which is remaining in this session--even though we have been active as a committee and got the bill timely to the Senate; even though we were on the floor for weeks intermittently, having to have it laid aside--we are here in the final hours of this session of this Congress. If we do not act on this bill tonight, and if we do not pass this bill tonight, it is questionable whether the leadership will find additional time for consideration. And, as we say, it may be that pieces of it would be put into some appropriations bills or a CR or something--some parts--but much of it could well be lost, unless this conference report is enacted. So I made the decision. I take full responsibility for the decision of urging the conferees to drop this legislation. 
   My distinguished colleague, the ranking member of the committee, I presume, will address the 
   Senate in a moment on this point. Exercising his rights in a very courteous way, he said he wished for me to convene the full Committee on Armed Services and have a vote: That we did. By a narrow margin, my recommendation was sustained by the full committee, I might add, in a bipartisan exchange of votes. 
   So that is the history as to why this legislation was dropped, I say to my colleague from Minnesota. I take responsibility. I believed it was necessary that this bill should be passed. On this day when the world is in such a tragic situation, whether it is the violence in the Middle East or the attack on an American ship, all of America expects Congress to do its duty on behalf of the men and women of the Armed Forces, and this is the most important piece of legislation done every year. 
   So I do not regret for a minute the decision I had to make in the face of representations, fairly and honestly made to me, by colleagues on both sides, as to the tactics that would be used if this bill would be brought up in a conference report before the Senate with either pieces of that legislation contained in the bill. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend our distinguished majority leader. This bill had a long and tortuous course through the Senate, but he stood by our side, not only me, as chairman, but the members of the committee from both sides of the aisle, and the Democratic leader likewise. 
   I see the presence of the distinguished Senator from Nevada. On those days when we were on again and off the next, you stood by. Last year, you were the first one to cosponsor the bill on the pay raise, the first one this year to cosponsor the bill on the medical benefits. While you are no longer a member of our committee, having once been one, you have stood with us throughout this whole process. I thank you.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I again thank our distinguished colleague from Georgia.

I thank him for his hard work and his extensive travel to military bases and installations in the United States, as well as abroad.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we should add to that--Senator LEVIN and I--how hard the Senator fought with respect to amendments on the GI bill for portability of the benefits, enabling  the service person to have a quantity of those benefits--whatever fraction might be agreed on in law--to be passed on to a spouse or a child. I supported that and fought that battle with you, I say to the Senator. We did not win. We lost in conference. But, I say to the Senator, we will start that next year. 
   Now I would like to refer to the UC agreement which is governing this debate. I will read from it: That following the debate just outlined--that is basically what we have had to date--Senator BOB KERREY be recognized to make a point of order, and that the motion to waive the Budget Act be limited to 2 hours, equally divided in the usual form. 
   It also states: I further ask unanimous consent that following the use or yielding back of time on the motion to waive, the Senate proceed to vote on the motion and, if waived, a vote occur immediately on adoption of the conference report, without any intervening action, motion, or debate. 
   The one remaining thing is, I intend to fairly--and I am sure my colleague from Michigan does as well--deal with Senator PHIL GRAMM, who unavoidably had to leave the floor. But let us proceed now under this order with the recognition of our colleague, Senator KERREY.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it would be, because I have not yielded back time on the UC. I was just trying to keep this thing moving in an informal way, protecting our colleague from Texas. I would be willing to yield back my 14 minutes. I presume the Senator would be willing to yield back his 59. Because the two of us have time under the debate of the motion of the Senator from Nebraska. So I think we are adequately protected. That would move this forward and shorten the time between now and the vote.

   Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object, I want to clarify, I am not certain at what juncture Senator GRAMM would be recognized. Again, he is unavoidably away from the floor. But we could proceed, presumably under Senator KERREY's motion and my motion that I would make, and really have the vote on that, and then Senator GRAMM could be recognized if he can't be recognized beforehand. 
   So I am prepared to yield back 14 minutes. As I understand it, the Senator from Michigan yields back 59 minutes. Let's have action on that.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I know there are moments in the life of a Senator that they will never forget. This is one I will not forget. I don't have a better friend in the Senate than my good friend from Nebraska. I don't know of any Senator--well, perhaps Senator INOUYE, of course--who has more rightfully earned the respect of this body and, more specifically, the men and women of the Armed Forces for his courageous acts in the field of battle in Vietnam. I was privileged to be in the Navy Secretariat with our recently departed, beloved former Senator Chafee, who was then Secretary when the Medal of Honor was awarded my good friend. 
   I have to say to my friend that, yes, in law, it is not clear about their entitlement, but in every other respect--sometimes the law is silent--these people were, time and time again, told they would have for life their health care. 
   I want to draw a distinction which was not clear in the Senator's otherwise very able presentation. He talked about his service, indeed my service, which was very insignificant compared to his, but we both served in the Navy at different times. I think I have some faint recollection of this, but it was long ago; I won't rest my laurels on that. 
   You went in initially not with the idea of becoming a careerist, and there may have been a point in your career when you did think about staying for 20 years. 
   The people who are entitled under this legislation are the ones who devoted their careers--a minimum of 20 years and often more years of service--to the military. It is not those like myself who served for briefer periods in World War II and brief periods in Korea. This legislation doesn't cover them. It would not cover you, regardless of your injuries which entitled you to other medical care that you received that was service connected. My point is, the person who goes in for one hitch as an enlisted man, one tour as an officer, they are not the beneficiaries under this. It is that class of individuals who, together with their families, have dedicated a career, who have moved, who responded to the call to go overseas many times, in most instances. That is what this legislation is for. I would like to have the Senator comment on that.

   Mr. WARNER. It was intentionally devised that way. When I made reference to the nonmilitary people in this country who are not, of course, eligible because of absence of a career in military service, Congress should be addressing that issue. I know of initiatives time and again to try to do that. Regrettably, it will probably not be done in the waning days of this Congress, but we have an obligation to these people. Do you realize if we had not made this program permanent, we would be casting on these individuals--most of whom are over 65 to 70, and some are medically retired--they would be forced to 
   make a decision to drop their private insurance, which they had to go out and buy? They have to make other decisions because they would not be certain that Congress at some future date would make it permanent. So that is why we had to go down this road. 
   I will yield in a moment. First, I want to show my good friend something that I found. I went out and did some research on this because I have spent endless hours trying to figure out the facts. I have found this recruiting poster for the U.S. Army. Can the Senator read it from there?

   Mr. WARNER. ``Superb health care. Health care is provided to you and your family members while you are in the Army, and for the rest of your life if you serve a minimum of 20 years of active Federal service.'' This is an actual official recruiting document. I daresay there are many others like it from World War II to this date. If you are a young man or a young woman enlisting today and this is printed by the U.S. Army, you believe it.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, if I might reply, I respect the Senator from Nebraska. I associate myself with his remarks that the military did more for him than he gave to the military. That is certainly true in my case. I don't think it is true in his. I think he served with the greatest distinction, and this country is everlastingly in the Senator's personal debt. Certainly, for this humble soul, the military did more for me than I did for it. I have said that on the floor a dozen times. 
   There is living proof of promises made. I have shown you the difficulty facing the aged people over 65 and into their seventies who have to make a decision depending on the vote about to be taken in this Senate. They were made to commit one way or another by their Nation. I think they are deserving, 
   having given their careers, families, spouses, whatever. I urge that Members of the Senate join me in waiving this Budget Act. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, all Senators recognize that we are drawing to a conclusion this session of Congress. We have had an excellent debate. I urge Senators to support my motion to waive. Were this to fail and the Budget Act is not waived, the entire Defense authorization conference report will fail. Conferees will have to be appointed for a new conference. The Senate will appoint conferees and send the bill back to the House. The House will appoint conferees and a new conference will have to be convened. A new conference report will then have to be passed by both the House and the Senate. We will have opportunities next year to readdress this problem. 
   I close by saying, with all due respect to my dear friend from Nebraska, this is the living proof which says for the rest of your life, if you serve a minimum of 20 years active Federal service, you earn your retirement. That is a commitment that has been made by this Nation since World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and continues to be made today. Now it is the obligation of the Senate to confirm the credibility of this country and to give to these people what they have earned rightly. 
   I yield back my time. Have the yeas and nays been ordered?

   Mr. WARNER. The Senate understands these HRSCs are not to be replaced by the new benefits center to be established in Cutler, Maine. Instead, the new Navy Benefits Center will complement the services performed by the eight HRSCs. The conferences believe that the new U.S. Navy Benefits Center will add a new capability which supplements the resources inherent in the existing HRSCs. That is, the new center will not replace the eight existing Navy HRSCs but will enhance efforts to provide information to civilian employees of the Navy. 
   I also want to bring to the attention of my colleagues that there is an error in the Conference Report tables. Three million dollars for this initiative should have been authorized to match the appropriations provided in the fiscal year 2001 DoD Appropriations Conference Report. I have been in contact with the Chief of Naval Operations this afternoon. I have his assurance that the Navy will execute this program as we intended.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I simply want to say to my very dear friend, I ask that I be associated with his remarks. It was a privilege to be on the floor at the time the Senator from Kansas delivered his remarks. In my 22 years in this great institution, the Senate, I have never known a Member of Congress who tried harder to work on personal relationships than my good friend from Kansas. 
   He is so respected in this institution, as he was in the House. To have him stand in tribute to one of our mutual friends of long standing for all of these years I have been in the Senate--I think maybe Herb's 20 years versus my 22 years. Whatever it is, it is inconsequential. I worked with him. 
   I was so pleased to go down to visit his lovely wife and his children. I have seen his children grow, as the Senator from Kansas has, and I was privileged to be at the service with the Senator and some others from the Congress of the United States. What a fine, fine person he was, and most deserving of the outpouring of heartfelt expressions at that memorial service. I spoke to his widow not too long ago. She is a woman of great strength, as are the children, and it will carry on. 
   I would like to work with my colleague and other Members of the House and the Senate at the appropriate time--which I think will have to be next year--to name something related to defense in honor of our most recently departed colleague and friend. 
   I thank the Senator.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might say to my good friend, Herb and I played a game of golf, which he dearly loved. He had his priorities--his family, his church, and work in Congress. He was the only man I played with, as others have, and whom I ever knew of, who could miss a 2-foot putt and still walk off the green with a smile on his face. He always said, well, tomorrow, or the next putt on the green, it will be a better day. But that was the sort of wonderful, even-tempered, absolutely beautiful man he was in terms of his character. 
   I thank my colleague. I have enjoyed these few moments. He loved the Navy. He loved everything connected with the sea and maritime. How many times we heard him give the speech: And I'm the Congressman from the First Congressional District.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, our former distinguished majority leader, Mr. Dole, has headed up, together with others, an effort across America, and indeed from abroad, to raise the funds and otherwise provide for a memorial to be erected in the Nation's Capital in memory of those who served in World War II, and indeed those who were not in uniform but here on the homefront who, in every other respect, supported that heroic effort during that period from the day beginning December 7, 1941, to and including the surrender of Japan in August of 1945. 
   Mr. President, as we all know, World War II was the defining event of the 20th century for the United States and its wartime allies with more than 16,000,000 American men and women serving in uniform in the Armed Forces. Over 400,000 Americans gave their lives for our nation and more than 600,000 were wounded. In addition, countless Americans back home in the  United States organized and sacrificed to give their unwavering support to those in uniform. 
   Today, there are less than 6,000,000 surviving World War II veterans and we mourn the passing of greater than 1,200 veterans each day. 
   Mr. President, this is why the construction of the National World War II Memorial must follow an expeditious and critical path to completion. In 1994, legislation was enacted which approved the location of a memorial to this epic era in an area of the National Mall that includes the Rainbow Pool. 
   Since July 1995, the National World War II Memorial site and design have been subject to 19 public hearings that have resulted in an endorsement from the State Historic Preservation Officer of the District of Columbia, three endorsements from the District of Columbia Historic Preservation Review Board, and most significantly, four approvals from the Commission of Fine Arts and four approvals from the National Capital Planning Commission. In July of this year, the Commission of Fine Arts approved the design of the memorial followed by final architectural design approval by the National Capital Planning Commission on September 21, 2000. 
   Mr. President, it is my feeling that construction of this magnificent memorial, which has received a thorough review and given final approval by all jurisdictional authorities, should begin without delay. It is imperative that this fitting tribute to those brave and patriotic Americans be completed and dedicated while surviving veterans are still alive. 
   I ask my Senate colleagues to support this resolution and allow our World War II veterans, veterans of the most devastating war the world has known, to see and be a part of the memorial they so fiercely deserve. 
   Mr. President, I sought to get the cosponsorship of all those in this body who served in World War II. The ability to do this, time-wise, precluded that, but I am certain that almost all would have joined. Therefore, it is a particular privilege for me to submit this to the Senate. Congressman STUMP will introduce the identical measure in the House of Representatives. 
   Mr. President, I ask that we take action on this resolution.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to General Anthony Zinni, United States Marine Corps, on the occasion of his completion of a successful tour of duty as Commander in Chief, United States Central Command, and his retirement from active duty after 36 years of loyal service. I offer these remarks with great respect for General Zinni, a true American patriot and a Marine's Marine. 
   General Zinni is a remarkable individual, a distinguished combat soldier, and an inspiring, uncompromising leader. During his 36 year military career, General Zinni's intellect, candor, and unshakeable optimism have had a profound, positive influence on the U.S. Armed Forces from the Quang Nam province of Vietnam to the sheikdoms of the Middle East, and a hundred points in between. A life long adventure that began in a small Pennsylvania town on the banks of the Schuykill River has taken him around the world and to the top echelons of military leadership. 
   A first generation American, General Zinni began his service to the nation in 1961. His father, Antonio Zinni, who immigrated from Italy and fought for his adopted country in the trenches of France in World War I, and his mother, Lilla, instilled in General Zinni an unconditional devotion to the principles of American freedom and liberty and a profound respect for military service. On his first day of classes at Villanova University, with the lessons of his parents in mind, General Zinni joined the Marine Corps. From the Augustinians and the Marine Corps Drill Instructors, General Zinni developed an intellectual prowess and professional military acumen that would distinguish him as a ``cut above'' throughout his career. 
   Beginning with two combat tours in Vietnam, General Zinni embarked on a series of assignments that reflect the myriad missions to which the military has been deployed in the latter part of the 20th Century--combat operations, humanitarian operations, peacekeeping and peace enforcement. Following Vietnam, General Zinni participated in humanitarian relief operations in the Philippines and in Northern Iraq. He commanded U.S. military forces in Somalia and also commanded the task force responsible for safeguarding the withdrawal of U.N. peacekeeping forces from Somalia in 1995. 
   In August 1997, General Zinni, recognized as one of the most operationally competent, most experienced and most versatile military leaders in uniform, was selected by the President to be the Commander in Chief of United States Central Command. Following a unanimous confirmation vote by this chamber, General Zinni spent the next three years representing the United States and ensuring the security of U.S. interests in one of the most challenging areas of the world. 
   As many of my colleagues are aware, United States Central Command encompasses a region that includes 25 nations, extending from Egypt and the Horn of Africa through the Arabian Peninsula and Gulf States, to the newly independent central Asian nations and Pakistan. While abundant in cultural, ethnic and religious diversity, these same enriching features are also the source of deep-rooted, historic animosities--animosities within the region and toward the United States. Guided by his imperative to genuinely understand the unique perspective of a society and his desire to work with the people of the region, General Zinni earned the respect and administration of the area's national leaders. There is no question that he was the right man in the right place at the right time. 
   While we acknowledge the long list of General Zinni's accolades, we recognize that the challenges of military life are most successfully accomplished as a team effort. General Zinni's wife, Debbie, and their children Lisa, Tony, and Maria have shared the challenges and rewards of General Zinni's military life. The journey which brought General Zinni to Central Command, the hallmark of his distinguished military career, would not have been possible without the unconditional and loving support of his family. 
   On behalf of a grateful nation, I congratulate you and your family for your service to the Nation, the Armed Forces and to the Marine Corps. Semper Fi! General, as a former Maine, I salute you on the floor of the U.S. Senate.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an exceptional leader in recognition of a remarkable career of service to his country--Admiral Leon A. Edney, United States Navy, Retired. 
   Admiral ``Bud'' Edney has amassed a truly distinguished record, including 35 years of commissioned service in the U.S. Navy uniform, that merits special recognition on the occasion of his retirement as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Retired Officers Association (TROA). 
   Born in Dedham, Massachusetts, he entered the Navy as an ensign in 1957, following his graduation from the United States Naval Academy, and culminated his distinguished naval service with tours of duty as Vice Chief of Naval Operations and as NATO's Supreme Allied Commander and Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Atlantic Command. He retired from active duty in August 1992. 
   Admiral Edney has shown valor and leadership throughout his 35 years of dedicated military service to his country, and has been a positive role model for countless sailors in the process. 
   His dedication to service and excellence has not diminished since leaving active duty, serving as a trustee of the Naval Academy Foundation and the Association of Naval Aviation. For two years, he also held the distinguished Professor of Leadership chair at the U.S. Naval Academy. 
   Admiral Edney was elected to the board of directors of The Retired Officers Association in 1994. For the last two years, he served as TROA's chairman of the board, the position from which he is now retiring. 
   Through his stewardship, The Retired Officers Association continues to play a vital role as a staunch advocate of legislative initiatives to maintain readiness and improve the quality of life for all members of the uniformed service community--active, reserve, and retired, plus their families and survivors. 
   His tenure as chairman of TROA began simultaneously with my chairmanship of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I am pleased to state that these two years have witnessed very substantial quality-of-life enhancements for active, reserve, and retired service members and their families. 
   Admiral Edney has been a strong supporter of the Senate Armed Services Committee's efforts toward improving long-term retention and readiness through a competitive compensation package for active and reserve forces, restoration of lifetime health care for retired personnel and their families, and enhancing protections for the survivors of deceased service members. Under his leadership, TROA has been an invaluable source of information that has proven of considerable utility in the committee's deliberations on a long list of compensation and benefits issues during this extraordinarily productive period. 
   Admiral Bud Edney has been, in every sense of the word, a leader in the military, TROA, and the entire retired community. Our very best wishes go with him for long life, well-earned happiness, and continued success in service to his nation and the uniformed service members whom he has so admirably led and served. 
   As a former Sailor and Marine, I offer Admiral Edney a grateful and heartfelt salute, and wish him ``fair winds and following seas.''

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is unfortunate that James Madison's legacy is sometimes overshadowed by other prominent Virginians who were also founding fathers of the United States. Most Americans can readily recite the accomplishments of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. And while most people can identify James Madison as an important figure in American history, his exact accomplishments are sometimes less well known than some of his contemporaries. As we approach the 250th anniversary of James Madison's birth, I wish to bring to your attention the outstanding contributions he made to the fledgling United States. 
   During the course of his life, James Madison exhibited all the best qualities of a politician and a scholar. As a politician, he served as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, U.S. Secretary of State, and two-term President of the United States. As a scholar, he is associated with three of the most important documents in American history: the U.S. Constitution, the Federalist Papers, and the Bill of Rights. In Virginia, we have paid tribute to James Madison by naming one of our fine state universities after him--James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia. 
   More than any other American, Madison can be credited with creating the system of Federalism that has served the United States so well to this day. Madison's indelible imprint can be seen in the delicate balance struck in the Constitution between the executive and legislative branches and between the states and the Federal government. In addition to his contributions to the Constitution and the structure of American government, Madison kept the most accurate record of the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia of any of the participants. Madison's notes from the Convention are a gift for which historians and students of government will forever owe a debt of gratitude. 
   After the Constitutional Convention, Madison worked toward ratification of the Constitution in two of the states most crucial for the new government: Virginia and New York. He narrowly secured Virginia's ratification of the Constitution over the objections of such prominent Virginians as George Mason and Patrick Henry. He assisted in the New York ratification effort through his contributions to the Federalist Papers. 
   The Federalist Papers, written by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, and John Jay are used to this day to interpret the Constitution and explain American political philosophy. Federalist Number 10, written by Madison, is the most quoted of all the Federalist Papers. 
   As a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Madison became the primary author of the first twelve proposed amendments to the Constitution. Ten of these were adopted and became known as the Bill of Rights. 
   James Madison presided over the Louisiana Purchase as Secretary of State under President Jefferson and prosecuted the War of 1812 as President. He was a named party in Marbury vs. Madison, the famous court case in which the Supreme Court defined its role as arbiter of the Constitution by asserting it had the authority to declare acts of Congress unconstitutional. 
   James Madison was born March 16, 1751, in Orange County, Virginia. Accordingly, I urge your support of the James Madison Commemoration Commission Act, legislation that will recognize the life and accomplishments of James Madison on the 250th anniversary of his birth.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the professional dedication, vision and public service of Mrs. Patty Lewis who will be leaving the staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee at the end of this year to return to the Department of Defense to serve in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs. It has been a privilege for me to work with Mrs. Lewis and it is an honor to recognize her many outstanding accomplishments. 
   I asked Mrs. Lewis to join the staff of the Armed Services Committee last October to assist me and the other Members of the Committee deal with the complex issues of improving the Military Health Care System, TRICARE, and providing health care to Medicare-eligible retired military personnel and their families. She is superbly competent and demonstrated a level of professionalism which far exceeded that of many of her contemporaries. Mrs. Lewis is an expert at cutting through the red tape of the military health care bureaucracy and never losing sight of the fact that taking care of the individual is paramount. Her focus was always on doing the right thing for our service members and their families. 
   Mrs. Lewis has earned a reputation as someone on whom we could rely to provide fresh ideas, detailed research, and practical solutions to complex problems. Her professional abilities and expertise have earned her the respect and trust of her colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in both Houses of the Congress. Mrs. Lewis' ability to clearly see a viable alternative when others could only see the fog of confusion contributed to the success of the Committee on Armed Services in developing the legislation that will, for the first time in history, definitively entitle retired military personnel to the lifetime of health care that they were promised when they were recruited and reenlisted. With Mrs. Lewis' help, we are finally able to fulfill that commitment. 
   Mr. President, initiative, caring service and professionalism are the terms used to describe Mrs. Lewis. Patty Lewis is a great credit to the Senate and the Nation. As she now departs to share her experience and expertise with the Department of Defense I call upon my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to recognize her service to the Senate and wish her well in her new assignment.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to expand the boundary of the George Washington Birthplace National Monument in Westmoreland County, Virginia by allowing the U.S. Park Service to acquire portions of the surrounding property from willing sellers. Previously, on September 28, 2000, I offered S. 3132 to allow the Park Service to acquire one acre of property adjacent to the park. The bill I introduce today will allow the Park Service to acquire 115 acres from willing sellers, including the one acre referenced in S. 3132. I urge my colleagues to support the preservation of George Washington's birthplace. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in the RECORD.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the man who would later become America's first president, George Washington, was born at Popes Creek Plantation on the banks of the Potomac River in 1732. Although most Americans are familiar with his later residence at Mt. Vernon, fewer people know that George Washington's childhood was spent on this sprawling 550 acre plantation in Westmoreland County, Virginia. 
   The Washington family first settled at Popes Creek in 1656 when John Washington, great-grandfather of George Washington, acquired the property. Although he later moved to Mt. Vernon, most historians agree George Washington returned on a regular basis to his birthplace. Located on the property is the Washington family cemetery that is the final resting place for  George Washington's father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. To this day, Washington family descendants continue to live in the area. 
   In 1930, Congress recognized the historic importance of this site to the nation and created the George Washington Birthplace National Monument. The park is truly a national treasure which tells of George Washington's formative years. In addition to providing an excellent example of colonial life, the park contains acres of woodlands, wetlands, and agricultural fields. I am told numerous bald-eagles now call the park home. 
   In this age of rapid development, it is remarkable that despite the passage of two hundred and sixty-eight years, the Popes Creek area is remarkably unchanged since the time of George Washington's birth. The 131,099 annual visitors to the park can still experience a rural, pastoral countryside that George Washington would recognize. Much of the credit for this bucolic atmosphere is due to the efforts of the owners of the private property surrounding the park. They have done their best to avoid developing the property adjacent to the park. But, as these landowners gradually decide they wish to sell their property, I believe the Park Service should acquire the surrounding property to preserve this historic setting for future generations. The alternative is to risk development that could forever scar this beautiful national landmark. 
   Today, I am introducing legislation to expand the boundary of the George Washington Birthplace National Monument by allowing the U.S. Park Service to acquire portions of the surrounding property from willing sellers. As a nation, it is our duty to preserve America's heritage for future generations. I urge my colleagues to support the preservation of George Washington's birthplace.

   Mr. WARNER. Madam President, Sec. 211 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 includes a provision to accelerate the process to deauthorize inactive civil works projects. I am concerned, however, that this provision will have unintended consequences for deep-draft navigation projects. 
   In 1986 the Congress authorized many port improvement projects after a 16-year deadlock with the Executive Branch. At that time, these projects were authorized according to the Report of the Chief of Engineers. Subsequently, with the concurrence of the non-Federal sponsor, elements of these major projects were constructed in phases. For example, in the case of the Norfolk Harbor and Channels Deepening Project, the project authorizes the deepening of the main channels to 55 feet, deepening anchorages to 55 feet and deepening secondary channels to 45 feet. 
   Significant progress has been made to deepen our nation's most active ports. These projects are critical to America's competitiveness in the global marketplace and to securing a favorable balance of trade. Like other major port navigation projects, construction under the Norfolk Harbor and Channels project has occurred in increments or phases. The outbound channel, anchorages and Southern Branch of the Elizabeth River have all been deepened under the current authorization. Work is underway to deepen the inbound channel to 50-feet, and the Commonwealth has fully funded this increment. 
   The remaining elements of the project are still vitally important and wholly supported by the Commonwealth of Virginia. The Port of Virginia is the second busiest general cargo port on the East Coast and the largest port in terms of total cargoes, which include bulk commodities such as coal and grain. The port complex consists of the Newport News Marine Terminal, Norfolk International Terminals, Portsmouth Marine Terminals, and the Virginia Inland Port. 
   In fiscal year 2000, over 12 million tons of containerized cargo moved through the ports. Virginia's general cargo facilities are responsible for more than $800 million a year in commerce and tax revenue. Also, Hampton Roads ranks among the world's largest coal exporting ports--handling more than 50 tons annually. Virginia's ports are one of the few in this country capable of loading and unloading the new generation of container ships. 
   I am concerned that the provision in section 211 relating to separable elements in subsection (b)(2), will deauthorize the 55-foot phases of this project within 1 year. This section fails to recognize that it makes good economic sense, from the federal and state perspective, to construct these large projects in phases.  
   I would ask the Chairman if my understanding of this section is correct?

   Mr. WARNER. I thank my good friend and colleague, the senior Senator from Massachusetts. 
   I send to the desk, on behalf of myself and my colleague Senator VOINOVICH, an amendment. In two or three sentences, the amendment simply does the following: Since 1986, the Senate has operated under a law whereby projects built by the Corps of Engineers, pursuant to the process of authorizing projects, are then, upon completion, carried by the States--the financial burden of the operation and maintenance of those projects. 
   The current legislation along the Everglades--and I am going to vote for the Everglades provision--changes that law by virtue of setting a precedent whereby the Federal taxpayer will pay half the cost of operation and maintenance for the life of the project. 
   Now, with due respect to my distinguished chairman and good friend, Senator SMITH, and others, who have written this legislation, I cannot understand any valid reason for changing a law that has been in effect for 14 years and served this Nation so well for this single project. My colleague from Ohio shares these concerns. That is the purpose of this amendment--to strike only a few words, providing the exception for this particular Florida project, and saying the Florida project will be treated just as all the other projects that have been authorized by the Congress in the past 14 years and presumably in the future. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the clerk. I asked the amendment be read because this is a technical amendment. It clearly strikes the provision which, if left, changes the law that the Congress and the executive branch have operated under for 14 consecutive years. It changes it for this project, and it establishes a precedent that every Member of Congress in the future will have to grasp as he or she advocates their next project in their State. I think that is ill advised. 
   For 14 years, we have had a body of law that has served well regarding the most complicated and very expensive series of programs to take care of needed situations in our country--floods, saving lives, navigation, promoting commerce. We can go on and describe these many projects that each year the Congress considers working with the Corps of Engineers and the executive branch to obtain. 
   All of a sudden, we are going to quietly, with one short sentence, take off the law books the provision which has established that the States have the responsibility for operation and maintenance when these projects are completed with taxpayer money and some cost-sharing formula by the States. I think that is wrong. I see no justification. 
   I support this project. I will vote for it. It is a very important part of America. Indeed, it is shared, although in Florida the benefits are shared by all Americans. I point out regarding the Chesapeake Bay, for years I have advocated, with some success, and with the help of many colleagues, the cleanup and the restoration of that great national asset. That has been in progress for a dozen years. Each year, we get a few million dollars to do it, just a few million here and there, to improve this magnificent estuary serving a number of States on the east coast. 
   All of a sudden, we come along with the romance of the Everglades, and the administration has some idea--and I cannot find any justification clearly in the RECORD--and says do away with 14 years of practice and legislation that has been in effect by the Congress. 
   I say to every Member voting, be prepared to go back home and explain to your constituents why they must continue to pay the full 100 percent O&M for their projects in the last 14 years, and all of a sudden Florida gets a cost sharing of 50-50. Be prepared to go back home and answer that question. My amendment simply restores, preserves, the law as it has been for 14 years. 
   Very interestingly, in 1996 I, as I have for 14 years, served on the Environment and Public Works Committee. I happened to be subcommittee chairman when we considered the Florida Everglades and wrote the initial legislation to get this project underway. I am addressing the Water Resources Development Act of 1996, Public Law 104-303, October 12, 1996. I refer to the following, 110 Stat. 3770:

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before the Senator yields the floor--we served on the Environment Committee for 14 years--I have to bring to the attention of the Senate another project. It is called the Central Artery in Boston. There are those who affectionately refer to it as ``the big ditch'' which our late, highly respected and beloved Speaker of the House, Tip O'Neill, initiated. I went back and checked the record, I say to my friend from Oklahoma. I bear some of the responsibility because I was on this committee at this time. 
   The first estimate for the big ditch was $1 billion. It is still unfinished. We have expended about $7 or $8 billion and the GAO estimate to finish it is $13.5 billion, underlining the importance of getting that chief engineer's report, which has been the law and the precedent of our committee for these many years. I thank the Senator.

   Mr. WARNER. That is the point. In other words, all of that magnitude of money, which was a $451 million shortfall last fiscal year, is for projects done prior to 1986. Since 1986, the States have paid for it and that is existing law. If you fail to maintain a project, a dam or a waterway, what happens? It deteriorates. The cement crumbles, the silt fills in, and it begins to degrade and begins to impact the safety of the citizens who rely on those projects for protection or navigation. 
   This is a very serious program my distinguished colleague brings to the attention of the Senate, and I am so glad that the Senator clearly reiterated my message: It is not a Florida situation; it is all 50 States. 
   When my colleagues vote, bear in mind how that vote affects this year and for years to come your State projects.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my amendment goes to the operation and maintenance, which from 1986 on was 100-percent State responsibility. That is the amendment. The Senator, of course, quite properly is addressing, by way of background, the construction. And there are various formulas for cost sharing on construction. But he points out that they are paying 50 percent versus the 35 percent on the construction allocation of the State. But in fairness, the reason they are paying the higher is that there are some other than environmental projects here. This whole thing goes from Orlando to the tip of Florida. This is enormous. This is over half the State's length; is that correct?

   Mr. WARNER. Thirty-five to forty. I was off 10 percent. I say to my good friend, the reason you go to 50 percent and not 35 is you are covering non-Federal and part of municipal water supplies. There are a whole lot of municipal water supplies that are benefited.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question? 
   I was much taken by my colleague's comment that this is a matter between the Federal Government and the State. Indeed, it is a marriage that every Governor would dream about, and the wedding presents being given are astronomical. Look at the whole project. It is dotted with wastewater projects to clean up the water that comes from the communities before it goes to these estuaries. I can understand that. I can understand that, I say to my other colleague from Florida. But how does that differ from the Chesapeake Bay which has been struggling over a 10-year period to clean up the wastewater from their surrounding communities which goes into the Chesapeake Bay and which affects the striped bass, crabs, and everything else? Who pays for that? The local communities do. 
   The wastewater comes from the various adjacent communities, and why shouldn't this cleanup project be paid for by the local communities rather than this massive public project? 
   I have looked at towns all over Virginia that are struggling to meet the wastewater requirements and paying their local taxes to clean it up before it is distributed into the streams and rivers and lakes in my State. I say there is no difference between my streams and my lakes in the Chesapeake Bay and the magnificence of the Florida Everglades. Yet the Senator is asking the Federal taxpayer to pay for it and changing a law which has served this Nation for some 14 years. 
   That is why you do not have the 35-percent construction cost formula but 50 percent, because of the many projects which are not related to the magnificence of the flora, fauna, birds, alligators, snakes, and so forth, which indeed are very important. They are very important and essential to these projects. 
   Fine, clean up the water, but do it like every other municipality. Have the States pay for it with the local taxes before it is distributed back into the various components of the Florida Everglades. 
   If there are any Senators who wish to reply during the course of the debate, I would be glad to yield. 
   There is an abundance of wedding presents coming with this marriage, I say to my good friend from Florida.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may respond to my friend, I accept  what he is saying. It is just a question of who is going to pay for it. 
   Take, for example, the cleanup of the Chesapeake Bay, which begins way up in Delaware, reaches Baltimore, MD, reaches Washington, DC, and reaches Norfolk, VA. All of the water runoff from those municipalities the local people accept the cost of because it goes into the Chesapeake Bay, which is, as any number of projects, a Federal investment. The Federal taxpayer has put money into cleaning up the Bay. 
   What is the distinction between the water runoff from municipalities into the local streams or the Chesapeake Bay, which is just as important to the people of those communities as are the everglades to the people of Florida?

   Mr. WARNER. I want to reply to my colleague. 
   We love our States equally. I say to the Senator, the Chesapeake Bay is just as dear to our people as are the Everglades to Floridians. The Chesapeake Bay is a national asset--maybe not of the proportions but certainly of equal significance to the Everglades. All of this has been done through the years at a minute fraction of the cost to clean up the bay. Striped bass and crabs are returning and are beginning to live and prosper. We are making some progress. Again, there has been a clear cost sharing by the local communities, which I do not find in this bill. 
   My question to the Senator is, Why did the Congress of the United States in 1996, just 4 years ago almost to the day, October 12, pass a law saying ``operation and maintenance expenses of projects carried out under this section shall be a non-Federal responsibility''? 
   That was 1996, 4 years ago. Why is this now being changed?

   I say to my friend, I don't understand it. The State of Florida has to pay 50 percent rather than 35 percent. I will tell you why. It is because you have so many collateral projects, wastewater and other things. But if that was the problem, why didn't you stick in the committee to the 35 percent and leave the cost sharing as it was and not change the law?

   But one of the interesting things, if I may add for a minute, where are the environmental organizations, the watchdogs who are the first to come up? They are standing by in absolute silence as to the change of this law which they helped us put in place in 1986, and again in 1996. It is just silence across the land because of the romance and the mystique of this magnificent Everglades. 
   I say to those organizations: My little lakes, my little streams in Virginia are just as important. And the people of Virginia are paying to clean up the water going into those streams and lakes, rivers and dams, not the Federal Government.  
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to accommodate the distinguished chairman of our committee to facilitate the vote, which would also accommodate a number of our colleagues. 
   We have had a very good debate. The issue before the Senate is very succinct and simple. We have had a body of law for 14 years. That law, with reference to this specific project, was reviewed in 1996. And explicitly, the Congress, after reviewing it, stated the following: ``The operation and maintenance of projects carried out under this section''--and that section dealt with the Florida Everglades--``shall be a non-Federal responsibility.'' So we are now about to vitiate 14 years of law. 
   I say to my colleagues, you will have to go back and explain to your constituents how all the projects in that 14-year period are now operation and maintenance being funded by the States, and that the budget for the projects prior to 1986 is underfunded by $440 million in this one fiscal year. 
   So I think it is a very bad precedent for this Congress to vitiate 14 years of law, and particularly when it was reviewed specifically with regard to this project just 4 years ago and explicitly written into law that the operation and maintenance would be entirely the responsibility of the State of Florida. 
   I yield the floor and yield back my time.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, throughout the 22 years I have been privileged to be a Member of the Senate, I have worked very closely with our distinguished colleague from Delaware, Senator ROTH, and indeed our  colleague from New York, Senator MOYNIHAN. This has to mark one of their finest hours in the Senate. Senator MOYNIHAN has spoken with me unreservedly on this important issue and it took the strong leadership of our chairman and distinguished ranking member to shepherd this key legislation through the Senate in light of the number of challenges they faced. 
   I hope that not only the constituencies in their respective States but the Nation as a whole recognize the skill with which these two very seasoned and senior Senators have managed this most critical piece of legislation. Passage of this legislation is in the interest of our country economically and in terms of our security--I will dwell on the security interests in a moment--for today, tomorrow, and the future. 
   As we enter this millennium, China, in my judgment, is our natural competitor in economics, and perhaps the nation that could pose the greatest challenges in terms of our national security. I was very much involved, as were other Members of the Senate, indeed our two leaders, in the amendment offered by Senator THOMPSON. I subscribe to so many of his goals. Were it not for a framework of laws which adequately address the concerns of Senator THOMPSON, I would most certainly have supported his amendment. But as our two managers have pointed out, as drafted, that amendment could have imperiled the passage of this legislation. 
   I am pleased to join colleagues today in supporting PNTR for China. I join all Senators who have spoken so eloquently on the question of human rights deprivation in China. Indeed, I have traveled there, as almost every Member of this body has at one time, and have witnessed with my own eyes the human rights deprivation of the citizens of that nation. However, continued isolation, in my judgment, would strengthen the hands of those who inflict the abrogation of human rights on those citizens by restricting the Chinese people's contact with some of our very finest Ambassadors. I am not just speaking of the diplomatic corps. I am talking about the American people, be they traveling for business or to gain knowledge about China. The American people are among the best Ambassadors as it relates to human rights. 
   Our citizens, wherever they travel in the world, most particularly to China, whether it is to conduct business or for pleasure or for other reasons, bring with them the closely held and dearly valued principles of a democratic society, principles of human rights. They are unrelenting in trying to share those principles and impress upon the people of China the value of reshaping their society along the principles of human rights adopted by the major nations of this world, particularly the United States. Therefore, exposing Chinese citizens to many of the ideals that our democratic society is built upon can only help in the strengthening of human rights in China. 
   It is through such contacts, which will be greatly expanded with the passage of PNTR with China, that significant improvements can be made in the human rights situation in China. Not providing the PNTR status for China would also have a significant impact on both U.S. businesses and consumers. 
   China imports 20 percent of the U.S. wheat and timber exports, and they also are major importers of U.S. cotton, fertilizer, aircraft equipment and machinery. China supplies the United States with one-third of those wonderful gifts, particularly at Christmastime, that we share with our children. They have always had a very innovative insight into what the children want and a great deal of what we purchase comes from that nation. Ten percent of our footwear, 15 percent of our apparel, and a large percentage 
   of our electronic products are supplied by China. Without a PNTR agreement, duties on these products might drastically increase and the costs be borne by the American consumer. 
   However, China's accession to the WTO will be a boon to U.S. manufacturers, farmers, and service providers. As a requirement to join the WTO, China has agreed to greatly reduce tariffs across the board. This will in turn open markets in that huge nation, thereby providing American business with great opportunities. 
   Let me take a minute to explain how such a reduction in Chinese tariffs will beneficially impact my State, the Commonwealth of Virginia. In 1998, Virginia's worldwide poultry and product exports were estimated at $101 million. China is currently the second leading market for U.S. poultry exports. Under its WTO accession agreement, by 2004, China will cut its frozen poultry products tariff in half, from 20 percent to 10 percent. The beautiful Shenandoah Valley of Virginia, indeed, along with other regions of the State, are the heartland of our poultry export market. They stand to benefit greatly. 
   In 1998, Virginia's worldwide live animal and red meat exports were estimated at $87 million. Under its WTO accession agreement, by 2004, China will reduce its tariffs 45 percent to 12 percent on frozen beef cuts, from 45 to 25 percent on chilled beef, and from 20 percent to 12 percent on frozen pork cuts, definitely benefiting Virginia's exports in these areas. 
   Virginia's lumber industry is the 13th largest in the Nation. China is the world's third largest lumber importer. Under its WTO accession agreement, China will substantially reduce tariffs on this import, thereby dramatically opening up the market to the American lumber industry. 
   Those are but a few examples of how China's accession into the WTO will provide numerous opportunities for Virginia business, particularly small- and medium-size companies which account for 54 percent of all exports from Virginia to China. 
   I believe it is in the long-term interest of the United States to maintain a positive trade relationship with China. I believe we can use our relationship to foster positive social, civil, and economic changes in China. Isolation tactics will only prevent the United States from having any influence over guiding China towards democratic reform.

   Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague. I will take but a few more minutes. 
   Therefore, I intend to vote loudly and strongly for this measure. 
   In conclusion, I am privileged to work in the Senate in the area of security, military and foreign relations as chairman of the Armed Services Committee. 
   In light of that, I have looked very closely at China. China is pushing many frontiers, whether it is the export of armaments or being involved in some of the most complex and fragile relationships the world over. We need only point out Pakistan and India and how Russia is on one side and China is on the other side. Let's only hope that their work with regard to that tension-filled part of the globe will be constructive and in a way to prevent any significant confrontation between those two nations. 
   Therefore, I think it is important that our military maintain its relationship with the Chinese. Given the tenuous situation with regard to Taiwan, and the strong principles of our Nation in trying to defend and support that democracy, I believe such a dialogue will give us a better opportunity to work on security relationships, whether regarding India and Pakistan, Taiwan or other regions of the world. 
   Mr. President, I think we are on the verge of a very historic moment. I commend the chairman and ranking member for their initiatives and long weeks of hard work. 
   I yield the floor.

   The Corps of Engineers is authorized to repair the Goshen Dam/Spillway system on Lake Merriweather in Rockbridge, Virginia. This dam is classified as a ``high hazard'' dam according to the Federal Dam Safety Guidelines because its failure threatens the downstream community of Wilson Springs. The Corps has completed a Technical Report on the engineering and design specifications for the project's repairs and upgrades.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my frustration over the inability of the Senate to reach a unanimous consent agreement in regard to legislation that addresses the critical shortage of highly skilled workers in the information technology fields. On April 11, 2000, the Senate's Judiciary Committee favorably reported out S. 2045, The American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act, by a vote of 16-2. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this important legislation. Unfortunately, this legislation is now being held hostage because some of my colleagues in the Senate wish to attach unrelated amendments to the bill. 
   There are very few remaining days left in this Congress. Before Congress adjourns for the year, we must pass the remaining appropriations bills, and have them signed into law. In addition, legislation extending Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China, and legislation reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, must be considered. Consequently, there simply is just not enough time for the Senate to debate numerous unrelated amendments on the H-1B visa bill. 
   Mr. President, our country's burgeoning economy has resulted in an extremely low unemployment rate nationwide. While I am proud of our economy, and our low nationwide unemployment rate, there does exist a tight labor market in many fields, especially the information technology fields. One need only look in the classified section of the Washington Post to see how many high-tech jobs are available in Northern Virginia. This tight labor market makes it difficult for the high-tech industry to fill job openings, and this difficulty is compounded by the fact that our American education system, for one reason or another, is not producing enough individuals with the interest and skills for employment in the information technology fields. If these jobs our not filled, our economy will suffer, and these American companies will move overseas to fill their jobs. 
   In 1998, Congress and the President recognized the serious effects that the tight labor market could have on the high-tech industry and our economy. In that year, Congress passed, and the President signed into law, legislation increasing the annual ceiling for admission of H-1B nonimmigrants from 65,000 to 115,000 in fiscal year 1999 and fiscal year 2000, and 107,500 in fiscal year 2001. This 1998 act also imposed a $500 per visa fee to fund training and scholarships for U.S. workers and students. 
   Nevertheless, despite increasing the H-1B ceiling just two years ago, that increase has proved to be woefully inadequate. In 1999, the H-1B visa ceiling was reached at the end of 9 months. This fiscal year, the ceiling was reached 6 months into the fiscal year. The effect of the H-1B ceiling being reached before the year's end is that these jobs will remain unfilled, which in turn will only hurt our economy. 
   The Senate Judiciary's Committee Report on S. 2045 states that the, ``shortage of skilled workers throughout the U.S. economy will result in a 5-percent drop in the growth rate of the GDP. That translates into approximately $200 billion in lost output, nearly $1,000 for every American.'' The Committee cites other studies that indicate that a shortage of information 
   technology professionals is costing the U.S. economy as a whole $105 billion a year. I also found Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony before the Senate's Banking Committee quite compelling. Mr. Greenspan endorsed S. 2045 in response to a question from Senator PHIL GRAMM, and then stated that, ``The benefits of bringing in people to do the work here, rather than doing the work elsewhere, to me, should be pretty self-evident.'' 
   Now, let me state clearly, it is my preference that these jobs in the information technology fields would be filled with Americans. However, due to the low unemployment rate and the lack of unemployed educated high-tech workers, filling the numerous openings in the information technology fields with Americans is simply not realistic. Therefore, to continue to propel our economy forward, we must pass legislation such as S. 2045 to fill these critical positions in our information technology sector. 
   This legislation, though, does more than just increase the number of H-1B visas to temporarily fill the job openings in the high-tech industry that cannot be filled by Americans. This bill contains very important provisions that continue the imposition of a $500 fee per H-1B visa petition. It is estimated that this fee, with the increase in the H-1B ceiling, will raise roughly $450 million over three years. This money will create 40,000 scholarships for U.S. workers and U.S. students, thereby helping them to choose education in these important fields. Our goal should be to fill these American jobs with trained American workers. These provisions of S. 2045 takes us toward that goal. 
   Mr. President, in closing, I cannot overstate how important it is for our country's economy to raise the ceiling on H-1B visas, and to provide funding for the training of Americans to fill these jobs. I implore my colleagues to reconsider their demand for votes on unrelated amendments on this legislation. At this late stage in the Congress, demanding votes on unrelated amendments on this legislation will kill this important bill, leave very important jobs in the information technology sector unfilled, and ultimately, hurt our economy.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to once again introduce a resolution with my colleague from Washington, Senator Murray, to establish October 17, 2000, as the Day of National Concern About Young People and Gun Violence. 
   According to Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, 10 children and teens across the country are killed by firearms each day. This statistic is an alarming one, but, nevertheless, statistics can be so impersonal. We must remember that these 10 children lost everyday are real people. They are children, they are brothers, they are sisters, and they are grandchildren to real people. They are also a lost part of our future as a country. When put in real terms such as this, it is difficult to imagine a more important task facing our great nation than eliminating gun violence among America's youth. 
   We all remember the events in Conyers, Georgia; Littleton, Colorado; Peal, Mississippi; West Paducah, Kentucky; Jonesboro, Arkansas; and Springfield, Oregon, Neighborhoods in these areas have all been home to horrific school shootings. Youth gun violence, however, is not limited to these all too often incidences of school shootings. America has lost thousands of children in what has become the all-too-common violence of drive-by shootings, drug wars and other crimes, as well as in self-inflicted and unintentional shootings. 
   The good news in our fight against youth gun violence is that child gun deaths in America have fallen every year since 1994. Nevertheless, Mr. President, 10 deaths a day is 10 too many. 
   While there is no simple solution as to how to stop youth violence, a Minnesota homemaker, Mary Lewis Grow, developed the idea of a Day of National Concern About Young People and Gun Violence. I believe this idea is a step in the right direction, as do such groups as Mothers Against Violence in America, the National Association of Student Councils, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Parent Teacher Associations, and the American Medical Association. 
   Simply put, this resolution will establish October 17, 2000, as the Day of National Concern About Young People and Gun Violence. On this day, students in every school district in the Nation will be invited to voluntarily sign the ``Student Pledge Against Gun Violence.'' By signing the pledge, students promise that they will never take a gun to school, will never use a gun to settle a dispute, and will use their influence in a positive manner to prevent friends from using guns to settle disputes. 
   Just last year over 2 million young Americans signed the Student Pledge Against Gun Violence. I am confident the number of student's signing this year's pledge will be even greater. Though this resolution is not the ultimate solution to preventing future tragedies, if it stops even one incident of youth gun violence, this resolution will be invaluable. I urge all of my colleagues to join in this resolution to focus attention on gun violence among youth.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the emerging field of bioinformatics uses information technology to analyze the billions of bits of data that create a human or plant genome. The research efforts at Virginia Tech will complement and support efforts by the Department to develop new bioinformatic tools, biological data bases, and other information management tools, which hold the promise of reinvigorating our rural communities through high-technology jobs in agri-biotechnology. This amendment provides $500,000 to support Virginia Polytechnic Institute's (VPI) Bioinformatics initiative.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, during consideration of the 1990 Farm Bill, a provision was inserted granting the USDA Graduate School the ability to enter non-competitive, interagency agreements for the provision of training services to other agencies. The Graduate School pursues and enters into these side agreements with other Federal agencies on a non-competitive basis. The private sector is shut out, unable to bid on these contracts. 
   Section 1669 enables the United States Department of Agriculture Graduate School (Graduate School) to accept non-competitive agreements from federal agencies to provide training and other human resource services. The provision limits--and even discourages--competition in contracting, the cornerstone of fair and equitable pricing in the award of government contracts. 
   Despite its name and 80-year history, the Graduate School is not a part of the federal government. The Comptroller General of the United States ruled that the Graduate School is a ``Non-Appropriated Fund Instrumentality'' (NAFI). NAFIs do not receive budget authority or appropriations from Congress and are supported entirely by fees or prices for their services. Like other NAFIs the Graduate School is not subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulations, the Freedom of Information Act, or other laws and regulations governing the operations of federal agencies. The Comptroller General ruled that the Graduate School, as a NAFI, is not a proper recipient of interagency order from Government agencies for training services. And under law, these orders are only permissible if a commercial enterprise can't provide the goods or services as conveniently or cheaply. 
   Various federal laws do indeed provide preferential treatment for economically disadvantaged firms in the award of government contracts. Under these programs administered and monitored by federal agencies, such as the Small Business Administration, Department of Labor, and Department of Commerce, many small businesses, minority-owned enterprises, and firms in labor surplus areas qualify by meeting established regulatory standards. 
   The Graduate School, however is not economically disadvantaged. The Graduate School earned net profits exceeding $13 million over the past five years. Effective on the close of its 1998 fiscal year on September 30, its net worth was $18.5 million; its aggregate retained earnings (1993-1998) were $13.3 million, and its current asset/liability ratio was 2.01. In spite of this financially advantageous position, the Graduate School pays ``bargain rate'' non-profit postage, receives donated space and services from federal agencies, and pays no federal income tax. 
   Only the Graduate School benefits from the preferential treatment afforded by Section 1669. 
   The Graduate School has government subsidized facilities in Washington, D.C., Chicago, Philadelphia, Honolulu, Atlanta, Dallas, and San Francisco. It offers a range of business, finance and management courses that could be offered by hundreds of local community colleges or private training firms. 
   The Graduate School benefits at the expense of small and large tax-paying businesses and is not selling any commodity they could not provide. Indeed, many large and small-business training enterprises are ready, willing, and able to compete for the Graduate School's share of agency training budgets. 
   Mr. President, competition requires a level playing field. Without it, American taxpayers take the hit. And agencies and taxpayers are not receiving the benefits for quality and pricing that competition provides. In Section 1669 restrictive, narrowly based, preferential legislation undermines proven forces of the market economy to determine fair and equitable prices. Section 1669 of the 1990 Agriculture Act (PL 101-624) must be repealed.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the 211-year history of the Senate, the State of Georgia has one of the richest and most storied legacies. Since the formation of the Senate, and that was in 1789, Georgia has sent to the Senate 62 individuals as Senators. I have had the distinct privilege of serving with 6 of them, including our beloved PAUL COVERDELL. When the people of Georgia elected PAUL COVERDELL to represent them here in the Senate 8 years ago, they sent to Washington a unique, especially talented, and gracious gentleman; a gentleman of the South, I say to those of us who are privileged to come from that region. 
   PAUL began his service to the Nation nearly 30 years ago when he served his Nation in the U.S. Army, stationed in Okinawa, Taiwan, and Korea, and he never stopped in his quest to serve the people. He was truly a public servant. 
   He gave almost half his life to serving the Nation and the State of Georgia. It is no overstatement to say that his presence in public life has made this Nation more prosperous and more secure. He was a leader in the fight against drugs and the fight for better education and the struggle to keep this Nation strong, both economically and militarily. 
   We have a saying around the Senate: There are show horses and workhorses. We know for sure PAUL was no show horse; He was a workhorse. He worked hard and often he worked behind the scenes. He did not seek the headlines. PAUL COVERDELL did not seek the headlines. He would seek results--he wanted to get the job done, let others take the credit--and always results that were in the best interests of our Nation. That was his guide; that was his compass. 
   All of us here, before we cast the first vote, before we discharge the first responsibility, take the oath of office. We solemnly commit ``to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies.'' We commit ``to bear true faith and allegiance.'' We undertake ``to faithfully discharge'' our duties.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to establish a federal commission to join the Commonwealth of Virginia in preparing for the 400th anniversary of the founding of the Jamestown settlement, the first permanent English settlement in the United States. 
   In a little more than six years, America will observe one of its most important anniversaries with the celebration of the Jamestown quadricentennial. On May 13, 1607, nearly five months after setting sail from London, a group of 104 English men and boys selected a site on the banks of Virginia's James River as their new home. Settling Jamestown was a momentous event in American history. 
   While the Spanish founded St. Augustine in Florida in the 1560's and the English attempted to colonize Roanoke Island in North Carolina in the 1580's, Jamestown was America's first successful, permanent European settlement. Jamestown is the birthplace of our nation, and is where representative government in the Americas began. The founding of Jamestown marks the beginning of what Alex de Toqueville described as the United States' ``great experiment'' in democracy. 
   The establishment of Jamestown remains a cornerstone event in American history because of the lasting traditions that the English brought with them, including the legacy of language and common law that have shaped our great republic for decades. 
   Celebrating the 400th Anniversary of Jamestown marks an important opportunity to remember and reflect on how our ancestors established Virginia: how they treated America's original inhabitants, the Indians, and how the slave trade was begun. While injustice is a major part of this historical legacy, it is also the legacy that marked the beginning of our rich cultural heritage that defines the United States today. 
   With the 2007 celebration we have a chance to properly remember a story--too often glossed over--of the ``darker side of the Jamestown legacy'' as one scholar has noted, ``a legacy of slavery; of warfare and conquest; of the displacement and decimation of Native Americans; of damage to the natural environment.'' 
   The history of Jamestown is rich, complex, tragic and inspirational. Certainly, an important part of Jamestown's history is the beginning of the distinct American spirit of exploration and adventure. The Jamestown adventure led directly to the formation of the great American principles of rule of law, religious and political freedom and the rights of man. The establishment of these pillars of American government was, again, unique in the history of man and government. The United States stands today as the world's longest lived, continuous democratic republic in existence today. 
   The Jamestown story is also the story of the beginning of truly global commerce. Not only was the establishment of Jamestown a commercial venture, it was a venture that coincided with an emerging worldwide capitalism. The landing was one of many efforts by primarily western European countries to go beyond a country's boundaries in search of commercially important natural resources. 
   The English came to Virginia looking for economic gain, but found personal freedom. They quickly found that the British model of government was not well-suited to the challenges of the New World. 
   Americans have joined in celebrating Jamestown's founding with major events during the past two centuries, most recently in 1957. These occasions have been marked with parades to an eight-month international exposition. 
   The 2007 Jamestown celebration will allow us to learn from our past as we prepare for the future. It is a national event that deserves our national attention and commemoration. The commission will bring the many talents of noted historians and scholars together with the Commonwealth's plans to fully observe the Jamestown experiment and its lasting contributions to our society.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senate is again considering legislation that will provide, at long last, relief from the marriage tax penalty. 
   The marriage tax penalty unfairly affects middle class married working couples. For example, a manufacturing plant worker makes $30,500 a year in salary. His wife is a tenured elementary school teacher, also bringing home $30,500 a year in salary. If they both file their taxes as singles they would pay 15 percent in income tax. But if they choose to live their lives in holy matrimony and file jointly, their combined income of $61,000 pushes them into a higher tax bracket of 28%. The result is a tax penalty of approximately $1,400. 
   The Republican marriage penalty relief bill eliminates this unfairness without shifting of the tax burden and without increasing taxes on any individual. Middle and low income families would benefit as much as earners with higher incomes. 
   According to the Congressional Budget Office, almost half of all married couples--21 million--are affected by the marriage penalty. Over 640,000 couples in Virginia are affected, according to one study. 
   Most of the tax relief under our plan goes to the middle class. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation's distribution analysis estimates that couples making under $75,000 annually will be the biggest winners. Additionally, the Joint Tax Committee estimates that couples earning between $20,000 and $30,000 will receive the biggest percentage reduction in their federal taxes out of any income level, with couples making between $30,000-$40,000 fairing almost as well.  
   This money belongs to the taxpayers. With a surplus of over $2 trillion, not including Social Security, all taxpayers are entitled to a return of their tax overpayment. In addition, the federal government, through tax policy, should not discourage either parent from staying at home with children. The government should not penalize a family simply because it takes both spouses working outside of the home to make ends meet. Being a stay at home parent should be rewarded. 
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates that taxpayers will send Uncle Sam almost $2 trillion in additional surplus taxes over the next ten years--after Congress has locked up 100% of Social Security surplus and paid down the public debt. This proposal gives back to the middle class families just 10 cents out of every surplus dollar they send to Washington. As I have said before, the Federal government should not put a price tag on the sacrament of marriage.

But it requires the strength of the famous Four Horsemen on the football team because this tax is one that probably--I hesitate to say this, but I am going to say it anyway--is more acceptable to the public than any that I know of because they see this tax translated into things they desperately need by way of road improvements, by way of other improvements, and safety improvements. 
   How many times do they drive up and down the highways in my State and we see the projects going on. It delays the traffic and they are irritated. But when they go by, they say: When that is fixed it will be better.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it says in part the following:  
   On behalf of the Nation's elected State and local government officials, we would like to express our strong opposition to this legislation or any other proposals before Congress to repeal or suspend any portion of the Federal gasoline tax.  
   Further down in the letter:  
   It is our understanding that the amendment being proposed ..... would suspend the 18.4 cents Federal gasoline tax for 150 days. As a result of this loss of revenue, States and localities could face significant reductions in spending for transportation planning, highway and bridge repairs, public transit, bike and pedestrian facilities, clean air programs, and most importantly highway safety. Also, without a predictable flow of Federal highway, transit, and aviation funding, States and localities may face more difficulty in long-term transportation planning which will cause projects to be more costly and result in safety concerns.  
   We learned through the many years that I have been associated with this issue on the Environment and Public Works Committee that planning goes forward years in advance. Contracts are let based on a source of these funds guaranteed by Congress and Federal law. These contractors are not going to risk their working capital. Employers are not going to risk trying to hire additional people if there remains this constant uncertainty around this tax. 
   I hope the Senate stands with the Four Horsemen, and that we will be able to protect, once again, the interests of the people with the tax which probably is the least objectionable of all taxes. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor Admiral Jay L. Johnson, United States Navy, our 26th Chief of Naval Operations, as he prepares to turn over the helm of the United States Navy to his successor. 
   As former Secretary of the Navy and a member of the Armed Services Committee for 22 years, I have worked closely with every Chief of Naval Operations since 1969. Admiral Johnson, in my view, ranks with the finest of this long line of great Chiefs. 
   Thirty-six years ago, on the 30th of June, 1964, a young Midshipmen Johnson raised his hand on Tecumseh Court at the United States Naval Academy and took his oath of office to support and defend the Constitution. In the years since that day he has devoted indeed all of his great energy and talent to that task. Oceans of water have passed beneath the keels of the ships he has commanded and many men and women have stood proudly on their decks. He has been steadfast in his covenant to this nation and his devotion to those with whom he has served. An illustrious career gives eloquent testimony to his service to our country and his leadership of its Navy. 
   He was commissioned an Ensign upon his graduation in 1968 and, demonstrating exceptional tactical and technical acumen, he soloed in both propeller and jet aircraft within six months, setting the pace for a most impressive future. 
   His first sea duty tour was aboard U.S.S. Oriskany (CVA 34), where he made two combat cruises flying and fighting the F-8J Crusader over Vietnam with the Hellcats of VF-191. He flew the F-14 Tomcat as a Ghostrider of VF-142, a Grim Reaper of VF-101, and as Commanding Officer of the Jolly Rogers of VF-84. 
   Admiral Johnson's follow-on sea tours demonstrated the tactical brilliance and the consensus-building skills that would characterize his tenure as CNO. As Commander, Carrier Air Wing ONE, he planned and coordinated the joint Navy and Air Force air strikes against Libya in response to terrorist acts in Europe. In this same carrier airwing, he successfully integrated the F/A-18C with the F-14, providing a superior day-night combat capability to our forward-deployed carrier battle groups. 
   Admiral Johnson's early shore assignments reinforced his commitment to our Sailors as he served in the Bureau of Naval Personnel, detailing junior aviation officers. His selection to the prestigious Chief of Naval Operations' Strategic Studies Group further cemented his reputation as a Naval Warfare visionary, and marked him as a future leader of our nation's Navy. 
   As a new Flag Officer, Admiral Johnson went back to the Bureau of Naval Personnel, where his profound concern for the well being of our Sailors resulted in dramatic improvements in retention and support of our Fleet Sailors. It is particularly noteworthy that these institutional changes were orchestrated at the same time he was coordinating the Navy's activation and call-up of Reserve Sailors in support of Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm. 
   Back to sea in command of U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt Battle Group, his tactical acumen and diplomatic skills proved key to a more efficient and combat-ready coalition of forces in Bosnian Theater operations. 
   But nowhere was Admiral Johnson's leadership, focus on mission execution, and consensus-building skill more brilliantly demonstrated than in his next assignment as Commander, Second Fleet: Striking Fleet Atlantic and Joint Task Force 120. He simultaneously guided the Eisenhower Battle Group through preparations for its deployment to the Sixth Fleet while serving as the Deputy Commander for Operation Uphold Democracy, which restored the democratically elected government to Haiti. 
   After serving as the Vice-Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Johnson took the helm of our Navy as its 26th Chief. He has exemplified the quiet dignity and honor of that office, ably and wisely counseling leaders at the highest echelons of our Government. His leadership, integrity and foresight have set a true and steady course for the Navy as it transitions into the 21st century. It has been written in ancient annals that ``anyone can hold the helm when the sea is calm.'' This man took the helm of our Navy in heavy seas. Steering by a constellation of four guide stars--Operational Primacy, Leadership, Teamwork, and Pride--Admiral Johnson guided the Navy through the shoals of four tempestuous years, balancing mandated reductions in forces with dramatically increased operational tasking. The Fleet's mission accomplishment in our forward operating areas overseas--at the tip of the spear--was never placed in doubt. And never for a moment did he loose sight of the interests of the men and women of our Navy. 
   Admiral Johnson empowered the Navy's commanding officers by removing unnecessary inspections and burdensome paperwork, and gave these skippers the opportunity to lead and truly command their ships, submarines, squadrons, and SEAL teams. He also led the Joint Chiefs of Staff in calling for much-needed increases in the Navy's budget: Pay Table Reform and the reform of the Retirement Program are resulting in dramatic increases in retention of the Navy's most valuable asset--our Sailors. 
   Admiral Johnson's legacy for the future of Naval Warfare is embodied in his vision of the Navy at sea and ashore. At sea, he has boldly committed his service to build upon the Navy's strategy laid down in ``Forward From the Sea'' and the Marine Corps' ``Operational Maneuver From the Sea.'' He has championed the creation of a Navy and Marine Corps team that will directly and decisively influence events ashore--anytime, anywhere. He has focused the Navy's research, development and investment capital upon improving the Fleet's ability to conduct Land Attack Warfare, Theater Air and Missile Defense, and Organic Mine Warfare. Admiral Johnson has prepared the Sailors and the Fleet to defeat future threats and he has created an information technology revolution at sea, which is dramatically and irreversibly changing the way we employ our Navy in peacetime, crisis, and war. 
   Ashore, Admiral Johnson has re-invigorated the Naval War College, reminding us of the years prior to World War II, when the Navy's war games anticipated nearly every enemy operation. He has conducted Battle Experiments with cutting-edge technology and brought together the best minds of government, academia, business, and the military to create new rule sets for an international security environment characterized by an Internet-driven, global economy. 
   Standing beside this officer throughout his superb career has been his wife Garland, a lady to whom he owes much. She has been his key supporter, devoting her life to her husband, to her family and to the men and women of the Navy family. She has traveled by his side for these many years visiting the Fleet. Her sacrifice and devotion have served as an example and inspiration for others. This team has served our Navy well and we will miss them both. 
   With these words before the Senate, I seek to recognize Admiral Johnson for his unswerving loyalty to the Navy and the Nation. From the beginning, he has  been a model Naval officer who has always done his duty to God and to Country. It has been my personal good fortune, and the Senate's good fortune as a whole, to witness Admiral Johnson's leadership of the finest Navy in the world. 
   The Department of the Navy and the American people have been served well on his watch. The men and women of the United States Navy will not forget the leadership, service and dedication of Admiral Johnson as he has left the Navy better prepared to face the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. 
   We thank him and wish Jay, and his lovely wife Garland, fair winds and following seas as they continue forward in what will most assuredly remain lives of service to this Great Nation.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation to add two areas in my State to the National Wilderness Preservation System. These areas, known as The Priest and the Three Ridges, are located in the George Washington National Forest and comprise approximately 10,500 acres. 
   The Commonwealth of Virginia is blessed with rich geographic diversity. From the Chesapeake Bay in the East to the Appalachian Mountains in the West, residents of the state and visitors alike are able to participate in a broad range of activities not often found in other areas of the country. 
   The Priest and the Three Ridges, in particular, offer unique opportunities for visitors to enjoy scenic views, interaction with wildlife, hiking, fishing, and other types of outdoor recreation. These areas need to be protected from development, and this legislation would ensure that they remain pristine for the use and enjoyment of present and future generations. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to the designation of The Priest and Three Ridges as wilderness through the swift passage of this bill.

   We are here to try to convenience the Senate tonight. After this next vote, under the order, we go to the defense authorization bill. There are only four amendments scheduled in addition to Mr. BYRD's amendment. That would make five. 
   Senator LEVIN and I will accommodate the Members who are going to be debating tonight. If we can get into some short meeting with them, in between these votes right now, perhaps at the end we can announce a UC request sequencing the four amendments. That is my intention.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have in mind, and I think other Members do at this juncture, operating under the unanimous consent agreement reached last night. I amend that unanimous consent to the extent that the senior Senator from West Virginia very graciously is willing to withhold the presentation of his amendment until such time that the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator from Alaska bring up their amendments, which is sequenced, and they indicate to this manager that it will not take more than 10 or 12 minutes. Therefore, I ask that. 
   I further request, following the disposition of the Byrd amendment, Mr. FEINGOLD be recognized; following the completion of his amendment, the Senator from Illinois, Mr. DURBIN, be recognized.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am, indeed, very honored to be a principal cosponsor with my friend and fellow member of the Armed Services Committee on this piece of legislation. This is a very important step. China should not perceive this as a threat. China should not perceive this in any other way than a positive step by the Congress to establish or keep in place this ongoing commission for the purpose of advising the Congress from time to time. 
   We do not have as individual Members--of course, our committees perform oversight, but we do not have an opportunity, on a daily or weekly basis, to monitor the various criteria as set forth in the Byrd-Warner legislation. This commission will, again, be established by the Congress with six Members appointed by the Senate and six Members appointed by the House in a bipartisan manner, and it will be the watchdog to inform us from time to time. 
   China in this millennium will compete with the United States, the world's only superpower, on a broad range of fronts--not just foreign affairs, not just national security, not just trade and economics, but in areas which we cannot even envision tonight, as this new millennium unfolds and this cyberspace in which we are all involved engulfs us day after day. The distinguished Senator from West Virginia pointed out some representations by certain individuals in China about their desire to get more involved in cyberspace for national security reasons. That is one of the important functions of this commission. 
   I am very pleased to join with him because China will be the competitor. The Senate and the House--the Congress collectively--needs its own resource, and I underline that. I commend my distinguished colleague and friend from West Virginia.

   The Senator makes a fairly strong statement indirectly at our former colleague, Senator Cohen, now Secretary of Defense, that he would proceed blindly on this program which is so vital to the security of the United States, assuming, as you say, under the full criteria that the President addressed goes forward--that he would go blindly. Is that a purposeful choice of words directed at this distinguished former colleague who, in my judgment, having been on the Armed Services Committee 22 years and having served 18 or 19 of those years with him, I cannot imagine undertaking the responsibility to oversee a program of this importance and proceeding, as the Senator said, ``blindly.''

   Mr. WARNER. I have to say with all due respect to our three colleagues, opponents on this amendment, indirectly this amendment is suggesting that the Department is not proceeding in a prudent way towards their responsibilities on this program. I have to state that. 
   I do not find any specific fault with some of the requests made but momentarily when I take the floor in my own right, I will have documentation to show that the Welch panel is doing the very things for which the Senator asked. I will point to the fact that the Secretary of Defense has said in previous testimony what he is doing on this program. In fact, I say to the Presiding Officer, being a member of the Armed Services Committee and indeed the chairman of the strategic subcommittee, I asked the Secretary of Defense to come up at his earliest opportunity and report to the Committee on Armed Services. He has agreed to do so shortly after his return from his trip currently in Asia. I thought he addressed the test program, which did, regrettably, end in a failure, I thought in a very courageous and forthright way he addressed that failure to the American public and, indeed, the world.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I may address my colleague on my time and his reply can be charged to his time, I wish to associate myself with the response of my distinguished colleague from Michigan with regard to 2005. He is absolutely correct. The threat exists today. The warhead content is a different subject for a different time, but it is a part of this equation in calculation of time. 
   I am pleased the Senator from Massachusetts said on the floor tonight that he supports going forward with the concept of what we call the Cochran bill which was signed by the President of the United States. That is my understanding of what he said. He did vote for it. But he said collectively, we, and he opened his arms. The record also shows that the other two colleagues on this amendment did not vote for the Cochran bill and were two of the three who voted against it. The ``we'' I think we want to make a little clearer. 
   Here is my problem with this amendment, and I find myself in somewhat of an awkward position. I am defending Bill Cohen, my good friend, the Secretary of Defense of the administration with which my colleagues pride themselves with a long-time association. Fine. 
   Here is what it says on page 4 of the amendment:  
   Independent Review Panel.-- (1) The Secretary of Defense shall reconvene the Panel on Reducing Risk in Ballistic Missile Defense Flight Test Program.  
   There it is, ``shall reconvene.'' 
   Here is the panel to which he was speaking which reported to the Nation on June 13 of this year, and on page 3, General Welch and his colleagues said the following:  
   The IRT believes that design discrimination capabilities are adequate to meet the defined C-1 threat. However, more advanced decoy suites are likely to escalate the discrimination challenge. The mid-course phase BMD concept used in the current NMD program has important architectural advantages. At the same time, that concept requires critical attention to potential countermeasure challenges.  
   Precisely what my colleague from Massachusetts is saying. Let me finish:  
   There is extensive potential in the system design to grow discrimination capabilities. The program to more fully understand needs and to exploit and expand this growth potential to meet future threats needs to be well defined, clearly assigned, and funded now.  
   The concluding sentence:  
   A panel of the IRT is continuing work in this area.  
   When you direct the Secretary of Defense to do something the panel is already doing, I say to my good friends and colleagues, what is this about? That is why we will not accept the amendment. It has some constructive parts to it, but you are directing the Secretary of Defense to do something he is already doing. That is my concern.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. 
   It is important we do have colloquies on this issue. You have hit on a very important point, and that is ``contentious.'' Throughout our long history, through the cold war with the former Soviet Union--indeed, today with Russia--there was always the underlying predicate that the Soviet Union--and now Russia--would handle decisionmaking as it relates to strategic intercontinental ballistic missiles in a responsible way. 
   Up until recently, we knew very little about North Korea, we knew very little about the intentions of the deceased leader, and now the new leader. Some ground has been broken. I happen to be on the cautious side. 
   So let us watch, not just for a month, not just for 2 months, but for over a period of time. It may well be that we can get a different perspective and understanding about the new leadership. But as yet, we cannot, and we have to rely on much in the past.

   Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator SHELBY. I believe we both agree that the National Security Agency should better address its acquisition issues. However, I note the concerns you raise and agree that the report should not be read to mandate treating each individual technology effort within NSA as a major acquisition program. As the chairman of the Intelligence Committee knows, the Department of Defense (DoD) has an extensive effort to develop various technology projects that could ultimately contribute to one or more major DoD acquisition programs. DoD does not manage these individual technology projects as major acquisition programs, despite the fact that they may contribute to successful fielding of a program being managed as a major acquisition program. 
   It was the committee's intent to ensure that each of the major modernization efforts that NSA must undertake will receive appropriate management attention. it was not the committee's intent that individual technology projects that are contributing to those broader efforts be managed as major acquisition programs on a project-by-project basis. 
   I look forward to working with you to ensure that NSA properly manages its acquisition programs.

   Mr. WARNER. For the information of all Senators, at approximately 11:30 a.m. the Senate will immediately begin a vote in relation to the Bennett amendment to the DOD authorization bill. Following the 11:30 a.m. vote, the Senate will proceed to the estate tax bill, and if an agreement cannot be reached, the Senate would then resume consideration of the Interior appropriations bill. A finite list of amendments may have been agreed to with respect to the Interior appropriations bill; therefore, votes could occur throughout the day and into the evening with respect to the Interior bill. 
   Also, the Senate may be asked to resume the Death Tax Elimination Act with amendments in order, if an agreement can be reached between the two leaders. It is hoped that the Senate can conclude the Interior bill and the DOD authorization bill by the close of business on Wednesday. The leadership has announced that the Senate will consider and complete the reconciliation bill during this week's session also.

On our side, as best I can assess, there is one remaining understandable discussion that must take place between Chairman ROTH of the Finance Committee and the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. BYRD.

I would bring to the attention of my colleagues that the Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2000 called for a study of potential additional EW platforms to supplement the EA-6B. The B-52 warrants careful and thorough analysis, and I have been assured by the Defense Department that it is, in fact, being studied. Senator LEVIN, would you care to comment?

Both proponents are now working with the chairman and ranking member of the Banking Committee.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, Senator LEVIN, who has worked with me throughout on this bill. For 22 years we have been together, and our respective chiefs of staff. It has been entirely separate, but we have achieved another milestone. Now it appears to me that we will be able to come to the Senate at a time convenient to our leadership and complete action on the annual Defense authorization bill. I believe this will be 42 consecutive times the Senate has passed this wide piece of legislation for the men and women in the Armed Forces and, indeed, the security of the Nation. I yield the floor.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fine group of Americans who have performed a remarkable service to this country and to our global community. The Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue Team were honored on June 27, 2000 in a ceremony held at The Pentagon for their extraordinary efforts over the past 14 years. The following remarks were delivered on this occasion by Secretary of Defense William Cohen:  
   Senators Warner and Robb, Congressmen Moran and Davis, thank you all for joining us here today and for your tireless efforts on behalf of our men and women in uniform. Deputy Secretary DeLeon; Assistant Chief of Fairfax County Urban Fire and Rescue Team, Mark Wheatly; members of the Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue Team and your families and friends; distinguished guests--including our canine friends; ladies and gentlemen. It is a pleasure to welcome all of our guests, whether they arrived on two legs or on four. 
   Two years ago, I received a call in the middle of the night. It was the tragic news of the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. And I think all Americans--indeed, people the world over--were simply stunned by the unspeakable cruelty and inhumanity of that act, the lives of 267 innocent men and women snuffed out in a single instant of indiscriminate violence. 
   Such moments force us to pause and reflect on the thinness of the membrane that separates this life from the next, on how quickly our hearts can be stopped and our voices can be silenced. And there is the futile wish that we all experience in grief: the wish to turn back the hand of time, to reverse what fate has just dictated. Of course, we cannot. But what we can do is renew our appreciation of the precarious and precious nature of our lives, resolve to use our time and energy to preserve and protect the sanctity of life and freedom, and rededicate ourselves to those principles of humaneness and generosity. 
   Today, we are here to honor and express our thanks to a group of men and women who have taken that ideal to its highest expression, who have made that ideal both a career and a calling. Time after time over the past 14 years, those of you in the Fairfax County Urban Search and Rescue Team have responded to some of the worst disasters of our time: Mexico City, Armenia, Oklahoma City, Turkey, the Philippines, and Taiwan. You have gone into cities whose devastation could vie with Dante's vision of hell. And upon your arrival, there has been no food, no water, no electricity. On every block, horrific scenes of carnage. On every face, confusion, fatigue, and grief. But in every case, you have used your energy, innovation, and skill to make a tangible difference in the lives of disaster victims. 
   Sometimes it has been risky and harrowing, such as in the Philippines, where your team worked more than 9 hours in a collapsed hotel to free a trapped man while ground tremors from the earthquake continued.  
   Sometimes it has been a combination of thoughtful planning and sheer luck, such as when a special camera was able to locate an 8-year-old boy, who had practically been buried alive when his bunk bed collapsed under the weight of a crushed building in Turkey. 
   Sometimes it has been grim and bittersweet, such as when you were able to save an elderly woman in Armenia who was the sole survivor from her building. 
   The rest of us can only imagine the physical and psychological toll that these types of missions take on each of you: day upon day of work without sleep, the chaos of the circumstances, the calls for help and relief that far outnumber your resources and manpower. 
   So we wanted, on behalf of the Department of Defense, to pay tribute to your efforts and say thank you; in particular, for the aid that you provided during our response to the tragedy in Kenya and Tanzania; but more broadly, for your sacrifices and those of your families and friends, who have provided so much support during your deployments. 
   We want to commend you for the message of friendship that you have sent to the people of other nations on behalf of the United States. When you go to a foreign country and raise your tents, with those American flags sewn on top, and use your skill, patience, courage, and compassion to help other people, that sends a powerful message of goodwill to other nations. 
   That is precisely the type of positive example that we in the Department of Defense encourage in our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen when they are abroad. Because it is a very eloquent and enduring statement about what America stands for. 
   I cannot tell you how many times my counterparts abroad have expressed to me their gratitude--to the United States and the American people--for some type of assistance or aid. That type of relationship--including the trust, respect, and appreciation that you earn--is indispensable to diplomacy, stability, and peace. And so we thank you. 
   Finally, I want to congratulate you for the example that you have set for cooperation between the military community and the civilian community. Several of you have already participated in our Domestic Preparedness Program, and your efforts are going to be even more important in the future as terrorism and weapons of mass destruction become greater threats here in the United States. Every time we work with you to get your gear and trucks onto an air transport or fly you to a distant location, our partnership becomes more valuable for you and for us. Ultimately, when the sirens sound the next time, that experience will allow even more lives to be saved. 
   Just across the hall from my office here in the Pentagon there is a painting of a soldier in prayer. It is graced with an inscription taken from the Book of Isaiah. In the passage, God asks: ``Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?'' And Isaiah answers: ``Here I am. Send me.'' 
   Today it is my pleasure to honor an extraordinary group of Americans who, in the dark and decisive hours after tragedies, have always been willing to say, ``Here I am. Send me.'' You proudly represent not only Fairfax County and the state of Virginia, you represent the best of America and the better angels of our nature.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this legislation on behalf of myself and Senator BYRD, believe would establish a commission to examine the Department of Energy; National Security programs, which I believe will help restore the trust of the American people in the nuclear weapons programs of the United States. 
   Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, the Nation learned that two identical computer hard drives, containing highly classified nuclear weapons information, were missing at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. These computer discs are used by the Department of Energy's Nuclear Emergency Search Team (known as NEST) to respond to incidents of nuclear terrorism or other nuclear incidents. 
   The Committee on Armed Services held a hearing, in both open and closed session, earlier this week to hear from the Secretary of Energy on this matter. I must tell my colleagues that I was not satisfied with all the answers provided by the Secretary during that hearing. 
   Sadly, this most recent incident is just one more potentially catastrophic security failure in a series of security failures at our important nuclear weapons labs. I need not remind my colleagues that it was just one year ago this week that Congress was in the midst of an intensive investigation into allegations of Chinese espionage at these very same Department of Energy labs. 
   Under the Rules of the Senate, the Committee on Armed Services is responsible for ``the national security aspects of nuclear energy,'' which includes the DOE nuclear weapons labs. We take this responsibility very seriously. 
   That is why, today, I and Senator BYRD are sending to the desk a bill to establish a congressional commission--with commissioners to be appointed solely by the leadership of the Congress--to examine the efficacy of the current structure of DOE and to make recommendations to the Congress on whether the Department of Energy's national security programs--particularly nuclear weapons programs--should remain as a semiautonomous agency within the Department of Energy, or be moved to the Department of Defense, or possibly be established as an independent agency, as was the case with the Atomic Energy Commission. 
   Let me be clear, this commission will not re-examine or make recommendations regarding the internal structure of the NNSA, which was thoroughly reviewed and debated during the National Defense Authorization Conference last year. Nor will it hinder the new NNSA Administrator's efforts to fully establish his new agency. I am confident that, under General John Gordon's leadership, the internal structure of the NNSA will be sound. To the contrary, the existence of the commission will act as a safeguard against those who would seek to impede General Gordon in carrying out his statutory missions. 
   There is no higher calling--of any Member of this body or any President--than to protect this great Nation from the threats from nuclear weapons. 
   It is my intent to require this commission to report back to Congress in May of next year, to capture both the current and the forthcoming Administrations' views on where these programs should reside.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the managers for their efforts on this very important piece of legislation. They will have my support. 
   Mr. President, I have been associated with this very important piece of legislation providing aid to Colombia since it was first recommended to the Congress of the United States. 
   I commend the administration and, in particular, General McCaffrey. I have had an opportunity, as chairman of the Committee on Armed Services and, indeed, for some 22 years to work with General McCaffrey, particularly during the period of the Gulf War in 1991 when he showed extraordinary leadership as a troop commander in that decisive battle to turn back Saddam Hussein's threats. 
   Now he has volunteered, once again, as an American patriot, to take on this somewhat thankless task of dealing with the almost insoluble problems of the importing into this country of drugs. This is one effort by the general--indeed, the administration, and others--to try to curtail this illegal importation of drugs. 
   I heard a colleague earlier today concerned about: Well, we are not spending enough money here at home. My quick research and consultation with other colleagues indicates that I think some $500 million in taxpayers' money has been added by this Congress to the Administration's budget requests for domestic programs over the past 3 years. This money has been expended in an effort to educate and to, in every other way, help Americans, first, avoid the use of drugs and then, if misfortune does strike an individual and their families, to try to deal with the tragic consequences. 
   So I rise to speak in support of the U.S. counternarcotics activities in the Andean ridge and neighboring countries, as provided for in this bill, and to address the impact of drug trafficking on the stability of the region. 
   The importance of this region to the United States cannot be overestimated. I will give you one example. The region provides the United States with almost 20 percent of the supply of foreign oil. The number is likely to increase with the recent discovery, in Colombia's eastern plains, of reserves estimated at 2 million barrels. The ongoing controversy over the price of gas by the American motorists at this very moment is reason to help Colombia fight this problem. 
   When I say help this nation, I have been privileged to meet with their President in the course of his visits here, and also meet with the Foreign Minister, the Ambassador--the very courageous Ambassador from Colombia to the United States--and many others  from that nation. And, indeed, I have met with private citizens here in America who have had their origin and background in Colombia. So I have talked to a wide range of individuals. 
   This legislation is the right thing. I commend all those, certainly here in the Senate, and particularly those in the current Government of Colombia, as well as the citizens who have worked to foster this legislation. 
   Mr. President, to reiterate I rise to speak in support of United States counter-narcotics activities in the Andean Ridge and neighboring countries as provided for in this bill, and the impact of drug trafficking on the stability of the region. The importance of this region to the United States cannot be overstated. 
   This region provides the United States with almost 20 percent of its supply of foreign oil--a number that is likely to increase with the recent discovery in Colombia's eastern plains of reserves that are estimated at two billion barrels. The ongoing controversy over the price of gasoline that the American motorist is paying only serves to reinforce the importance of this commodity in our everyday life and economy. 
   In sharp and tragic contrast is the threat from this same region posed by illegal drugs to American citizens on the streets of our cities and in the playgrounds of our schools. An estimated 80 percent of the cocaine and 90 percent of the heroin smuggled out of Colombia is destined for the United States. Sadly these drugs have caused, directly and indirectly the death of 50,000 Americans each year and the loss of billions of dollars from America's economy. 
   I am also very concerned about the impact that narco-trafficking in Colombia is having on the democratically elected governments in the region. Many of these countries have only recently transitioned from military dictatorships to democracies--and as recent events have demonstrated--these democracies are fragile. The ``spill over'' effect from the narco-trafficking in Colombia could prove enormously destabilizing to the surrounding nations. 
   Additionally, this region is home to the Panama Canal, a waterway of significant importance to America. With the United States no longer maintaining a permanent military presence in Panama, it is crucial that we be vigilant against any threat as a consequence of drug trafficking our friends in the Panamanian Government and the Canal itself. 
   The President's recent request for a $1.6 billion supplemental aid package to assist Colombia and its neighbors in their counter-narcotics efforts, and the funding which will be appropriated through this and other acts for that purpose, represents an increased U.S. role in the region's difficulties. The rampant violent criminal activities of the various terrorist organizations and paramilitary groups involved in narco-trafficking, including kidnaping and murder, continue to undermine the stability of the democratically elected governments of the region. This is particularly true in Colombia. 
   The proposed aid package, much of which will be provided to Colombia in order to fund portions of the $7.5 billion Plan Colombia, represents one of the most aggressive foreign policy actions of the United States in Latin America in recent history. However, the funding contained in this package is only a small part of our overall commitment to this problem. We already spend hundreds of millions of dollars and deploy hundreds of military personnel to the region every year. In addition to the proposed increase in funding, our support for Plan Colombia will require us to deploy many more military personnel in order to train Colombia law enforcement and military personnel. This is a matter of grave concern for the Senate Armed Services Committee, which has as its primary focus the safety and well-being of the men and women who proudly serve in the Armed Forces. 
   The decision by the Congress to support Plan Colombia and an increased American involvement in the region was not to be an easy one to make. Some have compared the situation in Colombia to Vietnam, and warn against such a U.S. military involvement in an internal matter. Others believe that such involvement is in our vital interest and warn of the consequences if we refuse to engage. 
   On April 4th of this year, the Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing on this issue in order to explore the problem and determine what, if any, assistance was appropriate. Our witnesses at that hearing included Brian Sheridan, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict; Rand Beers, Assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs; General Charles Wilhelm, Commander-in-Chief, United States Southern Command; and Mr. Peter Romero, Acting Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs. 
   Mr. President, at that hearing I asked our witnesses five questions I believe to be essential in making a decision regarding what role the United States should play in this effort:

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, Tony Snow wrote an editorial in the Washington Times. In this editorial he captures the very essence of service to this Nation by those who have worn the uniform of our Nation throughout its history. 
   This weekend, I and others will be attending ceremonies in recognition of those who served in the Korean war. A few days ago, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, the Presiding Officer, I, and other Members of the Senate and the House of Representatives attended a magnificent ceremony in honor of those who served during the Korean war. 
   I was privileged to be in the Marine Corps and served in the 1st Marine Airwing for a brief period in Korea as a communications officer. I have an indelible memory of the sacrifices of many others, those particularly, not myself included, who had to serve in a position in harm's way and paid the ultimate price in life or in many cases in limb, and the suffering of their families. 
   Upon their return home, unlike World War II, in which I served a brief period towards the end, America did not welcome them with open arms. They were returned home from an operation of our military which was indecisive and inconclusive. Those wonderful veterans, these 50-some odd years, at long last deserve the recognition. I think Mr. Snow's article captures it exceedingly well. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD the article to which I referred.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to pay tribute to a patriot, federal servant, and industry leader, Bert M. Concklin. I have worked with him closely for nearly twenty years in his capacity as president of the Professional Services Council (PSC), as a representative of two of the largest employers in Virginia, PSC and Computer Sciences Corporation, and as a driving influence on numerous advisory panels. 
   After more than eight years with PSC, Bert has accepted the role of Business Systems Modernization Executive at the Internal Revenue Service. I admire his courageous willingness to tackle such an obvious challenge and I anticipate that he will, as always, perform exceedingly well. The agency is fortunate to acquire such a talented executive. 
   Throughout his career, Bert has proven himself to be an effective leader and an even-handed advocate. The fact that he has been such a dynamic leader for the professional and technical services industry, which is populated by so many of our nation's most innovative names, has in no small way made our jobs in the United States Senate that much easier. Those companies represent the very heart of our national defense and I know that Bert's dedication originates in large part from a love of our country that I share. Perhaps this trait comes from his days at the United States Naval Academy, but I suspect he had it even before. 
   Bert is no stranger to federal service. During his many years of service with the federal government he has held a number of distinguished positions including, Assistant Secretary and Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration; Deputy Administrator for Policy Evaluation for the Federal Energy Administration; Administrator of Price Controls for the Cost of Living Council; and Director of Information Systems with the Office of Management and Budget. He has also held significant special assignments including membership on the FAA Blue Ribbon Advisory Committee. 
   I wish every success to Mr. Concklin as he starts the next chapter of his truly remarkable career and thank him for a job exceedingly well done.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the situation is as follows: For close to 2 or 3 years, I have been working with my good friend, Senator DODD, on a wide range of issues relating to Cuba. Senator DODD and I have spent a great deal of time studying and, indeed, traveling in relation to this matter. It is our belief that we should, as a nation, remove those legal impediments, to allow food and medicine to go into Cuba. We embarked on the effort to legislate, to have the Senate adopt measures to allow food and medicine to go into Cuba. 
   I remember one of our former distinguished colleagues, Malcolm Wallop, brought into my office some American physicians who had undertaken to travel down to Cuba to see for themselves the plight of these people who have been denied up-to-date, state-of-the-art medical equipment. Cuba has good doctors, but they have not the medical equipment nor the medicine. Anyway, those efforts failed. 
   In the course of the Elian Gonzalez case, it became apparent to me that America--outside of Florida and elsewhere--began to wake up to the relationship between the United States and Cuba and the inability, over 40 years, to succeed in our goal to allow that nation to receive a greater degree of democracy, trade, and other relationships. 
   So Senator DODD and I have at the desk an amendment, the Warner-Dodd amendment, calling for the appointment of the commission. It is essentially the same as the Dodd amendment that is up now. 
   But as a manager of this bill and, indeed, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, I have to decide my priorities. My priorities are that this bill is in the interest of the security of this Nation; $300-plus billion providing all types of equipment for the men and women of the Armed Forces--salary, medical care for retirees. The committee has worked on this bill for 6 months. 
   This issue of the commission to determine the future relationships between the United States and Cuba is not germane. I thought perhaps we could discuss it, so I offered the amendment, and it is now the pending business. But it is clear to me that this piece of legislation could become an impediment for this bill being passed. 
   I have no alternative but to say two things. One, I remain philosophically attuned and in support of the Warner-Dodd amendment, which is at the desk. At some point in time, I hope to rejoin the effort, with others, to try to bring about some of the objectives in the Warner-Dodd amendment. But it has to be withdrawn at this time in order for this bill to move forward and the Dodd amendment to be considered.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss two amendments to S. 2549, the Department of Defense Authorization bill. Specifically, I wish to discuss Senator KENNEDY's amendment and Senator HATCH's amendment, both of which deal with hate crimes. 
   Typically defined, a hate crime is a crime in which the perpetrator intentionally selects a victim because of the victim's actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability, or sexual orientation. 
   Mr. President, I deplore all acts of violence. But, I must say, that I personally find hate crimes to be particularly horrific. Crimes committed against someone simply because of that person's race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, gender, disability, or sexual orientation are, in fact, different types of crimes. 
   In 1998, James Byrd, Jr. was beaten, tied to the back of a pickup truck, and dragged to death along a Texas road. Why? for one reason and one reason only: Mr. Byrd was black. 
   Later in 1998, Matthew Shepard was beaten, tied to a fence in Wyoming, and left to die. Why? For one reason and on reason only: Mr. Shepard was homosexual. 
   These brutal murders shocked me and shocked our Nation. James Byrd and Matthew Shepard were killed not for what they did, but simply because who they were. 
   Our country's greatest strength is its diversity. While it is true that certain people might not approve or might not agree with another person's religion or sexual orientation, or might not like someone's color, we must not, I repeat, we must not tolerate acts of violence that spur from one individual's intolerance of a particular group. 
   Hate crimes do tear at the fiber of who we are in this country. The United States is a country of inclusion, not exclusion. Hate crimes, unlike other acts of violence, are meant to not just torture and punish the victim, such crimes are meant to send a resounding message to the community that differences are not acceptable. 
   In 1990, I was pleased to vote in support of the Hate Crimes Statistic Act. This act required the Attorney General of the United States to gather and publish data about crimes ``that manifest evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity.'' In addition, in 1994, I was pleased to support the Violence Against Women's Act. This important legislation provides funding for many important programs, including funding to prosecute offenders, funding to help victims of violence, grants for training of victim advocates and counselors and grants for battered women's shelters, to name but a few. 
   Presently before the United States Senate is an amendment offered by Senator KENNEDY, entitled the Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act of 2000. This legislation, essentially, would amend current law to make it a federal crime to willfully cause bodily injury to any person because of the victim's actual or perceived race, color, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation or disability. This is a great expansion of federal jurisdiction. Current federal hate crimes law covers race, religion, and national origin so long as the victim is engaged in one of six federally protected activities. The Kennedy amendment would expand federal jurisdiction into certain murder, assault and battery cases and possibly all rape cases. 
   As a United States Senator, I believe that before the Congress passes legislation that would vastly expand federal criminal jurisdiction, we must take into consideration two important factors: the need for the legislation and the constitutionality of the legislation. 
   The horrific murders of James Byrd and Matthew Shepard certainly cause strong emotional feelings that would lead me to believe that the expansion of federal hate crimes law is necessary. However, once the emotional feelings somewhat subside, we are left with the facts. In this case, the facts are not yet present to indicate a need for federal legislation. 
   All states have laws that prohibit murder, battery, assault, and other willful injuries. Most states, 43 I believe, have hate crimes statutes, although these states differ in what groups are covered. Since 1990, with the passage of the Hate Crimes Statistics Act, we have learned about the number of hate crimes that are occurring. These statistics, however, do not show whether states are, in fact, not prosecuting crimes under their hate crimes statutes or are not prosecuting crimes being committed against certain groups of people. If states are prosecuting such crimes, a vast expansion of federal jurisdiction is unnecessary. 
   Moreover, it is also interesting to point out that in some circumstances the Kennedy amendment, if it became law, would in fact result in a weaker punishment for a hate crimes perpetrator than state law. For example, the Kennedy amendment states that where the crime is murder, the convicted defendant shall be imprisoned for any term of years or for life. It does not authorize the death penalty for the most heinous crimes. Two of the three murderers of James Byrd were prosecuted, convicted and sentenced to death in Texas. The third was sentenced to life in prison. 
   In addition to analyzing the need for the expansion of federal criminal jurisdiction, I believe that members of Congress have a duty to evaluate the constitutionality of particular legislation before passing such legislation. I have some grave concerns about the constitutionality of the Kennedy amendment. 
   Congress must have constitutional authority to enact legislation. Article I, section 8 of the Constitution provides a laundry list of Congress' power to enact legislation. One such power in that list is the power to regulate interstate commerce. 
   From the New Deal era to the mid 1990s, the United States Supreme Court broadly interpreted Congress' authority for enacting legislation pursuant to the commerce clause. In fact, for approximately 60 years following the passage of New Deal legislation, the Supreme Court did not overturn one piece of congressionally passed legislation on the grounds that Congress exceeded its authority to enact legislation under the commerce clause. 
   In the past few years, however, the Supreme Court, in the cases of United States v. Lopez and United States v. Morrison, issued opinions that places some serious boundaries on Congress' authority to enact legislation under the commerce clause. Just this year, in the Morrison case, the Supreme Court struck down a provision of the Violence Against Women's Act--a bill that I supported in 1994. 
   The plaintiff in the Morrison case was allegedly raped by three students at a major university in my home state. She brought a civil suit in federal court under a provision in the Violence Against Women's Act that provides federal civil remedies for victims of gender motivated violence. The Supreme Court stated that this provision of VAWA was unconstitutional, holding that the Congress exceeded its authority under the commerce clause in 
   enacting this legislation. 
   Now, I am not going to get intimately involved in a legal analysis of the Morrison case and its application to the Kennedy amendment. It is important, however, to point out one particular quotation in the majority opinion. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice Rehnquist stated ``if Congress may regulate gender-motivated violence, it would be able to regulate murder or any other type of violence since gender-motivated violence, as a subset of all violent crime, is certain to have lesser economic impacts than the larger class of which it is a part.'' 20000 U.S. Lexis 3422, *31 (2000). Based on the Morrison case, I have serious concerns about the constitutionality of Senator KENNEDY's amendment. 
   I believe that a federal role in combating hate crimes is appropriate. I support Senator HATCH's amendment to study the success of States in investigating and prosecuting hate crimes. I also support provisions in Senator HATCH's amendment that will provide assistance and federal grants to States and localities to help assist them in their investigation and prosecution of hate crimes. 
   Let me be clear, if a federal study indicates that states and localities have  not been successful in investigating and prosecuting hate crimes, I will be the first person to join Senator KENNEDY in trying to find a constitutional federal hate crimes solution. At this time, however, I must reluctantly vote against Senator KENNEDY's amendment in light of my concerns about the necessity and constitutionality of this legislation.

   Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I would like to highlight the work of Congressman STEVE KUYKENDALL concerning this important amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. His tireless efforts over the past several months ensured this legislation was not only included in the chairman's mark during the House Armed Services Committee markup of H.R. 4205, but also that it remained unchanged during the debate on the House floor. Although I am confident that we could have resolved this issue in conference, there is always some risk when the House and Senate do not have identical legislation provisions. As a thorough legislator unwilling to take this risk, Mr. KUYKENDALL immediately sought my assistance after the House had acted on the bill to include the proposal in the Senate's defense authorization legislation. By ensuring that the land-for-building swap language is included in both the House and Senate authorization bills, Mr. KUYKENDALL has guaranteed that this innovative solution will appear in the final defense authorization legislation sent to the President for signature. I was glad to work with my colleague from the house to include his language in our bill, and appreciate Senator FEINSTEIN's support on this effort.

   Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I believe we will proceed in accordance with the order. 
   Madam President, I rise this afternoon--14 days since the Senate first turned to consideration of the Fiscal Year 2001 Defense Authorization Bill--to, once again, emphasize the importance of the Senate passing this critical legislation. Our troops deployed around the world, many in harm's way, their families here at home, and all those who have answered the call to duty before them are waiting on the Senate to act. 
   Since June 6 when the Senate first began consideration of the Defense Authorization bill we have had productive debate and dialogue. The Senate has spent four days debating and voting on this legislation, and the Committee has done a great deal of work during the ``down time''--when the Senate was considering various appropriations bills--in clearing many of the amendments that are in order on the authorization bill. We now have a Unanimous Consent agreement for the next day and a half to deal with several pending amendments. In my view, there is perhaps an additional day's worth of debate and votes on the remaining amendments which we believe will be offered to this bill. I urge my colleagues to work with the Committee on any remaining amendments so that we can pass this bill in the Senate and send a strong signal of support to our troops. 
   Mr. President, I think it is useful to remind my colleagues of the amount of hard work that goes into the annual defense authorization bill. This year alone, the Armed Services Committee has conducted 50 hearings related to the defense budget, and spent four days--15 hours--in marking up the bill which is before the Senate. 
   This bill, which we reported out of the Senate Armed Services Committee on May 12th with bipartisan support, is a good bill which will have a positive impact on our nation's security, and on the welfare of the men and women of the Armed Forces and their families. It is a fair bill. It provides a $4.5 billion increase in defense spending--consistent with the congressional budget resolution. But, the real beneficiaries of this legislation are our servicemen and women who will not only have better tools and equipment to do their jobs, but an enhanced quality of life for themselves and their families. We must show our support for these brave men and women all of whom make great sacrifices for our country and many of whom are in harm's way on a daily basis by passing this important legislation. 
   I am privileged to have been associated with the Senate Armed Services Committee and the development of a defense authorization bill every year of my modest career here in the Senate--a career quickly approaching 22 years. The Senate has passed a defense authorization bill each and everyone of those years. In fact, the Senate has passed a defense authorization bill each year since 1961--since the beginning of the current authorization process. This year, the House passed its version of the defense authorization bill by an overwhelming vote of 353-63. It is now the Senate's duty to fulfill its responsibilities on this important legislation. 
   But our responsibility to consider and pass the annual defense authorization bill goes beyond statutory requirements and historical precedent. We must also be aware of the importance of this measure to our men and women in uniform around the world. 
   U.S. military forces are involved in overseas deployments at an unprecedented rate. Currently, our troops are involved in over 10 contingency operations around the globe. Over the past decade, our active duty manpower has been reduced by nearly a third, active Army divisions have been reduced by almost 50 percent, and the number of Navy ships has been reduced from 567 to 316. During this same period, our troops have been involved in 50 military operations worldwide. By comparison, from the end of the Vietnam War in 1975 until 1989, U.S. military forces were engaged in only 20 such military deployments. 
   In an all-volunteer force, where increasing deployments and operations challenge the capabilities of our military to effectively meet those commitments, as well as challenge the efforts of our military to recruit and retain quality military personnel, we must embrace every opportunity to demonstrate our commitment 
   to our military personnel. The National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2001 sends this important message. 
   Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to make my colleagues well aware of the impact of NOT passing The National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2001. 
   With respect to personnel policy, the committee included legislation in the defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2001 to continue to support initiatives to address critical recruiting and retention shortfalls. In this regard, the committee increased compensation  benefits and focused on improving military health care for our active duty and retired personnel and their families. 
   Without this bill, there will be: 
   No extension of TRICARE benefits to active duty family members in remote locations; 
   No elimination of health care co-pays for active duty family members in TRICARE Prime; 
   No Thrift Savings Plan for military personnel; 
   No stipend for military families to eliminate their need to rely on food stamps McCain amendment); 
   No five year pilot program to permit the Army to test several innovative approaches to recruiting; and 
   No transit pass benefit for Defense Department commuters in the Washington area. 
   Without this bill, almost every bonus and special pay incentive designed to recruit and retain service members will expire December 31, 2000, including: 
   Special pay for health professionals in critically short wartime specialities; 
   Special pay for nuclear-qualified officers who extend their service commitment; 
   Aviation officer retention bonus; 
   Nuclear accession bonus; 
   Nuclear career annual incentive bonus; 
   Selected Reserve enlistment bonus; 
   Selected Reserve re-enlistment bonus; 
   Special pay for service members assigned to high priority reserve units; 
   Selected Reserve affiliation bonus; 
   Ready Reserve enlistment and re-enlistment bonuses; 
   Loan repayment program for health professionals who serve in the Selected Reserve; 
   Nurse officer candidate accession program; 
   Accession bonus for registered nurses; 
   Incentive pay for nurse anesthetists; 
   Re-enlistment bonus for active duty personnel; 
   Enlistment bonus for critical active duty specialities; and 
   Army enlistment bonuses and the extension of this bonus to the other services. 
   And, Mr. President, without this bill, the Congress will not meet it's commitment to our miliary retirees and their families to provide a comprehensive lifetime health care benefit, including full pharmacy services. Without this bill, military health care system benefits will continue to be denied to retirees and their 
   dependents who reach age 65 and become Medicare eligible. Military beneficiaries will lose the earned military health care benefit that this bill finally restores to them. 
   The committee has carefully studied the recruiting and retention problems in our military. We have worked hard to develop this package to increase compensation and benefits. We believe it will go a long way to recruit new servicemembers and to provide the necessary incentives to retain mid-career personnel who are critical to the force. 
   Mr. President, on many occasions I have shared my concerns about the threats posed to our military personnel and our citizens, both at home and abroad, by weapons of mass destruction: chemical, biological, radiological and cyber warfare. Whether these weapons are used on the battlefield or by a terrorist within the United States, we, as a nation, must be prepared. 
   Without this bill, efforts by the committee to continue to ensure that the DOD is adequately funded and structured to deter and defeat the efforts of those intent on using weapons of mass destruction or mass disruption would not be implemented. Efforts that would not go forward without this bill include: 
   Establishing a single point of contact for overall policy and budgeting oversight of the DOD activities for combating terrorism; 
   Fully deploying 32 WMD-CST (formerly RAID) teams by the end of fiscal year 2001; 
   Establishing an Information Security Scholarship Program to encourage the recruitment and retention of Department of Defense personnel with computer and network security skills; and 
   Creating an Institute for Defense Computer Security and Information Protection to conduct research and critical technology development and to facilitate the exchange of information between the government and the private sector. 
   Mr. President, I would like to briefly highlight some of the other major initiatives in this bill that would be at risk without the defense authorization bill: 
   Without this bill, multi-year, cost-saving spending authority for the Bradley Fighting Vehicle and UH-60 ``Blackhawk'' helicopter would cease. 
   Without this bill, there would not be a block buy for Virginia Class submarines. Without the block buy, there would be fewer opportunities to save taxpayer dollars by buying components--in a cost-effective manner--for the submarines. 
   All military construction projects require both authorization as well as appropriations. Without this bill, over 360 military construction projects and 25 housing projects involving hundreds of critical family housing units would not be started. 
   The Military Housing Privatization Initiative would expire in February 2001. Without this bill, the program would not be extended for an additional three years, as planned. The military services would not be able to privatize thousands of housing units and correct a serious housing shortage within the Department of Defense. 
   Mr. President, it has been said that, ``Example is the best General Order.'' The Senate needs to take charge, move out, and pass the National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2001. This legislation is important to the nation and to demonstrate to the men and women in uniform, their families and those who have gone before them, our current and continuing support and commitment to them on behalf of a grateful nation.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to offer my strong support for the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act. This legislation removes legal barriers to electronic commerce by establishing important legal standards for electronic contracts and signatures.  
   With the passage of this important legislation, businesses will have the legal certainty that they require and consumers will have the assurance of safety and security that they need. The measure represents a balanced approach. It ensures that protections in the digital world equal those in the paper world. 
   Mr. President, E-commerce offers tremendous benefits for businesses and consumers in terms of efficiency, choice, convenience, and lower costs. The measure will ensure the continued expansion of electronic commerce, the roots and future of which lie in Virginia. It will take electronic business-to-business and business-to-consumer commerce to the next level.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the leadership determined the Senate will return to consideration of this very important piece of legislation. I shall now read the order that was devised by the leaders. 
   Today, the Senate will immediately resume consideration of S. 2549, the Department of Defense authorization bill. As a reminder, there are an overwhelming number of amendments in order. In an effort to complete action on the bill, those Senators with amendments are encouraged to work with the bill managers during today's session. 
   Of course--I think I am joined by my distinguished ranking member--we desire to try our very best to continue to consider only those amendments that are actually germane to the purpose of this bill. That is my hope. Votes are expected throughout the day, and Senators will be notified as votes are scheduled. 
   Senators should be aware that consideration of the Transportation appropriations bill may begin as early as the leadership determines. Hopefully, also, last night we agreed among the leadership to vote on the nominee for the Department of Energy, General Gordon. There will be some announcement to that effect later today.

   Mr. WARNER. This is a subject in which I have been heavily involved, as have others. Senator DODD and I on repeated occasions have put legislation up, I presume comparable to what the Senator has in mind. I clearly associate myself with the Senate's goals. 
   As a matter of fact, on the authorization bill for the Department of Defense, there is a Warner-Dodd amendment which asks for the appointment of a commission, to be appointed by President Clinton, drawing on nominees from not only the President but the majority, the Democratic leader, and others in the Congress, to begin to focus on a broad range of policy considerations with regard to the relationship between the United States and Cuba. So I am highly supportive. I have listened to the Senator enumerate a few Senators, and with a lack of humility I ask my name be included among those who strongly support, as I have now for 2 years, with Senator DODD and others, the lifting of particulars. If we are to make any inroads on the Government in Cuba, it has to be done people to people. What better way than food and medicine because if there is anything that does not have the taint of politics, it should be food and medicine. So I commend my colleague.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I advise my distinguished colleague of the following situation: One of the amendments pending at the desk is a Warner-Dodd amendment which establishes a Presidential commission to examine the overall policy between the United States and Cuba. It is my intention, if the parliamentary situation develops and I can do this, to ask that that amendment be withdrawn. 
   I do that with the greatest reluctance, but I have an obligation as manager of this very critical piece of legislation, the annual authorization for the Armed Forces of the United States, to compromise in my own objectives. One of them, of course, is to support the Senator's goals and to support the establishment of a commission. I have to do that because two colleagues, very respectfully, in a very friendly and forthright manner, told me that if the Warner-Dodd amendment remains on the authorization bill, we can anticipate--and I use the magic words--a prolonged debate on the Warner-Dodd amendment. That prolonged debate, I have to interpret, is a means by which to deprive the ability of the managers to move forward in an expeditious manner on the authorization bill. 
   In recognition of that, I have indicated to my two distinguished colleagues and good friends that I am going to withdraw my amendment, if I can, from a parliamentary standpoint. I can only anticipate those two Members, and indeed probably 
   others, will indicate to the managers that should the distinguished colleague from North Dakota desire to offer that amendment, whether it is today or at some future time that will be available, we can anticipate prolonged debate on the armed services authorization bill. That is as much as I can say at this point in time.

   I commend our distinguished colleague, Senator REID of Nevada. He has been most helpful, and Senator LOTT on my side has supported me in trying to get this bill moving. As a matter of fact, Senator LOTT has given us this time this morning. He has represented to me he will try henceforth to give us time in between appropriations bills, which understandably is the prime function of the Senate.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, momentarily, we will vote on the nomination of a very distinguished citizen of our country. I want to elaborate in these few minutes about his distinguished career. 
   We know he has been nominated to be the first Under Secretary for Nuclear Security, as well as the first administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration at the Department of Energy. We are all familiar with General Gordon's record. He took on many challenging assignments over these years in the Department of Defense and currently is Deputy Director for the Central Intelligence Agency. 
   I would like to go back and give a brief history of the establishment of the National Nuclear Security Administration and the position for which General Gordon has been nominated. 
   The Administration was established by title 32 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2000. That consolidated all of the national security functions 
   of the Department of Energy under a single, semi-autonomous organizational unit. This reorganization represents the most significant reorganization of the Department of Energy in more than 20 years. 
   The Congress did not take this action lightly. We established this new entity in response to a multitude of reports and assessments which called for changes in the Department of Energy's ``dysfunctional'' organization structure. The reports include the 1997 ``120-day study'' issued by the Institute for Defense Analysis, the 1999 Chiles Commission report, and the 1999 Foster Panel report--just to mention a few. However, the most compelling report was issued by President Clinton's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board in June 1999. That bipartisan report stated that:  
   ..... real and lasting security and counterintelligence reform at the weapons labs is simply unworkable within DOE's current structure and culture. To achieve the kind of protection that these sensitive labs must have, they and their functions must have their own autonomous operational structure free of all the other obligations imposed by DOE management.  
   The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board went on to make the following recommendations to the President and Congress, (1) create a new semi-autonomous agency and (2) streamline the management of the DOE weapons labs management structure by abolishing ties between the weapons labs and all DOE regional, field and site offices, and all contractor intermediaries. The committee was very careful to fully implement the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board's bipartisan recommendations, exactly as they were presented to President Clinton. 
   The overarching goal was to establish, for the first time in many years, a clear chain of command for the Department's national security programs. Some disagree with the final product, but I believe we accomplished that goal. It is now time for General Gordon to make this new entity work. 
   I have been trying for some weeks to get this nomination up. Just think: Last year, we passed structural reforms. It was signed into law by the President. And here we are almost a year later--just today--about to confirm the President's nominee to head this new entity. 
   We have vested a considerable amount of authority in the Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration; that is, General Gordon. We trust that he will use it in the best of U.S. national security. 
   I have come to know this fine man very well over the months that I have worked with him in connection with this nomination. I can tell the Senate without any equivocation that I do not know of a more qualified person, a man whose background, whose achievements, whose every step in life better qualifies him, including a character I think that is beyond question, to take on this important responsibility. 
   With regard to some details about him, the general entered the Air Force through the Reserve Officer Training Corps Program in 1968. 
   His early assignments were in research and development and acquisition where he was involved in improving the Minuteman Intercontinental Ballistic Missile--ICBM--and in developing and acquiring the Peacekeeper ICBM. He served with the U.S. Department of State in the politico-military affairs. Later, he commanded the 90th Strategic Missile Wing, the only Peacekeeper ICBM unit. He served in the National Security Council in the areas of defense and arms control, including oversight and completion of START II negotiations. The general then became senior member of the staff of the Secretary of Defense, and later the Director of Operations, Air Force Space Command, responsible for overseeing  and developing policy and guidance for the command's operational missions.

   Mr. WARNER. The reason for the quorum call is to accommodate the chairman of the Subcommittee on Appropriations who will be here, as I understand it, momentarily. 
   Senator LEVIN and I have just had the opportunity to talk on the telephone with the Secretary of Energy. It had been our intention and the Committee on Armed Services is currently scheduled to have a hearing at 9:30 tomorrow morning on the problems associated with the missing disks at the Los Alamos Laboratories. 
   In view of the fact that at least one committee--the Energy Committee, and I think to some extent the Intelligence Committee--are conducting the hearing on this subject now, and basically the same witnesses would be involved, Senator LEVIN and I are of the opinion that time should be given for the Secretary of Energy and/or his staff to make certain assessments, and then we would proceed to address these issues in our committee. 
   I point out that our committee has explicit jurisdiction over these problems under the Standing Rules of the Senate. Nevertheless, other committees are looking at the situation. Secretary Richardson has agreed to appear as a witness before our committee, together with General Habinger, Ed Curran, and the Lab Director of Los Alamos. We will have that group of witnesses on Wednesday morning beginning at 9:30. 
   Senator LEVIN and I wish to notify Senators that we are rescheduling the hearing for tomorrow morning until 9:30 next Wednesday morning. 
   I ask Senator LEVIN if he wishes to add anything.

During the commencement ceremony, at which I had the privilege of also speaking with the Class of 2000, I listened to the eloquent and inspiring speeches of three Virginia Tech students, Class President Lauren Esleeck, Graduate Student Representative Timothy Wayne Mays, and Class Treasurer Rush K. Middleton. Yesterday, I inserted Ms. Esleeck's and Mr. Middleton's speeches into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. I have now obtained a copy of Mr. Mays' speech, and it is my pleasure to ask that a copy of his speech also be printed in the RECORD. 
   Graduation Speech by Timothy Wayne Mays 
   Good morning. I'd like to begin with a brief story that I recently read that illustrates the theme of my message today. A successful business executive and former University of Alabama football player was asked ``what was the first thing coach Paul Bear Bryant said to you and the other scholarship athletes after arriving on campus.'' Surprisingly, at the first team meeting, Coach Bryant asked the group ``Have you called your folks yet to thank them?'' After hearing those words, the players looked confused--most had their mouths open. They looked at one another with disbelief. Apparently, not one of them had anticipated this question. These freshman athletes had been on campus less than 24 hours, but they already had their first lesson in team productivity. No one in the room that day had acknowledged having called home with a word of thanks. What was the essence of the lesson? Coach Bryant followed up his initial question with a second statement. ``No one ever got to this level without the help of others. Call your folks. Thank them.'' [from The Millionaire Mind (Stanley, 2000)] 
   When I was asked to speak at today's graduation ceremony, I kind of struggled with what I wanted to talk about, but preparing this speech gave me the opportunity to reflect on how I got to this point in my life. And the main thing that stood out to me was the significant influence that certain individuals have had on my life. In some way or another, these people gave me a chance or an opportunity that I would not have had otherwise. Now some of these people are, of course, my parents and other family members who have given me a chance by raising me in a safe, loving, and spiritual environment. In the most challenging times of my life, their prayers and support have helped me stand strong, or sometimes, just make it through. 
   In a different way, some of the people who have most significantly influenced my life are friends, teachers, and even just acquaintances that have taken an interest in me for some reason or another. They have given me the guidance and motivation that I need to succeed. As a recent example, when I came to Virginia Tech, I wasn't sure what type of structural engineering work I wanted to do after graduation. Over the last four years, Dr. Tom Murray, in the Civil Engineering department here at Virginia Tech, has helped me find the specific type of work that I will enjoy. I will surely remember his help in the years to come when I wake up every morning happy to go to work. Also, it was Dr. Ray Plaut who took a personal interest in me during my college visit and brought me here to Virginia Tech. Everything that I have accomplished here at Virginia Tech would have been impossible without his help and guidance over the last four years. The truth of the matter is this: Had some of these people not entered my life, I definitely would not be here speaking today. 
   As graduates of this great university, we really do have so much for which to be proud. However, I challenge each of you to take the time to reflect on the individuals who have helped you get to this place in your life, and to personally thank them for taking an interest in you. 
   At this chapter in our life comes to an end, a new chapter begins, and one of the most exciting things to think about is the new people we will meet and the impact they will have on our lives. More importantly though, I hope that we can be influential people in others lives. By always recognizing the impact that other people have had on us, I believe that we can. Thank you very much and God bless.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, America awakened in the last 24 hours to another very distressing disclosure of an alleged breach of security practices at the Los Alamos Laboratory, again relating to what is the greatest threat every hour, every minute of the day to this Nation; that is, from nuclear weapons. We are not here to prejudge any facts at the moment. 
   From the standing rules of the Senate, rule XXV, I read:  
   The Committee on the Armed Services has jurisdiction over national security aspects of nuclear energy.  
   Clearly, this problem falls within our domain. As chairman, in consultation with the ranking member, we will move very swiftly. We will establish a hearing date as soon as we can to develop those facts that can be publicly disclosed and such facts as must remain classified. The Armed Services Committee has dealt with this issue for over a year. In the authorization last year, we had a hard fought debate on this floor about establishing a new entity within the Department of Energy. Indeed, we did it. It was signed into law, and it is ready to go. 
   Our committee also has jurisdiction over the nominees to head this new entity. I refer the Senate to item 1010 in Nominations, Gen. John H. Gordon, United States Air Force, to be Under Secretary for Nuclear Security, Department of Energy. That was May 24. 
   I am writing a letter to the majority leader today and, indeed, to the distinguished Democratic leader, asking that this nomination be brought up immediately. There are allegations that certain Senators think that the law that was passed last year has to be changed. That is a matter that can be brought up before the Senate at any time. But I do not think this Nation should sit 1 minute, 1 hour, 1 day longer on the nomination of this outstanding American, who has impeccable credentials, to take over this whole problem of security in the Department of Energy and is waiting to do so. Let us act on this nomination. I am certain the distinguished majority leader, in consultation with the Democratic leader, will move to see that this is done at the earliest opportunity. I hope it is done today. 
   I will advise the Senate later today with regard to the hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
   This is a matter of serious concern. At the hearing, we intend to call Secretary Richardson, General Habiger, who is the Chief of Security Operations, and Mr. Ed Curran, Chief of Counterintelligence. It may or may not be a counterintelligence matter. We don't want to prejudge the facts. But action is needed by this body, first on the nomination, and then to look into this situation. There is nothing that poses a greater threat to the United States of America, indeed, to our allies, than that from nuclear weapons. 
   It is ironic. This particular alleged security breach is basically in the same location of the previous incident involving Wen Ho Lee, as I understand it, probably the same floor, same corridor. We have testimony in the record, which I will add to the record, of the Secretary of Energy, who has appeared repeatedly before the committees of the Congress. This incident is clearly on Secretary Richardson's watch; let there be no mistake about that. He has repeatedly advised the Congress that he has put in place such regulations and other measures as to protect the United States, protect this Department from such alleged security breaches it faces this morning. 
   Mr. President, I am speaking after consultation, of course, with the majority leader's office and Senators DOMENICI and KYL, who have worked with me on this matter for some 18 months.

   Colonel Les Brownlee is currently serving as Staff Director of the Senate Armed Services Committee, having previously served as a staffer on the Committee and in my Senate office. He is known and respected throughout our nation's military and defense industry. This award--for his lifetime of extraordinary leadership in uniform and with the Senate--is well deserved.

During the commencement ceremony, three Virginia Tech students, Class President Lauren Esleeck, Graduate Student Representative Timothy Wayne Mays, and Class Treasurer Rush K.

The speeches given by these three students were so eloquent and so inspiring, that I felt it was important to share them with my colleagues in the United States Senate and with the people of the United States. 
   To date, I have been able to obtain copies of Ms. Esleeck's speech and Mr. Middleton's speech. It is my pleasure to ask that these speeches be inserted into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   I see the distinguished junior Senator from Massachusetts on the floor. It may well be that we could proceed with that, but I shall defer to my colleague momentarily. 
   SCHEDULE 
   For the benefit of the Senate, we will resume consideration of the Department of Defense authorization bill. At 1 o'clock, the Senate will begin 2 hours of debate on the McCain amendment regarding soft money disclosure. That 2 hours will be equally divided between the sponsors of that amendment and the Senator from Virginia. 
   Following that debate, Senator KENNEDY will be recognized to offer an amendment regarding health care management organizations. Under a previous order, there will be up to 2 hours of debate on the Kennedy amendment, again, with the time equally divided between Kennedy proponents and the Senator from Virginia and/or his designee. 
   Votes will occur at approximately 5 o'clock. Senators should be aware, other amendments may be offered during the morning session. Therefore, votes may occur prior to the 1 o'clock orders. 
   I thank my colleagues. I know the distinguished minority whip seeks recognition on a matter.

   We have the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts who has, under a previous order, 1 hour. I suggest he be the first and lead off this morning, followed by the distinguished Senator from Maine, the chair of the Senate Seapower Subcommittee, and that would be for a period of 30 minutes thereafter. Following that, the distinguished ranking member and I have some 30 cleared amendments which we will offer to the Senate following these two sets of remarks. 
   Then Senator SMITH; as soon as I can reach him, I will sequence him in. 
   I just inform the Senate I will be seeking recognition to offer an amendment on behalf of Senator DODD and myself, and I will acquaint the ranking member with the text of that amendment shortly. 
   Just for the moment, the unanimous consent request is the Senator from Massachusetts, followed by the Senator from Maine followed by a period of time, probably not to exceed 30 minutes, for the ranking member and myself to deal with some 30-odd amendments.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague from Michigan. The Senator and I have been here 22 years, and we have seen a lot of Senators come and go on the Armed Services Committee. When this fine American stepped on to our committee, from the first day he has taken a position for which we all respect and value his guidance and judgment. 
   I will say, this man has a sense of humor. Now, it takes sometimes a little probing to get it out. He always combines his humor with history. He is a great student of military history and those who have been in public life in the past. He livens up the committee meetings and the markups. When things are sort of in a trough, he will inject himself. 
   But this is something he and I have discussed for a number of years. I am very hopeful that we, in the course of the conference, can achieve some measure of these goals, maybe the full measure, I say to the Senator, but I know not. 
   As I have said, with great humility, what modest military career I have had in terms of periods of active duty, both at the end of World War II and during the Korean War, in no way compares to the heroic service that this fine Senator rendered his country. 
   But I will say, the greatest investment America made in post-World War II, in those years when this country was returning to normalcy--they were exciting years, 1946 to 1950--it was the GI bill, the investment by America in that generation of some 16 million men and women who were privileged to serve in uniform during that period, and I was a modest recipient of the GI bill. I would not be here today, I say to the Senator, had it not been for that education given to me. 
   My father had passed on in the closing months of World War II, and my mother was widowed. We were prepared to all struggle together to do the best we could in our family. Among the assets was not the money to go to college. Had it not been for the GI bill, I would not be here today. 
   So you have a strong shoulder at the wheel with this Senator. But I salute you. We are going to do our very best. 
   I thank you for working tirelessly on behalf of the men and women of the Armed Forces. 
   Mr. President, the distinguished ranking member and I are prepared to offer a number of amendments with our colleagues.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let me expand on this and say how much I respect Senator BINGAMAN for bringing this to the attention of the Senate and incorporating this most well-deserved recognition on behalf of these individuals. 
   Again, with brief service in the concluding months of the war, particularly while I was in the Navy, the Marine Corps utilized these individuals a great deal. What they would do is get on the walkie-talkies in the heat of battle and in their native tongue communicate the orders of the officers and noncommissioned officers to forward and other positions, subjecting themselves to the most intense elements of combat at the time. They were very brave individuals. They performed a remarkable service. Here we are, some 56 years after the intensity of the fighting in the Pacific, which began in 1941, honoring them. They were magnificent human beings, and the men in the forward units of combat appreciated what they did. I salute our distinguished colleague. I am delighted to be a cosponsor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, Senator ROTH has worked tirelessly on the issue of revisiting that chapter of our history, the attack on Pearl Harbor. Those listening to this debate will recall that Admiral Kimmel was the Navy commander and General Short was the Army commander. 
   There has been a great deal of controversy throughout history as to their role and the degree of culpability they had for the actions that befell our Armed Forces on that day. This is an action of some import being taken by the Senate. I remember a debate on the floor one night in the context of last year's authorization bill when Senator ROTH sat right here in this chair for hour upon hour when we debated this issue.

   Mr. President, I see our distinguished colleague, a member of the Committee on Armed Services, about to address the Senate on a subject on which I have been privileged to work with him for some time. 
   I must say that in the many years I have been on this committee I have never seen a more diligent nor a more committed effort than that by the Senator from New Hampshire. It has been a matter of personal pleasure to me to work with him and to go back into the history of the U.S. Navy about an event of great tragedy. I think what he is proposing today will be well received by the Senate and, indeed, hopefully by the naval community which have labored with this burden for these many, many years since the closing days of World War II. 
   I remember vividly at the time this particular ship was sunk, the Nation was absolutely shocked and just couldn't believe it. Indeed, a famous Virginian, Graham Clayton, who came along as Secretary of the Navy shortly after me, was the naval officer on board a ship that arrived first on the scene. Graham Clayton used to recount to me his personal recollections about this. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, Senator DODD is recognized as one who has devoted much of his career to Central America. I have traveled with him in years past to those regions of the world, particularly in troubled times. I respect his judgment and I am pleased that he has joined on the Warner-Dodd amendment. It relates to Cuba. 
   Senator DODD and I, in the 105th Congress, put in legislation to allow the sale of food and medicine to Cuba. Unfortunately, it was not accepted. We renewed that effort. That was in the 105th, and we renewed it in the 106th. Unfortunately, it was not able to be accepted by the Senate. 
   This Nation has experienced the Elian Gonzalez case, a most unusual chapter in history. I am not here to describe it because much of that case is clearly in the minds of Americans. But if there is some value out of that case, it has awakened America to the seriousness of this problem between the relationship of our Nation and Cuba. 
   We have had various policies in effect for some 30-plus years and, in my judgment, those policies have not moved Fidel Castro. But Fidel Castro is a leader who does not have my respect, and I think many in this Chamber would share my view, if not all.  
   There are certain ways we can bring to bear the influence of the money of America to try to help a change of the government, and to try to help the people to change their leadership. 
   While we may have put in these series of sanctions over the years with the best of intentions, the simple fact is, there today Fidel Castro reigns, bringing down in a harsh manner on the brow of the people of Cuba deprivations for many basic human rights, deprivation from even the basic fundamentals of democratic principles of government. 
   One only needs to go to that country to see the low quality of life that the people of Cuba have to face every day they get up, whether it is food, whether it is medicine, whether it is job opportunity, or whether there is any certainty with regard to their future. It is very disgusting and depressing. 
   Referring back to the Gonzalez case again, the only point I wish to make is that it has opened the eyes of many in this country to the need for the policies of the United States of America in relationship to Cuba to be reexamined. 
   It is my hope and expectation that the next President will take certain initiatives that will bring our Nation somehow into a relationship where we can be of help to the people of Cuba. 
   All I wish is to help the people of Cuba. We have tried with food and medicine unsuccessfully, although through various pieces of legislation there is in some ways food and medicine 
   going to those people. 
   I remember a doctor. Former Senator Malcolm Wallop brought an American doctor to my office with considerable expertise in medicine. He said to me that the medical equipment available to his colleagues in the performance of medicine in Cuba was of a vintage of 30 years old--lacking spare parts, almost nothing in the state-of-art medical equipment. 
   What a tragedy to be inflicted upon human beings right here so close to America in Central America. 
   In this amendment, Senator DODD and I simply address the need for a commission to be put in place which would hopefully take an objective view of what we have done as a nation in the past with relation to Cuba and what we might do in the future. That commission would then report back to the next President of the United States and the Congress of the United States in the hopes that we can make some fundamental changes in our policy relationship with Cuba which would help--I repeat help--raise the deplorable quality of life for the people of Cuba. 
   I anticipate the appearance momentarily of my colleague from Connecticut. We weren't able to judge the exact time when he would arrive.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, Senator DODD and I wrote President Clinton in 1998--we had 22 Senators join us in that letter--recommending that he establish the very commission that is outlined in this legislation, but for reasons which are best known to him, he decided not to do it. 
   Senator DODD and I recommend this action because there has not been a comprehensive review of U.S.-Cuba policy or a measurement of its effectiveness or ineffectiveness in achieving the goals of democracy and human rights that the people of the United States wanted and which the people of Cuba deserve. We haven't had such a review in 40 years, since President Eisenhower first canceled the sugar quota July 6, 1960, and we imposed the first total embargo on Cuba on February 7, 1962. Most recently, Congress passed the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 and the Helms-Burton Act of 1996. 
   Since the passage of both of these bills, there have been significant changes in the world's situation that warrant, in our judgment, a review of our U.S.-Cuba policy, including the termination of billions of dollars of annual Soviet economic assistance to Cuba and the historic visit of Pope John Paul II to Cuba in 1998. 
   In addition, in recent years numerous delegations from the United States have visited Cuba, including current and former Members of Congress, representatives from the American Association of World Health, and former U.S. military leaders. 
   These authoritative groups have analyzed the conditions and the capabilities on the island and have presented their findings in areas of health, economy, religious view, freedom, human rights, and military capacity. Also, in May of 1998, the Pentagon completed a study on the security risk of Cuba to the United States. However, the findings and reports of these delegations, including the study by the Pentagon and the call by Pope John Paul II for the opening of Cuba by the world, have not been broadly reviewed by all U.S. policymakers. 
   We believe it is in the best interests of the United States, our allies, the Cuban people, and indeed the nations in the Central American hemisphere with whom we deal in every respect. 
   We have a measure that hopefully will come through very shortly regarding a very significant amount of money to help Colombia in fighting the drug wars. 
   We are constantly working with the Central American countries, except there sits Cuba in isolation. 
   We, therefore, believe that a national bipartisan commission on Cuba should be created to conduct a thoughtful, rational, objective--let me underline objective--analysis of our current U.S. policy toward Cuba and its overall affect in this hemisphere--not only on Cuba but how that policy is interpreted and considered by the other Central American countries. 
   This analysis would in turn help shape and strengthen our future relationships with Cuba. Members of the commission would be selected from a bipartisan list of distinguished Americans from the private sector who are experienced in the field of international relations. These individuals should include representatives from a cross-section of U.S. interests, including public health, military, religion, human rights, business, and the Cuban American community. 
   The commission's tasks would include the delineation of the policies--specifically achievements and the evaluation of: 
   No. 1, security risks, if any, Cuba poses to the United States, and an assessment of any role the Cuban Government may play in the international terrorism, or illegal drugs; 
   No. 2, the indemnification of losses incurred by U.S.-certified claimants with confiscated property in Cuba; 
   No. 3, the domestic and international impact of the nearly 39-year-old U.S.-Cuba economic trade and travel embargo; U.S. international relations with our foreign allies; the political strength of Cuba's leader; the condition of human rights; religious freedom; freedom of the press in Cuba; the health and welfare of the Cuban people; the Cuban economy and U.S. economy and business, and how our relations with Cuba can be affected if we changed that. 
   More and more Americans from all sectors of our Nation are becoming concerned about the far-reaching effects of our present U.S.-Cuba policy on U.S. interests and the Cuban people. 
   Establishment of this national bipartisan commission will demonstrate leadership and responsibility on behalf of this Nation towards Cuba and the other nations of that hemisphere. I urge my colleagues to join Senator DODD and myself. 
   I ask the amendment be laid aside.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have listened to the interesting introductory remarks by our two distinguished colleagues, and momentarily we may receive the remarks of another distinguished colleague associated with this amendment. 
   I tell my colleagues straightforward, they have my vote. I support them, but I ask them to address the question of the matter that is pending before the Senate: The annual Armed Forces bill. This is a list that goes back to 1961. The Senate of the United States unfailingly has passed an authorization bill for the men and women of the Armed Forces. I say to my dear friend and colleague, a former distinguished naval officer, this amendment will torpedo this bill and send it to the bottom of the sea where only Davy Jones could resurrect it. 
   To what extent have my colleagues who are proposing this thought about breaking 40 years of precedent of the Senate by sinking the annual authorization bill at a time when the threats facing the United States of America are far more diverse, far more complicated than ever in contemporary history; when the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States are absolutely desperate in terms of pay and benefits to keep them in the jobs as careerists? 
   We now have one of the lowest retention rates ever. There are no lines of young men and women waiting to volunteer to be recruited. This bill goes a long way. This bill helps with the benefits they rightly deserve. For the first time in the history of the United States of America, we have provisions caring for the medical assistance of the retirees. First time, Mr. President. It is the first time in the history of this  country, and add on the ships and the aircraft. 
   I read the Constitution of the United States. What are the responsibilities of the Congress as delineated by our Founding Fathers? ``To declare War.......To raise and support Armies.......To provide and maintain a Navy; To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces........'' 
   That is what this bill does. That is our constitutional fulfillment. 
   Yet my colleagues who are proposing this know full well this bill is subject to what is known as the blue-slip procedure if it leaves this Chamber with this amendment and goes to the House of Representatives. The House will blue slip it, and this bill is torpedoed. 
   I await reply of the sponsors of the amendment to the points I have raised and how it could jeopardize and end the fulfillment of the obligation of the Senate under the Constitution of the United States. I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Arizona and I go back a very long way. When I was Secretary of the Navy, he was incarcerated as a consequence of his heroic service in Vietnam. His father was among if not the most valued adviser I had during the turbulent period of that war when I had the responsibility for the Department of the Navy. That was for over 5 years, 1969 through 1974. 
   I have the highest personal regard for my friend and my colleague, whom I have worked with from the day he returned to the United States of America to be welcomed quite properly as a hero. 
   I know for a fact that he has always foremost in his mind, every day that he draws a breath, every day the great Lord of ours gives him the strength to take up his responsibilities, the welfare of the men and women of the Armed Forces. I find it very awkward to be in a position to be in opposition to my friend, but the rules are quite clear of the House that it is a matter of privilege of the House regarding the constitutional provision as it relates to taxation. 
   It has been a matter of privilege since the inception of this Republic. That privilege is determined by the House in the course of resolutions. If this bill goes over, then they adopt a resolution. We know from consultation there are Members of the House who will absolutely take that resolution to the floor, and there is no doubt that this bill will be blue-slipped, and it will be torpedoed and go to the bottom of Davy Jones' locker. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to ask a question of my colleague. I will charge the time of the entire colloquy to that under my control. 
   As always, the Senator from Connecticut is fair and straightforward, and clearly in his dissertation to the Senate he said, yes, there is a vestige that this blue-slip procedure could send it to the bottom to Davy Jones' Locker, which I accept. 
   I read from Descher's House Precedents, which is the ``bible'' that guides the House. 
   This is fascinating. Listen to the title: ``Invasion of House Jurisdiction or Prerogatives.'' 
   Isn't that interesting?  
   Invasion of the House prerogative to originate revenue-raising legislation granted by article I, section 7, of the Constitution raises a question of privilege of the House.  
   I have studied all of this very carefully. Once that question of privilege is raised, the Senate is left to their interpretation. 
   Colleagues are clearly putting forward this amendment with the best of intentions. I said I would support the amendment in any other venue but this. It does raise it, and the House will not allow it. I can recite dozens of precedents. A year or two ago, they sent a blue slip to us on S. 4, the thrift savings accounts for sailors, soldiers, and marines. 
   I am saying to my dear friend: Why should we take the risk, given the few legislative days left, and given all the work? It is interesting. Our committee has had 50 committee hearings and 11 markup sessions. That is a year's work by 20-plus members of our committee and by the staff, paid for by the Senate, out of taxpayers' funds. All of that is for naught if this bill goes down. It would be the first time in 40 years. 
   I say to my colleagues: No matter how strongly you feel about the merits of this bill, consider our own constitutional responsibility to provide under the Constitution for the men and women of the Armed Forces. 
   I say to my colleague: I would like to know what his reasoning is to take this risk. The Senator from Connecticut is not known as a risk taker.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we normally rotate and I was prepared so to do. Does the Senator wish to speak? If not, I will ask my colleague from Kentucky some technical questions on my time. I yield myself such time as I need. 
   There are several technical issues relating to this amendment. 
   I say to colleagues, 527 has been on the books since 1975 and here we are dealing with it today:  
   Organizations presently exempt from tax on exempt function income, which includes contributions for political purposes.  
   The McCain amendment would lift this exemption for 527 organizations which do not provide certain information to the Secretary of the Treasury. Thus, a 527 organization which elects not to disclose would be taxed. 
   So it is a revenue measure. There is no doubt about it. It would be taxed on previously exempt income, thus raising revenue. I do not know what more clear example can be made, how this thing will be blue-slipped by the House. The Senate is invading. 
   I yield to the Senator from Kentucky.

Under the order, there will be a total of 90 minutes on the Kerrey amendment regarding strategic forces, and the Warner second-degree amendment. Following that debate, there will be up to 2 hours of debate on the Johnson and Warner amendments regarding CHAMPUS and TRICARE. After the use or yielding back of that time, there will be up to four votes on the pending amendments. Therefore, Senators can expect votes to begin not later than 1 p.m. 
   Those Senators who intend to offer amendments are encouraged to work with the bill managers in an effort to complete this important legislation prior to the end of this week. Further votes can be anticipated during today's session of the Senate.

   Mr. WARNER. Yesterday, Mr. President, we made progress on this bill--not quite as much as I had hoped, but nevertheless progress was made. I wish to draw to the attention of my colleagues that late last night the ranking member and I put forth an amendment to this bill regarding the D-Day memorial. As the last act, it seemed to the distinguished Senator from Michigan and myself that it was most appropriate that the 56th anniversary of D-Day be concluded with an amendment which provides the opportunity for, first, the Senate, and hopefully the entire Congress, to participate in the raising of the needed dollars for the World War II memorial. Over 1,000 World War II veterans are dying each day. Organizers are within $6 million of reaching that sum of money needed to complete the construction and design phases of this memorial. 
   I am pleased to say this amendment passed last night. I thank my distinguished colleague, Mr. LEVIN, for joining me. All the World War II veterans currently serving in the Senate were added as cosponsors. I served very briefly at the end of World War II. And the others, seven in number, were added as cosponsors together with our distinguished colleague, Senator KERREY--although not a World War II veteran, a veteran of Vietnam with greatest distinction. So I am pleased to  make that announcement. Some Senators may have missed it last night. 
   I note Senator KERREY's presence in the Chamber. We thank the Senator for cosponsoring the amendment last night by which the Senate goes on record endorsing a contribution of $6 million, I might add, out of nonappropriated funds. We were able to get the funding from that account.

Mr. President, I want to make it very clear that this Senator, the Senator from Virginia, although his service at the end of World War II was brief, a little less than 2 years, does not put himself in the hero class with those in this body who, indeed, very humbly and rightfully earned that hero distinction. I may have served in Korea in the second engagement of our country in war but not at this particular time. Basically, the Navy educated me, for which I am grateful. The GI bill helped me, as it did all of those us who served at the time. That was probably the greatest investment the United States ever made in a bill.

   Mr. WARNER. If I can advise my distinguished colleague, the subject of a military museum embracing the chronological history of the participation of men and women of our Nation in causes of freedom beyond our shores is very much in the minds of the members of the Armed Services Committee. At the moment, I and other Senators are promoting a museum colocated with Arlington Cemetery on the ridge that overlooks where the current headquarters of the Marine Corps is located. That is due for demolition. That site seems to me and others to lend itself to the convenience of tourists visiting this Nation's Capital. It would embrace the military history of all branches of our services. We are a modest size in comparison to others, but the Senator is right. 
   I noticed with interest yesterday in Great Britain the Queen opened an extraordinary exposition and permanent museum devoted to the Holocaust, again, a reminder of chapters of the tragedy that unfolded on the European Continent as a consequence of Hitler and the Axis powers.

</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-warner-va-9-20000607</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WARNER. The answer to that question is very simple. It was first done in 1996. We repeated it in 1997, 1998, and 1999. In 2000, we made it permanent. That is the provision which the Senator from Nebraska is trying to strike. 
   In response to that, Congress took action and the President of the United States signed it into law one time, two times, three times, four times, five times. That should answer the 
   question posed by the Senator from Nebraska. 
   The President concurred in the judgment of the Congress which said that you should not drop below those levels. What the amendment from the Senator from Virginia says is it doesn't, in my judgment, restrict the President's constitutional right to negotiate, but it says, Mr. President, you should not unilaterally, as Commander in Chief, reduce our Armed Forces in terms of those strategic levels until you do two things which have been followed by previous Presidents, and, indeed, this President when he first came to office. You make a QDR study. 
   For those that do not understand it, it is an entire study of the world threat situation, our force levels, force levels which are conventional, force levels which are strategic, and you do a comprehensive review of the nuclear posture. 
   Those two things having been done, then you can proceed to exercise your judgment as Commander in Chief to reduce certain force levels. 
   There it is. The President signed it five times, clearly. He could have vetoed it. He did not. He signed it into law five times. It remains the law of the land today. I will vigorously oppose the efforts of my colleague and good friend from Nebraska to repeal that law because that law very clearly says you must take prudent actions. My amendment sets out what those prudent actions are. Then my amendment gives the President the right, after taking those actions of the QDR and the posture review of the nuclear forces, to waive the statute that has been signed five times by the President of the United States.

   Mr. WARNER. I simply say to my good friend, I strongly disagree. This President signed this five times. We saw an example where the distinguished Senator from West Virginia and I had the Byrd-Warner amendment regarding the deployment of our troops and taking certain steps by the Congress. What happened? Not only this President but the candidates for President, both Vice President GORE and George W. Bush, communicated in various ways they believed that amendment was an encroachment on Presidential power, and we missed that by a mere three votes, is my recollection, because of that very issue. It was an abridgement of Presidential power. Nothing is fought on this Chamber floor with greater vigor than protecting the powers of the President of the United States.

   Mr. WARNER. I simply reiterate what my colleague, who is the chairman of the subcommittee, has said. This amendment, which I drew up carefully, is drawn in such a way that it does not preclude President Clinton from negotiating and, indeed, preclude him from exercising his authority as Commander in Chief to direct the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and others in the Pentagon: This is a level to which you will drive nuclear weapons. He can do it. 
   We are saying it should only be done after a quadrennial review, after a nuclear posture study has been completed. From a practical standpoint, it simply, in my judgment, cannot be achieved. If it were forced to be done, it would be viewed not only by us but the Russians and all others who follow this as an imprudent, an unwise step by our President. That is it.

But the point is, that was a process that evolved over many years. The work had been done. The studies had been done. All of it was in place ready for his signature. 
   I say to the Senator, that is not the case in this instance. The last posture review of importance was 1994. Why this administration sought not to bring those up to date, to bring up a current one----

   Mr. WARNER. I would say, if this situation today were of a parallel situation at the time of President Bush, I would have been the first to pass this same law. It was an entirely different factual situation, I say to the Senator. I hope those listening understand that. But you posed the question. If President Bush at that time was faced with the decision such as this to lower the numbers drastically, I would say it should not be done until the staff work and the careful work had been done by those entrusted, namely, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to make the analysis before a President acts.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might summarize, again, on five occasions President Clinton has signed into law actions by the Congress of the United States which state very clearly we should not go to these levels. There it is. 
   It is interesting, one of the reasons Congress took that action is we were not sure what the Duma would do on START II. We were right. They accepted START II, but with the following conditions on it: ABM treaty demarcation protocol, ABM treaty succession multilateralization protocol, START II extension protocol. Those protocols have not been sent to the Senate by the President. No one can refute that; they have not been sent here. They do not have his endorsement. That is why we should not undo hastily with this amendment this fabric of legislation which for 5 consecutive years has been passed by the Congress and signed by the President of the United States.  
   The Warner amendment does not preclude President Clinton from negotiating. It does not preclude our President from creating a QDR in the next few months, creating an updated nuclear posture. He could do it. But it would be imprudent and unwise to do it because it would run against the guidance provided by the Congress. No one should say this Congress, particularly the Senate, is not an equal partner on matters of seriousness of this nature, particularly as it relates to treaties. It is in the Constitution just as clearly as is the President's Commander in Chief role.

   Mr. WARNER. In quick summary, he cites what the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs said in 1995. Fine. But General Shelton and others were acting on the predicate, on the assumption, which was a fair assumption, that the Russian Duma would adopt START II as it was written and not put these conditions on it. Once they put these conditions on, it was a clear signal to all of us, we had better go back and reexamine what in effect is the desire of Russia on arms control. These are conditions which they know this Chamber, as presently constituted, would never accept. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. I think the Senator has raised a legitimate question. Are we as a body in the Senate to look in a bipartisan way to future arms control or are we not? It is a fair question given the action by this Chamber, which is a proper action, on the test ban treaty. I fought hard against that. The Senator was on the other side. We rocked the Halls of this Chamber with that debate. But that is history. 
   I want the Senator to know that this Senator from Virginia firmly believes in an ongoing arms control process, firmly believes that this country should continue its leadership with this very important endeavor to try to make this a more safe world. But every arms control agreement that comes along is not the one we should buy into. I say to my good friend, if he says this Chamber is divided, I commit this Senator to work, so long as I am privileged to be a Senator, for arms control. But for some reason, the Russian Duma, although it is in comparison a very new legislative body, had the opportunity to take START II and accept it, just as President Bush had signed it, put it into force and effect--but how well you understand, they put conditions on and those conditions they knew would not be acceptable in this Chamber. So they intentionally blocked going into force and effect the START II treaty. I say to my friend, why did they do that?

The Duma knew full well that in this Chamber--and, indeed, in the Congress and, indeed, in the whole of the United States--there is a very serious and important debate going on; I hope it is part of the Presidential election debates, as to whether or not this Nation should allow itself to be held hostage by Russia in terms of a critical need to defend our Nation against the growing threat of strategic intercontinental missiles. You know that, and I know that. That is what these protocols go--the ability of this Nation to defend itself. They were very clever in the Duma because they knew that was putting out, as we say in the military, a ``tank trap.'' We were stopped cold once those protocols were put on.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is very clear that the next President of the United States must be given every possible bit of leverage he can have as he readdresses in good faith, as did President Clinton, this issue of the ABM Treaty. It could well be that the levels we are debating right here in this amendment are the levels of those arms reductions which we all know as a certainty will be done at some point in time. 
   We believe, of course, in accordance with the Warner amendment, that it should be done after careful analyses and steps have been taken. In any event, we will come down to those levels. We know that. 
   But should not that next President have in his negotiating strategy the ability to do those negotiations of lower levels as a part of the essential requirement to get some reasonable modification to the ABM Treaty that enables this country, as George W. Bush said in his statement, to rightfully defend itself? That is what this is all about. Don't take away a possible negotiating bit of leverage he has with regard to the levels of these weapons. 
   Will the Chair advise us with regard to the time remaining.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this has been a good debate. It is on a very important issue. I express my gratitude to so many colleagues who have participated. 
   In summary, I simply say this body, five times, has passed the statute which my good friend desires to have repealed. Do not repeal this statute. Do not, I say to my colleagues, in good faith, repeal a statute which was signed into law five times by the President. I ask my friend, what has changed to justify repealing it? He says the ratification of START II by the Duma. Had that ratification been in accordance with the way this Chamber ratified it, I would say it is time to let the statute go. But they did not do it. They put protocols on that treaty which pose a great problem to the next President--indeed, to this President--as he saw when he went to the summit. 
   And nyet, nyet, nyet, nyet, time and time again when our President tried in a very rational way to determine the flexibility that Russia might have on the ABM Treaty, which flexibility is essential for this Nation to provide for its own defense. Nyet, nyet, nyet. Those are the only changes since five times this Chamber has adopted that law; five times the President has signed it. The only change is a ratification of START II by the Duma, with impossible conditions put on it, which not only the Senate would not accept but nor would this Nation accept.

   Mr. WARNER. I advise my colleagues that at an appropriate time someone from the Budget Committee on this side of the aisle will make a point of order. 
   Mr. President, we are almost parallel in thought here, certainly parallel in thought for the need to help the retirees. I have been privileged to be in this institution 22 years. This is the first time, I say to my colleague, we have ever taken a step to provide for retirees. No one can refute that. If I may say, to push aside a little humility, it came from this side of the aisle. It was not in President Clinton's budget. It hasn't been in any of his budgets. We took the initiative. We have done it carefully step by step. I commend my colleague for his leadership on this issue. Indeed, it is the interest in his bill which has been garnered across our land that has helped our committee to, step by step, begin to increase these provisions. 
   I see my colleague wishes to make a point.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, once we took the initiative on our side of the aisle in the committee, we had bipartisan support across the board. The Senator is absolutely right. The point is where we are. We are faced with constraints in military spending, as we are in all other avenues. Let's make it clear--let's see if the Senator and I can agree--the CBO, in costing out my bill, said it would be about $40 billion over 10 years. Will the Senator agree with that?

   Mr. WARNER. Correct. So the difference between the two approaches is very significant in terms of dollars. In fact, the distinguished Senator's bill would cost along the following lines: He said $3 billion in fiscal year 2001; $5.7 billion in 2002; up to $8.3 billion in 2003; $9.4 billion in 2004; and going out to 2010, $12 billion. So those are the figures. I think we are in agreement as to the dollar consequences of the two bills. 
   Yesterday, my distinguished colleague, the ranking member of this committee, when I raised the amendment, said that a point of order would rest. The inference was clearly that it would be brought against my amendment. Whereupon, I thought it imperative that I take my amendment and amend it, which I did, to just go out to the year 2004. By so doing, the expenditures under my bill, as they flow out through these years, bring it within the Senate budget resolution and, therefore, does not make it subject to a point of order. 
   I think we can agree on that point.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WARNER. The retiree community, in particular, following this, will say to the Senator from Virginia: Why did you cut short to 2004? I simply say: Because the likelihood of getting 60 votes was in doubt, and I didn't want to have that doubt. I wanted to make sure we got started on some major incremental series of benefits for retirees. That is why I did it. I made that calculation. I take full responsibility for having done it. 
   Now, let's see if we can narrow the differences between the approach of my colleague and the one I take. I summarize it as follows: I have provided in my bill, albeit only through 2004, every provision the Senator has. Particularly, I commend him for waiving the 1964 law--not waiving it, but taking it off--which was essential. We did that together. 
   The main difference is the coverage that is given to these retirees under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program; would I be correct in that? 
</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-warner-va-46-20000607</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WARNER. But my point is, had it been able to go out 10 years, we continue to use that baseline. I am absolutely confident that this issue of retiree health care will be injected into the Presidential campaign. Each candidate will be asked what position he wants to take on that. I am certain they will. And should my amendment be adopted by the Senate and become the law of the land, and given that it has to stop in 2004, the first question I would ask the candidates is, Are you going to support rewriting the Warner amendment such that it goes out in perpetuity? I forewarn the candidates to be prepared to answer that question. 
   I support, of course, that action by the Congress, with the support of the next President, to make it in perpetuity. But going back to the Senator's point, coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program is what takes my bill from $40 billion to yours to at $90 billion; are we correct on that? Let's address the situation. 
   We passed--I believe it was 2 years ago--a program to allow the retirees to decide whether or not they wanted to go into this Federal health program. Interestingly, we allowed up to 66,000 to enter under that experimental test program. Mr. President, astonishingly, only 2,500 of those eligible opted to do it, indicating to our committee that they felt if they could get the full benefits offered to them when they were on active duty in their retired status, they preferred to have that rather than to go into the Federal health program. What clearer evidence could there be? We offered 66,000 a chance to do it and only 2,500 accepted.

<DOCNO>106-warner-va-47-20000607</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WARNER. I say to my good friend, clearly some of that may have taken place. It is better that retiree organizations should certainly have tried to give them the information and 
   explain it. They have done a magnificent job in explaining what my colleague is offering in his amendment. 
   I wish to return to the following. Here we go. We are now taking the retirees who are given only Medicare, and the Warner bill now restores them to the full rights they had when they were on active duty in terms of health care. My good friend, Senator JOHNSON, wants to offer them also the chance to go into the Federal program, and the cost of that is largely borne by the Federal Government. That raises his amendment up to twice the cost of mine, using the 10-year average. But we are giving them both. 
   At the same time, I project that the Congress is going to be called upon, should the Warner amendment or the Senator's amendment become law, to begin to add funds for the existing military health care program so that it can absorb back this community. That is not an insignificant expenditure. Now, having done that, which we have to do under either amendment, then to offer them the chance to go into the Federal program, you put the infrastructure in place, they don't avail themselves of it, they go into the Federal employees program, and you have built a big medical program that will not be fully utilized.

   Mr. WARNER. The Senator is correct. But am I not also correct that if we mandate by law that the existing military health program has to absorb back into it this class of retirees, they will have to augment doctors, nurses, perhaps modest increase in facilities, and all of the other infrastructure that is necessary to give these people fair, good quality health care; am I not correct? 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>106-warner-va-49-20000607</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the number of retirees over 65 is roughly 1.4 million persons. Under the Warner amendment, as well as the Johnson amendment, they are now taken back into the existing infrastructure that cares for active duty and under-65 persons. Anyone would know that with 1.4 million now given the opportunity to come back in, you would have to augment and refurbish that system. This will be a justifiable issue before the Congress very quickly. I am certain the Secretary of Defense--the next Secretary--in the posture statement of the next President will say: All right, Congress; you said we are to take them back. We are happy to take them back, but give us the funds to refurbish and  augment that system. That will be done. 
   That system will be prepared to take back these people, and at the same time, you are saying to these people while we put the infrastructure in place, you may decide not to use it and go off here and avail yourself of other taxpayer dollars--namely, paying a premium of 70-plus percent, in most cases, to go into the private sector. Of course, there is no augmentation to the private sector. The private sector could probably absorb 
   this class. There could be a competition between the private sector and the military infrastructure. But the military infrastructure has to be put into place. As you say, very little would have to be done in the private sector to absorb them. 
   So that is the reason, I say to my colleagues, no matter how laudatory the amendment would be. I suggest we go a step at a time in treating these people fairly. And we have taken the initiative to do it. Let's do it a step at a time and first refurbish the existing military system to accept them back and give it a period of several years under my amendment to see how it works before we take the next leap and put on the American taxpayers double the amount of money that my amendment would cost.

   Mr. WARNER. I simply say once again I thank the Senator from South Dakota. He has been a leader on this issue. Indeed, his amendment has been widely supported throughout the retirement community. 
   I have come in with the second-degree simply to say we should take these steps incrementally, one after another. Let us bring the retirees back into the fold of the military health care system. Let us build the infrastructures necessary to take care of them and try that out in the light that only 2,500 ever opted for the Federal program out of 66,000 eligible. Let us try that out for the 2 or 3 years my program would be in effect. 
   The next President will have to address this situation. The next Congress will address this situation. But we will have made enormous progress if the Senate will adopt the Warner amendment. Indeed, it represents well over two-thirds of the amendment by our distinguished colleague from South Dakota. 
   The only thing remaining is whether or not we should give both at this point in time, which would double the cost over a 10-year period. It would double  the cost if we gave them the option of the Federal program in addition to what we are giving them under the Warner amendment; namely, now back into the 
   system which has taken care of them for the period of their active duty and that period between the termination of their active duty and retirement up to age 65.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we had a very good debate on this. I see it slightly different. What we are doing in the Johnson amendment is giving two health care programs to military retirees. We are giving them the military health care program and then asking the taxpayers to add on the tax burdens of the Federal program. So it is not the same as we get; we do not get the military program. I have to correct the Senator. There are two systems if you vote for that. That is why his is $90 billion over 10 years versus the Warner amendment, which is $40 billion.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, for 5 consecutive years, the Senate has put language into law with the President's signature reserving these numbers, which the distinguished Senator from Nebraska now wishes to strike from 5 years of consecutive law signed by the President. 
   The Warner amendment simply says that the President, whether it be President Clinton or the next President, should follow a very careful procedure before changing the numbers, 
   of strategic systems; namely, to do a QDR process which takes into consideration not only the strategic weapons but the conventional weapons and then do an updated posture statement regarding exclusively the strategic. 
   Those are prudent steps that should be taken. In essence, this Chamber recognized that in the 5 consecutive years we have kept this language in. 
   Given the nyet--no, no, no--that our President received in Moscow on the ABM issue, he may well need the leverage given by the 5 consecutive years of law. My amendment gives the President the right of waiver, but it imposes on him the need to take a prudent managerial course of action before any decision is made. 
   I yield the floor.

   I ask unanimous consent that the previous order for Senator WARNER to be recognized to offer an amendment on working capital be laid aside to recur following the disposition of the BRAC amendment. 
   I further ask that on the Reid amendment, it be limited to 1 hour, with 45 minutes under the control of Senator REID and 15 minutes under the control of Senator WARNER, and no second-degree amendment in order prior to the vote in relation to the amendment. 
   I further ask consent that following the disposition of the Reid issue, Senator KENNEDY be recognized to offer his HMO amendment, and that there be 2 hours equally divided prior to a vote in relation to the amendment, with no second-degree amendments in order prior to the vote. 
   I further ask that following the disposition of the Kennedy issue, Senators MCCAIN/LEVIN be recognized to offer their amendment, re: BRAC, on which there will be 2 hours equally divided, under the same terms as outlined above; namely, an hour under the control of Senators MCCAIN and LEVIN, and 1 hour under the control of Senator WARNER. 
   I further ask that following the disposition of the Warner amendment, Senator WELLSTONE be recognized to offer his amendment, re: Child soldiers, on which there will be 30 minutes equally divided in the usual form and under the same terms as outlined above. 
   I further ask consent that during the debate today or tomorrow, the following Members be recognized for debate only: JOHN KERRY for up to 60 minutes and Senator FEINGOLD for up to 12 minutes.

   Also, late last night, Senator CARL LEVIN and I put in an amendment which was accepted, was cosponsored by all the veterans of World War II who are now in the Senate, some eight or nine, and it provided $6 million toward the memorial that is being constructed on The Mall. 
   Earlier that day, our former distinguished majority leader and colleague, Robert Dole, accepted a $14.5 million contribution. Together with the $6 million of the Senate, and my understanding from Senator Dole, with whom I spoke late last night, that brings within completion the budget they had for design, construction, and otherwise for that memorial. 
   It was a historic day.

   Mr. WARNER. Since he and I joined together several years ago on a piece of legislation to initiate the BRAC process--you remember that, and I will not go into the chronology--I share with the Senator appreciation of the need for an assessment of our base structure. That should be made in the context of the demands of the armed services. There is no one--you just had an amendment that succeeded overwhelmingly in the Senate on food stamps. You begin to address these problems. I commend my old friend and colleague. 
   This comes to my mind. There is no one who is a stronger fighter for the prerogatives of the President of the United States. You fought hard here recently on an amendment which I had with Senator BYRD. I think you took the line we could be strapping the President of the United States. 
   Factually speaking, with no criticism towards President Clinton, there will be an election in this country and a new President elected in a few months. He will take office. Should we not accord him the courtesy to address this question, address it in the context of the needs that you have stated, address it in the context of a QDR, his own analysis of the military structure of the United States? Address it in the context of what his direction will likely be with respect to the Armed Forces of the United States? 
   My colleague, above all, and I are strong supporters of one particular candidate. He has spoken out very forcefully on the need to further strengthen our military. I think if we were to start the process now, it could in some ways impede or indeed thwart the next President's, what I consider, complete freedom to look at this issue. 
   My colleague was right. He was talking about the $20 billion this could possibly generate. He was correct in assessing the needs of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and others. Just moments ago we missed by a few votes a $90 billion program for retirement, which was tough for those who had to go against it, but we had to resist that. 
   I am suggesting: What is the reason we should start now versus just allow the next President to frame this legislation in terms of his own needs and aspirations?

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is the amendment about which I spoke on the floor earlier this morning. I think colleagues have had an opportunity to inform themselves about it. It is my hope that a number will desire to be cosponsors. We have a number of cosponsors right now. 
   This amendment relates to the continuing work of the Armed Services Committee with regard to the necessity to provide a health care program for retirees over 65. As the Presiding Officer well knows, the committee has addressed this in several increments, and now with another amendment by the Senator from Virginia, which I offer on behalf of many. I want to recognize that this is a subject that has quite properly gained the attention of a number of colleagues. I know Senator MCCAIN, on our side of the aisle, and Senator HUTCHISON have worked on this subject of health care. In no way do I indicate that anyone--certainly not myself--has been the principal; we have all worked together as a team.  And at such appropriate time, I will return to this amendment. 
   I want to make some opening comments now regarding this very important piece of legislation. This bill contains the much-needed increases in defense funding and critical initiatives, including in the area of recruiting and retention. Retention is one of the most serious problems we have facing us today in our current military, as well as recruiting. This 
   bill, in the collective judgment of the committee, goes a long way toward helping to alleviate the problems we have and to improve those critical areas in our defense. 
   It is most appropriate that we begin this discussion today, on June 6, the 56th anniversary of D-Day. Today, America recalls the heroic acts of bravery and valor demonstrated on the beaches of France and the many who paid the price in life and limb for liberty and freedom. And how proud we are, as the Senate, to have as the President pro tempore the distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina, STROM THURMOND, among us. He, of course, crossed the beaches of D-Day 56 years ago. He addressed the Senate earlier today on that subject. 
   As we look to the future and the defense of this Nation, we must never forget what may be required, and indeed what was required, of so many--over 1,400 American servicemen, not to speak of our allies; they had casualties also. But 1,400 American servicemen died on June 6, 1944, on the beaches of France, and thousands more were wounded. They did it to restore freedom to so many nations and people all through Europe--freedom that had been taken away by Hitler and the Axis forces. 
   I begin by expressing my thanks to the ranking member, Senator LEVIN. We came to the Senate together 21 years ago. We have worked as partners on this bill and have produced a bipartisan product that will strengthen the security of the United States, in the collective judgment of all members of the Armed Services Committee, and improve the quality of life of our men and women in uniform and, most especially, for their families. 
   I also applaud our subcommittee chairmen, ranking members, and all members of the Committee for their fine work throughout this year. I will put in the RECORD elsewhere the volume of hearings, special meetings, the prolonged markup sessions that led to the work product for which we labored in the Senate today. 
   A special thanks to our committee staff. What a superb professional staff--not only this year and last year, but throughout the 22 years I have been privileged to be on this committee. Under many distinguished chairmen and ranking members, we have had the most nonpartisan and the hardest-working staff in the Senate. I salute Colonel Les Brownlee, David Lyles, and the personal staff of the committee members for their invaluable work which led to the creation of this bill. 
   I appeal to all Members to join us in our bipartisan effort to improve our security. The safety and well-being of our men and women in uniform, thousands of whom are deployed at this very moment in harm's way across this world, should not fall victim to any partisan debate and certainly no election year politics. We have done that in the past. I hope we will not do it on this bill and in the future. 
   We should keep in mind that Members of the Senate have always recognized the importance of the annual Defense authorization bill, and in the past we have put our partisan concerns aside for the good of the Nation. I remind colleagues that the Senate has passed a Defense authorization bill every year since the authorization process began in 1961, some nearly 40 years. The House this year had a strong, resounding vote of 353 yeas to 100-some-odd nays. So that is a clear indication of the strength of the House and the Senate bills and the need for these bills to be brought into law. 
   At this time of increased tension around the world, at this time of unprecedented deployments of U.S. military personnel around the globe, we must show our support for our troops. Accordingly, I urge all Members to abstain from offering nondefense-related amendments and to join in a bipartisan effort to pass this Defense authorization bill, to send a strong signal of support to our brave troops, wherever they are in the world, for risking their lives at the very moment we address this legislation, risking to safeguard freedom of our allies, our friends, and indeed those of us here at home. The problems and the threats facing the home front have increased to where they are greater today than I ever envisioned in my life. 
   The national security challenges that the United States will face in the new millennium are many and diverse--new adversaries, unknown adversaries, new weapons, and unknown weapons. A very complex threat faces us at home and our forces forward deployed. It is important that we remain vigilant, forward thinking, and prepared to address these challenges. 
   Just days ago the National Commission on Terrorism, established by Congress in 1998, issued its report, ``Countering the Changing Threat of International Terrorism''. I would like to quote from the Report's executive summary: ``Today's terrorists seek to inflict mass causalities, and they are attempting to do so both overseas and on American soil. They are less dependent on state sponsorship and are, instead, forming loose, transnational affiliations based on religious or ideological--regrettably I have to use that word, ``a common hatred''--affinity and a common hatred of the United States. This makes terrorist attacks more difficult to detect and prevent.'' We must be prepared to respond to this threat and I look forward to reviewing the numerous recommendations contained within the report which we may address in the course of the deliberations on this bill. 
   While the Department of Defense (DOD) must plan and allocate resources to meet future threats, ongoing military operations and deployments from the Balkans to Southwest Asia to East Timor continue to demand significant resources in the short term and the foreseeable future. 
   The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 authorizes a total of $309.8 billion for defense spending--$4.5 billion above the President's request--and provides authority and guidance to the Defense Department to address the critical readiness, modernization, and recruiting and retention problems facing our military. 
   For over a decade, our defense budgets have been based on constrained funding, not on the threats facing the nation or the military strategy necessary to meet those threats. The result of this is evident today in continuing critical problems with recruiting and retention, declining readiness ratings, and aging equipment. 
   Last year, the Congress reversed the downward trend in defense spending by approving a defense authorization bill which, for the first time in 14 years, included a real increase in the authorized level of defense spending. This year, we continue that momentum with the bill before the Senate the second year of increased authorization levels. As I stated earlier, the authorized level of $309.8 billion in this bill is $4.5 billion above the President's request and consistent with this year's concurrent budget resolution. The fiscal year 2001 funding level also represents a real increase in defense spending of 4.4 percent from the fiscal year 2000 appropriated level. 
   The funding we have provided is primarily going for modernization and readiness and for other benefits for the men and women of the military. The committee authorized $63.28 billion in procurement funding, a $3.0 billion increase over the President's budget. Operations and maintenance was funded at $109.2 billion, with $1.5 billion added to the primary readiness accounts. Research, development, test and evaluation was budgeted at $39.31 billion, a $1.45 billion increase over the President's budget request. 
   The committee's support for additional funding for defense is based on an in-depth analysis of the threats facing U.S. interests, and testimony from senior military leaders on the many shortfalls in the defense budget. 
   While the cold war has been over for nearly a decade, it is evident that the world remains a complex and violent place. The greatest threat to our national security today is instability; instability fueled by ethnic, religious, and racial animosities that have existed for centuries, but are now resulting in conflicts fought with the weapons of modern warfare. Many have turned to the United States, as the sole remaining superpower, to resolve the  many conflicts around the world and to ensure stability in the future. However, this military power does not ensure our security. As Director 
   of Central Intelligence George Tenet told the committee in January, ``The fact that we are arguably the world's most powerful nation does not bestow invulnerability; in fact, it may make us a larger target for those who don't share our interest, values, or beliefs.'' 
   U.S. military forces are involved in overseas deployments at an unprecedented rate. Currently, our troops are involved in over 10 contingency operations around the globe. Unfortunately, there appears to be no relief in sight for most of these operations. At an October 1999 hearing of the committee, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Hugh Shelton, stated that, ``Two factors that erode military readiness are the pace of operations and funding shortfalls. There is no doubt that the force is much smaller than it was a decade ago, and also much busier.'' 
   Over the past decade, our active duty manpower has been reduced by nearly a third, active Army divisions have been reduced by almost 50 percent, and the number of Navy ships has been reduced from 567 to 316. During this same period, our troops have been involved in 50 military operations worldwide. By comparison, from the end of the Vietnam war in 1975 until 1989, U.S. military forces were engaged in only 20 such military deployments. 
   This unprecedented rate of overseas deployments is one of the primary factors contributing to the severe problems we are having with recruiting and retaining quality personnel, and with maintaining adequate readiness of the existing force. We have tried to address these issues in the bill before the Senate. 
   It has also affected our readiness, as the Presiding Officer well knows as chairman of the subcommittee with the primary jurisdiction of readiness. 
   I want to pause for a moment and acknowledge the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Service Chiefs--the Chief of Naval Operations, the Air Force Chief of Staff, the Army Chief of Staff, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps--for their role in helping to reverse the decline in defense spending. I cannot think of one single factor that added greater emphasis not only this year but last year to the increase in defense spending--not one fact greater than their honest, forthright professional and personal assessments which were given this committee time and time in formalized hearings, and indeed in private consultations. I commend them. They have ably represented their troops. 
   There is no group of leaders more responsible for stopping this downward trend than the Chiefs. 
   On three separate occasions, October 6, 1998, January 5, 1999, and October 26, 1999, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the 
   Service Chiefs came before the Armed Services Committee to tell us about the ever increasing challenges the armed forces were facing in carrying out their military missions. Simply put, they did not have enough money. Their individual observations were forthright and candid. Collectively, their reports to the Congress became the unimpeachable voice that made Americans sit up and take notice. The chiefs were heard across the land. Our nation echoed back: we believe you, you have the people's support. 
   The military service chiefs have testified that they have a remaining shortfall in funding of $9.0 billion for fiscal year 2000, a requirement for an additional $15.5 billion above the budget request to meet shortfalls in readiness and modernization for fiscal year 2001, and a requirement for an additional $85.0 billion in the future years Defense Program. 
   This bill adds $3.8 billion to the President's budget request to specifically pay for items identified by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Service chiefs as necessary requirements: necessary requirements that were not funded by the President's request. 
   As I said earlier, the high operations tempo of our armed forces is having a negative impact on recruiting and retention. Last year, the committee took action to provide a pay raise and a package of retirement reforms and retention incentives in an effort to recruit and retain highly qualified personnel. The committee has received testimony that these changes are having a positive impact on recruiting and retention efforts. 
   This year, the committee has focused its ``quality of life'' efforts on improving military health care for our active duty and retired personnel and their families. 
   Earlier this year, I announced my intention to join with the majority leader and others to tackle the long-standing problems with the military health care system. 
   I wish to acknowledge the full cooperation of my distinguished colleague, Mr. LEVIN, and the Members on his side of the aisle. It has truly been a bipartisan effort. We have heard increasing complaints, especially from over 56 retirement communities. 
   While the Congress was taking some steps in the past to try to improve the health care system, it was time for a major assault on this problem. And we have done more than establish a beachhead. I used that term months ago when I laid down the first piece of legislation with our distinguished majority leader, Mr. LOTT. 
   The bill before the Senate today is but the first step, I hope, in what will be a continuing process to fulfill our commitment of quality health care for all military personnel--active duty, retired, as well as their families. 
   The Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and the service chiefs have all highlighted the many problems associated with implementing a user-friendly health care program for active duty service members, military retirees, and their families. 
   In this bill, the committee included initiatives that ensure our active duty personnel and their families receive quality health care and initiatives that fulfill our commitment to military retirees, including extending TriCare Prime to families of service members assigned to remote locations, eliminating copayments for service received under the TriCare Prime, and authorizing a comprehensive retail and national mail order pharmacy benefit for all eligible beneficiaries, including Medicare-eligible beneficiaries with no enrollment fee or deductible. 
   I will elaborate on the pharmacy benefit. Prescription medication is the major unmet need of the military retiree. I believe this bill meets that need. This bill for the first time provides an entitlement for a comprehensive drug benefit for all military beneficiaries, including those who are Medicare eligible. 
   Hopefully, I will add my amendment which will further enhance this whole package of retiree benefits, particularly for those over 65. At the appropriate time, I will ask to turn to that amendment. 
   Other quality-of-life initiatives of note in this bill are 
   a 3.7-percent pay raise for military personnel effective January 1, 2001, and a provision that directs the Department to implement the Thrift Savings Plan for military personnel not later than 180 days after enactment of this act. We put similar provisions in last year's bill but gave the discretion to the Department. This year, we have been forthright and we direct action on that program. 
   Last year, NATO conducted its first large-scale offensive military operation with the 78-day air war campaign--and it was associated with other military operations and was not exclusive to air--on behalf of the beleaguered and persecuted peoples of Kosovo. The lessons learned from that operation addressed during a series of committee hearings highlighted not only shortfalls in weapon systems and intelligence programs but also the complexities of engaging in coalition operations. 
   As noted in the combined testimony of Operation Allied Force Commanders, Gen. Wesley Clark, Adm. James Ellis, and Lt. Gen. Mike Short, the Kosovo campaign:  
   ..... required [that] we adopt military doctrine and strategy to strike a balance between maintaining allied cohesion, striking key elements of the Yugoslav Armed Forces, minimizing losses of allied aircraft and crew, and containing collateral damage.  
   Of paramount concern to the committee this year was applying the lessons learned from the air campaign over Kosovo to our defense budget to ensure the future preparedness of the  U.S. Armed Forces for future military operations. Accordingly, the committee included over $700 million for a program to include aircraft precision strike capability, aircraft survivability, and intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance assets based on lessons learned from the Kosovo conflict. 
   Over 38,000 combat sorties were conducted during the Kosovo air campaign--and I proudly say, for all nations that participated, some seven nations flew--with no combat casualties and some heroic rescue operations. While the committee understands that no military operation is without risk, limiting the risk to military personnel is an important goal. Every day, advances in technology such as computing and telecommunications are being integrated into warfighting equipment. 
   The committee believes the Defense Department must further pursue these technological advances in an effort to provide advanced warfighting capabilities, while at the same time limiting the risk to military personnel. To this end, this legislation directs the DOD to aggressively develop and field unmanned combat systems in the air and on the ground so that within 10 years one-third of our operation of these type aircraft would be unmanned, and within 15 years one-third of our ground combat vehicles would be unmanned. The committee also added $246.3 million to accelerate technologies leading to the development and fielding of remotely controlled air combat vehicles and remotely controlled ground combat vehicles. 
   As demonstrated in Kosovo, our Armed Forces are the best prepared in the world. They can beat the enemy on any battlefield. I don't say that with arrogance. It is factual. Our enemies, certainly those that can be identified, know that. It is the ones that we can't identify--the growing number we cannot identify, that we cannot anticipate--that pose the greatest threat. Current and future potential adversaries must fully understand, however, our military capability. Many are now intent on carrying the battle right here at home in the 
   continental limits of the United States of America either by ballistic missile attack or attacks with chemical or biological agents or through cyberterrorism. That is where we are soft, soft in the underbelly of this great Nation. Recently, retired Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre characterized domestic preparedness as ``the mission of the decade.'' I agree with that distinguished former public servant. 
   The military services play a critical and important role in domestic preparedness for such attacks. Should some madman or terrorist release a chemical biological agent on the civilian population at home--or, indeed, at a military base that could be a target--the Defense Department must be prepared to assist the first responders, whether they are volunteer firemen, the police officers, or even citizens who instinctively try to come to the aid of those suffering, along with the health care professionals in our local communities. To deter and defeat the efforts of those intent on using weapons of mass destruction or mass disruption in the United States, this bill does the following: 
   It adds $76.8 million for initiatives to address the threat of cyberattack, including establishment of an Information Security Scholarship Program to encourage recruitment and retention of Department of Defense personnel with computer network security skills. This is a program in which I have had a great deal of interest. I do hope the Members will work with me on this. We have this massive people program, maybe $20 or $30 million just to begin to give incentives for young people to go into cyberspace terrorism. What better evidence do we need than this love note that floated around, causing billions of dollars of loss to the economy in this country for the shutdown of computers. 
   Second, there is the creation of an institute for defense computer security and information protection to conduct research and critical technology development and to facilitate the exchange of information between the government and the private sector, and sharing of information to try and meet this common threat. 
   Further, we added $418 million for ballistic missile defense programs, including $129 million for National Missile Defense Risk Reduction, $92.4 million for the Air Forces Airborne Laser Program, $60 million for the Navy Theater-Wide Missile Defense Program, $15 million for the Atmospheric Interceptor Technology Program, $8 million for the Arrow System Improvement Program, $15 million for the Tactical High Energy Laser Program, and $30 million for the Space-Based Laser Program. 
   This is a serious threat to our homeland, the intercontinental ballistic missiles. We are forging ahead. I wish we could be stronger in our efforts. 
   I will, with others, try everlastingly to increase our strength to try to approach these things and solve these problems--because we are defenseless. Americans think we spent $300.9 billion this year and $300 billion previous years and that we have some defense. We do not. We are absolutely defenseless against these intercontinental ballistic missiles, particularly the ones that might be fired by a rogue state or terrorist state or, indeed, an accidental firing. It could decimate any of our great cities or, indeed, rural areas.

   Mr. WARNER. Last, we added $25 million for five additional Weapons of Mass Destruction-Civil Support teams formerly known as RAID teams. This will result in a total of 32 of these teams by the end of fiscal year 2001. It is the committee's intent to support the establishment of these teams for each State and territory. I commend this committee, particularly the subcommittee that handles this under Senator ROBERTS, for their relentless initiative to drive and get these teams in place. The Department of Defense has not been as aggressive as has the Senate on this issue. 
   I would like to briefly highlight some of the other major funding initiatives and provisions of the bill. 
   First, we strengthen the Joint Strike Fighter Program by significantly increasing funding for the demonstration and validation phase of this program while removing funding for the engineering, manufacture, and development phase in the fiscal year 2001. 
   It increases the shipbuilding budget by $603.2 million to over $12 billion. I commend the chairman and ranking member of that committee, the Senator from Maine. This is a very essential investment, an increase in spending, if we are ever to hope to maintain just a 300-ship Navy. 
   It authorizes $98.2 million for military space programs and technologies, $22 million for strategic nuclear delivery vehicle modernization, and $190 million for national and military intelligence programs. 
   We support the Army transformation initiative and we add additional resources that support research and development efforts designed to lead to the future development of that force. 
   Congress has to help the Army. They have some very bold initiatives, but the funding profile for these initiatives in the outyears has a degree of uncertainty which troubles this Senator. But we will try to do our best to work with the distinguished Chief of Staff, the Secretary, and others, in trying to move the Army along in its projected transformation program. 
   We included provisions supporting, under certain conditions, the agreement reached between the Department of Defense and the government of Puerto Rico that is intended to restore relations between the people of Vieques and the Navy and provide for the continuation of live fire training on this island. I commend the former Presiding Officer, the Senator from Oklahoma, for his unrelenting efforts, many visits down to that region to work on this problem. 
   We increased funding for military construction and family housing programs by $430 million to $8.46 billion. 
   We authorized $1.27 billion for the environmental restoration accounts to enhance environmental cleanup of military facilities. 
   We required the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, to: 
   No. 1, develop long-range plans for the sustainment and modernization for U.S. strategic nuclear forces and; 
   No. 2, to conduct a comprehensive review of the nuclear posture of the United States for the next 5 to 10 years. 
   That is an essential program. We must get that evaluation. We have not  done one since 1994. This was of great concern to me. While I commend the President--he did the best he could at the recent summit--it would have been advisable if this Nation had conducted one of these essential programs to make an analysis of the threat--what we have in our inventory, the inventories of the other nations of the world--and, therefore, have a better idea of exactly where this country stands today and what it faces in the future. 
   These are but a few of the highlights of the many initiatives included in this bill. The subcommittee chairmen are truly the architects of this bill. They will discuss in greater detail the provisions in their respective subcommittees. Each should be congratulated for their study and hard work, together with their ranking members. 
   I urge my colleagues to support rapid passage of this bill. We need to send a strong signal of support to our Armed Forces in the field, at sea, and those who have gone before them in the line of duty. We are trustees of this great Nation and we are given that trust by generation after generation after generation of Americans who have gone from the shores of our Nation to defend the cause of freedom in farflung places of the world. These are outstanding men and women now serving in uniform. We have an obligation to them as previous Congresses have had obligations to other generations, engaged in the preserving of our freedom. 
   I, once again, thank my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Michigan, for his work on this committee--indeed, nonpartisan hard work--and the wonderful staff. We put this bill together. 
   I thank the Senator and yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my good friend, I will try to accommodate you on that because it is a very important amendment. I would like to  discuss with you just perhaps the following procedure: That we have the opportunity to have a colloquy and make some presentations about the amendment, and then at that time I will consider laying it aside. I would like to have that opportunity this afternoon. I would very much appreciate the comments of my colleague. 
   It had been my intention to give it to you a little earlier today, but I think it began to get to your people around 11 or 12 o'clock. It had been my intention to bring it up. That is not a fact in any way I wish to conceal. But anyway, that did not come to the attention of the Senator from Michigan. 
   So, yes, we will work on this because in fairness to our colleagues--and I anticipate an overwhelming majority of the Senate would like to support the objectives of this amendment--we should address what could be done to the amendment. 
   I acknowledge that a point of order does lie, and at the appropriate time I would ask for the waiver. Yes. The answer is, we will see what we can do. So I suggest as follows, that we allow other colleagues--the President pro tempore, a member of our committee, the former chairman wishes to address the bill, and the Senator from Colorado wishes to address the bill. There may be others. 
   So let us have some brief opening statements by our two colleagues, and I will adjust the procedure at the request of the Senator from Michigan.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his thoughtful remarks, most particularly the remarks directed at the staff and other members of the committee. He is a hard-working subcommittee chairman, and he is tackling the problem of recruiting and retention. We will hear further from the Senator as we proceed with this bill. 
   I ask unanimous consent we proceed briefly to discuss the pending amendment, and then we will proceed to an amendment to be offered by Senator MCCAIN on food stamps, if that is agreeable as procedure. I say to my colleague, we are moving expeditiously, with Senator ROBERT KERREY anxious to come to the floor. 
   I am not suggesting we will vote on the Warner amendment. We will discuss it, and when Senator MCCAIN comes to the floor, we will take up that amendment. My understanding is he desires less than half an hour. The Senator can indicate the time the other side desires, and then we will proceed to rollcall vote and possibly go to the Kerrey amendment.

   Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Michigan. He indicated to the Senator from Virginia that the pending  amendment, in our collective judgment, is subject to a budget point of order. I have shared with his senior staff that corrective measures were taken to try to bring that amendment within the strictures of the budget amendment so it would not be subject to a point of order. We will show immediately what we intend to do. 
   In the meantime, I will discuss the amendment until Senator MCCAIN comes to the floor. 
   I have introduced this amendment today to change the existing military medical program to encompass in the future retirees over 65. This amendment provides uninterrupted access to both TRICARE and CHAMPUS for military retirees and their families without regard to age. 
   Let me use the term ``retirees.'' Those following this debate might not fully understand. We are talking about men and women in the Armed Forces who put in the necessary number of years of active service or reserve service or guard service, whatever the case may be, to meet the criteria of the various frameworks of law to qualify them for a retirement for such services as they render. That is the class of individuals being referred to. It does not include persons, such as myself, who have short tours of military duties; it does not apply to me. When we use the term ``retirees,'' it is only for those who, by virtue of their services, met the statutory requirements and are eligible to receive retirement benefits. 
   Beginning in World War II, promises were made to military members that they and their families would be provided health care if they served a full career. Of course, we certainly included active duty and to some limited extent the reserve and guard for military health care. We are talking about that category of persons I have just described. 
   Subsequent legislation was enacted which cut off medical benefits for those over age 65, leaving them to depend on the Medicare system, which, in their judgment and in the judgment of others, has proven insufficient, and in other ways it is a breach of promise. 
   So there are many underlying reasons for the legislation I am proposing and the most important is equity. The reputation of those in the military who gave the promise--not knowing there wasn't any statutory foundation--made promises concerning medical care to induce individuals to provide a minimum, say, 20 years of service in most instances, to enable them to have a career in the 
   U.S. military. 
   Not meeting the commitment to provide medical care is a breach of promise made on behalf of our Nation. We have to correct it. These individuals devoted a significant portion of their lives, their careers, in service to our country. I recognize with profound sorrow how we broke the promise to these retirees, certainly when we passed legislation in the early 1960s. We rectify it today. 
   I have examined these issues. There is no statutory foundation providing for entitlement to military health care benefits. It simply does not exist, in my judgment. It is mythical in terms of a foundation law. But good-faith representations were made to these members. Who made the commitment is irrelevant. 
   I have some personal recollection. I was on active duty for a brief time toward the conclusion of World War II, and then I had a second tour of active duty during the Korean conflict-- again, less than 2 years. Nevertheless, I was surrounded by military people. I remember well the inducements given at the conclusion of World War II when so many desired to return to civilian life, requests to stay on active duty; the same thing during the Korean conflict--stay on active duty; continue; give the military the opportunity to show you a career pattern. Part of those representations included the health care package. 
   Our committee has made a determination--and indeed it is a bipartisan decision--that we would fix the issue of health care for our retirees this year. We started with a series of bills, step by step by step. I have acknowledged my gratitude, and indeed other members of the committee acknowledge their gratitude, for what the military retirees did in bringing to our attention certain inadequacies of steps we had taken. Step by step, we have improved the benefits, in this particular phase of legislation, in this fiscal year. We are going to achieve a very significant improvement to the health care benefit, particularly if that amendment is adopted by the Senate. 
   The amendment I bring to the floor repeals the restriction barring 65 or older military retirees and their families from continued access to the military health care system. If included, this provision will provide an equal benefit for all military health care system beneficiaries, retirees, reservists, guardsmen, and their families. This puts all beneficiaries in the same class. 
   It is expensive, but I think it is essential we do this to keep the faith with military retirees. I have had many meetings with both active and retired military on the health care issue. I conducted town hall meetings, discussions with groups who have come to my office, and I have listened to those who have attended the Armed Services Committee hearings regarding their views. They filled the room on a number of occasions. They have come from all areas of the country to talk about this. They are not seeking it solely for themselves. They are seeking to preserve the image of the U.S. military so the young people today who are considering joining at the recruiting stations--going through our ROTC, NROTC, the AROTC, all of these programs--will consider a military career. 
   When they go back home they hear the oldtimers say: Watch out, they broke a promise to me on health care. You are thinking about devoting 20 years of your life to this, or more--watch out. 
   We are going to get rid of the, ``Watch out.'' That is what we are trying to do, get rid of it, because the military retirees are the most cost-effective recruiters that we have in America today. They do not cost us anything. Yet it is those ladies and gentlemen who served this Nation who go out and talk to the youngsters. The youngsters look up to them. The youngsters trust them. They look up to the veterans. They have been there. They have done it. They help tremendously helpful in recruiting. So there are many reasons for making these health care improvements. 
   The amendment is a quantum leap ahead of the provisions already in committee markup at the desk. While the markup includes the comprehensive drug benefit regardless of age, the amendment goes further and provides uninterrupted access to complete health care services. As a result of these initiatives, all military retirees, irrespective of age, will now enjoy the same health care benefits. 
   In town hall meetings, as I said, I listened carefully to the health care concerns of the military, particularly those over 65. We have all done that. The constant theme that runs through their requests is that once they have reached the point at which they are eligible for Medicare, they are no longer guaranteed care from the military health care system. This discriminatory characteristic of our current health care system has been in effect since 1964. It reduces retiree medical benefits and requires a significant change in the manner in which health care is obtained at a point in the lives of our older military retirees when stability and confidence and respect and indeed the love of the community is most needed. This is an amendment which in effect repeals the 1964 law. 
   In order to permit the Department of Defense to plan for restoring the health care benefit to all retirees, my provision would be effective on October 1, 2001. While some may advocate an earlier effective date, it is simply not feasible to expand the medical coverage to the 1.8 million Medicare-eligible retirees overnight. 
   The amendment eliminates the confusing and ineffective transfer of funds from Medicare to the Department of Defense. Military retirees will not be required to pay the high cost of additional basic or supplemental insurance premiums to ensure their health care needs. Military readiness will not be adversely impacted, and our commitment to those who serve their full career will be fulfilled. 
   What is apparent to me is that the will of the Congress, reflecting the will of the Nation, is that now is the time to act on this issue. Access to military health care has reached a crisis point. With the reduction in the number of military hospitals and with the growth  in the retiree population, addressing the health care needs of our older retirees has become increasingly difficult. These beneficiaries should be assured that their health care needs will be met. 
   I am well aware of the legislative alternatives that have been proposed to address military retiree health care needs. I have struggled to examine the most acute needs of these beneficiaries and have struggled to develop a plan that equally benefits all our retirees, not just those fortunate enough to live near a military medical facility, or those fortunate enough to be selected through some sort of lottery to be allowed to participate in the various pilot programs now underway. My goal is to provide health care through a means that is available to all beneficiaries, in an equitable and complete manner. 
   As I have made it clear throughout the year, improving the military health care has been the Committee's top quality of life initiative this year. We have listened. We have, with 
   bipartisan support, enhanced our earlier legislation to include full pharmacy benefits. The amendment now before the Congress complements those earlier efforts and provides an equitable medical benefit, one that is not based on age. It is time to act. 
   At the suggestion of my distinguished colleague, to avoid a point of order, I am looking at not changing the fundamental provisions in the amendment but limiting it to two or possibly three fiscal years. That will bring us within the constraints of the budget resolution. That is an important step. I appreciate my colleague bringing this to our attention. 
   It will have another effect. It will enable the Congress, and initially our committee, to go in, in depth, and study this amendment because it is going to have a very significant impact on the existing infrastructure that is caring for the existing active duty and military retirees under 65. We cannot fully calculate, no matter how hard we look into this, what that impact would be. In my own judgment, it will require the Congress to step forward and provide funds, maybe some legislation, to help the existing infrastructure absorb the over-65 retirees as they return to what was justly promised them when they signed up. 
   So this amendment has the advantages of laying it out, giving a reasonable period of time for the Department and for the Congress to examine it and determine what we have to give by way of additional support. 
   Also--I say this with no political motive whatsoever--it should become and will become, in my judgment, an issue in the Presidential campaign. I am quite certain the retirees will say to both candidates: Look here, the Senate of the United States included this provision. It went over to the conference with the House. It survived. It was signed into law by the President. But it ends. It ends in, say, 2003. I want to hear what the Presidential candidate has to say about this program and whether he will support it, support it in the sense of extending it beyond 2003, support it in the budget requests to provide the additional funds and whatever is necessary to make the infrastructure of our military able to support this program. 
   That is what we are working on. Momentarily I will ask my amendment be modified. I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. This question of pay inversion, let me just sort of describe it. You have a sergeant who has served 5 or 6 years. He has a wife and two children. And then a private comes into his platoon, and he has a number of children, which enables him to qualify for food stamps. 
   Now we add a certain sum of money, which the Senator proposes, and the salary of the private is coming right up very close to the salary of the sergeant. Now, the Senator knows from his long experience in the military--and my experience is far more modest than our distinguished colleague from Arizona, but having served in the Department of Defense, I have watched for many years this question of pay because pay has a tremendous significance not only to the military person who wears the uniform, but to the wife and family. It is a matter of pride. It is recognition for his length of service, for his professionalism, which by virtue of that length of service is greater than the younger people coming on. How do we address that? What guidance do we give, say, the officer corps and senior noncoms who have to deal with this issue, on the assumption that Congress passes it?

   Mr. President, in consultation with the majority leader, the Democratic leader, and my colleague, Senator LEVIN--while I had hoped we could continue with votes tonight--we have now reached the following recommendation in the form of a UC request. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Virginia be recognized to modify his amendment, and following the modification of the amendment, the amendment be laid aside and Senator ROBERT KERREY be recognized to offer an amendment relative to strategic forces, and immediately following the reporting by the clerk, the Senator from Virginia be recognized to offer a second-degree amendment. 
   I further ask consent that following the debate tonight, there be 90 minutes additional beginning at 9:30 a.m. on the strategic forces issue, to be equally divided in the usual form, and following that debate, the amendments be laid aside. 
   I also ask consent that following that debate, the Senate resume the amendment of the Senator from Virginia, amendment No. 3173, and it be laid aside in order for Senator JOHNSON to offer a similar amendment, and there be 2 hours, equally divided, total, for debate on both amendments, and following that debate, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the amendments. 
   I also ask consent that there be no amendments in order to either of the four amendments described above, or the language proposed to be stricken, and there be 2 minutes for explanation prior to each vote. The voting order for tomorrow would be as follows: Warner amendment No. 3173; Johnson amendment; Warner second degree to Kerrey; Kerrey first degree, as amended, if amended.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. 
   I remember so well when the Senator brought this up last year. This is a serious effort by one of the most serious, conscientious Senators with whom I have ever been privileged to serve and one for whom I have the highest personal and professional regard. As I said some months ago, this Senator, too, will miss him. 
   We are not trying to abridge, so to speak, the right of President Clinton. He is the President of the United States. Until the last day, the last hour, the last minute of his term of office, he is entitled to exercise the powers given to him under the Constitution. As the Senator knows so well, being a student of foreign and international affairs, the Constitution designates the President of the United States as that individual who is our chief foreign policy advisor, negotiator, the home realm authority that goes with the Presidency. 
   I don't wish to be critical, but I will be factual. The President simply did not, in the course of his administration, avail himself of the opportunity to do the indepth type of study that I and other colleagues think is necessary before any decision of the type the Senator describes be made. 
   As the Republican candidate, George W. Bush said he would move in some of the directions President Clinton has indicated in terms of trying to seek that level of reduction to the lowest level that still protects the security interests of this country. But George W. Bush would only do that after he had received the advice and counsel of the Department of Defense, and presumably his own Secretary. But Members of the Joint Chiefs would still be carrying forward, a number of them, from one administration to the other, and he would carefully counsel with them as he moved forward. 
   My point is, that study cannot be done in 30, 60, or 90 days, in my judgment, nor should it be done. Let's face it; we have elections coming this November. We have the heat that accompanies any election from the debates that take place between the candidates and, most specifically, the Presidential candidates. To try to overlay a decision of that magnitude and try to have a report generated in 30, 40, 60, 90 days is not, in my judgment, the wise thing to do.

   Mr. WARNER. I certainly cannot rely on a 1997 review as being up to date. Much has occurred in those 2 years, indeed over 2 years, to where we are today. 
   Let me give one example. The Russians are strapped financially. One of the principal motivations to go to a lower level, on behalf of the Russians, is they simply do not have the financial resources to maintain their existing arsenals--the readiness, the safety,  all aspects of those existing arsenals. That is the 1997 assessment. I would not accept that. I would not think President Clinton would want to accept it. 
   What I am telling the Senator is that I would like to reply in totality to the Senator's question by giving my statement and then we can perhaps continue this colloquy. Is that an option?

   Mr. WARNER. In the first place, the law of the land is still intact until the Senate and, indeed, the House are in conference and the President signs this bill. At the moment, the law of the land precludes him from doing that. 
   What I am trying to offer is a relevant course of action whereby the next President has the opportunity to address this situation in the context of a fresh QDR and a fresh up-to-date analysis of all the strategic threats, what the other nations possess, and the like. That is effectively what I am trying to do.

One of the reasons, motivations for the Russians to drive to lower figures as soon as they can possibly get there is the inability fiscally to maintain their own structure in a readiness posture, which equates to what they have had in years past.

   What I am saying to you now is, before this President or any other President begins to make an assessment of a magnitude such as this, they better have in place an up-to-date analysis. That is essentially what I am saying. 
   For the record, I would like to read from the George W. Bush statement:  
   As President, I will ask the Secretary of Defense to conduct an assessment on our nuclear posture and determine how best to meet our security needs. While the exact number of weapons can come only from such an assessment, I will pursue the lowest possible number consistent with our national security.

   Mr. WARNER. I am not going to single out the Foreign Relations chairman, but I make the following observation. That is, this is the law of the land. We are giving the opportunity to the next President to do the necessary studies. 
   Supposing President Clinton took such actions, which under the Constitution I presume he can--except that the law is pretty explicit here, unless it is repealed--and laid down a set of numbers which the next President, whomever it may be, finds unacceptable after he does the requisite studies, not only of the nuclear posture but also the conventional. You have to do them together. Then what happens? 
   The next President is faced with the dilemma of trying to refute what President Clinton did. That would be the worst of both worlds.

I simply will not put my finger on any particular number. Your assumption is reasonable, but I am not going to accede to it.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I might interject myself, as this is drawn, I can easily amend it so that the next President can bring about the necessary infrastructure of studies and have them completed on a timetable to accelerate it so it is not tied to December. The way this is drawn, it is due in December. But I do not interpret that to preclude an earlier assessment by the next President. 
   What I say to the Senator most respectfully is, practically speaking, under the current administration you have several years in which to do this work and bring it up to date. It simply has not been done. 
   I just think, practically speaking, this President would be ill-advised to try in the remaining period of a few months to do this type of important thing and to have these studies suddenly brought up.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, our beloved former colleague, former majority leader, Senator Dole, and others have been very active in raising funds to build a memorial to those who served in World War II. I have been in consultation with him, as have other Members of the Senate, with regard to the success of this memorial effort. 
   It has been successful. Today Senator Dole was proud to receive a donation from the private sector in excess of some $14 million. What a fitting day, the 56th anniversary of D-Day. I called Senator Dole, after consultation with a number of my colleagues, most specifically those colleagues in addition to myself who served in World War II, to get their concurrence in a decision that I had made sometime earlier to the effect that I thought Congress should participate in the funding of a portion of this memorial, a relatively small portion that remains to be raised to reach the goal. I asked Senator Dole to come today, which he did several hours ago. We met. We reached concurrence on the following language, which I will address to the Senate. 
   This is becoming a campaign to build this memorial. It is all America. It is extraordinary. I was very heavily involved in the funding, the legislation and other aspects of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, spent 2 or 3 years before, in fact, or more working with the courageous group that envisioned that magnificent memorial. I can remember when it was just a glimmer in our eyes, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. I think there were 10,000 different designs that came in. I remember going out to Andrews Air Force Base where all the designs for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial were posted. We had a group of experts examine them. 
   Finally, the experts came down on the design which is the current wall. It was designed by a young architectural student or just a graduate, 21 years old. It was as if the hand of providence reached down and touched those individuals who started that campaign, who saw it through at times when we didn't have $5 in the bank and we worked to rescue it. Then this brilliant woman, Maya Lin, created the design out of 10,000 submissions. So much for that history. 
   I have a very modest association with Senator Dole and others who are working on this, but I am happy to present this to the Senate tonight as America's campaign. Citizens across our land, corporations, foundations, veterans groups, civic, fraternal, professional organizations and State legislatures, yes, indeed, State legislatures, have generously contributed to this important cause. Hundreds of thousands of individual Americans, young and old, are rallying behind the opportunity to say thank you to a generation of Americans from the World War II generation. It is to the military men and women who wore the uniforms, but I, as a young person who went into the service in January 1945, remember the war was raging, the Battle of the Bulge had not been completed yet. The campaign in Iwo Jima was about to start. The whole of America was involved in that war, whether you were in uniform or whether you were on the home front. 
   This is a recognition of the contribution of millions of Americans, upwards of 16 million who wore the uniform in that period, and treble that amount at home were involved in the industrial base, all of the activities to support those who were on the battlefronts in the Pacific and in Europe. 
   So it was America's generation of uniformed and those civilians here at home who fought courageously and sacrificed in so many ways to make victory assured against tyranny. 
   The memorial campaign currently is progressing toward raising the $139.6 million needed to build this lasting memorial to the generation that conquered tyranny in the 20th century. While the campaign is very close to the goal, we in the Congress now have an opportunity to show our support and add our shoulder to the wheel. 
   The site on The National Mall has been chosen, preliminary design approved, and the intent is to break ground on Veterans Day weekend, this November. Since the private sector is generously donating the funds needed to design, construct, and maintain the memorial--over $120 million as of today--I believe it is appropriate for Congress also to support the memorial campaign. 
   The amendment I introduce tonight, together with my distinguished colleague from Michigan, Mr. LEVIN, will show the support of Congress for this important project. Specifically, the amendment provides for $6 million to the American Battle Monuments Commission from the revenues of sale of titanium from the national defense stockpile--nonappropriated funds, Mr. President. The $6 million should be used to complete all necessary requirements for the design of, groundbreaking for, construction of, maintenance of, and dedication of the World War II memorial. 
   The Commission plans to complete construction and dedicate the memorial on Veterans Day, 2002. We cannot wait a moment longer to show our support for this project. It is astonishing that over 1,000 men and women each day who proudly wore the uniform, of that 16 million total, are passing on to their great rewards--1,000 a day who die. Now it is the hour for Congress to act and put our shoulder to the wheel to give our expression, along with all other Americans, for this great project. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. I was about to do that. It is so hard for the current generation of people to remember that period. Both of 
   us do. I happen to have been in uniform. I remember where we had a little book of stamps, savings bonds, and you put your quarter stamps in. You were rationing butter, meat, shoes and clothing. We never thought about it. It was our way of backing the men and women in uniform. I remember it was 3 gallons, I think, a week of gasoline that you had. My father was a doctor, and I remember that doctors had an additional allocation of gasoline so they could make hospital calls and visit homes. It was just an extraordinary hour in America, the way there was a total effort.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, does the Senator remember the collection of scrap metal? I will never forget it. In those days, the Nation's Capital, where we lived, had great big trash trucks, and the trucks ran overtime. They would come down the street, and people would come out and put all kinds of scrap metal in the trucks. I remember the person who lived across from me came out with an armful of magnificent guns--shotguns and rifles that belonged to her husband--and the trash guys looked at them and just threw them in the truck. I don't know that those guns ever got to the scrap heap, but I remember that as if it were yesterday.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, S. 2669, to afford members the opportunity to examine the issues related to the complicated military medical program. We desire to change the existing program to encompass, in the future, retirees over age 65. 
   Beginning in World War II promises were made to military members that they and their families would be provided health care if they served a full career. Subsequent legislation was enacted which cut off medical benefits at age 65, leaving them to depend on the Medicare system, which has provided to be inefficient. This is a breach of promise made on behalf of our country to retirees who devoted a significant portion of their lives with careers in service to their country. I recognize with profound sorrow how we broke this promise to these retirees. 
   I have gone back and carefully examined these issues. There is no statutory foundation providing for entitlement to military health care benefits. It does not exist. It is a myth. But good faith representation was made to these members. Who made the commitment is irrelevant. I know personally that these representations were made. I served in the military and heard the same promises. 
   My Committee has made a determination, a bipartisan decision, that we would fix the issue of health care for our older retirees, this year. We have started with a series of bills, strengthening them as we went along, listening to those beneficiaries who use the system. The legislation I bring to the floor today repeals the restriction barring 65 and older military retirees and their families from continued access to the military health care system. If enacted, this legislation will provide an equal benefit for all military health care system beneficiaries, retirees, reservists, guardsmen and families. This puts all beneficiaries in the same class. It is fairly expensive, but we need to do it. 
   The legislation is a quantum leap over the provisions included in the Committee markup of the annual Defense bill. While the markup includes a comprehensive drug benefit regardless of age, the legislation goes further and provides uninterrupted access to complete health care services. 
   As a result of my initiatives, all military retirees, irrespective of age, will now enjoy the same health care benefit. 
   In Town Hall meetings, I have listened carefully to the health care concerns of military retirees--particularly those over age 65 who have lost their entitlement to health care within the current military health care system. The constant theme that runs through their requests is that, once they reach the point at which they are eligible for Medicare, they are no longer guaranteed care from the military health care system. This discriminatory characteristic of our current system--that has been in effect since 1964--reduces retiree medical benefits and requires a significant change in the manner in which health care is obtained at a point in the lives of our older military retirees when stability and confidence are most important. This bill, in effect, repeals the 1964 law. 
   The bill that I am proposing today would eliminate the current discrimination based on age and would permit military retirees and 
   their dependents to be served by the military health care system throughout their lives. Under my proposal, it would not matter whether the military retiree is 47 years old or 77 years old. He or she will be covered by the military health care system while on active duty and throughout their retirement. No new systems will be required, although the existing military system may require assistance from the Congress to strengthen its ability to serve all retirees. This bill eliminates the confusing and ineffective transfer of funds from Medicare to the Department of Defense. Military retirees will not be required to pay the high cost of additional basic or supplemental insurance premiums to ensure their health care needs are met. Military readiness will not be adversely impacted and our commitment to those who served a full career will be fulfilled. 
   In order to permit the Department of Defense to plan for restoring the health care benefit to all retirees, my bill would be effective on October 1, 2001. While some may advocate an earlier effective date, it is simply not feasible to expand the medical coverage to the 1.8 million Medicare-eligible retirees overnight. 
   What is apparent to me is that the will of the Congress, reflecting the will of the Nation, is that now is the time to act on this issue. My bill would eliminate the discriminatory practice that caused concern among our military retirees and will restore full benefits of the military health care system to all retirees. 
   Access to military health care has reached a crisis point. With the reduction in the number of military hospitals and with the growth in the retiree population, addressing the health care needs of our older retirees has become increasingly difficult. These beneficiaries should be assured that their health care needs will be met. They were promised a healthcare benefit, they served to earn a benefit, and our country needs to fulfill the commitments that were made to them. 
   I am well aware of the legislative alternatives that have been proposed to address military retiree health care needs. I have struggled to examine the most acute needs of these beneficiaries and have struggled to develop a plan that equally benefits all our retirees, not just those fortunate enough to live near a military medical facility, or those fortunate enough to be selected through some sort of lottery to be allowed to participate in the various pilot programs now underway. My goal is to provide health care through a means that is available to all beneficiaries, in an equitable and complete manner. 
   As I have made it clear throughout the year, improving the military health care system has been the Committee's top quality of life initiative this year. My Committee has held hearings and listened to a variety of beneficiary representatives. I have traveled throughout my state and listened to the concerns of retirees. I conducted an extensive town hall meeting in Norfolk in March. I have met with many retirees and their representatives at my office, during my travels, and even in social settings. I have listened. 
   This extensive review has allowed me to examine carefully how to approach this issue. The number one priority I  heard from 
   retirees was the importance of access to pharmaceuticals. This inspired me to develop S. 2087, which provided a mail order pharmacy benefit for all military beneficiaries, including--for the first time--all Medicare eligible retirees. S. 2087 also addressed a number of other issues with the military health care system including some critical improvements to the TRICARE program for both active duty and retirees and their family members. I appreciate the bipartisan support of so many of my colleagues in crafting and introducing this critical first step. 
   In my many meetings with retirees, and through discussions with my colleagues, I came to understand the need to further enhance S. 2087. I proposed amendments to the budget resolution to increase the funding available to address retiree health care needs. Then, again with bipartisan support, I crafted a new piece of legislation which improved and enhanced the pharmacy provisions of the original legislation. With special assistance from Senator SNOWE and Senator KENNEDY, the new S. 2486 included an enhanced pharmacy benefit with no enrollment fees, that included both retail and mail order programs. This improved legislation addressed the major unmet need of retirees, access to pharmaceuticals, and provides an equitable benefit, one that is not discriminatory based on age. This legislation was included during Committee consideration of the Fiscal Year 2001 National Defense Authorization Bill, with the overwhelming support of Committee members. 
   The bill now before the Congress compliments my earlier efforts and those of the Committee. This bill, in conjunction with the provisions in the Defense Authorization Bill, would provide a complete health care benefit for all military retirees. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to discuss the importance--the critical need--for early Senate consideration of the defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2001. This bill, which we reported out of the Senate Armed Services Committee on May 12th with bipartisan support, is a good bill which will have a positive impact on our nation's security, and on the welfare of the men and women of  the Armed Forces and their families. It is a fair bill. It provides a $4.5 billion increase in defense spending--consistent with the congressional budget resolution. But, the real beneficiaries of this legislation are our servicemen and women who will not only have better tools and equipment to do their jobs, but an enhanced quality of life for themselves and their families. We must show our support for these brave men and women--many of whom are in harm's way on a daily basis--by passing this important legislation. 
   I am privileged to have been associated with the Senate Armed Services Committee and the development of a defense authorization bill every year of my modest career here in the Senate--a career quickly approaching 22 years. During those years, the committee has used the annual defense authorization bills to address the most fundamental national security issues facing the nation, including: the revitalization of the Armed Forces under President Reagan; the Goldwater-Nichols reorganization of the Department of Defense; the restructuring and reduction of the Armed Forces following the end of the cold war; investigating the tragedies in Beirut, Somalia, and Saudi Arabia (Khobar Towers); and the review and implementation of the lessons learned from military operations in Grenada, Panama, the Persian Gulf, and, most recently, the lessons learned from the operations in the Balkans and, in particular, Kosovo. 
   This year's legislation follows in this fine tradition. The importance of this bill is without question. 
   While this legislation is not the only bill on defense spending, it occupies a very unique and critical role in the congressional defense funding process. Both it's timing and function in the congressional budget process are intended to achieve important goals: fully explore public concerns and fulfill statutory requirements. 
   The venerable soldier-statesman, General George Marshall once stated, ``In a democracy such as ours, military policy is dependent on public opinion.'' 
   The crucial step of ensuring that public opinion on national security policy issues has a forum begins in the Armed Services Committee. Since the beginning of the 106th Congress, the Senate Committee on Armed Services has conducted almost 170 hearings, briefings, and meetings, to fully explore, examine and deliberate matters of concern to the public on national security policy and funding issues. This year, in particular, a sample of the issues addressed in our hearings include: healthcare for military personnel, their families and retirees; the future of the U.S. strategic nuclear arsenal; U.S. military involvement in the Balkans; Defense Department efforts to counter the threat of a terrorist attack; security clearance procedures for defense personnel; immunizing our personnel against anthrax; and ensuring Russia safely secures and disposes of its nuclear arsenal. 
   Mr. President, the discussion on these important issues does not end with consideration in the Armed Services Committee. In fact, in the last twenty years, our Chamber's collective interest in continuing the public debate on pressing national security matters presented in the defense authorization bill has significantly increased. In 1979, the first opportunity I had to be a part of the defense authorization bill process, there were only 11 amendments to the bill during Senate floor debate. Last year, during our debate on the national defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2000, there were over 160 amendments. 
   But we know our responsibility to consider and pass the defense authorization bill goes beyond statutory requirements and historical precedent. We must also be aware of the importance of this measure to our men and women in uniform around the world. 
   U.S. military forces are involved in overseas deployments at an unprecedented rate. Currently, our troops are involved in over 10 contingency operations around the globe. Over the past decade, our active duty manpower has been reduced by nearly a third, active Army divisions have been reduced by almost 50 percent, and the number of Navy ships has been reduced from 567 to 316. During this same period, our troops have been involved in 50 military operations worldwide. By comparison, from the end of the Vietnam war in 1975 until 1989, U.S. military forces were engaged in only 20 such military deployments. 
   In an all-volunteer force, where increasing deployments and operations challenge the capabilities of our military to effectively meet those commitments, as well as challenge the efforts of our military to recruit and retain quality military personnel, we must embrace every opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to our military personnel. The National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2001 sends this important message. 
   Mr. President, I noted previously in these remarks the important role of the defense authorization bill as a means by which the Armed Services Committee and the Senate address many of the today's important military policy matters. I would like to take a moment to highlight the impact of not passing the National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2001. 
   With respect to personnel policy, the committee included leglsiation in the defense authorization bill for fiscal year 2001 to continue to support initiatives to address critical recruiting and retention shortfalls. In this regard, the committee increased compensation benefits and focused on improving military health care for our active duty and retired personnel and their families. 
   Without this bill, there will be: 
   No 3.7 percent pay raise for military personnel; 
   No pharmacy benefit for medicare eligible military retirees; 
   No extension of TRICARE benefits to active duty family members in remote locations; 
   No elimination of health care co-pays for active duty family members in TRICARE Prime; 
   No Thrift Savings Plan for military personnel; 
   No five year pilot program to permit the Army to test several innovative approaches to recruiting; and 
   No transit pass benefit for Defense Department commuters in the Washington area. 
   And, without this bill, the current Department of Defense Medicare subvention demonstration program will not be expanded, as we envisioned, but instead terminated. Currently, the Medicare Subvention demonstration program provides medical services to approximately 28,000 military retirees in Mississippi, Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Washington, and Delaware. Expanding the program would provide medical services to military retirees living in the District of Columbia, Virginia, Ohio, Georgia, Hawaii, and Maryland. 
   Without this bill, almost every bonus and special pay incentive designed to recruit and retain service members will expire December 31, 2000, including: special pay for health professionals in critically short wartime specialities; special pay for nuclear-qualified officers who extend their service commitment; aviation officer retention bonus; nuclear accession bonus; nuclear career annual incentive bonus; Selected Reserve enlistment bonus; Selected Reserve re-enlistment bonus; special pay for service members assigned to high priority reserve units; Selected Reserve affiliation bonus; Ready Reserve enlistment and re-enlistment bonuses; loan repayment program for health professionals who serve in the Selected Reserve; nurse officer candidate accession program; accession bonus for registered nurses; incentive pay for nurse anesthetists; re-enlistment bonus for active duty personnel; 
   enlistment bonus for critical active duty specialities; and Army enlistment bonuses and the extension of this bonus to the other services. 
   The committee has carefully studied the recruiting and retention problems in our military. We have worked hard to develop this package to increase compensation and benefits. We believe it will go a long way to recruit new servicemenbers and to provide the necessary incentives to retain mid-career personnel who are critical to the force. 
   Mr. President, on many occasions I have shared my concerns about the threats posed to our military personnel and our citizens, both at home and abroad, by weapons of mass destruction: chemical, biological, radiological and cyber warfare. Whether these weapons are used on the battlefield or by a terrorist within the United States, we, as a nation, must be prepared. 
   Without this bill, efforts by the committee to continue to ensure that the  DOD is adequately funded and structured to deter and defeat the efforts of those intent on using weapons of mass destruction would not be implemented. Efforts that would not go forward without this bill include: establishing a single point of contact for overall policy and budgeting oversight of the DOD activities for combating terrorism; fully deploying 32 WMD-CST (formerly RAID) teams by the end of fiscal year 2001; the establishment of an Information Security Scholarship Program to encourage the recruitment and retention of Department of Defense personnel with computer and network security skills; and the creation of an Institute for Defense Computer Security and Information Protection to conduct research and critical technology development and to facilitate the exchange of information between the government and the private sector. 
   Mr. President, I would like to briefly highlight some of the other major initiatives in this bill that would be at risk without Senate floor consideration of the defense authorization bill: 
   Without this bill, multi-year, cost-saving spending authority for the Bradley Fighting Vehicle and UH-60 ``Blackhawk'' helicopter would cease. 
   Without this bill, there would not be a block buy for Virginia Class submarines. Without the block buy, there would be fewer opportunities to save taxpayer dollars by buying components--in a cost-effective manner--for the submarines. 
   All military construction projects require both authorizations as well as appropriations. Without this bill, over 360 military construction projects and 25 housing projects involving hundreds of critical family housing units would not be started. 
   The Military Housing Privatization Initiative would expire in February 2001. Without this bill, the program would not be extended for an additional three years, as planned. The military services would not be able to privatize thousands of housing units and correct a serious housing shortage within the Department of Defense. 
   Mr. President, it has been said that, ``Example is the best General Order.'' The Senate needs to take charge, move out, consider and pass the National Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2001. This legislation is important to the nation and to demonstrating to the men and women in uniform, their families and those who have gone before them, our current and continuing support and commitment to them on behalf of a grateful nation.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on May 16, 2000, the United States Senate took a procedural vote on Senator DASCHLE's amendment to S. 2521, the Military Construction Appropriations Bill. Senator DASCHLE lost this procedural vote by a vote of 42-54. 
   I did not support the Daschle amendment at that time because it was a procedural amendment to an unrelated bill. This unrelated Daschle amendment kept the Senate away all day from the important business of the Military Construction Appropriations Bill. In addition, it appeared that the Daschle amendment might indefinitely delay consideration of this important bill. As Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have a responsibility to secure passage of the important Military Construction Appropriations Bill. This bill provides critically needed funding for military construction projects, improves the quality of life for the men and women who are serving our country in the armed forces, and sustains the readiness of our armed forces. These areas are traditionally underfunded, and this bill provides the necessary funds to help make up for this shortfall. For these reasons, I did not support the Daschle amendment when it came before me on a procedural vote on May 16, 2000. 
   Subsequent to the procedural vote on the Daschle amendment on May 16, 2000, Senators LOTT and DASCHLE reached an agreement to have two up or down votes--one on the aforementioned Daschle amendment and another on an amendment to be offered by Senator LOTT. Under the agreement, debate on the amendments was limited by a time agreement. 
   Once this leadership agreement was reached, it became apparent that the Daschle amendment would no longer indefinitely delay the Military Construction Appropriations Bill. Therefore, my previous objections to this amendment were no longer relevant. 
   The Daschle amendment is a ``Sense of the Senate'' amendment. After stating a number of findings, the amendment states, among other things, that it is the Sense of the Senate that ``Congress should immediately pass a conference report to accompany'' the Juvenile Justice Bill that includes the Senate passed gun-related provisions. 
   During the Senate's debate of the Juvenile Justice Bill in May of 1999, I supported the Lautenberg amendment, and other amendments to close the gun show loophole in the Brady Act. I also supported an amendment to require licensed firearm dealers to provide a secure gun storage or safety device when a handgun is sold, delivered or transferred. Unfortunately, the Juvenile Justice Bill has been locked in a House and Senate Conference Committee. 
   I remain firm in my stance on these issues. I certainly hope that House and Senate conferees can reach an agreement in conference on the Juvenile Justice Bill. And, I will continue to support the common-sense gun provisions that passed the Senate during the Juvenile Justice debate. I believe the Senate passed gun-related amendments to the Juvenile Justice Bill will help keep guns out of the hands of convicted felons and increase public safety without infringing on the rights of law-abiding citizens. Therefore, when it became clear that the Daschle amendment would not indefinitely delay consideration of the Military Construction Appropriations Bill, I supported this amendment and voted for it on May 17, 2000.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation today with Senator KENNEDY, Senator SARBANES, Senator JEFFORDS, and Senator ROBB to designate the Washington Opera as the National Opera. 
   The Washington Opera has been an innovative leader in bringing to the metropolitan Washington area exceptional performances since 1956. The company has enjoyed tremendous success in the community over the years. Since 1980, the company has grown from 16 performances of four operas to 80 performances of eight operas for the 2000 season. 
   Mr. President, the purpose of this legislation is to recognize in our nation's capital an opera of national significance. Let me be clear to my colleagues that this legislation does not extend any Federal responsibilities or obligation for funding to the Washington Opera. It would not become part of any Federal activity. Today, the Washington Opera enjoys a contractual relationship with the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts for use of its facilities. It is not affiliated with the Kennedy Center in any way other than being named as the resident opera company. This is an honorary designation, but there is no financial support for the opera from the Kennedy Center. 
   The legislation is only intended as a means of recognition of opera in our Nation's capital and its mission to bring to the nation a forum to highlight our musical heritage. Under its  new name, the National Opera will bring contained performances of American opera to the stage. 
   The history of the Washington Opera and its commitment to bringing opera as an art form to the Washington area community is to be commended. The Washington Opera's Education and Community Programs are dedicated to educating future audiences and making the experience of opera more available to residents of the region. Since 1992, over 150,000 students have participated in these programs. Today, there are over 22 programs that provide performance experiences, curriculum activities, in-school artist visits, professional development opportunities for teachers and young artists, and other activities that bring opera into our schools and communities. 
   Mr. President, with this national recognition comes the obligation for the Washington Opera to undertake additional programs to serve a larger national audience, expand community outreach for underprivileged youth, and other missions that embody a larger national presence. I am confident that the opera will enthusiastically accept this challenge.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the exceptionally distinguished service of Lieutenant General Ronald R. Blanck, United States Army, who has distinguished himself as the Army's 39th Surgeon General and Commander, U.S. Army Medical Command General, from 1 October 1996 to 31 August 2000. 
   In addition to serving as the principal medical staff advisor to the Army Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Blanck also serves as Commander of the United States Army Medical Command, which administers a 6.6 billion-dollar worldwide-integrated health care system with 46,000 military personnel and 26,000 civilian employees. During his tenure, Lieutenant General Blanck concentrated on three major areas, readiness, quality of healthcare, and innovation, to ensure the provision of comprehensive, quality healthcare to soldiers, retirees, and their family members. Lieutenant General Blanck implemented a new set of combat support training standards; energized the Army's Medical Reengineering Initiative; and organized an array of Special Medical Augmentation Response Teams to provide global, rapid-deployment capabilities for local, state and federal agencies. He provided oversight for the Defense Department Anthrax Vaccine Immunization Program; and established a successful, Army-wide Medical Protection System to track all immunization data. In addition, he established new partnerships with civilian trauma centers to provide appropriate hands-on training and experience for military surgical trauma teams. 
   Lieutenant General Blanck has been a leader in the development and use of clinical practice guidelines and helped implement the Department of Defense clinical practice guidelines partnership with the Department of Veterans Affairs. As a direct result of his initiatives, Army medical treatment facilities have been accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO), with scores consistently above 90, the highest in the history of the Army Medical Department, with three prestigious Army hospitals receiving perfect scores of 100 on their JCAHO surveys during the past year. Lieutenant General Blanck has championed the use of modern technologies by the Department of Defense and the Army Medical Department. He supported an innovative Simulation Center initiative, and promoted the dissemination of information about chemical and biological terrorism. He has also enthusiastically advocated the introduction of new, advanced technologies into patient care, including: (1) the Medical Personal Information Carrier which stores soldiers' medical and personal information, (2) a dry fibrin sealant bandage, developed by Army research in cooperation with the American Red Cross, (3) multiple and extensive uses of telemedicine, (4) new initiatives to speed evacuation of wounded soldiers from the battlefield. 
   Mr. President, Lieutenant General Blanck is a great credit to the Army and the Nation. Even with all of the extraordinary accomplishments during his thirty-two years of service, General Blanck will be remembered mostly for his great compassion for people, his loyalty to his country and his inspirational leadership.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. We have been privileged to serve together for many years. The Senator draws on personal experience, having served in World War II in the concluding chapters of the war in Europe. The Senator's opinion, in my judgment, is to be respected. I regret we are on different sides. 
   As I listened very carefully to the speech, the theme time and time again was, our allies, our allies. And that is important. Senator BYRD yesterday recounted the history from World War I and World War II. Time and time again, we have always been in partnership with the allies for that portion of Europe. We will do so in the future. 
   We have 100,000 in NATO. Time and time again, I get the feeling that people who are trying to strike this provision have no confidence in the ability of the Congress of the United States, acting at the direction and request of the next President, to make a proper decision for national security. 
   Those who select a vote to take this out, think about your constituency: $2 billion of taxpayers' money expended on Kosovo; yet there is no conclusion as to how this is going to be spent over the years, how long we will be there. What we are trying to do is put some discipline in the Congress of the United States to assume its responsibilities 
   and to involve itself in a coequal way with the President of the United States. That is not asking too much for hometown America which is supplying these dollars and supplying the men and women who proudly wear their uniform. 
   I yield the floor.

   I thank the distinguished Senator from New Jersey. This clearly shows this is a bipartisan issue. It is not a political issue. We are not directing anything at our President. We are directing it solely, as my distinguished colleague said, at fulfilling our duties  under the Constitution. I am grateful for his pointing out that the United States, in the Korean conflict, where we have had a large number of nations, stands alone today. In Iraq, we stand alone with Great Britain containing that situation, after a dozen allies in 1991 helped us with that conflict. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his kind remarks. But I want to draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that we--the U.S. taxpayers--have already spent $4.5 billion on this Kosovo operation. The President did not ask for any money for the year 2000. That is why we are faced with this supplemental of another $2 billion. So $4.5 billion plus $2 billion is $6.5 billion. Then the authorization bill, which we are now working on, and the appropriations for the next fiscal year, has another $1.6 to $1.7 billion. 
   Wake up, colleagues. We are shoveling money out of here as fast as we can swing our arms, without giving, I think, due consideration.

   Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague for his kind personal references. Indeed, we have worked together as a team. On this one, we divide. 
   Regarding his concluding remarks on world leadership, in this debate we are constantly talking about our allies. I am concerned about the hometowns in Virginia that are shoveling out taxpayer funds, billions and billions of dollars. I have already added it up--well over $6 billion. 
   There has really been no debate or action in this Senate. We have an obligation in the Congress to speak before we shovel these funds out in incredible sums. It is from the towns and villages in our State and other States from whence we get these brave young men and women, who put on these uniforms, as the Senator and I have in the past, and march forth from the shores of our country into harm's way. I think Congress has to stand up and be accountable in those decisions and support the President. I have no fear that this institution will support the next President of the United States in his request, if he comes forward and says: It is my intention not to just leave this indefinitely but here is my plan to keep our troops over there. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for his very important contribution to the debate.  It has been one of the best debates on foreign policy we have had in the Senate I think this year. I appreciate his references to the Senator from Virginia. 
   We have accomplished much of what we set out to do in this amendment. I bring to the Senator's attention that yesterday there were 263 votes in the House of Representatives in support of the principles that are embodied in the Byrd-Warner amendment. The other body spoke just yesterday. But I say to my dear friend that I am willing to calculate we have spent close to $20 billion in Bosnia and Kosovo. I will place it in the RECORD. 
   This is, in a sense, handing out another blank check for $1.8 billion in this supplemental for Kosovo with no clear, decisive action for the Congress requiring a strategy as to when our troops can hopefully be considered along with others to be withdrawn. 
   I say to my good friend, how many of my colleagues are calling back home today to get the sentiments of hometown America and put them against----

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will speak for a minute awaiting Senator LEVIN's appearance on the floor. 
   As we approach the desk for this historic vote, and it will be a historic vote, I point out to my colleagues we have in the past contributed, in fiscal year 1999, $4.5 billion for this action in Kosovo. We are about to vote on, in a sense, another blank check, for $1.85 billion. In the bill I am working on and will bring to the floor hopefully next week and pass on to the appropriators, there is authorization for another $1.65 billion for a total of up to $8 billion for Kosovo. 
   I think we have an obligation to the people of our Nation in hometown America who are paying this through their taxes, who are sending forth the young men and women into harm's way beyond our shores. We have an obligation to them. If we are going to vote to strike the Byrd-Warner amendment, in essence we are saying Congress is out of it. It is another blank check. Add up Bosnia; it is about $11 billion to $12 billion. We are approaching $20 billion for U.S. participation in this critical part of the world. 
   I certainly agree it is in our security interests to have been with NATO in Bosnia, then with NATO in Kosovo. We did the bulk of the fighting in the 78-day war. How proud we are of the men and women of the Armed Forces. Now we have an obligation to those serving today. For an indefinite commitment, there is no one who can come forth in this Chamber--and I ask anyone to come forth in this Chamber--and give any time expectation as to when this commitment terminates. 
   The Byrd-Warner amendment, within the confines of the constitutional responsibility of the Congress, is trying to lay down a strategy and some information for the American people who are paying the bills and sending forth the troops. To strike this language is back to business as usual, blank checks which will total, just in Kosovo alone, $8 billion. 
   Then the section about our allies. They fought bravely with us to the extent they had the air assets, the lift assets, the highly technical guided ammunitions. They fought bravely. This is no disrespect to any soldier, sailor, airman, or marine of any nation that fought in that the 78-day war. 
   In a sense, we are fighting for their own interest in knowing how long they are going to be there. No one can come to this floor and controvert the Senator from Virginia saying in January and February and March of this year they were falling behind in their commitments they made following that war to provide economic assistance, humanitarian assistance, police. 
   We got their attention. I thank Senator STEVENS, Senator INOUYE. It was a bipartisan effort. Many Members came to the floor and laid in the RECORD the intention to bring this issue on the first legislative vehicle we could. That is before the Senate today, the requirement for our allies to fulfill their commitments. They are doing that. I am confident that the President can make the certification as required in a section of this amendment and certify that the allies have at long last met their commitments. 
   This is a historic vote. It affects not only our commitments in this worldwide and important place in the Balkan region but all the other commitments. It will set a standard by which the Congress will have said that we are going to enter our decision power under the Constitution as we send forth men and women of the Armed Forces into harm's way and expend the taxpayers' money in such enormous sums.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it had been my hope as cosponsor of the bill to have the opportunity to make some rebuttal arguments to those who are about to speak. Since that will not be possible, I will take my 2 minutes to sum up the manner in which I view this entire debate of those who have come to strike the Byrd-Warner inclusion in this appropriations bill. 
   I am reminded of the immortal words of a great President, Franklin Roosevelt, when he said: The only thing this Nation has to fear is fear itself. Underlying the debate of those who are considering striking this language is the fear that the next President will be unable to convince the Congress to do what is right for America. That is what it is--fear. 
   I say to those who have fear, if there is not a simple majority, but 51 votes, to support the next President, then logic says to me that the continuation of those deployments in Kosovo are not in the public interest or the national security interest of this country. It is as simple as that. If there are not 51 votes for it, we should not be there, and we may as well stand up and face the world and say that this body, with coequal responsibility, has exercised its voice. 
   I committed earlier in this debate and I commit now that if the next President makes a strong case, he will have the Senator of Virginia voting and supporting him. I have confidence in this institution to make the right decision, and in this Senator's heart, he has no fear. I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am proud to come to the floor once again to defend and explain the Kosovo amendment which I have sponsored with the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator BYRD, and other, well-respected, conscientious colleagues--despite the accusations of some to the contrary. That amendment is now part of the bill before the Senate. 
   Several weeks ago, Senator BYRD and I joined forces to draft a plan of action that would lead to a vote or votes on the continued deployment of U.S. troops in Kosovo. For almost a year now, thousands of U.S. troops have been patrolling the streets of Kosovo as part of a NATO-led peacekeeping operation--with no end in sight. The Congress has been silent; that must end. Congress is about to appropriate, pursuant to a request by our President, almost 2 billion U.S. taxpayer dollars for military operations in Kosovo without any knowledge of when our troops will come home. 
   The purpose of our legislation is twofold. First, it requires the Congress to fulfill its co-equal constitutional responsibility, with the President, to make decisions--by vote--that are in the best interest of the nation, and particularly the men and women of the Armed Forces deployed in the Kosovo operation. This is a responsibility that the Congress has consistently failed to exercise for many years with respect to other military operations. Second, the legislation sends the message that other nations and organizations must follow through on their commitments of assistance for Kosovo if U.S. troops are to remain a part of the military force in Kosovo. 
   The legislation that is before the Senate today has three main objectives. First, it terminates funding for the continued deployment of U.S. ground combat troops in Kosovo after July 1, 2001, unless the President seeks and receives Congressional authorization to keep troops in Kosovo. Second, the legislation requires the President to develop a plan, in consultation with our allies, to turn the ground combat troop element of the Kosovo peacekeeping operation entirely over to other nations by July 1, 2001. Third, related to today's operations in Kosovo, and to signal to the Europeans the need for them to fulfill their commitments for implementing peace and stability in Kosovo, the legislation withholds 25 percent of the emergency supplemental funding for military operations in Kosovo until the President certifies that our allies are making adequate progress in meeting the commitments they made to the Kosovo peacekeeping process. If the President does not make that certification by July 15 of this year, the funding held in reserve can only be used for the safe, orderly and phased withdrawal of U.S. troops from Kosovo, unless Congress votes otherwise. 
   While I expected opposition to this legislation, I am, quite frankly, surprised by the misleading statements which are being used to describe our effort. Those of us who support this legislation are being accused of endangering the lives of U.S. troops, providing aid and comfort to the enemy--Milosevic, and sounding the ``death knell'' of NATO. According to General Clark, the measures contained in this legislation, ``are unlikely to encourage our European allies to do more. In fact, these measures would invalidate the policies, commitments and trust of our Allies in NATO, undercut U.S. leadership worldwide, and encourage renewed ethnic tension, fighting and instability in the Balkans.'' There is simply no basis in fact for making such statements. Why is the Administration so afraid of letting the Congress have a voice, by vote, on our continued military presence in Kosovo? We are elected by the people of our nation to speak and vote in their 
   best interests. 
   Have the opponents really looked at this legislation? It is not a ``cut and run'' from Kosovo. We are not deserting our allies. Nowhere in this legislation is there an automatic, mandated withdrawal of U.S. troops from Kosovo  on a date certain. In every case, what we have done is make the continued U.S. ground combat troop presence in Kosovo subject to a vote by the Congress. We are requiring a Congressional affirmation of a Presidential decision that affects the security of our nation and the welfare of the men and women of the Armed Forces deployed overseas and their families here at home. That was the intention of the Framers of the Constitution in giving the Congress co-equal power for such decisions. 
   I point out to our critics that this legislation was carefully crafted to impact only the ground combat element of our presence in Kosovo. Even if the Congress decides, over a year hence, not to support our continued military presence in Kosovo, the U.S. would still be able to provide support elements to the NATO-led mission in Kosovo, and would be able to respond to an emergency situation with combat units. 
   General Clark has pointed out that other nations--primarily our NATO allies--contribute 85 percent of the troops that make up the Kosovo operation. To now say that the possible elimination of only part of the remaining 15 percent U.S. forces would mean that ``the sky is falling'' calls into question the importance of the allied contribution to this effort. Is General Clark really saying that the 85 percent of the troops in Kosovo are of such little consequence, little effectiveness, in the effort to achieve peace and stability in that troubled region? I would hope that is not his message to our allies. 
   One of the main reasons we are proceeding with this legislation is out of a deep sense of concern for the safety and security of our men and women in uniform in Kosovo. They are making sacrifices, they are facing daily risk to their personal safety. We, as their elected representatives, with co-equal responsibility under the Constitution for deploying troops into harm's way, must fully examine and debate this issue and--ultimately--vote on whether or not U.S. troops should remain in Kosovo. That is our responsibility, and we owe our brave servicemembers no less. We cannot--we must not--allow the situation in Kosovo to drift on endlessly, as we stand idly by, unwilling to act. 
   Over the past decade, as our military has been reduced by a third, U.S. troops have been involved in overseas deployments at an unprecedented rate. According to General Hugh Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, ``Two factors that erode military readiness are the pace of operations and funding shortfalls. There is no doubt that the force is much smaller than it was a decade ago, but also much busier.'' The increasing frequency of these contingency operations--which involve extensive, repeated separation from family and home--is one of the major causes for the problems the military is having in recruiting and retaining quality personnel. The United States has far too many commitments around the world, our military is stretched too thin; we cannot have an open-ended, decades-long military deployment to the Balkans. It is time for Congress to act. 
   I was very troubled by what I discovered during my January trip to Kosovo. I was a supporter of our military involvement in Kosovo; in fact, I was a principal sponsor of the resolution for authorization by the Congress of the air war. But I was disturbed by what I saw in January. 
   I found U.S. troops running towns and villages--acting as mayors, police, and jailers; 
   I found U.S. troops--in groups of 2 or 3--guarding individual houses and churches, escorting Serb families to market; I found U.S. troops concerned with the slow pace of the UN's effort to rebuild the region, and frustrated by the seemingly endless and mindless cycle of ethnic violence in Kosovo--Albanian on Serb, Serb on Albanian, and Albanian on Albanian. 
   When I visited Bernard Kouchner, the UN Administrator in Kosovo, I found a man frustrated with the level of progress he had been able to achieve; I found a man pleading for help from the international community. ``I have no money'' was a phrase I heard over and over as we sat in KFOR Headquarters in Pristina, in one of the few buildings in the city with power--but no running water--as most of Kosovo was cold and dark during the winter. He told me that many pledges and commitments of assistance had been made at international conferences, but he could not pay the government workers or fix the power supply with pledges. He needed money. 
   Until he, and others, are able to make progress, our troops will continue to be policemen and mayors and mediators--targets of the frustration of the people of Kosovo, and increasingly at risk. We saw some of the danger that our troops face during the violence in Mitrovica. That will only increase if an adequate economic and security infrastructure does not quickly materialize in Kosovo. 
   I returned from that trip in January determined to do something to change the situation I found in that troubled region. I could not turn a blind eye to what I had seen. The legislation before the Senate is the result. Some may not agree with the approach, but I strongly believe that it is the proper course of action. 
   Let me address some of the charges that have been leveled against the proponents of this legislation. The one that most troubles me is the charge that we are putting U.S. troops at risk because of this legislation. Who among us really believes that Senator ROBERT BYRD, Senator TED STEVENS, Senator DANIEL INOUYE, and the many others who have either cosponsored or voted for this amendment--15 of whom are veterans--would do anything to put U.S. troops at risk? We have devoted our careers to fighting for the well-being or our troops. I say to those who make this charge, we are trying to take action to address the risks our troops in Kosovo face everyday--which we must no longer ignore. 
   My office recently received a communication from a soldier in Kosovo describing a recent confrontation with local citizens. I would like to quote parts of this e-mail so that my colleagues can understand the day-to-day reality of our troops in Kosovo:  
   The entire village went out into the street, erected a barricade and as the squad (of my soldiers) came out they were pelted with rocks and other debris ..... As we moved in people were hitting us with sticks and actually hitting us with their fists ..... By the time of the linkup I was punched in the face, hit with a stick and got in a wrestling match. ..... Several hundred moved up the hill and started throwing rocks, tree limbs, fire wood, and everything else they could get their hands on. After getting hit in the head by a large rock and getting smashed across the back with a tree limb I gave the order for the soldiers to open fire with nonlethal munitions.  
   How long will it take until one of these incidents turns deadly? Those who vote against this amendment vote to leave our troops in these situations indefinitely. 
   I would like to address a particular issue raised in the letter which General Clark sent to Senator LEVIN concerning this legislation; that is, General Clark's contention that this legislation ``is unlikely to encourage European allies to do more.'' On this, General Clark, 
   there is already evidence to the contrary. In the several months since I first began discussing my original amendment--which is now incorporated in the Byrd-Warner amendment--there has been progress. I quote from a March 18, 2000, letter from Dr. Kouchner, in which he details results: ``I very much appreciate the efforts that you have made so far which have been instrumental in improving our budget situation. Existing donor pledges have now been honored. The next challenge will be to get new donor pledges and to ensure that the pledges for the reconstruction budget of 17 November 1999 do materialize.'' Dr. Kouchner, we are continuing our efforts to help. 
   I would like to address one other issue, one that was raised in a recent editorial by the Ranking Member of the Foreign Relations Committee--an editorial in which he accused the supporters of this legislation of being isolationists, a new charge for most of us. In this editorial, Senator BIDEN states, ``Some would even condition U.S. assistance on actions of the European Union, an abdication of our prerogatives in decision-making that ought to horrify conservatives.'' Since that is directly aimed at the certification requirement which I contributed to this legislation, I will respond. I point out to my colleagues that our President has already conditioned ``U.S. assistance''--that is, U.S. troops--on the actions of others. I remind my good friend from Delaware that the exit  strategy for our troops in Kosovo--as it is for our troops in Bosnia--is directly linked to the actions of the UN, the EU, the OSCE, and others in achieving civil implementation goals. As Secretary Cohen stated in an October 15, 1999 letter to the Congress, ``The duration of the requirement for U.S. military presence (in Kosovo) will depend on the course of events ..... The military force will be progressively reduced based on an assessment of progress in civil implementation and the security situation.'' This legislation uses the same link--the same tie to the actions of others--already adopted by the Administration. If this logic is good for one side in this debate, I say to my good friend, then it is good for the other side as well. 
   I encourage my colleagues to read this legislation carefully; examine it for what it does, and especially for what it does not do. Consider the well-respected, conscientious group of supporters. And judge for yourself what is the best course of action.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to indicate my reasons for not supporting the Daschle amendment, amendment number 3148 to S. 2521, the military construction appropriations bill. 
   The Daschle amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. After starting a number of findings, the amendment states that it is the sense of the Senate that ``Congress should immediately pass a conference report to accompany'' the juvenile justice bill that includes the Senate passed gun-related provisions. 
   During the Senate's debate of the juvenile justice bill in May of 1999, I supported the Lautenburg amendment, and other amendments to close the gun show loophole in the Brady act. I also supported an amendment to require licensed firearms dealers to provide a secure gun storage or safety device when a handgun is sold, delivered or transferred. Unfortunately, the juvenile justice bill has been locked in a House and Senate conference committee. 
   Let me be clear, I remain firm in my stance on these issues. I certainly hope that House and Senate conferees can reach an agreement in conference on the juvenile justice bill. And, I will continue to support the common-sense gun provisions that passed the Senate during the juvenile justice debate. I believe the Senate passed gun-related amendments to the juvenile justice bill will help keep guns out of the hands of convicted felons and increase public safety without infringing on the rights of law-abiding citizens. 
   Despite the fact that I agree with the statement in the Daschle amendment that Congress should immediately pass a conference report on the juvenile justice bill that includes the Senate passed gun-related amendments, I do not support the Daschle amendment. The Daschle amendment is not a legislative amendment and is simply a procedural maneuver. The Daschle amendment has no force in law and no relationship to the underlying purposes of the military construction appropriation bill. 
   As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have a responsibility to secure passage of the important military construction appropriations bill. This bill provides critically needed funding for military construction projects, improves the quality of life for the men and women who are serving our country in the armed forces, and sustains the readiness of our armed forces. These areas are traditionally underfunded, and this bill provides the necessary funds to help make up for this shortfall. 
   The Daschle amendment is an unrelated sense-of-the-Senate amendment to the military construction appropriation bill. Sense-of-the-Senate resolutions have no force in federal law. Voting for this amendment places vitally needed funding for our Armed Forces in peril by jeopardizing passage of the overall bill. 
   Again, I continue to support the commonsense gun related provisions that passed the Senate as part of the juvenile justice bill. When these matters come before the United States Senate in a substantive, rather than a procedural capacity, and on a related piece of legislation, I look forward to voting for them once again.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, may I take 1 minute to state the Byrd-Warner amendment. We would simply change the date from July 1, 2001, to October 1, 2001, the date on which funds would be prohibited for continued deployment of ground combat troops. Second is one of the benchmarks the President has to certify. It would be reduced from 33 percent to 25 percent, thereby making it possible, in the judgment of this Senator, that the President would be able to make the certification as required by the amendment.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished leader, who came to this body following an earlier distinguished career in the House, is he aware of the overwhelming vote in the House today for basically the principles that are incorporated in the Byrd-Warner amendment? The vote was 264 to 140-some, something along in there. 
   I think that is a clear indication that the people in the United States of America want, first, participation by the coequal branch, i.e., the Congress; and, secondly, for us to address this matter in a responsible way before we shovel out $2 billion more for this type of operation.

   Mr. WARNER. That is precisely why, when I visited the region in January of this year--I try to go every 6 months or every several months. The officials told me, the U.N., the E.U., all of them said: Senator, if they just keep the money flowing and the police flowing, then eventually we can get some timetable for the withdrawal not only of U.S. forces but other military forces and turn it over to a civil society to operate itself with such security as needed along the borders. 
   We are not pulling out. We are 100 or so miles away for some of our troops in the NATO installations. The sky is not falling in. 
   The Senator raises a key point. For General Clark to come up and say, in effect, that if we take out just the U.S. combat troops--again, leaving 100,000 in NATO, just a short distance away--Milosevic would read that as a signal and come charging across the borders--what does that say to the other allies? There are 32 nations providing armed forces in the KFOR force of a total in excess of 40,000. It says ``You don't count.''

In his own right, he proudly graduated from West Point and served his hitch in the U.S. Army. He reminds me of that when we get excessive naval funds through our committee. We thank the Senator. While I may not agree with his conclusion, his participation on this committee and this matter is of great importance to us.

   Mr. WARNER. It is just a question to my distinguished colleague. He used the term ``inaction by Congress.'' Indeed, I say to my colleague, Congress has been inactive on a number of occasions when we sent our troops abroad and expended our taxpayers' money. That is one of the purposes of this bill. To establish a precedent of inaction not conceived by the Founding Fathers--indeed, we are given coequal powers. 
   I want to go back to the bill itself, on page 71, ``congressional priority procedures,'' and ``joint resolutions, defined.'' 
   I interpret that clause in the Byrd-Warner language that only one Senator is required, I say to my distinguished colleague. One Senator can bring forth that resolution. I commit to you that I will be that Senator, if necessary. So there will not be, in my judgment, inaction by the Congress after the President sends his report up.

   Mr. WARNER. First, the Byrd-Warner amendment is very carefully drawn so that the next President of the United States in following up with President Clinton's report with the next President's report. It is not required of him to wait until July as is now written. Indeed, Senator BYRD and I thought we would give it additional time. If the next President perceives that there is some turbulence and doubt in the minds of our allies, he can file the report. Then this Senator pledges under the bill within the 10 days to come forward with that resolution and have this body act. I will guarantee. I will draft 
   somebody in the House to do the same thing.

   Mr. WARNER. At some point, would the Senator allow asking questions? I find very troublesome the accusation by General Clark. I have always believed General Clark to be a very brilliant field commander, despite the fact he was reversed in his desire to do certain things in Kosovo by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Secretary of Defense, time and time again. As a matter of fact, I was a supporter with him on the ground troops issue, traveled with him the day before the hostilities ceased. 
   That we would do something to place in harm's way those who serve today and those who serve for the remainder of the time--I looked, as a matter of record, at the cosponsors of this resolution. I think I counted 10 persons who are veterans of previous wars and engagements. For General Clark to be pointing a finger at up to a dozen Members and saying, we veterans are taking an action endangering our people--let me ask this question.

   Mr. WARNER. I say to my colleague, 23 Senators have already taken an action. They voted on it in the Appropriations Committee. They have taken that action. And you go back and count among the 23 those who proudly served in uniform for this country. 
   Let me turn to another point. How do our allies feel, listening to this debate where we are saying they are of little consequence? If we pull out 2,000 or 3,000 ground combat troops, leaving the support troops in place, why, the sky is falling in, says General Clark. What does that say to the other 30-plus nations that have their troops there: You are ineffective; You won't hold the line; You break ranks? 
   I think that is a fallacious argument.

<DOCNO>106-warner-va-44-20000517</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WARNER. General Clark, again, is a Rhodes scholar, a brilliant officer, but I do not agree with him about his perception of the Congress of the United States. I believe the next President, whoever that may be--ALBERT GORE or George W. Bush--will be able to assess this situation, come to the Congress, make the case, and the Congress will act responsibly. That can be done in an accelerated fashion. It does not have to wait until next July. Indeed, we tried in the amendment to give more time. 
   So I close by saying to all those who want to join behind General Clark, I feel very strongly that that is a pretty severe indictment of the chain of events that are to be carefully undertaken, first, by President Clinton; second, by the next President of the United States, and then by the Congress. We must remember that we are a coequal branch. We repeat that and repeat that, but in Europe their parliamentary forms of government are quite different than ours. There is not the coequal stature with the constitution in place, with regard to their various forms of legislature, or general assemblies, whatever the case may be. They are quite different and they have to be respectful of how this situation works. 
   I come back to Senator BYRD's statement, which is a brilliant statement, recounting World War I, World War II, and all the participation that this great Nation has given in this century towards peace and stability in Europe. 
   Are they now to turn their back on that history? I say no. I say to my good friend from Michigan, and I say to General Clark, I believe they have gone just a step too far. I have more confidence in the next President and confidence that this President can make a strong case, and I have confidence in the institution of the Congress of the United States. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder if my distinguished colleague from Alabama will forbear. With regard to time on our side, there are a number of Senators who have indicated a desire to address the Senate tomorrow. Tonight I will put in place a UC to enable them to have a specific period of time. 
   I point out, this is a bipartisan decision with which we are dealing in the Senate. We have our distinguished elder statesman, Mr. BYRD, leading it. We have another distinguished elder statesman, Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent whereby, from the other side of the aisle, Senator TORRICELLI, Senator CLELAND, and Senator FEINGOLD each have 6 minutes apiece at their disposal. On our side, we will lead off tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock with Senator ROBERTS, and he desires 15 minutes; Senator WARNER, myself, during the course of the morning, I reserve 20 minutes for myself; Senator HUTCHISON of Texas desires 7 minutes; Senator INHOFE desires 7 minutes; and Senator SNOWE desires 7 minutes. 
   I want to make those time commitments to guarantee that our colleagues who have indicated to me a desire to speak will have that time tomorrow. My understanding is there will be 5 1/2 hours of debate tomorrow prior to the vote at 2:30 p.m. which is fixed by order. The leadership may, of course, in some way change that, take leadership time, and so forth. Basically, it is 5 1/2 hours. Senator BYRD, under a previous order, still has an hour left of his time. So that should be recited. I ask that in the form of a unanimous consent request.

   In order to get some certainty for the opening of this debate tomorrow, which will commence immediately after the Senate is formally opened and the prayer is given, Senator ROBERTS from Kansas would be given 15 minutes to be followed by Senator LAUTENBERG of New Jersey for 15 minutes. Then I will only make known that Senator BURNS, of course--he is the chairman of the subcommittee for MILCON--will undoubtedly require some time. I assure him now that that time will likewise be given to Senator BURNS. 
   So the purpose of my unanimous consent is to see that those two Senators be recognized in that order for a total of not to exceed 30 minutes equally divided, 15 minutes each. I ask unanimous consent that that be the order.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, yesterday, the United States Senate took a procedural vote on Senator DASCHLE's amendment to S. 2521, the military construction appropriations bill. Senator DASCHLE lost this procedural vote by 42-54. 
   I did not support the Daschle amendment at that time because it was a procedural amendment to an unrelated bill. This unrelated Daschle amendment kept the Senate away all day from the important business of the military construction appropriations bill. In addition, it appeared that the Daschle amendment might indefinitely delay consideration of this important bill. As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I have a responsibility to secure passage of the important military construction appropriations bill. This bill provides critically needed funding for military construction projects, improves the quality of life for the men and women who are serving our country in the armed forces, and sustains the readiness of our armed forces. These areas are traditionally underfunded, and this bill provides the necessary funds to help make up for this shortfall. For these reasons, I did not support the Daschle amendment when it came before me on a procedural vote on May 16, 2000. 
   Subsequent to the procedural vote on the Daschle amendment on May 16, 2000, Senators LOTT and DASCHLE reached an agreement to have two up or down votes--one on the aforementioned Daschle amendment and another on an amendment to be offered by Senator LOTT. Under the agreement, debate on the amendments was limited by a time agreement. 
   Once this leadership agreement was reached, it became apparent that the Daschle amendment would no longer indefinitely delay the military construction appropriations bill. Therefore, my previous objections to this amendment were no longer relevant. 
   The Daschle amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. After stating a number of findings, the amendment states, among other things, that it is the sense of the Senate that ``Congress should immediately pass a conference report to accompany'' the juvenile justice bill that includes the Senate passed gun-related provisions. 
   During the Senate's debate of the juvenile justice bill in May of 1999, I supported the Lautenberg amendment, and other amendments to close the gun show loophole in the Brady act. I also supported an amendment to require licensed firearm dealers to provide a secure gun storage or safety device when a handgun is sold, delivered or transferred. Unfortunately, the juvenile justice bill has been locked in a House and Senate conference committee. 
   I remain firm in my stance on these issues. I certainly hope that House and Senate conferees can reach an agreement in conference on the juvenile justice bill. And I will continue to support the common sense gun provisions that passed the Senate during the juvenile justice debate. I believe the Senate passed gun-related amendments to the juvenile justice bill will help keep guns out of the hands of convicted felons and increase public safety without infringing on the rights of law-abiding citizens. Therefore, when it became clear that the Daschle amendment would not indefinitely delay consideration of the military construction appropriations bill, I supported this amendment.

   Mr. WARNER. Fine. 
   Mr. President, in the course of the deliberations before the Senate Appropriations Committee on this measure, the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. BYRD--former majority leader of the Senate; one who has served in the Senate 41 years--brought before that committee an amendment entitled the Byrd-Warner amendment dealing with the issue of the balance of power in the Constitution between the executive branch, the President, and the legislative branch, the Congress of the United States, as it relates to matters of foreign policy but, most particularly, as it relates to the matter--and perhaps the most important entrusted to both the President of the United States and the Congress--the most important matter of when the President, as Commander in Chief, sends beyond the shores of our great Nation men and women in uniform into harm's way in the cause of peace. 
   This week, those of us on the Republican side of the aisle had our weekly luncheon, as did our good friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle. At our luncheon, Senator STROM THURMOND stood and asked if we could observe a moment of silence as he recounted the closing day of World War II, when hostilities ceased in Europe--the bloodiest of all wars, in which 292,000 men and women, wearing the uniform of the Armed Services of the United States, lost their lives. 
   You could have heard a pin drop in that caucus as that great soldier, as that great statesman, asked for remembrance of the veterans of those generations. 
   In a very humble way, I have a brief memory. At age 17, I joined the Navy. It was January of 1945. I was simply trained, as were thousands of other youngsters my age, because at that point in January, in the winter of 1945, both the war in Europe and the war in the Pacific were inconclusive. I simply was at training command, waiting for the invasion of Japan. I thank God that last battle in the Pacific never occurred, not only for myself but for millions of others who would have been involved. 
   I look back very humbly on the modest contribution I made in uniform, both in that war and again during the Korean war, where I served in the Marines for a brief period. 
   The military did far more for me than I did for the military. Today, that 17-year-old sailor as of 1945 is privileged to be the chairman of the Armed Services Committee of the Senate, a dream I thought would never be fulfilled.  
   I again reiterate, my service was modest. On both sides of the aisle, there are men who have served and show the scars of war, who understand the burden on the President of the United States as he sends forth troops into harm's way. I respect these individuals greatly for their knowledge, for having borne the pain in the field of battle, unlike myself. But I was there when others did. 
   The point of this is the gravity of the decision to send forth our people--the sons and the daughters of people from every village and town across this Nation. 
   I recount World War II. I then go to Korea, again, where I served as a young Marine officer. Over 50,000 men and women lost their lives in that conflict. 
   During the course of the Vietnam conflict, I was privileged to serve in the Navy as Undersecretary of the Navy and then as Secretary of the Navy. I was there 5 years, 4 months, and 3 days. Over 50,000 men and women lost their lives, not to mention the number of those wounded. 
   The point I make is, the last time this Nation declared war was World War II. Yet since that time we have sent men and women into harm's way, beyond our shores, over 100 times. 
   We never declared war in the Korean conflict. As a matter of fact, it was called the forgotten war. We never declared war in Vietnam, a war that not only brought tremendous casualties on the field of battle and a wrenching experience to the families--as each war does--but it divided this Nation. Indeed, it was the people of this Nation who rose up and, finally, through their elected representatives in Congress, provided the basis for the withdrawal of our troops from that conflict. 
   That is what this amendment is all about. It is a decision of power between the executive and the legislative branches. It is assuming the responsibility--the responsibility to join with the President or not join with the President--in sending those people beyond our shores. No greater responsibility rests upon a Member of Congress than that. 
   I have had the privilege to know Presidents. I have had the privilege to learn from my elder statesmen in this Chamber--foremost among them John Stennis, John Tower, Barry Goldwater, and ``Scoop'' Jackson, all of whom worked on the Armed Services Committee--of how Presidents of our great Nation face up to that decision to go or not to go. 
   Stennis used to tell the story that Lyndon Johnson told him. The President used to say to Stennis: When that phone rings at night, and there is a troubled spot in the world, and I have to make the decision, Do I or do I not send those troops? I always thought, Where is an aircraft carrier, an island of America? What is the nearest force structure of the U.S. to this conflict? 
   It is a big decision. Read the biographies of our Presidents. It is a tough decision. Congress has an obligation to share with the President in the making of that decision. That is my point. That is what this amendment is about. 
   We have not really fully shared in that decisionmaking since World War II. Yes, we have the power to declare war under the Constitution. We also have the sole power over the purse--the power to decide whether that President can utilize the taxpayers' contribution each year in the operations of the United States. 
   Just this week, the Armed Services Committee concluded its bill--roughly $309 billion--to provide for the Armed Forces of the United States. It is the biggest money bill that goes through here. It will be brought to the floor next week, hopefully. 
   That is what I am talking about--the power of the purse. Our committee authorizes, and the committee under the Senator from Alaska, Mr. STEVENS, and the distinguished cosponsor of this amendment, Mr. BYRD, then make the decisions on the appropriations against the authorization. That is what this amendment is about. It is about how we conduct the expenditure in this bill--$2 billion-plus for Kosovo alone--how we go about spending the taxpayers' money for that. How does it directly relate to the safety and welfare of those brave men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces who are marching through, or patrolling through, or standing watch night and day in Kosovo? 
   Mr. President, I first went to Kosovo in 1990 with then-leader Bob Dole. There was a group of four or five of us. I remember that trip very well. I remember that we exited rather speedily from Kosovo because there was a riot developing. So many people wanted to see the American Senators, wanted to tell the American Senators about the cruelty and the deprivation of human rights that was then, in 1990, being inflicted on the people of Kosovo--Kosovo being a part of Yugoslavia--being inflicted by Milosevic. Little did we know that war would soon spread through this region--first in Bosnia, and then it would erupt in Kosovo. 
   Well, we saw those people. We went by the famous field where, hundreds of years ago, the people of that region fought off the barbarian insiders and lost the battle. They still consider that the most hallowed ground in Kosovo. That region has been subjected to fighting and internal strife ever since. Even Hitler put some 21 divisions in there to try to control the Yugoslav region, and finally he told his generals to just contain them as best they could. He never could subvert that province because of the internal fighting. Throughout the occupation of the German armies, a continuous civil war raged among the various religious and ethnic factions in that region. The Germans just sort of turned their back on them. One German general said in a dispatch to Berlin about those who died in this civil war: ``Less mouths to feed, less backs to clothe.'' 
   What a desperate, desperate cauldron of humanity. I expect that at one time or another in our deliberations in this body on Bosnia and Kosovo, every Member has availed themselves of the history of this region. As many times as I have been there--I believe I was the first U.S. Senator to go into Sarajevo in September of 1992, at the height of the fighting of the civil war in that town. I remember the French, who were controlling such security as was available, just in an airport where we were trying to bring in Red Cross supplies and food, put me in an armored vehicle and drove me around the town. We looked out through a little slit and firing was going on.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from South Carolina. I remember when I first came to the Senate 22 years ago, two-thirds of the Senate or more had the opportunity to serve in uniform. Today, there are fewer. I cast no aspersion against those who do not. It is just a generational thing. 
   Listening to my dear friend from South Carolina, I know he draws on his experiences in the army in World War II as a young officer in the battle to free Europe when he had the responsibility of life. No one else but him, as an officer, had the responsibility for those young men under his command. 
   This type of amendment we discussed--certainly I have and others--with many veterans who have worn the uniform of this country and many who are on active duty today. 
   The distinguished Senator said he has seen war. I saw it in the continental limits in World War II, and then I had a brief tour in Korea as a ground officer with an air wing. I saw the others who had to fight it, but I never put myself in the category of a combat soldier. I have always said my orders did not take me there, but they took the Senator there and he saw it. 
   I know in the course of this debate, the issue will be raised: We may be putting the young men and women in the Armed Forces in jeopardy as a consequence of this amendment, even the act of filing it and debating it. 
   I want to get into that. I am sure the Senator will rejoin in this debate if and when that happens. 
   I see our distinguished colleague here, who is a naval veteran, who is about to speak. I do not know if it is on this matter or on another matter. It is not on this matter. 
   But I am willing to join in that debate. When 23 members of the Appropriations Committee voted ``yea'' to put this in--and the distinguished Senator from South Carolina can correct me--but of that group who voted ``yea,'' the following have been privileged to wear the uniform of our country: Senator COCHRAN, Senator SPECTER, Senator GORTON, Senator BURNS, Senator BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL, Senator DANIEL INOUYE, Senator ERNEST F. HOLLINGS, Senator HERBERT KOHL, and Senator STEVENS, the chairman. They are veterans. 
   Let us debate it, but let us debate it with great care. 
   The letter which I put in the RECORD from Senator BYRD and myself states our point of view. This letter is just going out to Members, but already the following cosponsors, who likewise were veterans, have signed on: Senator ROBERTS, Senator STROM THURMOND, Senator INHOFE, Senator ROBERT SMITH, and Senator SESSIONS. So a goodly number of those who have been privileged to wear the uniform of our country have joined behind this. 
   We would not have done it, I say to the Senator, if we had had a moment's concern we were increasing the risk to our people. They are at risk today. They will be at risk tomorrow and the next day. And as we are drifting into this endless--endless--commitment, they are at risk every single day. 
   This amendment simply says: Congress, either join with the President or state your case and bring them home. That is the purpose of this amendment.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from West Virginia, as his principal cosponsor on this important Kosovo amendment which was adopted this morning by the Appropriations Committee. We have worked together as partners on this endeavor for the past several weeks, and I have confidence that the outcome of our efforts is sound precedent for our Nation's security policy. 
   The amendment which will soon be before the full Senate is a true collaboration--a melding of the original Warner certification amendment and the long-standing efforts of Senator BYRD to ensure that Congress exercises its constitutional role in decisions to deploy U.S. troops into harm's way. 
   There are two main goals that we are seeking to accomplish: first, to ensure that our allies are shouldering their commitments, their fair share of the burden for implementing stability and peace in Kosovo; and, second, to require the Congress to fulfill its constitutional responsibility to vote on the continued deployment of U.S. ground combat troops in Kosovo. 
   I would like to address--up front--what we are not doing with this amendment. We are not doing a ``cut and run'' from Kosovo. We are not deserting our NATO allies. I want to be very clear on these points. We are simply saying that our allies must fulfill the commitments which they made--I repeat, which they made--to provide assistance and personnel to rebuild the civil society in Kosovo; and that the Congress must take action--vote--to specifically authorize the continued presence of United States ground combat troops in Kosovo after July 1, 2001. 
   These are not precipitous or ill-conceived measures. They are supported by a respected group of cosponsors who are all strong supporters of NATO and who are determined not to let the United States military simply drift into an endless presence in Kosovo. The vote in the Appropriations Committee was overwhelmingly in favor of the Byrd-Warner amendment--23 to 3. 
   I would like to address in detail the certification requirement contained in this amendment, as it is an updated version of an amendment I originally put before the Senate on March 9. Subsection (d) of the Byrd-Warner amendment would provide 75 percent of the over $2 billion contained in the Supplemental for military operations in Kosovo immediately--no strings attached. The expenditure of the remaining 25 percent of the funding would be dependent on a certification by the President that our allies had provided a certain percentage of their commitments of assistance and personnel to Kosovo. If the President is not able to make that certification by July 15, 2000, then the remaining 25 percent of the Kosovo funds contained in the fiscal year 2000 supplemental could be used only to conduct the safe, orderly and phased withdrawal of our troops from Kosovo. This limitation could be overcome by a vote of the Congress--under expedited procedures--to allow the money to be used for the continued deployment of our troops in Kosovo, despite the lack of the Presidential certification. 
   Why do I feel so strongly about our Allies meeting their commitments in Kosovo? Because of the sacrifices of our brave men and women in uniform who bore the major share of the burden for the air war in Kosovo, and the continuing sacrifices of our troops, today and for the future, on the ground in Kosovo. As my colleagues know, the United States flew almost 70 percent of the total number of strike and support 
   sorties in Operation Allied Force, at great personal risk, particularly to our aviators, and at a cost of over $4 billion to the U.S. taxpayers. 
   In return, the Europeans have promised to pay the major share of the burdens to implement and secure the peace. So far, they have committed and pledged billions of dollars and thousands of personnel for this goal. The problem is that not enough of the money or the necessary personnel have made it to Kosovo. 
   Since I first signaled my intentions on this amendment several months ago, considerable progress has been made--I gratefully acknowledge this. There has been a positive response from our allies. But more needs to be done, particularly in the areas of police and reconstruction. 
   What is happening as approval of this assistance for Kosovo is slowly working its way slowly through the bureaucracies in Europe? Our troops, and the troops of other nations, are having to make up for the shortfall--by performing basic police functions, running towns and villages, guarding individual homes and historic sites, escorting ethnic minorities--all functions for which they were not specifically trained and which increase their level of personal risk. When will this end? Time is of the essence as our troops stand in harm's way until relieved, in large measure, by civilians specially trained. 
   General Klaus Reinhardt, the fine German general who recently relinquished command of KFOR, said that he expects military elements of KFOR to be in Kosovo for a decade. I find this unacceptable, but I can see how it is possible if we do not move quickly to establish the basic economic and security infrastructure in Kosovo that is essential for long-lasting stability in that troubled region. That is one of the main goals of this amendment--to spur our allies on to quickly fulfill their commitments. 
   What we cannot--must not--allow to happen is for the current situation in Kosovo to drift on. There are problems. They must be addressed and addressed in a timely manner. 
   The principal sponsor of this amendment, the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia and noted historian has eloquently addressed the constitutional responsibility of the Congress in deploying U.S. military forces overseas. I would simply add that it is  time--past time--for the Congress to fulfill its obligations regarding our deployment to Kosovo. Since last June, the United States has had thousands of troops engaged in a dangerous operation in Kosovo, and thus far Congress has taken no action, other than emergency supplemental appropriations, on this deployment. 
   This is disappointing, but not surprising. The last time the Congress exercised its constitutional responsibility to declare war was during World War II. Since that time, the United States military has been involved in over 100 military deployments--including the Korean conflict and the war in Vietnam. and where has the Congress been during all of that time? We occasionally pass resolutions authorizing the use of force--as we did for the Persian Gulf conflict--but more often than not, we simply fail to act. That must stop. We owe it to our brave men and women in uniform to act on their behalf. They are fulfilling their responsibilities; we must fulfill ours. 
   This amendment does not say we must leave Kosovo. This amendment does not mean that we are shirking our NATO responsibilities. This amendment simply says that Congress--as a co-equal branch on foreign policy matters--must exercise its constitutional responsibilities and authorize the continued deployment of United States ground combat troops in Kosovo. 
   I urge my colleagues to join us in our effort to prevent an open-ended United States military commitment in Kosovo. 
   Mr. President, in summary, the Byrd-Warner amendment was today adopted by an overwhelming majority of 23 to 3 in the Senate Appropriations Committee. 
   This is an amendment on which Senator BYRD and I have worked for the better part of 2 months. We have had extensive consultations with a number of our colleagues, and thus far we have, as cosponsors, Senators STEVENS, INOUYE, THURMOND, ROBERTS, SNOWE, INHOFE, GREGG, SMITH of New Hampshire, and SESSIONS. There are others who will be added in due course. 
   Senator BYRD and I are concerned about two things: The indefinite commitment of our troops into the Kosovo situation and that indefinite commitment not being backed up by an affirmative action of the Congress of the United States, which has a clear responsibility to act when we send young men and women into harm's way. 
   This is not a cut-and-run amendment. This is simply an assertion that the United States together with its allies is trying to bring about peace and stability in that region. We have succeeded after an extensive 78-day combat mission, 70 percent of which missions were flown by the U.S. airmen. It is time to address the future and to have our allies meet their commitments in a timely fashion, commitments they made prior to the combat action and shortly thereafter. 
   Secondly, we believe there should be some certainty as to how long our troops must remain in this commitment. It cannot be indefinite. We are, as a nation, now with troops all over the world. And we are stretched. We are having problems with retention, problems with recruiting because of the overextension of the U.S. military forces. 
   What Senator BYRD has emphasized--and many times on the floor of the Senate--is it is the duty of the Congress of the United States, through a vote, to affirm the policies of the executive branch as we deploy our troops into harm's way. 
   So those are the basic elements of this amendment.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an outstanding young Virginian, Daniel Azzize Samuel, who has been selected to receive the 2000 American Automobile Association Lifesaving Medal. This award is the highest honor given to members of the school safety patrol. 
   Daniel is a member of the Kent Gardens School Safety Patrol in McLean, Virginia. On January 12th of this year, he was on his way to his post when he saw an eight-year-old student running back toward his departing bus. Quickly sizing up the danger, Daniel yelled at the student to stop. The bus driver also heard Daniel's yells and stopped the  bus, a mere three feet from the oncoming student who was approaching in the driver's blind spot. 
   I salute Daniel and the other young recipients of this year's award, Daniel Rogers of Maryland and Greg Lawson and Tasha Tanner of Ohio, for their lifesaving contributions to the safety of their fellow students. As members of their school safety patrols, these young people have made invaluable contributions to their schools and communities. I also commend the American Automobile Association for their sponsorship of this valuable program to keep our nation's young people safe on their trips to and from school.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a friend and patriot Sterling Edwards Rives, Jr. of Petersburg, Virginia who died on February 13, 2000, at the age of 78 years. 
   A native of Surry County, sterling served in the Army at the close of World War II and then spent a year building airfields in the Philippines. He returned to a position as an inspector with the U.S. Department of Agriculture traveling with his wife Virginia Anne and newborn son Sterling III throughout the Southeast grading peanuts, potatoes and produce. Two more sons Andrew II an Bailey were born as they moved to Petersburg where he began his 35-year career where he held leadership positions in the Christ and Grace Episcopal Church. 
   Sterling Rives served on the Virginia Republican State Central Committee, as a delegate to four national conventions, vice-chairman of the Petersburg Electoral Board, and as a delegate to the White House Council on Aging. 
   President Ronald Reagan once told me that ``Politics is not a spectator sport.'' 
   No one took that more to heart than Sterling Rives who believed that it was his civic responsibility and patriotic duty to contribute freely his time and talents to elect those he supported to public office. I was privileged to be one of those public servants whom Sterling took by the hand and guided towards election day after election day. 
   Sterling Rives drove the original footings for the foundation of the Republican Party of Virginia. He and his family gave tirelessly in election after election. 
   Just last year Virginians elected a Republican Governor, Lt. Governor,  Attorney General and a new Republican majority in the House of Delegates and the Senate for the first time in our state's history. That impressive victory was a most appropriate tribute to Sterling Rives' long public service encouraging people to be active in politics. 
   We have far too few citizens who recognize the importance of the political process in preserving our democracy and our freedom. The life of Sterling Rives will stand as a model for patriots who seek to preserve our liberty. I know my colleagues join me in paying tribute to Sterling Rives and extending to his family our deepest sympathy.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Yeoman Second Class Matthew C. Hawes, United States Navy, for his unsurpassed dedication to duty, professionalism, and public service. As Petty Officer Hawes transitions from the active duty Navy to the civilian work force and the Naval Reserve, I am privileged to recognize his achievements and to commend him for the exemplary service he has provided to the Senate, the Navy and our great nation. 
   Petty Officer Hawes enlisted in the Navy in January 1991 and was assigned to the U.S.S. Cincinnati (SSN 693) after completing Yeoman ``A'' school and Basic Enlisted Submarine School. While aboard the Cincinnati, he made several overseas deployments which contributed to the security of our nation and earned his ``Silver Dolphins,'' the enlisted submarine warfare qualification insignia. He was then assigned to Joint Task Force 160 in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as the Non-Commissioned Officer-in-Charge of the J1 Division. 
   After his six-month deployment to Cuba, Petty Officer Hawes was assigned to the Bureau of Naval Personal as the Administrative Assistant to the Enlisted Nuclear Power Programs Manager. He served in this position until he was selected for assignment to the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs. Petty Officer Hawes reported to the Navy's Senate Liaison Office in April 1996 as a Liaison Officer and Administrative Assistant. In this capacity he has been a major asset to the Navy and to the United States Senate. He has been key to the smooth coordination of all Navy leadership visits to the Senate, as well as for the accurate and prompt management of a wide variety of Navy-related Senate constituent casework. Petty Officer Matthew Hawes has been extremely helpful to me and to my staff in numerous actions, as I know he has been for many of you. 
   The Department of the Navy, Congress, and the American people were well served by this dedicated Navy Petty Officer. Members of this Congress will not soon forget the service and dedication of Petty Officer Hawes. He will be missed. We wish Matthew, his lovely wife Blairlee, and their daughter Kathryn, Fair Winds and Following Seas.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to lend my support for the naming of the Pearl Street courthouse in New York City as humble tribute to our colleague, the distinguished senior Senator from New York, DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN, who regrettably announced his retirement from this body at the conclusion of the 106th Congress. 
   It is only fitting that any recognition of the senior Senator from New York's achievements should first underscore his limitless passion in reflecting the highest ideals befitting the dignity, enterprise, vigor and stability of the American government. His singular vision of the role of a United States Senator and his deep desire to live up to that lofty image is only part of what makes my friend and colleague the paragon of public service which he has been for this body, his constituents and the American people for nearly a quarter century. 
   Since his election to the United States Senate in 1976, Senator MOYNIHAN has imprinted an indelible impression upon our Nation's Capital in so many estimable ways. His virtues extend far beyond my capabilities of statesmanship but, given that the pending matter is the naming of a federal building in his honor, I will limit myself to simply discussing his unique role in shepherding the physical transformation of the federal landscape in Washington, D.C. 
   During his tenure in Congress, Senator MOYNIHAN has made a consistent commitment to build government buildings well and help achieve the potential L'Enfant envisioned here 200 years ago. 
   There's a fitting symmetry to Senator MOYNIHAN's career in Washington. He started out nearly four decades ago in the Kennedy Administration, and his service at the White House end of Pennsylvania Avenue continued in the Johnson and Nixon years. Since 1977, he's served on this end in the U.S. Capitol as the Senator from New York. 
   It fell to him, as one of Kennedy's cadre of New Frontiersman, to write a prescription for then-failing Pennsylvania Avenue, whose shabbiness had caught the President's eye during the inaugural parade. True to his scholar's training, Senator MOYNIHAN went back to basics to prepare an eloquent appreciation of L'Enfant's conception of Pennsylvania Avenue, ``the grand axis of the city, as of the Nation ..... leading from the Capitol to the White House, symbolizing at once the separation of powers and the fundamental unity in the American government.'' 
   Little wonder, then, that Senator MOYNIHAN today can look back with satisfaction at what has happened to the avenue. He was there at the beginning. 
   When news came that President Kennedy had been shot, Senator MOYNIHAN was having lunch with fellow White House aides to arrange a briefing for congressional leaders concerning the new plan for Pennsylvania Avenue. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN started out, as he once wrote, ``at a time of the near-disappearance of the impulse to art'' in public building, witnessing a ``steady deteriorating in the quality of public buildings and public spaces, and with it a decline in the symbols of public unity and common purpose with which the citizen can identify, of which he can be proud, and by which he can know what he shares with his fellow citizens.'' He called the new Rayburn House Office Building ``perhaps the most alarming and unavoidable sign of the declining vitality of American government that we have yet witnessed.'' 
   In his 1962 report which he drafted for President Kennedy, ``Guiding Principles for Federal Architecture,'' Senator MOYNIHAN outlined three broad principles which still affect federal architecture today: (1) An official style must be avoided; (2) Government projects should embody the finest contemporary American architectural thought; and (3) Federal buildings should reflect the regional architectural traditions of their specific locations. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN's deep rooted passion for public architecture has abated not an iota in the years since he wrote that document. In an interview he gave as a freshman Senator newly assigned to the Environment and Public Works Committee, he was quoted as saying, ``I like buildings, I like things,'' he explained simply, ``and the government builds things.'' Later as chairman, he used his vantage point to become one of the capital's most persuasive, powerful voices for rationality and beauty in the things our government builds. 
   Recently, he was asked about the capital's esthetic transformation, to which he asked a rhetorical question: ``Do we realize we look up and we have the most beautiful capital on earth?'' 
   I thank Senator MOYNIHAN. I have been privileged to serve with you to help transform Pennsylvania Avenue into the great thoroughfare of the city of Washington, DC. 
   His 1962 vision is Y2K's reality. I sincerely hope that the courthouse we name in his honor reflects the legacy of federal architecture he leaves and the great vision of this Nation he always espoused.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from Maine as a sponsor of this very important piece of legislation that would allow women-owned businesses to participate in the Department of Defense (DOD) mentor protege program. 
   Since 1990, the mentor protege program has provided small disadvantaged businesses increased opportunity to compete for federal contracts. The program accomplishes this by providing incentives to major defense contractors to assist qualified small business to enhance their abilities to compete as contractors on DOD contracts. The mentor-protege program does not guarantee contracts to anyone. Instead, it is designed to equip participants with the knowledge and expertise that they need to win such contracts on their own, in the competitive market place. 
   The mentor protege program has been an important tool to help achieve the goal--established by Congress in 1987--that DOD increase to five percent the total value of contracts and subcontracts awarded to small disadvantaged businesses. This has been a remarkable success story. For the past six years, the DOD has exceeded this 5% goal. 
   In 1994, a similar goal was set for the DOD to award five percent of its annual contracts to women-owned businesses. While women-owned business participation in defense contracting has increased since 1994, we are still, however, well below the 5% goal. It seems appropriate to provide DOD with additional tools to assist in meeting this goal. Providing women-owned businesses the opportunity to participate in the mentor protege program will be a big step forward in expanding federal contracting opportunities for these businesses. 
   I want to thank Senator SNOWE for her leadership on this issue and her work on behalf of women-owned businesses around the country. I urge swift passage of this legislation to enhance the opportunity for women-owned businesses to compete for, and win, DOD contracts.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Republican led Senate is considering legislation that I have long advocated for working families--relief from the marriage tax penalty. 
   This is not a limited problem. According to the Congressional Budget Office, almost half of all married couples--21 million--are affected by the marriage penalty. One study showed that over 640,000 couples in Virginia are affected. 
   The marriage tax penalty unfairly affects middle class married working couples. For example, a manufacturing plant worker makes $30,500 a year in salary. His wife is a tenured elementary school teacher, also bringing home $30,500 a year in salary. If they both file their taxes as singles they would pay 15 percent in income tax. But if they choose to live their lives in holy matrimony and file jointly, their combined income of $61,000 pushes them into a higher tax bracket of 28%. The result is a tax penalty of approximately $1,400. 
   The Republican marriage penalty relief bill would fix this unfairness without shifting of the tax burden and without the need for a tax increase on any individual. Middle and low income families would benefit as much as earners with higher incomes. The bipartisan support for eliminating the marriage penalty is overwhelming. The House of Representatives passed the bill with 268 votes. 
   In the Senate, our bill increases the standard deduction for joint returns to twice the amount of the standard deduction for single returns, doubles the size of both the 15% and 28% tax brackets for joint returns to twice the size of the corresponding tax rate brackets for single returns, and increases the phase-out income level for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) for joint returns by $2,500. Additionally, it makes permanent the current allowance of personal nonrefundable tax credits to offset both regular and alternative minimum tax liabilities. 
   Critics have claimed that most of the tax relief under our plan would go to wealthy couples. That is simply not true. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation's distribution analysis estimates that couples making under $75,000 annually will be the biggest winners. Additionally, the Joint Tax Committee estimates that couples earning between $20,000 and $30,000 will receive the biggest percentage reduction in their federal taxes out of any income level, with couples making between $30,000-$40,000 fairing almost as well. 
   Opponents of this measure have argued that some married couples, where only one spouse works, will receive a so-called ``marriage bonus''. Although the word ``bonus'' implies an additional benefit, this is simply not the case. First, this money belongs to the taxpayers. With a surplus of over $2 trillion, not including Social Security, all taxpayers are entitled to a return of their tax overpayment. Second, should the federal government, through tax policy, discourage either parent from staying at home with children? If a couple chooses to raise their family on just one income, they will need all the financial help they can get. The government should not penalize a family simply because it takes both spouses working outside of the home to make $50,000. Being a stay at home parent should be rewarded--not penalized. 
   This means over $64 billion in tax relief over the next five years. Combined with the other tax relief measures adopted by the Senate this year--tax relief for small employers, improved health care access, and education savings accounts--the total tax relief considered by the Senate falls well within the $150 billion budgeted for tax cuts in the recently-adopted budget resolution. 
   This is a modest proposal. Eliminating the marriage penalty will result in less tax paid to the federal government. However, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that taxpayers will send Uncle Sam almost $2 trillion in additional surplus taxes over the next ten years. That is after Congress has locked up 100% of Social Security surplus and paid down the public debt. Our proposal asks Uncle Sam to give back to middle class families just 10 cents out of every extra surplus dollar they send to Washington. Is that really to much to ask to help families? The Federal government should not put a price tag on the sacrament of marriage.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the budget resolution conference report. This budget before us today continues the momentum we started last year to provide additional funding for defense in an effort to correct the most critical readiness, modernization, and recruiting and retention problems in our military. 
   I thank the Majority Leader, the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee and his staff and the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee and his staff, for working with me to provide the additional $4.0 billion in much-needed funding for the Department of Defense, the reserve for military retiree healthcare, and the important language necessary to allow the military thrift savings plan to become a reality. I also recognize members of my own committee staff--Les Brownlee, Staff Director, Judy Ansley, our Deputy Staff Director, and especially Larry Lanzillotta, our Budget Chief--whose expertise in budgeting matters is invaluable not only to the Armed Services Committee, but to the entire Senate as well. 
   The funds which have been added in this Budget Resolution for defense are absolutely critical in providing readiness, modernization funding, and the personnel incentives necessary to reverse the negative trends in recruiting and retention. The increase of $4.0 billion will allow us to bring defense  spending to a more appropriate level and address some of the urgent unfunded requirements of the military chiefs. For too many years, the size of our defense budget has been based on constrained funding, not on the threats facing our country or the military strategy necessary to meet those threats. This budget will go a long way in allowing us to ensure the safety and security of our people by maintaining a strong and capable military. 
   Making the Thrift Savings Plan available to military personnel comes at a critical time for the military services. Participation in a thrift savings account will encourage personal savings and enhance the retirement income for service members, who currently do not have access to a 401(k) savings plan. When the TSP program is implemented, military personnel will be able to join federal workers in a savings program that will enhance the value of their retirement system and permit them to improve their quality of life. The Service Chiefs have indicated that this plan, combined with the pay raise, the repeal of the Redux retirement system, and the increased bonuses in the FY 2000 Defense Authorization Act, will reduce the hemorrhage of trained and experienced military personnel we are now experiencing. 
   The Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and the Service Chiefs have all said that fulfilling our commitment for healthcare to our military retirees should be among the highest priorities for this year. I believe there is overwhelming support in the Senate to correct many of the shortfalls in the military healthcare system for our service members, their families, and our military retirees. It is critical that we enact the important initiatives contained in the bipartisan healthcare legislation introduced by the leadership of the Senate and the leadership of the Armed Services Committee earlier this year. This budget resolution makes it possible to fund these important health care initiatives for our military retirees. 
   I want to again express my appreciation to the distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator STEVENS, and the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, and also their highly professional staff members for assisting us in securing these much-needed funds in support of a stronger national defense.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the American Bar Association Commission on Women in the Profession announced in February the winners of the 2000 Margaret Brent Women Lawyers of Achievement Awards. 
   Among those worthy recipients was Dovey J. Roundtree, General Counsel for the National Council of Negro Women, whom I have been privileged to know for many years. 
   As a former law clerk to Federal Circuit Judge Prettyman, then as an Assistant United States Attorney, followed by private practice in the greater metropolitan area of Washington, DC, I came to know and admire the professional achievements of Attorney Roundtree. 
   She is most deserving of this recognition for her tireless efforts to help others. 
   The award Mrs. Roundtree has earned is named for the first woman lawyer in America, Margaret Brent. She arrived in the Colonies in 1638, and was involved in 124 court cases over the course of eight years, winning every case. In 1648, she formally demanded the right to vote in the Maryland Assembly, but her petition was denied by the Governor. 
   These awards were established in 1991 to honor outstanding women lawyers who have achieved professional excellence in their area of specialty and have actively worked to help other women lawyers. 
   Attorney Roundtree and her work have been admired for more than three decades. She has been a leading civil rights lawyer, an Army veteran, an ordained minister and a resident of Spotsylvania. 
   She is a founding partner of the Washington, DC, law firm of Roundtree, Knox, Hunter and Parker, and she served for 35 years as General Counsel to the National Council of Negro Women and as special consultant for legal affairs to the African Methodist Episcopal Church. 
   Mrs. Roundtree attend Howard University Law School on the GI Bill and went on to break legal ground in both civil and criminal law. Her 1955 bus desegregation victory before the Interstate Commerce Commission, Sarah Keys versus Carolina Coach Company, was critically important in the legal battle for civil rights. 
   She was the first black woman admitted to the Bar Association of the District of Columbia and actively recruited other black women attorneys. 
   Dovey J. Roundtree is most deserving of this award.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I first thank our distinguished Senator from Ohio. When I was chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation, he was a Governor. He brought together those Governors. He laid the foundation with the National Governors' Association; indeed, a coalition of highway administrators all over the country. He deserves a great deal of credit for the work he did as we, in this body, worked on the legislation. We could not have done it without the help of those organizations. I am so glad the Senator paid proper respect to their services. 
   I thank our distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. I have now been privileged to serve with him here in my 22nd year in the Senate. No matter whether he has been the majority leader or minority leader, as a leader in his party, he 
   has always been there taking the lead, making the tough decisions, and pointing the way. 
   There is an old French saying about a politician one time saying: Tell me, which way is the crowd going so I can jump in front and lead? The senior Senator knows that quote better than I. That is not our senior Senator from West Virginia. He knows which way to lead and then, indeed, the Senate, most often, and the crowd, know which way to go.

   Mr. WARNER. But I say to my colleague, there are two separate issues today. Let us divide them. 
   First is the energy policy of this administration. Our distinguished colleague from Alaska has addressed that issue. Yes, it is flawed. In the words of the Secretary of Energy, they were caught napping. As a consequence, we are suffering at the gas pump. We are suffering in our economy. We are suffering in many ways for these increased prices. 
   I have compassion and understanding for those people. I support what Senator MURKOWSKI will bring forth as separate legislation to try to once again restore America's preeminence in its ability to develop energy sources and get the rigs out from under the brier patch of laws and regulations where they once drilled oil and gas in this country but are now rusting in stacks. 
   The Presiding Officer comes from a State which is known for its energy production. He knows full well of that situation. 
   I do not like to be in opposition to the distinguished leaders of my party, the Republican Party, but I am strongly in opposition to this question of repealing this gas tax. 
   I will not go back into the history, but we addressed this in the course of TEA-21. We took the funds, the general revenue, and put them into the highway trust fund. That was a commitment to the American public of those dollars so desperately needed to repair and modernize our transportation system. 
   I think what underlines this debate is the word ``anger.'' Yes, there is anger at the pump. That is understandable. But there is also anger behind the wheel when Americans, driving their vehicles today--whether it is for work or for pleasure, or for whatever purpose--see this cancer of the transportation system slowly eating away at their lifestyle, devouring the time they need at the job, devouring the time they need with their families, devouring the time they need for what little pleasure life provides today in terms of the burdens and commitments on the American family. 
   So we have a choice: Anger at the pump; anger with the highways. I believe it is most important that the institution of the Senate show a continuity of commitment to the modernization of our highways, our rails, and other transportation modes to reduce the threat to our lifestyle. That is what it is all about. 
   If we were to repeal this gas tax--I project that the Senate will not, but if we were to repeal it, what Senator could get up and say, with certainty, that that tax reduction will be passed down to the consumer at the gas pump? I will carefully listen to the speeches. What Senator could make that irrefutable commitment to the American public? 
   The free enterprise system is fraught with uncertainty. I would be willing to--I am not a betting man--wager, though, that that money would not go into the pockets of the American 
   consumers. That will bring about anger at the gas pump far greater than any that was witnessed thus far. 
   There is the question of the modernization of this highway transportation system and other modes of transportation. Hundreds of thousands of people are involved, from the Governor of a State, to their highway transportation authorities, to the legislatures of the various States. These people have made commitments, passed laws, adopted budgets on the reliability of the Congress to stand behind what they put into that legislation. 
   I repeat that. Stability in this program is essential because these modernization programs cannot be done overnight. They cannot either pour concrete or have the designers do their work overnight. There has to be a careful, methodical sequence of the steps. Literally hundreds of thousands of people are involved all over America. They sit and listen, astonished that we are about to take away one of the underpinnings of that program. 
   Those legislatures, in their next session--most of them have completed their sessions for this year--would say: Wait a minute. Before we commit so many State funds in reliance on what the Federal Government might do, let's wait and see. Is the Congress going to do something else to diminish the flow of funds? 
   We cannot have instability in the highway modernization program. That is fundamental, absolutely fundamental. 
   I conclude my remarks and hope the distinguished Senator from West Virginia will address the clause in the bill referred to on page 3, which says:  
   Maintenance of trust fund deposits.--In determining the amounts to be appropriated to the Highway Trust Fund under section 9503 ..... an amount equal to the reduction in revenues to the Treasury by reason of this subsection shall be treated as taxes received .....  
   I just say to my good friend from West Virginia, who has examined this legislation for so many years in this body, I think this is the first of its type. The distinguished Senator, the senior Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, understands the appropriations process. I find that this provision, No. 1, is unique. I don't know of many precedents that I have seen, if any at all. And second, the subject, again, of the uncertainty of taking it with one hand from the highway trust fund, by virtue of the elimination of the tax, then giving it back with the other hand in terms of some commitment, to me,  brings about uncertainty. I question how many Senators can rely on that. 
   I hope my distinguished colleague might look at that provision based on his many years of experience.

Mr. President, again I commend the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for his leadership on this issue--not only this particular measure before the Senate, but it goes all the way back to when I was privileged to be bringing to the floor the ISTEA, TEA-21 legislation. Then, in the course of that deliberation, we took the 4.3 cents out of the general revenue and put it in the highway trust fund for the express purpose to improve our Nation's highways. 
   I commend the leadership. 
   I also express my gratitude to the myriad organizations, from the National Governors' Association, the League of Cities and Communities, and hundreds of others that have worked so hard to keep the Congress well informed about the needs of our infrastructure, of transportation. 
   I wish to add one word, and that is ``stability.'' This Nation must have stability in the funding to make this program successful.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager, Senator DOMENICI. 
   Senator STEVENS and I have an amendment at the desk calling for a $4.1 billion increase in total defense spending. 
   We recognize that the House of Representatives is taking similar action. This would be parallel action. 
   At no time in contemporary history have there been more threats and more challenges affecting the security of this country. At the same time, at no time in my memory--I have been associated with the military as far back as World War II--has there been really less incentive for the young men and women of the Nation to join and proudly wear the uniform and incentives for those in the middle grades of our military to stay in after enormous expenses for the taxpayers to train them. When they finish their obligated period and first-term enlistments--the first term for officers and oftentimes pilots is 6 to 8 years--they are highly sought after by the private sector in our magnificent expanding economy. 
   We have this coincidence of pressures being put on the military today. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote favorably on the current version of the Stevens-Warner amendment of $4 billion for extra defense spending to meet the threats worldwide and to provide the proper benefits and care for the men and women of the Armed Forces and their families; to provide for the increase in procurement for the modernization they need with the additional dollars for training. 
   This Nation has witnessed the deployment of the men and women of the Armed Forces beyond our shores in the last 6 or 8 years, more times than any other President has sent them out into harm's way. 
   For too many years, the size of our defense budget has been based on constrained funding, not on the threats facing our country or the military strategy necessary to meet those threats. We began to make some progress last year when, for the first time in 14 years, we had a real increase in the authorized level of defense spending. We must continue the momentum we started last year in an effort to correct the most critical readiness, modernization, and recruiting and retention problems in our military. 
   Any analysis of our defense budget should begin with an analysis of the worldwide threat that our military faces--both now and in the future. The world remains complex and dangerous, and the United States is continually called upon to provide the requisite leadership to resolve the many conflicts which continue to erupt in this rapidly changing world. The negative impact that the large number of contingency operations in which our military is engaged worldwide is having on the readiness of our military forces concerns me. We have had troops in the Persian Gulf--engaged in active military operations against Iraq--for over a decade, in Bosnia for over four years, and now in Kosovo--with no end in sight for any of these operations. 
   The Joint Chiefs of Staff have testified that they still have a shortfall in funding of $9.0 billion for this fiscal year--fiscal year 2000; a requirement for an additional $15.5 billion above the budget request to meet shortfalls in readiness and modernization for fiscal year 2001; and a requirement for an additional $85.0 billion over the next five years. These were requirements identified by the Service Chiefs as their unfunded, validated requirements--not a set of ``wish lists.'' 
   As the elected representatives of the American people, we have no higher responsibility than ensuring the safety and security of our people by maintaining a strong and capable military. As chairman of the Armed Services Committee, I cannot sit idly by--knowing of the many shortfalls in defense funding that currently exist--without at least trying to address the many urgent needs of our military. 
   The Administration's budget request for fiscal year 2001 took some positive steps forward. The Budget Committee added an additional $500 million, but more needs to be done. 
   While the fiscal year 2001 defense budget request does reach the $60 billion modernization goal set in fiscal year 1995, this goal has not kept pace with requirements and has never been adjusted for inflation. Estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) have more accurately placed the funding necessary to meet modernization requirements at $90.0 billion annually, with other organizations stating that even larger increases are necessary. 
   We must continue the momentum we started last year when the Congress provided the personnel incentives necessary to reverse the negative trends in recruiting and retention. The Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and the Service Chiefs have all said that fulfilling our commitment for healthcare to our military retirees will be among the highest priorities this year. I believe, there is overwhelming support in the Senate to correct many of the shortfalls in the military healthcare system for our service members, their families, and our military retirees. it is critical to  enact the important initiatives contained in the bipartisan healthcare legislation introduced by the Senate and the Armed Services Committee leadership. Adding the funds in this amendment makes it possible to fund this important initiative for military retiree healthcare. 
   The increase of $4.0 billion contained in our amendment will allow us to bring defense spending to a more appropriate level and address some of the urgent unfunded requirements of the military chiefs. By adding the funding in this amendment, we will not be forced to fund needed increases for defense using emergency spending. Adding these funds now, allows the Senate to follow the normal procedures of authorization first, and not to forced to deal with added spending as an emergency. 
   The challenges that this country will face in the new millennium are diverse--new threats, new battlefields, and new weapons. It is important that we remain vigilant, forward thinking, and prepared to address these challenges. 
   Mr. Tenet, the Director of Central Intelligence, concluded his excellent opening statement at a very sobering hearing before the Armed Services Committee in January by saying:  
   The fact that we are arguably the world's most powerful nation does not bestow invulnerability; in fact, it may make us a larger target for those who don't share our interest, values, or beliefs.  
   We must ensure that our military forces remain ready to meet present and future challenges. 
   I want to express my appreciation again to the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the chairman of the Budget Committee for assisting us on this amendment. I want to also thank the highly professional staff members of the Appropriations Committee and the Budget Committee for their assistance for working out this amendment. 
   I also want to thank Senator DOMENICI and his staff in assisting me last evening in working out a solution which will provide for the implementation of a Thrift Savings Plan for the active and reserve components of our military. 
   I urge adoption of this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, the Congress authorized active and reserve members of the uniformed services to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan now available for federal civil service employees. This was an important part of the recruiting and retention package which the Senate passed, and which was enacted into law last year. 
   Under that authority, provided in last year's Defense Authorization Act, service members would be eligible to deposit up to five percent of their basic pay, before tax, each month. The government is not required to match the service member's contributions. In addition, service members would be permitted to directly deposit special pays for enlistment, reenlistment and the lump-sum for electing to remain in the ``Redux'' retirement program--pre-tax--up to the extent allowable under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, into their Thrift Savings account. 
   Last year's legislation required the President to identify sufficient offsets in order to implement this important program. Unfortunately and inexplicably, the President failed to identify the offsets in the budget he submitted to the Congress in February. Mr. President, we must adjust the outlays and revenues in the Budget Resolution to permit the Thrift Savings Plan to be extended to members of the uniformed services. This Thrift Savings Plan does not cause the loss of revenues, but defers the tax due until the service member retires. This is an important point--there are no lost revenues, and the cost of this initiative is cheaper than losing our most qualified military personnel. 
   Making the Thrift Savings Plan available to military personnel would come at a critical time for the military services. Participating in a Thrift Savings account would encourage personal savings and enhance the retirement income for service members, who currently do not have access to a 401k savings plan. Under current Thrift Savings Plan regulations, participants may borrow from Thrift Savings accounts for such worthy purposes as college tuition and purchasing a home. When implemented, military personnel would be able to join federal workers in a savings program that would enhance the value of their retirement system and permit them to improve their quality of life. 
   The Armed Services Committee continues to receive testimony strongly supporting a Thrift Savings Plan for military personnel as a strong incentive for both recruiting and retention. Testimony from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Service Secretaries and the military personnel chiefs confirm that the Thrift Savings Plan would be an important incentive for recruiting military personnel and retaining highly trained military personnel on active duty or in the Ready Reserve. The Service Chiefs have indicated that this plan, combined with the pay raise, the repeal of the Redux retirement system, and the increased bonuses in the FY 2000 bill, would alleviate the hemorrhage of trained and experienced military personnel we are now experiencing. 
   This critical initiative was not included in the President's budget request, but it is necessary to assist in retaining our military service personnel. We must correct this shortcoming in the President's budget. 
   The Senate has supported extending the Thrift Savings Plan to military personnel on three previous occasions. It is time that we complete the process and provide the necessary funding that would permit military personnel to join the federal workforce in the Thrift Savings Plan.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as has the distinguished Senator from New Jersey, I have had the privilege of serving with our friend, Senator MOYNIHAN, for many years on the Environment and Public Works Committee. If I may say with some little immodesty, I have been sort of a silent partner with Senator MOYNIHAN, not so much on this project--this was entirely his, I say to the junior Senator--but the Ronald Reagan Airport, for example, and the completion of the Federal Triangle are major, significant landmarks which will go forward for future generations. But for this quiet, modest, knowledgeable man--I doubt if he would ever be a cosponsor of this resolution--it is most befitting that this be done to recognize a man who stands for the rule of law. 
   I thank the Senator.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first I commend the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia. I was the chairman of the subcommittee that worked on ISTEA--we called it TEA-21. How well I remember that he, together with the Senator from Texas, fought the battle to take the 4.3-cent tax out of the general revenues and put it into the highway trust fund. Now our distinguished colleague and former majority leader is once again showing that leadership to keep those funds flowing to support America's highway infrastructure. 
   The economy of this Nation is dependent upon the efficient use of its transportation for people to get to and from their places of work, to carry our goods to the ports and terminals, to get them throughout the world. Now we are faced with this situation. I, from the first day, have resisted--even though I am in opposition to my distinguished leadership--the repeal of this 4.3 cents. It was a commitment made by the Senate by a vote, if I recall, I say to the senior Senator from West Virginia, which was in the 80s of Senators who approved the transfer of these funds from general revenue to the highway trust fund. 
   Every Senator understands the highway programs in his or her State. I recognize that. But stability is the key word, stability in funding. 
   We have the former distinguished Governor of Missouri and the former distinguished Governor of Ohio who will address those points. But as they set down their programs for highway improvement, safety and construction, they needed to have some certainty in the funding. It took almost a decade for the Senate to finally come to the recognition we ought to stop this donor-donee situation, one of the most controversial things I ever witnessed in my 20-plus years in the Senate. We got rid of that. 
   We also, in that bill, made a specific law whereby, when you go to the gas pump in your State and pump that gas, those taxes go to Washington and make a U-turn and go back to the State. No State got less than 90 percent of the return of those taxes. 
   That is what we are here for, continuity of action and decisionmaking by this body, continuity and stability in planning these programs to improve our roads, our infrastructure. There are contracts that reach out a year or more, 2 years or more. People have to order materials. They have to do design work. They have to engage labor. That is being done. We see the slow, steady improvement of our infrastructure. Now we are challenged by the 4.3 cents. As the distinguished Senator from West Virginia said, it could have a triggering mechanism where 4.3 cents goes to over 18 cents. As he pointed out, there is no certainty these funds will get back to the pockets of those who put the gas in their car--no certainty. There are many, many levels where various purposes could take off these funds. 
   My distinguished colleague from West Virginia talked about the groups. He put their letters in the RECORD. This is a group of organizations all across this country that support the highway construction program, whose efforts led to the passage of the ISTEA legislation in this Senate and eventually had it enacted into law. 
   The distinguished Governor from Ohio, who will soon speak, was very active in the National Governors' Association and the Association of Highway Administrators, which had given sound support through that legislation. He did not come by it by accident. It took absolutely years to build up to get this done. 
   The National Governors' Association, National Conference of State Legislatures, Council of State Governments, U.S. Conference of Mayors, National League of Cities, National Association  of Counties--these are groups that visit us every day on various issues. They write:  
   Proposals that would interfere with or reduce revenues coming to either trust fund by suspending or repealing any portion of Federal transportation taxes would undercut critical commitments to the nation's public infrastructure and potentially threaten the credit quality of state and local bonds already issued to finance highway, bridge and airport construction and repair.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in this effort, I am joined by the following organizations as of this moment. Within 3 hours this afternoon, they have come to my door in great numbers. I urge Senators to listen to the following. Opposing this measure--the substance of the bill--are the National Governors' Association. The distinguished Presiding Officer was a former Governor and was active in that association. Also, there is the National Association of Counties, U.S. Conference of Mayors, National Conference of State Legislators, Association of Road and Transportation Builders, Associated General Contractors, Building and Trades Unions, American Highway Users Federation, American Automobile Association. That list is growing by the hour. 
   I believe the Senate, at this critical hour, should be directing its attention in a constructive way to point out the failures of the Clinton energy policy. My colleague, the junior Senator from Alaska, has been a tireless worker on this effort. I believe either today or tomorrow he will be addressing the Senate on this subject. We should be focusing our attention on how, legislatively or otherwise, we can help the American free enterprise system to increase production. That production has been stymied time and time again by a number of Government regulations, such that today America is dependent for 56 percent of its petroleum energy requirements--56 percent coming across the ocean to our shores. 
   We are now finding ourselves in this great Chamber, watching intently as to what OPEC might do. A series of nations, the majority of whom--certainly not Iraq and Iran and others--we have come to their defense time and time again when their security and freedom have been challenged. Yet, we are sitting here by the hour waiting to see how they might provide this great Nation, the United States of America, an energy program of imports combined with our own domestic production to meet our needs, to continue to strengthen this economy, which is not only helping to support our Nation and provide jobs but, indeed, is relied on by economies throughout the world--all because of this petroleum. 
   We recognize that the price of gasoline has reached such a high level that it is beginning to have tragic consequences on families, on small businesses, on truckers, and many others across this Nation. Indeed, this Chamber is directing its attention to see what relief we may give. 
   But I say most respectfully to those who are proposing the suspension of this 4.3-cent tax and the possibility of another trigger requiring that to be subsumed into an 18.4-cent tax, that this is not a wise course, and I oppose it. I oppose it because the proposal is fraught with uncertainty. We could be taking an action which would not translate into relief for the drivers of our vehicles--those who are suffering from this. There is simply too much uncertainty in this course of action. That is one reason. 
   The second reason is it would impact negatively on legislation which I and others fought for years for and finally got through in the form of new highway legislation. I will address that in detail. 
   I ask the question: Is the repeal or temporary suspension of the 4.3 cents going into the pockets of the drivers? Can we give them that assurance? That is the question each of you will have to answer if you want to support this proposal. 
   What is the guarantee that this tax cut will be passed on to the consumer? What is the likelihood it might go in part or in whole into the pockets of the middlemen, the wholesalers, or the distributors? How are the drivers protected from the oil refiners and wholesale marketers from taking off some of this for their own reasons? Will the free marketplace enable them to charge the same price at the gas pump even after you achieve the rescinding of the 4.3? What is there to indicate that the price at the gas pump is going to come down? I can find no certainty. 
   I come back time and time again to one word-- ``uncertainty.'' 
   If it is not to be passed on to the consumers and the high prices continue, I think Americans will feel betrayed. They are now mad. But they could be more irate if they are betrayed by what could be perceived as a course of action. That could happen. But there is no certainty 4.3 cents will be put into their pockets. 
   What is the impact of this hollow tax cut? Is it a significant impact on our budget surplus? Very clearly--the way the bill is drawn, it will have an impact on that surplus. 
   The Department of Transportation estimates that the 9-month suspension--as proposed in this legislation--of this portion of the gas tax will result in approximately $6 billion less in the highway trust fund. That money, which by law in the context of the highway legislation that I worked on, will be taken out. That means there will be a shortfall in the next 9 months of $6 billion. 
   While the legislation as proposed by the distinguished leader has a unique provision--I am not sure I have ever seen one like it before--calling on the surplus--that is the general revenues and surplus--to replenish the lost revenue in the highway trust fund, there is some trigger mechanism in there. 
   But I ask my colleagues in the Senate: Do we want to be spending a significant part of our limited surplus for this uncertainty? If we knew it was going into the consumers' pockets, that might be one thing. But I have yet to find anybody who says it is absolutely going to bypass all the middle people and go into their pockets. 
   Do we want to take that surplus, which we are examining for debt reduction, tax reduction and other purposes, do we want to suddenly have $6 billion with just the 4.3 cents go into this type of scheme? If we go to 18.4, then it could well consume all the surplus. The question you have to ask yourself is, Is that what we want to do with the surplus? This Senator says no. 
   In other words, I would rather see such tax legislation as can pass this Chamber, tax legislation which guarantees by law taxpayer relief--the marriage penalty tax for one and the estate tax relief for another, specifically--relief that they need. And there is certainty. That is the word; there is certainty. But there is uncertainty with this proposal. 
   Do we want to use the on-budget surplus to give a tax cut to gasoline wholesalers? I don't. Do we want to use our surplus for 
   other, more certain tax legislation? Yes, I do. That is the position I take this evening. 
   Let's go back and look at the highway legislation that we worked on several years ago, called TEA-21. For over a decade in the Senate, I, along with many other colleagues on both sides of the aisle with strong bipartisan support--the senior Senator from Montana, Mr. BAUCUS, our former colleague, Senator Chafee from Rhode Island, myself, and others--teamed up in the Environment and Public Works Committee. I was then chairman of the transportation subcommittee, a position now occupied by our distinguished Presiding Officer, who I believe is in concert with me on the views with regard to this tax. Over a period of years we worked towards several goals, and we achieved them. 
   We wanted to first restore faith with the drivers who were promised over the years that the gas taxes they paid at the pump would come back to their respective States to be used for new highways, improvements in safety, and the like. But it never happened. We had the donor-donee situation, where various States got higher than they sent to Washington for taxes; others got less. And finally we struck a note of fairness in that legislation. It was landmark legislation. It has worked in our States. That is why the Governors in all 50 States are opposed to this. That is why the highway administrators in all 50 States and their organizations are opposed to the legislation. They made it work. 
   Tens upon tens of thousands of contracts are operating today to modernize and improve our highways and  other transportation facilities. Millions of people are engaged in employment and others in providing the supplies and engineering and design. The system is working as it was intended when this Senate together with the House of Representatives put this legislation into law. 
   TEA-21 guaranteed that all the taxes motorists paid at the pump would be placed in the highway trust fund. It would go into the trust fund, and, indeed, 100 percent went for highways and highway safety. 
   Before TEA-21, the gas tax was increased by 4.3 cents. I voted against an increase in taxes of 4.3 cents. But it went into the general revenues. As a part of the legislative process in devising TEA-21 right on this floor, we voted--I believe the vote was 80-18--to take that 4.3 cents which was going into the general revenue and put it into the highway trust fund. Now we are asked to suspend that source of income going into the highway trust fund. I am opposed to it. 
   As our Nation's transportation infrastructure aged and crumbled, it was imperative that we transfer the 4.3 cents from general revenues to the highway trust fund. Eventually, TEA-21 guaranteed spending reform which resulted in a 40-percent increase in funds for transportation over the past 2 years. Today, we are just beginning to see the benefits of TEA-21 with more projects under construction, jobs being created, products moving more efficiently across the country, and, most importantly, improvement in highway safety. 
   Do we want to now turn back the clock and inject uncertainty--that is the key word, uncertainty--into the funding profile needed for our highway program? 
   While the legislation has an untested triggering mechanism to restore general revenues to the highway trust fund, what happens if that trigger is pulled and it doesn't work? Again, uncertainty will jeopardize highway safety for the driving public and thousands of jobs once created by TEA-21. 
   In order to accomplish these significant budget reforms in TEA-21, adequate funding in the highway trust fund was critical to meet the many demands for the highway dollars. The highway trust fund is the sole source of revenue to improve our highways and bridges and maintain our bus and rail systems. 
   The consequences of a suspension of 4.3 cents of the Federal gas tax are very significant if that triggered mechanism doesn't work. First, State and local transportation activities will lose approximately $6 billion just from the 4.3. Second, there will be a tremendous loss of high-paying jobs. I have heard upwards of a quarter of a million jobs would be lost. Certain representations have been made by some of my colleagues, and I am not in a position to agree or disagree, that all the contracts that are currently signed in an operation have adequate funding. That could well be correct. However, I could not get the same representation from those individuals regarding the 18.4. If that suddenly comes in, it could jeopardize some of the contracts that are outstanding. 
   As Members come to the floor to vote tomorrow, they must have in mind an answer if the triggers go in effect--there are several triggers to the 18.4--what happens to the current contracts out there now and the people who are on the highways of this Nation working with trucks and all the other equipment to improve these roads. State and local transportation activities, as I say, will lose significant funds. 
   Second, there will be a tremendous loss of the highway-paying jobs. I have covered that.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. He has stood with me throughout this battle, succeeding me as chairman. He fully understands. He brings a perspective to the Government. He understands the problem of long-term stability in contracting on our highway programs. Of course, that is predicated on this trigger mechanism working. Perhaps the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee will know. 
   This is so serious, but I wish to inject a little humor. One of our colleagues today said this reminds him of pool. It is a three-bank shot. Picture the ball. That is the 4.3. You hit it off one bank, and suddenly it gets stripped off and goes around the other balls, which is the Budget Committee, so they don't have any voice in this. It goes off another bank. When it hits that bank, it picks up funds from the general revenue. Then it comes over and hits another bank to get around the Appropriations Committee, which usually has some authority over appropriating around the surplus, and then slowly goes into the pocket of the highway trust fund. So this is a three-cornered bank shot. Maybe our distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee can throw a little light on this triggering mechanism and how it works. 
   I thank my colleague.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on that point, this has been a great concern to me in my responsibilities on the Armed Services Committee. As the three of us are debating here in the spirit of the Senate, we have aviators flying missions over Iraq, containing that nation from further aggression, further human rights violations, possible further aggression from the very members of the OPEC cartel to which the distinguished Senator just referred having this meeting. They are risking their lives. What are we asking Americans to risk their lives for, at the same time we are sending spare parts to Iraq to increase oil production? 
   I asked in the Armed Services Committee the other day what, if any, commitments we made. I was assured by administration officials there was none. Iraq came up here the other day  and 
   committed to the world market 700,000 barrels as part of the 1.7, which my distinguished colleague from New Mexico just addressed. Then, at the same time, we have naval units in the Persian Gulf, right off Saudi Arabia, off the Emirates, off Kuwait, right off the coast of these nations, risking sailors' lives, and other nations have joined. Great Britain is flying with us over Iraq. They are taking risks as they try to enforce the embargo of the illegal export of oil from Iraq which, I understand from one of our colleagues, is coming now into the United States. How can we ask these young men and women flying these missions to take the risk of life in the face of this flawed energy policy? 
   I thank my colleagues. This has been a very good debate. I started off solo, and little did I know I would have the support of my two distinguished colleagues. I thank them both.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S.J. Res. 14. This important joint resolution calls for an amendment to the United States Constitution that would allow the United States Congress to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States. 
   For years now I have been among the strongest supporters in the United States Senate of amending the United States Constitution to allow Congress to prohibit physical desecration of the United States flag. I was pleased the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a resolution identical to S.J. Res. 14 on June 24, 1999, by a vote of 305-124, and I look forward to voting for S.J. Res. 14 in the near future. 
   In 1989, the United States Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision in the case of Texas v. Johnson, stated that the First Amendment prevented a state from protecting the American flag from acts of physical desecration. Since that time, a number of individuals have sought to seize on this misguided Supreme Court decision to justify flag burning. Mr. President, why would any citizen, who wishes to continue enjoying the great privileges of being an American, need a legal right to burn our Nation's flag in public? 
   No amount of tortured legal argumentation can overcome common sense and the plain meaning of the First Amendment. The first amendment to the Constitution states that no law shall abridge the ``freedom of speech.'' The key word in this portion of the amendment is ``speech.'' Laws that do not abridge ``speech'' are not prohibited by this section of the amendment. Simply put, burning the United States flag is not speech. A flag is not burned with words. Rather, a flag is burned with fire. As such, burning a flag is more appropriately classified as conduct, which is not protected by the first amendment. 
   The proposition that our greatness as a nation rests on whether or not an individual is permitted to burn Old Glory simply does not add up. At a time in our national history when disparate influences appear to be dividing people, the American flag represents unity. During the American Revolution, and subsequent conflicts, the flag has unified our diverse nation. Our flag symbolizes the freedoms we enjoy everyday. Generations of Americans have gone forth from our shores to stop enemies abroad from taking away these freedoms. 
   In addition, our great nation has always used the flag to honor those who, proudly in the uniform of our military, made great sacrifices. These are startling statistics that tend to be forgotten with the passage of time: World War II, 406,000 U.S. service members killed; Korea 55,000 U.S. service members killed; Vietnam, 58,100 U.S. service members killed, and Persian Gulf, 147 U.S. service members killed. For all those who gave their life, let us not forget that their caskets were draped in our flag as the final expression of our nation's thankfulness. 
   The memory and honor of those who have fought under our flag demands that our flag be protected against reckless conduct presenting itself as ``free speech.''

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on March 9, I advised the Senate of my intention to offer an amendment on Kosovo to the supplemental, assuming that legislation comes up. If not, I will consider other avenues of legislation to incorporate the basic structure of this amendment. 
   I have been joined in this effort by a thoughtful and well-respected number of my colleagues; indeed, the distinguished Senator from Alaska, who just departed the floor, and the distinguished Senator from Hawaii. 
   I placed a draft copy of the amendment in the RECORD at that time and invited comment and constructive criticism. I am so pleased to report that has happened in abundance. 
   I am here today to report to the Senate there has been an increasing interest in this amendment--positive, in most instances. I will refer to one bit of very constructive criticism momentarily. 
   We have taken into consideration the views of many. I will be putting in today's RECORD an amendment which shows certain modifications, technical modifications, which I hope will meet some of the very fine constructive ideas I have received. 
   To summarize, the amendment would require our European allies to fulfill a certain percentage of the commitments they have made to provide assistance and police personnel to Kosovo before the entire $2 billion contained in the supplemental for United States military operations in Kosovo would be made available. 
   The amendment would allow for the provision of 50 percent of the money--over $1 billion--immediately for the use of the Department of Defense. But the remainder would be dependent on a certification by the President of the United States that our allies had provided a certain percentage of their commitments of assistance to Kosovo. 
   If the President is not able to make that certification by June 1, then the remaining $1 billion could be used only to conduct the safe, orderly, and phased withdrawal of our troops from Kosovo--not a cut and run; not a fixed timetable; I repeat, a safe and orderly phased withdrawal. 
   Again, I have been pleased by the response that has been generated by this amendment. It is clear, we have already achieved our first goal of focusing attention on this very serious problem in Kosovo. 
   Actions on the part of our allies are being taken at an accelerated rate, and much more detailed information on such actions, past and present, are becoming available daily. 
   For example, this past week I received letters from Lord Robertson, the Secretary General of NATO, and Dr. Bernard Kouchner, the head of the UN Mission in Kosovo, outlining the increased efforts of burdensharing of certain allies. 
   According to the letter I received from Dr. Kouchner--I would like to quote a paragraph--I quote:  
   I very much appreciate the efforts that you have made so far which have been instrumental in improving our budget situation. Existing donor pledges have now been honored. The next challenge will be to get new donor pledges and to ensure that the pledges for the reconstruction budget of 17 November 1999 do materialize.

   Mr. WARNER. In addition, I had the opportunity to meet yesterday with Ambassador Guenter Burghardt, the European Commission representative in Washington, who provided me with valuable information on the contributions of the EU, particularly their efforts to streamline their process for providing assistance. 
   Several weeks ago, it was very difficult to get accurate information on what had been pledged by our allies--not that they were withholding it; people just could not find it, in many instances, and put it into writing--and almost impossible to get data on what had actually been supplied to Kosovo. 
   Now we are clearly making progress on this front, but more remains to be done. 
   I asked for constructive criticism. And within the hour, by pure coincidence, because I planned to deliver these remarks, came a letter from our former distinguished majority leader, and my very close friend and mentor, Senator Robert Dole. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print a letter from Senator Dole in the RECORD following my remarks.

   Mr. WARNER. Senator Dole wrote:  
   Accordingly, I would urge you to consider, at a minimum, allowing a Presidential waiver authority based upon compelling national security needs.  
   That sort of thing is often done. We carefully considered that. But after consultation with my cosponsors and many others, we decided not because it would make the amendment so weakened that it loses its purport. Therefore, I say respectfully to my former leader that that I cannot do. However, he has made other suggestions. And by pure coincidence and timing, they have been incorporated in the revised amendment, which I will file as a part of these remarks. 
   For example, he said:  
   That said, I believe in principle that you are entirely right to try to hold the Administration's feet to the fire to ensure that the United States continues to lead, while at the same time preventing it from shouldering an inordinate share of the international burden in the Balkans. The devil is in the details, however, and I am concerned that some of the targets identified in your amendment simply cannot be met, and that the European powers are being held to a higher standard than the United States. For example, is it realistic for the United States and/or Europeans to be required to disburse 33 percent of the funds needed for Kosovo reconstruction by June 1, 2000?  
   Prior to receiving this letter, we had made technical changes from ``disbursed'' to ``obligated or contracted  for.'' This gives the flexibility that is needed to obviate the problems raised by Senator Dole and others. 
   These technical changes, if I may enumerate them, give added flexibility to the President of the United States in making this very important certification. We have not, in my judgment, diminished in any way the strength of this amendment, but it has given added flexibility. No. 1, it makes it clear that the performance we are seeking on the part of the allies is to be evaluated, as we put in our amendment, ``on the aggregate.'' Performance of one nation which falls short, one nation which may not be able to make it, will not prevent the President from making the required certification. No. 2, we require that reconstruction and humanitarian assistance must be, as I said, obligated or contracted for. That point we covered in the recitation of Senator Dole. This is in recognition that even if the money has been set aside for Kosovo, some of these projects ``spend out'' at a slow rate. 
   These are the types of constructive changes that have come to my attention and we have incorporated them. We are still working on this. As I say, I have also been engaged in discussions with a number of administration officials over the past 2 weeks. 
   Last Friday, I had a productive meeting with the National Security Adviser, Sandy Berger, on the eve of his departure on this important trip the President is now undertaking. We were joined by OMB Director Jack Lew and Under Secretary of Defense, Walter Slocombe. As a result, of some of the technical information relayed to me at that meeting--it was a very good meeting--I have redrafted my amendment to take into account some of the concerns that were raised. While I think it is fair to say the redraft which I and my cosponsors have agreed to will not satisfy all the concerns of the administration, I believe our consultations are making progress. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print the latest version of my amendment in the RECORD.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the bottom line for the United States and for the other nations involved in KFOR--that is the entire military operation in Kosovo--is the current safety and well-being of our troops being deployed there--U.S. troops and those of some 35 other nations are involved and the formulation of a timetable, safety first, but the formulation of a timetable. We can't do it right now, but if the purport of this amendment is met, we will be able in the reasonable future to formulate a timetable for the establishment of the infrastructure, both economic and security, which will allow for the safe return of our troops and those of other nations to their respective homes. 
   Today, I had the opportunity to meet in my office with the Italian Minister of Defense, for example. He shares the common goal of this amendment. 
   We are now one day away from the 1-year anniversary of the start of the NATO war on behalf of Kosovo, on behalf of human rights. The world could not have stood by idly and watched the killing and the rape and the pillaging of that nation and done 
   nothing. It was a challenge to figure out what to do. On a number of occasions, I consulted with General Clark. Indeed, I was with him in part of that campaign, watching the operations he directed, and directed very skillfully. We could not have done nothing. 
   This is an appropriate time for reflection and assessment. What have we accomplished and what remains to be done? Clearly, the large-scale ethnic cleansing has stopped and hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanian refugees have returned to their homes. For this, NATO should be proud of their military action. 
   But what better way to express our pride in their successful accomplishment of that military mission than for the United States, in concert and partnership with its allies, to come forward in a timely manner and meet the commitments to solidify the military gains? None of us are totally satisfied. A regrettable chapter relates to the Serbian people who lived in those areas, many of whom have left after the cessation of the 78-day campaign. But I think the KFOR troops are doing their best to provide equal protection and that we are continuing to address that situation because we have to have an evenhanded policy. Human rights, to be successful, has to be implemented evenhandedly. 
   Yes, the fighting has stopped. Unfortunately, the violence continues. Recent events in Mitrovica and in the vicinity of the Presevo Valley are cause for great concern. Bottom line, until there is an economic structure in place, together with a security structure, we will not see substantial progress in creating peaceful, civil society in Kosovo. Until that happens, under the administration's current plan, U.S. troops could remain indefinitely in Kosovo. 
   Earlier this week, General Reinhardt, the commander of KFOR, said--and I believe I am quoting him accurately--that he believed KFOR troops would be in Kosovo for up to a decade. To make such a declaration at this time, I say, with respect to this fine professional military officer whom I have met--I met him in Pristina about a month ago, right in his office--I repeat, to make such a declaration at this time I find unacceptable. This is one of the motivating factors behind the amendment I have proposed. We cannot let General Reinhardt or anyone else set a timetable of a decade. We need to see more progress on the civil implementation side.

   Mr. WARNER. It outlines in full his concepts, which are very interesting. I have been on the Senate floor with Senator BYRD so many times. He is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. No one takes to heart more dearly the welfare of the men and women of the Armed Forces and their families than Senator BYRD. He is concerned about their welfare as am I. We have joined together at a meeting in the White House, I think some 3 weeks ago, to discuss this very subject. 
   He spoke up with great courage and determination to the President and the Secretaries of State and Defense. It was quite an interesting meeting. What we cannot allow to happen is for the current situation in Kosovo to drift on for a decade. I say no. There are problems. Those problems are surmountable if we work together. They must be addressed. They must be addressed in a timely manner. 
   I hope the amendment in its present form, revised, will contribute to this goal. I, once again, encourage my colleagues and others to come forward with any constructive suggestions they may have. I continue to say that this Senator--I think I can speak for my cosponsors--is going to stand firm, firm in furtherance of the goals of human rights in Kosovo, in furtherance of remaining as a vital partner of NATO, in furtherance of creating a record to show that NATO can handle peacekeeping missions. To do that, we need more timely assistance from those who have committed to provide the infrastructure of economics and security. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, with complete humility, may I ask to be associated with the remarks of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia on behalf of our colleague. 
   I have had the privilege of serving both with the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from Alaska. This is my 22nd or 23rd year, I think. I have lost count. But in those years, I have come to so respect both Senators. As we look at life in the Senate, there are no moments that are more cherished, no more well deserved than when a colleague rises at his or her own initiative to speak from the heart, as our distinguished Senator from West Virginia has done. He evoked the great quote from the Bible about the prophet without honor. But I would say to my friend from West Virginia, I have never thought of Senator STEVENS--until this moment--as being a prophet, but I have always thought of him with honor. 
   Although we are from the same side of the aisle, we have had very strong and vigorous debate in dissent, but I have never left the Chamber with less than the feeling that it has been a fair fight, and an honest fight, having even greater respect for our distinguished colleague. 
   How richly he deserves this honor. Like you, I say to the Senator, I only wish I could be there. But we will be there in spirit. 
   I thank my colleagues.

    Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I rise today to recognize and say farewell to an outstanding Naval Officer, Rear Admiral Andrew A. Granuzzo as he prepares to retire upon completion of forty-two years of distinguished service. It is a privilege for me to honor his many outstanding achievements and commend him for his devotion to the Navy and our great nation. 
   A native New Yorker, Rear Admiral Granuzzo's Navy career began in 1958 upon his enlistment. During the years that followed, he was commissioned as a naval officer and earned his wings of gold as a naval aviator. His assignments included sea duty with helicopter antisubmarine squadrons on both coasts, service with an attack helicopter squadron in Vietnam, and exchange duty in the United Kingdom with the Royal Navy. He commanded Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron 15, was navigator of the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Forrestal and commanded two ships, U.S.S. Inchon and U.S.S. Saipan. 
   Rear Admiral Granuzzo was selected for Flag rank in 1991, and commanded Amphibious Group Two, leading a 22-nation NATO exercise at sea. Twice, he commanded Joint Task Groups interdicting the flow of drugs through the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. 
   Perhaps his most significant contribution to the Navy is the role he has played in reshaping the Navy's diverse and often divergent aspects of safety, environmental protection, and occupational health. As Commander of the Naval Safety Center, he introduced the principles of risk management to naval operations. During his tenure, accidents and fatalities, on and off duty, was dramatically reduced and the lowest accident rate in naval aviation history was achieved. 
   As the Director of Environmental Protection, Safety and Occupational Health Division for the Chief of Naval Operations, Rear Admiral Granuzzo provided dynamic, inspirational and brilliant leadership during a critical, highly visible period for the Navy. As advocate for both naval operations and the environment, he pioneered new initiatives, including the first-ever, capped cost, commercially insured, installation environmental clean up contract, which has the potential of saving tax payers hundreds of millions of dollars. Additionally, he spearheaded savings in workers' compensation costs; accelerated field tests of a new bioremediation method for the biohazard perchlorate; and conceived a program that reduced shipboard oil spills. Rear Admiral Granuzzo's innovations have positioned the Navy to ensure its ships leave a clean wake, its facilities and installations preserve and protect the natural environment, and its people embrace their role as good stewards of the environment. 
   From the beginnings of the cold war, through Vietnam, the gulf war, and beyond--forty-two years in all--Rear Admiral Granuzzo has served as a warrior of uncommon valor. He is an individual of rare character and his professionalism will be sincerely missed. I am proud, Mr. President, to thank him for his honorable service in the United States Navy, and to wish him ``fair winds and following seas'' as he closes his distinguished military career.

   I ask unanimous consent to have an amendment appended at the conclusion of my remarks.

<DOCNO>106-warner-va-2-20000309</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Presiding Officer is familiar with the matter I bring to the attention of the Senate, and I thank him for his advice and willingness to participate in the undertaking to prepare the amendment which I will now address. 
   I rise today to advise the Senate of a proposed amendment on Kosovo, a form of which I and other cosponsors intend to offer when the Senate considers the fiscal year 2000 Supplemental Appropriations Act. An experienced group of colleagues have worked together, and we will continue to work together on this legislation. I thank Senators STEVENS, INOUYE, ROBERTS, and SNOWE for joining me as cosponsors in this effort. 
   I inform the Senate about this amendment now so that other colleagues, officials in the administration, and, indeed, our allies and other nations and organizations will have sufficient time to study and provide constructive comment on this legislation prior to the Senate's consideration of the supplemental later this month. 
   This is a vital issue, as our Presiding Officer knows full well. It is critical to the men and women of our Armed Forces that the U.S. Congress face up to this issue. It is equally critical to the brave troops of other nations serving in Kosovo. It is critical to the future of NATO, and it is critical to future peacekeeping missions. 
   There are an ever-increasing number of problems in the world today. It is a far more complex and dangerous place than it was a decade ago or a decade before that. Indeed, as I look back on the cold-war era, there was a certain amount of certainty within which we were able to structure our forces, lay down a strategy, and perform our missions. Today, it is greatly 
   different. The challenges posed to our national leaders, and particularly the men and women of the Armed Forces, have little precedent. Likewise, the diversity of the threats have now proliferated throughout the world. They are less and less nation sponsored, state sponsored; oftentimes, they are just small groups. There are conflicts in ever-increasing numbers, prompted by cultural, ethnic, and religious differences. 
   As I publicly stated regarding this amendment, my intention in offering this legislation is to ensure that our European allies have stepped up to meet their share in providing the necessary resources and personnel for the civil implementation in Kosovo, the efforts to which we have all pledged as a group of nations to fulfill. Once the military mission was completed, then we committed among ourselves to take the next step to ensure the peace that was given as a consequence of the sacrifices and the professionalism of the men and women who promulgated that combat action for 78 days. 
   During that period of combat, the United States bore the major share of the military burden for the air war, flying almost 70 percent of the total strike and support forces at a cost of over $4 billion to the American taxpayer. Many, many aviators and others took high personal risks. We were joined in that combat operation by another seven or eight nations that indeed did fly, willingly and courageously. However, it was the United States only--how well our colleagues know--that had the high-performance aircraft, the guided missiles, that support the transport aircraft. NATO did not have it. Those elements of our military, whether they were in or out of NATO, were brought together to promulgate this successful military operation. 
   In return, the Europeans then promised to pay the major share of the burdens to secure the peace. So far, they have committed and pledged billions of dollars for this goal. I acknowledge that. They have come in diverse amounts at diverse periods of time, but the problem is not enough money has been put up thus far in a timely fashion to make their way to the Kosovo problems, and then begin to solve those problems. 
   Why the delay? The troops and the public are entitled to know. As a result, our troops and other troops are having to make up for the shortfalls of failing to provide the police force--something we all agreed upon long before the first shot was fired. The troops today, therefore, are having to make up for those shortfalls by performing basic police functions, such as running  towns and villages, acting mayors, settling all types of disputes, and guarding individual houses and historic sites. The distinguished Presiding Officer visited this region just a month or so ago, as did I, and witnessed this. 
   The troops are functioning in areas for which they were not specifically trained. However, there is an extraordinary learning curve for men and women in the Armed Forces of the United States of America and, indeed, other nations. The Presiding Officer and I know; we were privileged to wear uniforms ourselves at one time. We know how well these young men and women can adapt to challenges. 
   They were not specifically trained, but they are doing the job, and they were doing it very well, 
   but at a great personal risk, I say to the Presiding Officer, at a great personal risk. We have seen in the past few weeks, in Mitrovica and other areas, outbursts, we have seen woundings, we have seen deaths. 
   That was not a situation we anticipated would take place if there had been a timely sequencing of the military actions and the placing of a civilian police force, infrastructure adjustments, and all the other things needed to bring together Kosovo as an operating society. 
   Our troops engaged in a high-risk mission, along with others. Their courage, their professional work, as I said, was witnessed by the Presiding Officer and myself, on my trip, and by many others in the Senate. I credit the large number of Senators for taking the time to go over and visit with our troops to see for themselves the complexity of the situation and the risks that are being taken. 
   As I said, our troops accept that risk. Indeed, the American people thus far have accepted that risk. But it is now incumbent upon the Congress of the United States to begin to exercise its authority and to show some leadership, hopefully in partnership with the administration. We need to show leadership to make certain, regarding the commitment made by our allies and other organizations--whether it be the United Nations, the E.U., the OSCE, or many others who are working in governmental organizations--that we are pulling on the oars together. I am proud to say our country, as best I can determine, has met in a timely fashion its obligations. But the purpose of this amendment is to draw the attention of our allies to the fact the record does not show that they are likewise fulfilling their commitments in a timely way. 
   We braved those 78 days of combat. Along with other nations that participated we laid the foundation for peace in Kosovo. What we cannot and must not allow to happen is for the risk to our troops to endlessly drift on because of the failure of our allies to live up to their share of the commitments. This is the bottom line of this amendment. 
   The amendment is simple and straightforward. Half of the funding included in the supplemental for the U.S. military operations in Kosovo--over $1 billion; that is one-half; it is a total of $2 billion--would be provided up front, ready for prompt disbursal to stop the drawdown of the readiness accounts. This would pay for the expenses accrued by our military in Kosovo since the start of the current fiscal year, way back on October 1, 1999. 
   The remainder of the money, roughly another $1 billion, would be available only--and I underline ``only''--after the President of the United States certifies to the Congress that the European Commission, the member nations of the European Union, and the European member nations of NATO have provided a substantial percentage of the assistance and personnel which they themselves have committed to the various civil implementation efforts in Kosovo. 
   This is an important point that needs to be emphasized. In this legislation we are not seeking an arbitrary or unachievable standard. We are holding the Europeans accountable for the pledges and commitments which they have made. Recognizing that nations have different fiscal years and different procedures, we are not asking for full compliance within the context of this legislation. We expect eventually full compliance. 
   In the critical areas of humanitarian assistance, support for the Kosovo Consolidated Budget--the money needed by Dr. Kouchner, to whom I will refer later; he is the head of the U.N. mission--to run Kosovo and the police for the U.N. international police force, the Europeans must provide 75 percent of the money or personnel which they committed to provide before additional U.S. taxpayer dollars for military operations in Kosovo would be disbursed. 
   That is a formula I devised along with the others who worked with me on this, and the intention is to lay down the figures of who has done what, when they did it, and what is left to be done. Unless our President, through his leadership, and other world leaders, can bring this rough formula into play, then we have the triggering mechanism by which the President, if he desires not to certify, or cannot because the facts do not justify a certification. Then I will spell out what happens to the balance of that money. 
   As I mentioned, on the reconstruction side--I wish to repeat that; it is important--it is a more long-term endeavor. We are requiring the Europeans to provide a third of the money they pledged for the 1999 and 2000 period. 
   I will readily admit I do not know if a third of the reconstruction money is a good benchmark because that is the category of aid for which I am having the most problem getting accurate data. I cannot tell you the hours and hours involved in consultation, trips and travel to the U.N. and elsewhere, to the Departments of our Federal Government, indeed, consultations with the White House. I found everyone trying to be constructive. 
   We had a meeting at the White House with the Secretaries of State, Defense, the chairman of the Budget Office, the National Security Adviser. Trying to assemble the data is an awesome task. This amendment forces that task to be undertaken by that individual best qualified to do it, and that is the President of the United States, working in concert with these organizations and the other allies. 
   It is so difficult to get the data, but we have plowed ahead as best we could. We know, for example, that billions have been pledged at two international donor conferences for Kosovo reconstruction, but I have not been able to find within the administration, at the U.N. or at the E.U., anyone or any document or fact that could advise me and inform the Senate on how much of that money has actually been disbursed. 
   To put it in the vernacular, where are the canceled checks for what has come in already? It is as simple as that. The American people understand there has to be a record. That is part of the body of fact this Congress needs--and that is required by this legislation--as we decide whether or not to support a continuation of our military deployment, the U.S. troops which are part of the KFOR military structure. 
   Again, I compliment that KFOR structure. It is working. It is meeting unanticipated problems. It is doing the best it can. There have been some problems recently. Our committee has had General Clark in, just a week or so ago. We went over this, carefully provided oversight about every 3 months or less on this situation. 
   What happens, I ask, if our allies do not fulfill their commitments and the President is not able to make the certification required by this amendment? If the President cannot make the required certification by June 1, then the remaining $1 billion contained in the supplemental for military 
   operations in Kosovo may be used only for the purpose of conducting a safe and orderly and phased withdrawal of U.S. military personnel from Kosovo. 
   There it is. That is the bottom line. It has to be said. Someone has to say it. And I said it. I am very pleased with the support I have gotten from a number of individuals to step up and take on this responsibility. 
   Further, no other funding previously appropriated for the Department of Defense may be used to continue the deployment of U.S. military personnel in Kosovo. We have to seal that up. It had to be said. I thought long and hard on the time and the moment I would come to this floor and state it. But I did it. 
   We are not setting a deadline for the withdrawal of our troops. It is up to the President and his military advisers to decide how best a safe, orderly, and phased withdrawal should be done. Under this legislation, the President would have to submit his plan for the withdrawal to the Congress by June 30. In my opinion, that withdrawal should not take more than 18 months.  
   The bottom line is it is not fair to our troops, to their families at home, to the other troops, to remain indefinitely in Kosovo with the political structure, be it our President, the Congress of the United States, the legislatures of the other nations and their leaders, not to take some strong, positive action now to ensure this peace. 
   We cannot ask those people in uniform and, indeed, many civilians who are associated in this effort--there are a lot of volunteer organizations there--we cannot ask them to take the ever-increasing share of this burden and the risks, personal risks, simply because the nations are not willing, in a timely way, to provide the funding or personnel they promised for civil implementation in Kosovo. 
   Some will criticize this legislation. That is all right. I am prepared to receive it. But what is a better solution than what we have devised? If there is a better one, please come forward and give it to us. I invite constructive criticism. I invite suggestions. Those who worked with me on this join me. 
   Some may claim it holds the U.S. military deployment in Kosovo hostage to the actions of our allies; that we are in effect letting others decide whether or not our troop presence in Kosovo will continue by their inaction. I address that allegation now and say, quite respectfully, that our President has already made that connection. The exit strategy for our troops in Kosovo--as it is for our troops in Bosnia--is directly linked to the actions of the U.N., the E.U., the OSCE and others in achieving their goals on the civil implementation side. 
   Our President said on October 15 in a letter to the Congress:  
   The duration of the requirement for U.S. military presence (in Kosovo) will depend upon the course of events. ..... The military force will be progressively reduced based on an assessment of progress in civil implementation and the security situation.  
   This legislation uses the same link, the same tie to the 
   actions of others already adopted in concept by this administration. 
   In Kosovo, the U.N., E.U., and OSCE are the groups charged with the civil implementation responsibilities. Up to this point, I must say quite plainly, these organizations are not doing the job they committed to do in a timely manner in Kosovo. The successful NATO-led military operation in Kosovo was undertaken--at personal risk to our troops and those of other nations, and with billions of dollars in costs to the American taxpayers and the taxpayers of other nations--with the understanding in America and, indeed, throughout Europe that the U.N. and other organizations would promptly move in behind and consolidate the military achievements. Now, as a result of little progress in that consolidation, U.S. troops and troops from over 30 nations, are required to perform almost all the tasks and are facing an indefinite deployment and indefinite risk in Kosovo. 
   Personal bravery, international bonds of commitment, and prudent NATO leadership won the war in Kosovo, but will the slow pace of follow-on actions result in the loss of the peace? That is what we are facing. 
   Recent events in Mitrovica show how fragile the peace is in Kosovo and how time and unfulfilled commitments play into the hands of those who oppose the peace, and there are several factions that oppose this peace. 
   During a hearing in the Senate Armed Services Committee on February 2 with NATO commander General Clark as the witness, I and other Members signaled our intention to take legislative action in connection with the upcoming Kosovo supplemental to be proposed by President Clinton. It has not as yet arrived in the Senate. It is to revitalize the near stagnant situation in Kosovo. That is the purpose of this amendment. 
   Congress has a coequal responsibility with the executive branch, and we now must exercise leadership, again I say, hopefully in partnership with the administration. This is not a political document. Many went in with the best of intentions, but it is time we recognize that no matter how sincere those intentions may have been, we are not collectively, as a group of nations, fulfilling our responsibilities. 
   We, a growing number of Senators, state:  
   Other nations and organizations must follow through on their commitments if U.S. troops are to remain a part of the Kosovo military force.  
   The United States has far too many commitments around the world. Our military is stretched too thin as it is. We cannot have an open-ended, possibly decades-long military deployment in the Balkans. 
   We, together with other nations, went into Kosovo with the best of intentions--to stop the slaughter of tens of thousands of innocent people, to restore peace and stability to that region, and to help the people of Kosovo rebuild lives shattered by war and ethnic cleansing. But what has the situation achieved? What has this coalition really achieved? Clearly, the military has fulfilled its mission. To the extent possible, given the continued ethnic animosities--and how extraordinarily they persist--the military has stopped the large-scale fighting and created a relatively safe and secure environment, from a military perspective. However, unacceptable dangerous levels of criminal activity continue and put our troops and many others at risk. Therefore, we have little time 
   left in which to address this problem. We have to figure out, given the precious little progress that has taken place to date, what we can do in the future. This is one idea by a very conscientious and thoughtful group of Senators. 
   We must recognize the U.N. bears its share of the responsibility. We only say that because the U.N. cannot share all the blame or accept all the blame for the slow pace of progress in Kosovo. But we are mindful of the fact that international organizations are dependent on timely contributions of money and personnel from member nations. In other words, the U.N. acts as a funneling of these funds as they are contributed pursuant to commitments by the various nations. These contributions have been severely lacking, severely delayed in the case of Kosovo. 
   When I was in Pristina in January, I had the opportunity to meet with Dr. Kouchner--an extraordinary man--the head of the UNMIK, the U.N. mission in Kosovo. He is a very dedicated and committed individual. He has given up much of his private life to go into that area to do the very best he can. 
   We conducted that meeting with General Reinhardt at the KFOR headquarters, the headquarters, I might add, which on that particular night did not even have running water and the electricity was flickering. It is just an example of the inability to deliver the very basic necessities. 
   I remember Dr. Kouchner said that night--he was bitterly cold--that there were people literally huddled in their homes without adequate food, heat, shelter, and the like, and it could have been alleviated, to some degree, had these nations stepped up and met their commitments. 
   As I said, I was impressed with the professionalism and dedication of the general and Dr. Kouchner. 
   Dr. Kouchner sounded a consistent and urgent theme. He desperately needed money if the U.N. was to achieve its goals in Kosovo. Dr. Kouchner has been going from capital to capital across Europe and, indeed, in this hemisphere--he visited here just a few days ago--urging nations to live up to the commitments they made, to send the money for his mission. General Reinhardt has been supporting Dr. Kouchner in his efforts, since the general understands the KFOR troops continue to bear the full burden if the U.N. mission does not succeed and the missions of all the organizations. 
   According to General Reinhardt:  
   The problem for Bernard Kouchner is that he doesn't get the money to pay for what he knows he needs and wants for Kosovo. ..... The international community--the same governments that decided to get us here--doesn't give him what ..... he needs, and it has a direct impact on my soldiers.  
   On Monday, March 6, Dr. Kouchner and General Reinhardt, as I said, were at the U.N. to report to the Security Council on the situation in Kosovo. Dr. Kouchner told the Security Council:  
   If we hope to build democracy in Kosovo, we must do more than ensure the safety of its residents. We must allocate the necessary resources to accomplish the job.  
   I agree. Foreign donors must deliver immediately, as the United States has done, on their commitments and promises. 
   My greatest concern is with the international police. The U.N. has said it needs an international police force of  4,718. To date, only 2,359 police have arrived in Kosovo. It is interesting, just about half of what was projected. The United States has done its share. We have already deployed 481 police, and the remaining police pledged by the U.S.--for a total of 550--will arrive in Kosovo shortly. Others, particularly Europeans, have to do their share by providing the necessary police forces. Overall, nations have pledged over 4,400 police. They must now deliver on these pledges. Pledges do not help with the current violence. We need to put it in words that Americans understand: ``Cops on the beat.'' 
   I commend my distinguished ranking member, Senator LEVIN, who has constantly hit that theme in open sessions over and over again. To a large measure, he joins me in the purport of this amendment. Hopefully, in the weeks to come, with his advice, and with others advice, we can, to the extent necessary--maybe not necessary--reconfigure some of the language of this amendment. 
   We had a meeting today with officials of our administration in the Armed Services hearing, again, to show the amendment and to urge them to come forward and give us such suggestions as they wish to make. 
   I spoke, by phone, with Secretary Cohen and National Security Adviser Berger. It is not as if we are out here operating on our own. We are trying to do our best. But remember, Congress has coequal responsibility and must exercise its best leadership. 
   NATO's soldiers must get out of the business of policing. That will not happen until enough police arrive. Our troops are not policemen. They were not specifically trained, as I said, to perform these tasks. It should not be a part of their continuing indefinite mission. 
   Since the air war began almost a year ago, the United States has spent over $5 billion for our military operations in Kosovo--$5 billion. It was for a good cause. But $5 billion is desperately needed by our military today for its modernization. The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, at lunch--and the Presiding Officer was there--recounted program after program in terms of the airlift, the aging C-5, the aging C-41, the need to up the buy of the C-17. That is where these needed dollars are required. 
   The annual price tag for the military commitment is over $2 billion in Kosovo. This is a heavy burden on the defense budget, but we are going to, hopefully, get it in the supplemental so that we do not take it, as we say, out of their 
   operating accounts. That is the importance of this supplemental. Plus, it is a heavy burden on the American taxpayer. 
   In addition to these significant sums of money, I am concerned, again, about the safety and welfare of the men and women in uniform. I will come back to that on every single pace. Each day that I am privileged to be a member of the Armed Services Committee--and now as its chairman--I think and begin every day asking myself: What is my obligation to work with this committee to better the lot of the men and women of the Armed Forces and their families? 
   They are patrolling these towns and villages--as you and I are in this Chamber, and others--subjecting themselves to substantial personal risk while performing their duties. They are taking the risks. The American people take the risks. 
   I believe we have reached a point in time where it is the responsibility of the Congress to take action to ensure that others step up and fulfill their commitments--other nations and organizations--and that the U.S. military commitment to Kosovo not remain an endless commitment. 
   I place this draft in the Senate RECORD of today, rather than formally filing the amendment, to show our determination to put forth a constructive approach, not a ``cut and run''--there is never any intention to do that--but accountability for all trying to secure a lasting peace in Kosovo. That is the bottom line. I did not file it, so that, if necessary--if we get a good set of suggestions--we can change this document and improve it. 
   I believe the American people will continue to support the U.S. involvement in Kosovo. I know they will if they know that our President and their Congress are acting in partnership, in concert, to get this job done that is fair to all. They want to see our allies also step up and be accountable and to do their part. 
   I think--and I say this humbly--this proposal will help do just this. We invite the comments and suggestions of all. 
   I thank the Presiding Officer, and others, for joining me in this effort. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I join my colleague in the House of Representatives, Congressman WOLF, in introducing legislation to honor two former Representatives from Virginia's 10th district which designates two postal buildings in Northern Virginia after Joel T. Broyhill and Joseph L. Fisher. 
   The Honorable Joel Broyhill, was the first member elected to Virginia's newly created 10th district. He served in the House of Representatives for twenty-two years. A native of Hopewell, Virginia, Congressman Broyhill is also a decorated veteran and served as captain in the 106th Infantry Division in WWII. During the war, he was taken prisoner by the Germans and held in a POW camp after fighting in the infamous and costly ``Battle of Bulge.'' 
   Congressman Broyhill currently resides in Arlington, Virginia. I believe renaming the postal building at 8409 Lee Highway in Merrifield, Virginia would be appropriate in recognition of his honorable and extensive political and military careers. 
   I would also like to honor another former Representative from the 10th District, the late Honorable Joseph L. Fisher. Congressman Fisher had a notable political career in the local, state and federal government. 
   Congressman Fisher, who held a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University, began his career in public service as an economist with the U.S. Department of State. After his service in World War II, he became a member of the Arlington County Board. He began a three-term service in the House of Representatives when he was elected in 1974, defeating the incumbent Republican Joel Broyhill. 
   Subsequent to his service in the House, among other positions, Congressman Fisher served as secretary of the Virginia Department of Human Resources and was a professor of political economy at George Mason University. 
   Congressman Fisher's commitment to public service should be recognized with the designation of the post office located at 3118 Washington Boulevard in Arlington, Virginia as the Joseph L. Fisher Post Office. 
   Joseph Fisher passed away in 1992 at his home in Arlington, Virginia. He is survived by his wife, Margaret, their seven children, sixteen grandchildren, and two great grandchildren. 
   I seek my colleagues to support legislation to honor these two former members in recognition of their distinguished public service.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the conferees for their hard work and diligent effort to accommodate the wide range of interests on this long-awaited legislation. 
   I take this opportunity to make my position on the FAA conference agreement perfectly clear. There are three areas which I want to address. First, I am grateful to the conferees for the inclusion of my amendment delinking federal Airport Improvement Program (AIP) funds to Reagan National and Dulles International Airports to the confirmation of federal appointees to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA). This provision ensures the release of $144 million to allow for critical safety and modernization plans to go forward. Second, I want to express my regret that the provision raising the Passenger Facility Charges (PFC) was included as part of the conference agreement. Lastly, it was my strong preference that no new additional flights be allowed into and out of Reagan National Airport. Despite my opposition, it was the will of the Congress to increase the number of slots at Reagan National. I will continue to oppose any increase in the number of flights at Reagan National. 
   I am pleased with the inclusion of my amendment to give Reagan National and Dulles International Airports equitable treatment under Federal law that is enjoyed today by all of the major commercial airports. 
   As you know, Congress created the MWAA Board of Directors and charged the Senate with the duty of confirming three federal appointments. In addition to the requirement that the Senate confirm the appointees, the statute contains a punitive provision which denies all federal AIP entitlement grants and the imposition of any new passenger facility charges (PFC) to Dulles International and Reagan National if the appointees were not confirmed by October 1, 1997. 
   As the current law forbids the FAA from approving any AIP entitlement grants for construction at the two airports and from approving any PFC applications, these airports have been denied access to over $144 million. 
   These are funds that every other airport in the country receives annually and are critical to maintaining a quality level of service and safety at our Nation's airports. Unlike any other airport in the country, the full share of federal funds have been withheld from Dulles and Reagan National for nearly three years. 
   These critically needed funds have halted important construction projects at both airports. Of the over $144 million that is due, approximately $161 million will fund long-awaited construction projects and $40 million is needed to fund associated financing costs. 
   I respect the right of the Senate to exercise its constitutional duties to confirm the President's nominees to important federal positions. I do not, however, believe that it is appropriate to link the Senate's confirmation process to vitally needed federal dollars to operate airports. 
   This amendment would not remove the Congress of the United States, and particularly the Senate, from its advise-and-consent role. It allows the  money, however, which we need for the modernization of these airports, to flow properly to the airports. These funds are critical to the modernization program of restructuring them physically to accommodate somewhat larger traffic patterns, as well as do the necessary modernization to achieve safety-most important, safety-and greater convenience for the passengers using these two airports. 
   Mr. President, my amendment is aimed at ensuring that necessary safety and service improvements proceed at Reagan National and Dulles and I am pleased with its inclusion. 
   Secondly, I wanted to express my profound regret that the conference agreement includes any increase in PFC charges. 
   The current PFC cap is set at $3 per airport and passengers can easily pay a total of $12 in taxes on a round trip flight. Already, airline passengers are subjected to a 7.5% federal excise tax, the $12.40 per passenger excise tax on air passenger arrivals, as well as the 4.3 cents per gallon Aviation Trust Fund tax on aviation jet fuel. Airline passengers can pay as much as 40% of their total ticket cost just in taxes. 
   Providing better airport facilities is imperative but raising PFCs in order to guarantee a revenue stream for aviation is like flying a jet plane with less than adequate destination fuel. You'll get off the ground but it will come at great cost. 
   Lastly, the conference agreement includes a provision that will allow for an increase of 12 flights at Reagan National Airport. The original Senate language included an unacceptable and astonishing number of 48 takeoffs and landings. I fought very hard to stem the tide as I had innumerable environmental, clean-air and local control concerns and am appreciative the conferees agreed to scale back the number of additional slots to a less egregious number. In crafting this agreement, I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate not to open future discussion on this matter without appropriate deference being made to my constituents in Virginia.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a truly incredible American and resident of McLean, Virginia for the past 35 years, who has passed from this world. 
   Chester M. Lee--known as ``Chet'' to family and friends--was born on April 6, 1919. After graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy Class of 1942, Chet Lee went directly into service in World War II. Chet was involved in a number of battle engagements during World War II and survived a Japanese kamikaze attack on his ship, the USS Drexler, off the coast of Okinawa in 1945. Chet Lee spent 24 years in the U.S. Navy, serving his country with great honor both in and out of battle. Chet helped pioneer the Navy's use of ship radar, was instrumental in development and testing of the POLARIS missile program, and commanded two Navy destroyers and an entire destroyer division. Chet Lee moved to Northern Virginia in 1964 to serve the Secretary of Defense at the Pentagon and achieved the rank of Captain before retiring from the Navy in 1965. He continued to be affectionately referred to by Navy and non-Navy colleagues as ``Captain Lee,'' and remained an avid Navy football fan throughout his life! 
   In 1965, Captain Lee requested to be retired from active duty in order to answer the call at the National Aeronautics and Space Agency, which was deeply involved in the Cold War space race. At NASA, Chet spent 23 years providing instrumental leadership during our nation's most exciting and pivotal space years. Captain Lee served as Assistant Mission Director for Apollo Missions 1 to 11 and then Mission Director for Apollo Moon Missions 12 to 17. He was Director for the Apollo/Soyuz space-docking mission, perhaps one of the most significant precursor events to the melting of Cold War barriers between the U.S. and then-Soviet Union. Captain Lee's impressive NASA career continued as he played an integral role in the development, operation and payload management for the U.S. Space Shuttle program. 
   In 1987, Chet Lee continued advancing U.S. aerospace leadership in the private sector, joining SPACEHAB Inc., a company dedicated to pioneering U.S. space commerce. He ascended to the position of President and Chief Operating Officer in 1996. Chet was instrumental in guiding the company's participation in the joint U.S.-Russian Shuttle-Mir program, and his tenure at SPACEHAB included 13 Space Shuttle missions, including the mission that returned Senator John Glenn to space. Captain Lee became Chairman of SPACEHAB's Astrotech commercial satellite processing subsidiary in 1998 and served on SPACEHAB's Board of Directors. At the age of 80, Chet Lee continued to work full-time on SPACEHAB and Astrotech projects up to his last days here on Earth. 
   Chet Lee was a tireless public servant, a devoted husband, father and grandfather and mentor to countless in the aerospace community. I am proud to have had Chet as a constituent, and my blessings go out to his family and friends during this time of mourning. I ask my colleagues to pay tribute today to Captain Lee's memory and to honor him for his contributions to this great country.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the distinguished  and exemplary career of Marie Fabrizio Dickinson, Chief Clerk of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Today, Marie achieves a notable and important career milestone: thirty years of continuous service with the Senate Committee on Armed Services. 
   ``Far and away the best prize that life offers,'' Teddy Roosevelt once remarked, ``is the chance to work hard at work worth doing.'' During the past thirty years, Marie has tirelessly devoted her professional pursuits to work we all know to be certainly worth doing: supporting the men and women of the Armed Forces. 
   Marie began her career in 1970 as the sole staff assistant for the Republican minority Committee staff. In 1987, Marie was promoted to Assistant Chief Clerk--serving eleven years in that assignment. When I became Chairman of the Committee in 1999, I was very fortunate to have Marie accept my request for her to serve as Chief Clerk of the Committee. 
   During the last year, Marie has excelled as Chief Clerk. The Armed Services Committee has undertaken many initiatives and issues in the 106th Congress--pay and benefits reform for our servicemembers, military operations in the Balkans, and an end to the decade-plus downward trend of defense spending. In each instance, at any hour of day, or night, under Marie's direction, Committee administrative operations have been flawless. The gains we have made in support of our servicemembers during the past year are due in no small part to the professional acumen and personal commitment of Marie Dickinson. 
   It is no small feat to attain the distinction achieved by Marie. Less than one percent of the employees of the Senate serving today have thirty or more years of service. Having supported five consecutive Chairmen prior to me--Senators Stennis, Goldwater, Tower, Nunn, and THURMOND--and seven staff directors of the Armed Services Committee, Marie is only surpassed in her duration of service with the Committee by the venerable Senator STROM THURMOND. 
   Mr. President, I invite you and our Senate colleagues to join me and offer our sincere appreciation to Marie Dickinson for her outstanding and distinguished thirty years of services. I do so with the hope that Marie will continue her outstanding service as Chief Clerk of the Committee on Armed Services for many more years.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am introducing this bill with the complete support and, indeed, the leadership of our distinguished majority leader, the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. LOTT. 
   The Senate will recall that Senator LOTT was one of the principal persons who enabled the pay and other benefits bill that was passed by the Senate, and indeed adopted by the President, to be introduced last year. He has exhibited leadership on this subject throughout. He is a former member of our committee, a very valued member. He has kept quite active on matters relating to not only personnel but the whole aspect of our national defense. I pay a special tribute to him and also to the  other members of our committee. Indeed, it is a bipartisan effort at this time in every respect to present to the Senate this piece of legislation.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to offer excerpts from three very insightful, thought provoking articles recently published in the U.S. Naval Institute magazine PROCEEDINGS. These articles were written by enlisted service members on the very important subject of retention of enlisted personnel in our Armed Forces. This is one of the most critical issues facing our military services today and I am encouraged by the solutions our senior enlisted personnel have offered as it shows their deep concern for their people, their service and their country. Allow me to share with you some of these perceptive views on this complex problem: 
   Senior Chief Navy Counselor Paul T. Pierce, USN writes, ``..... what is the number-one reason that sailors--talented sailors, the ones we want to keep--cite as their greatest dissatisfier? It is not pay or even family separation. Those issues always are near the top, but the number one reason sailors give for separating from the service is lack of advancement opportunity.'' He further states, ``The evidence is intuitive and irrefutable that we cannot build a force of professionals if we afford them virtually zero advancement opportunity. It is really that simple. ..... The fact remains that today's sailors are smart enough to grasp that promises of better opportunity made through almost ten years of draw down simply are not likely to materialize in any meaningful way in a ``steady-state'' Navy. This generation of young sailors and junior officers believes it has stupendous opportunities outside the Navy. Real or imagined, that siren's call is beckoning to them-imploring them to leave us. At the same time, many of them, particularly our mid-grade, second-term enlisted technicians, have qualities that make them highly marketable on the outside. ..... If we want to make real headway retaining sailors, then we must make the restoration of advancement opportunity a readiness imperative.'' 
   Master Chief Machinist's Mate James P. Russell, USN writes, ``Recognizing what sailors need is not an easy task. Sailors will always tell you they want more money. If we continue to chase the sailor's paycheck as the retention tool of choice, we will reach a point where we no longer can afford the price. It is unreasonable to expect that the Navy will be able to meet the perks and extras from our competition. It is the intangibles that will make the sailor stay for a career. We have things to  offer that no company on earth can match: the opportunity to make a difference; structured guidance and support throughout a career; responsibility at a level unmatched anywhere; a retirement plan that is guaranteed to be there at the end of a career; respect recognized throughout the world; the chance to grow and develop in an environment that is tolerant of mistakes; camaraderie that cannot be matched by any corporation; and an opportunity to experience all this in a global environment. 
   The person who needs to be able to transmit the knowledge of those perks to the sailor, and to make sure they are available, is that sailor's chief. Sailors are happiest when: they have a clearly defined mission; have ownership of their work environment; are held to fair, consistent and sensible standards; their families live in a clean, safe, and relatively comfortable location; and they receive recognition and pay that reflect the importance of what they do for their country. As the Navy leadership focuses on the first and the last, the responsibility of fighting for the rest lies squarely on the shoulders of the chief. The bottom line? Keep sailors happy and they will stick around.'' 
   And finally, Master Sergeant Michael M. Green, USAF writes, ``Our military and political leadership express serious concern for the ever-growing retention and recruiting problems facing the enlisted force, and have initiated moderate pay improvements to help resolve these problems. Much more can and must be done, however, to address the real financial needs and expectations of our enlisted warriors. The chief shortfalls of the current pay structure are in basic pay, the basic allowance for subsistence (BAS) and education incentives.'' He concludes, ``There are innumerable reasons why patriots choose and continue to serve in our nations military. There are significantly fewer reasons why they opt to leave. Financial compensation is the chief concern to both young recruits and old wardogs. Fashioning a more equitable pay and allowance structure will greatly entice tomorrow's warriors into service as well as to keep today's enlisted force serving proudly. ..... Our enlisted force is not composed of second-class citizens. It is a collection of the guardians of our nation and our national interests. It is time they are compensated that way.'' 
   These veterans have poignantly put forward their thoughts on a most difficult issue in an honest and sincere fashion. Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to share their views with you and the Nation they serve.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to address my colleagues on both sides of the aisle with regard to the deepening and very grave concerns I have in my heart about the situation in both Bosnia and Kosovo. I, as many colleagues, travel with some regularity to that region of the world, the Balkans. Just 3 weeks ago, I completed my most recent trip. I had the distinct privilege of being accompanied on that trip by the Supreme Allied Commander of Europe, General Clark, Commander in Chief of NATO Forces, in my travels through Kosovo, and then later the next day with his deputy, Admiral Abbott, as I went into Bosnia. 
   I have been to this region many times, although I am not suggesting I am any more of an expert than my colleagues. I first went in 1990 with then-leader Robert Dole. We went to Pristina, in Kosovo. I remember our delegation of Senators queried Senator Dole: Why here? Bob Dole instinctively knew that Kosovo could become a battleground. I remember Stephen Ambrose, the historian, was alleged to have quoted Eisenhower when Eisenhower was asked, 10 years after D-day: General, tell us about the next war. And Ike very wisely did not opine, except to say: That war could come as a surprise and may well come from a direction that none of us could anticipate. 
   In our visit to Kosovo, I and that tried and tested and courageous Bob Dole, a soldier of World War II, were confronted with a totally unpredicted situation while in Pristina. Thousands and thousands of people heard about Members of the U.S. Congress coming to this remote region, and they converged on the hotel. There was panic in the streets and a great deal of disorder. People were being trampled in the crowds, and Senator Dole had to make a wise decision, and a quick one, that we had to exit because we could be responsible for injuries to people, people who wanted to come to see us, people who wanted to tell us about the hardships that were then being inflicted by Milosevic. Indeed, we made a hasty retreat. 
   But as we went back to our plane, we passed that historic piece of ground, whose origin goes way back, in my recollection, to the 1300s, that field of battle which actually the persons who preceded the governing structure today lost. They lost the war, yet they still consider that hallowed ground. But I remember as we passed that battlefield, Bob Dole said: Tragedy and fighting will visit this land someday. 
   And that it did. Our Nation's men and women of the Armed Forces, primarily the Air Force, fought a courageous battle: 78 days of combat, tens of thousands of missions together with other nations--seven other nations were flying missions with our Air Force--and eventually the major nations of the world came to an understanding as to how that fighting should stop. It was causing tremendous damage, but there was no other recourse by which we could get the attention of Milosevic. 
   There are those who say today, in hindsight, perhaps we should not have done this, perhaps we should not have blown up that bridge. When I visited Pristina several weeks ago, someone said: We haven't got power because the power lines were blown out. It was a tough war, and our military commanders made tough decisions; 19 nations got together to make those decisions--a historic first combat by NATO. They made it work. Now they have basically stopped any major fighting and we are down to incidents --fortunately few incidents, but nevertheless dangerous ones. 
   When I looked into the faces of the young men and women of our Armed Forces, and indeed other armed forces, and actually walked the streets with a patrol, it was clear they were performing duties for which they were never trained in their military careers. Historically, our troops have not in any great measure performed the type of mission they are doing in that region. But they are 
   doing it and doing it very well. They are accepting the risks of getting caught in the crossfire that still erupts as a consequence of the cultural differences, the ethnic hatreds. Indeed, much of the fighting today in Kosovo is Albanian upon Albanian. It is retribution against fellow Albanians because they at one time or another did something to further the Serb interest. 
   Our troops are there. When you ask those in charge, whether it is the NATO commanders, the U.N. representative, the E.U. representative, or anyone else, no one can give you any time estimate within which our forces can be withdrawn. The infrastructure that was to move in behind in Kosovo, the commitments that were made by a number of nations to provide police, to provide money to pay salaries for the judicial element, to help rebuild the power lines--it is not flowing. It is caught up in bureaucracies, international bureaucracies. It is all but stagnant--all but stagnant. 
   I met with the commander of all troops, a very competent professional German officer. I met Ambassador Kouchner, who has been designated to pull together the various elements to make this work. We were in a room in the military headquarters. There was no running water. The water pipes were shut off, partially due to freezing and partially due to lack of power. The light bulbs flickered. Ambassador Kouchner pointed out we do not have enough power to keep the homes warm. There was a certain feeling we won the war but we could lose the peace, because the war goes on amongst the bureaucracies, no matter what the good intentions may be to bring forth and reestablish in that war-torn region of Serbia--Kosovo is a part of Serbia--the  infrastructure needed to bring back just a modicum of a normal life. 
   Foremost in my heart is my deep concern for the men and women of the armed services undertaking missions for which they were not trained. Missions which take them away not only from their families, but take them away from other potential deployments of our U.S. military, a military that is stretched far too thin already. 
   These men and women of our military need to have some definitization of how much longer we are going to keep significant numbers deployed to Kosovo. That timing is directly tied to the ability and the willingness of other nations and organizations to come in and consolidate the military gains, reestablish an infrastructure--be it judicial, be it police, be it rebuilding, be it a form of government, be it elections--so that the troops can return--ours and others--to their assignments and their bases elsewhere. 
   A similar situation still exists in Bosnia after these many years. However, let me draw a distinction. After the fighting stopped in Bosnia, the military decided they would locate the troops in heavily protected compounds. They would go out on daily patrols to prevent the eruption of further fighting. So far, that has worked. 
   Clearly, without any question, the military operations in Bosnia and Kosovo are a great credit to the men and women who fought them, the men and women who planned them, and the men and women who are still there today. That job was done and done well. 
   In Kosovo, they decided not to concentrate the military, either the U.S. military, or the other militaries. Rather, they were dispersed in the various regions. The U.S. region is the same as the one controlled by the British and the French. They dispersed them right out into the small communities so that men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces, four and five of them at a time, are living in some war-torn house or in a small churchyard where I saw them. Some are just guarding churches because of the incredible desire to destroy churches. That is a whole chapter of this tragedy which someone has to examine. The Albanian forces practically destroyed every church the Serbian people ever used. 
   Quite different is the military deployment in Kosovo from that in Bosnia, but both have worked. Both were carefully planned, both have a credible measure of success. 
   In Bosnia, the Dayton accords laid the blueprint. One can argue we should have done this and we should have done that in Dayton. Yes, we knew it could have been better, but we had to get an agreement, and we got the best we could at that time. 
   One of my concerns is we should go back--not reconvene everybody who was at Dayton--but go back and examine what was right and what proved not to be successful at Dayton and correct it. 
   The fighting has stopped, and the military provides a security blanket within which the various factions can begin to reestablish that country. Some progress is being made, but by any timetable, that progress is way behind the expectations, given the fighting has been over for several years. It is way behind, again, because of the difficulty of the bureaucracies working to bring in adequate police, and not just the police who perform duties on the streets, but in the case of Bosnia, we need an international police force to investigate and fight the rampant crime. 
   Beneath the security blanket provided by the men and women of the Armed Forces, organized crime is rampant. It has been said the only thing really organized in Bosnia is organized crime. The various ethnic factions get along very well in the criminal underworld. They have charted their ground. 
   Yes, things are slowly improving in Bosnia but ever so slowly. There we have independent entities. The U.N. has one area of responsibility, primarily the police; the E.U. another area of responsibility; the OSCE responsibility with regards to elections. 
   However, they each report to different capitals. 
   I had the Deputy Secretary General of the United Nations in my office yesterday. He is in charge of peacekeeping all over the world. He made clear how the four basic entities in charge of bringing about the restoration of Bosnia all have different reporting channels. There is no central authority that works today for the greater betterment of that region. 
   What has happened? You still cannot get a definitive date from anybody as to when the American troops and other troops can be withdrawn. 
   I say it is time the Congress of the United States should step up. We are a coequal branch of our Government. This body has time and time been called upon to vote for funds, for resolutions, and other legislative initiatives with regard to the Balkan situation. Now it is time for us to take a look at the constant flow of the American taxpayers' money and say: Is America going to keep its spigot flowing when, at the same time, other nations are not meeting their financial commitments or obligations? 
   If I can digress for a moment, I have studied this situation, I have talked with innumerable people, I have traveled to this region. The Balkan situation is the most difficult problem and a matrix of diversified responsibility and commitment I have ever tried to get my arms around. As soon as I feel I have one body of fact on which I can rely and reach a decision, another person will come along and say: No, it's different than that. 
   I have tried in this set of remarks to outline how I understand the situation to be in Bosnia and Kosovo. But I rise today to say to the Senate that it is my intention, when the piece of legislation we anticipate will be coming through soon, the supplemental--the supplemental has $2 billion--can I repeat that?--$2 billion associated with our obligations, military and otherwise, in just Kosovo. I think it is time we stated our intention as the Congress of the United States to allow the first part of those funds to flow--I will refine the language eventually--but to have a stopping point when we take a pause and we say to our President respectfully: Mr. President, no further funds of the $2 billion will flow until you can come back and give us some type of assurance, certification, or otherwise, that the other nations are living up to their commitments. 
   That should get the attention of the other nations. I say most respectfully, that should give our President some leverage to deal with these other nations. 
   I am not alone on this. I have talked to a number of colleagues. As I say, my language is not refined at this point. I welcome suggestions. I welcome those who can contribute facts where I may be in error with regard to some of the statements I make today. In good conscience, I tried to check out everything. But, as I say, getting your arms around this problem is not easy. Getting the body of facts is difficult. Indeed, others have worked as hard as I have. 
   Collectively, let us bring together our judgments as to how best and by what mechanism we can assert our responsibility under the Constitution--as the coequal branch, as those who control the purse strings of the U.S. Government--to string this purse of $2 billion such that our President can expend what has to be expended in the next 90 days, following adoption by the Congress, but that there comes a time when accountability steps in. 
   Our President has to explain to the Congress what he has done, what remains to be done, and hopefully some prospects of when these situations in both Bosnia and Kosovo can be brought to a state of affairs where the infrastructure allows the significant withdrawal of our troops and, indeed, troops of other nations. 
   It may well be that the United States--we took a major role in the war in Kosovo, a major role in the war in Bosnia--could turn over such balance of troop responsibilities as may remain in, say, a year, 18 months, to the Europeans. They are quite anxious, under NATO, to establish their own organization militarily to do certain things in the event NATO, for one reason or another, decides not to do them. This might be their first challenge. 
   I see on the floor the distinguished leader of our NATO group in the Senate, the Senator from Delaware. We just met with the British Foreign Secretary on this very question. This might be an opportunity to test that new military structure. I have concerns about that and how it might have long-term effects on the weakening of  NATO, but for the moment I give those who propose it the benefit of the doubt. It has not been completely refined yet, this concept, nor implemented. So that is another question for another day. 
   The reason for my addressing the Senate today is my deep concern for the welfare of the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States who are going through a winter far more severe than anything we have experienced here, certainly in the area of the Nation's Capital. And every day they could be subject to someone looking down a gun barrel, perhaps not firing in anger at them or the troops of other nations but firing in anger at someone else because of the persistent ethnic hatred that remains. 
   I say most respectfully, we have a duty in this institution to assert ourselves as to the timetable committed to by other nations with regard to their support in both Bosnia and Kosovo which, up to this point, has not been met. We should do everything within our power, and working with our President, to see that that is done. 
   Mr. President, simply put, the United Nations, the European Union, and the OSCE are not doing the job they committed to do--in a timely manner--in Bosnia or Kosovo. The successful NATO-led military operations in Bosnia and Kosovo were undertaken--at personal risk to our troops, and those of other nations, and with billions of dollars in cost to the American taxpayer--with the express understanding here in America that the UN and others would promptly move in behind and consolidate the gains. Now, as a result of little consolidation, U.S. troops--and troops from over 30 other nations--remain in Bosnia over four years after the end of that war, and are facing indefinite deployments to both Bosnia and Kosovo. 
   Personal bravery and international bonds of commitment won the wars in the Balkans; but, will the slow pace of follow-on actions result in a loss of peace? 
   During a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on February 2, when NATO commander General Clark was the witness, I first signaled my intention to take legislative action, in connection with the upcoming Kosovo Supplemental to be proposed by President Clinton, to revitalize the near stagnant situations in both Bosnia and Kosovo. I addressed this subject again this past Tuesday, during the Committee's annual hearing with the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs on the budget request. 
   I am considering a variety of options, including tying U.S. military funding for these operations to demonstrable progress by the UN, the EU, and the OSCE in fulfilling their commitments to rebuild the civil society in Bosnia and Kosovo; or requiring the withdrawal of U.S. troops by a time certain--perhaps in 18 months--and leaving the military occupation in Bosnia and Kosovo to European leadership. In the coming days, I intend to continue to consult with my colleagues in the Senate, and others in the Administration and outside of government, on this initiative. From my initial discussion with my colleagues I have to say, support is growing for my concept. 
   Congress has a co-equal responsibility with the Administration, and we now must exercise leadership, hopefully with concurrence by the Administration. This situation just cannot continue. Other nations and organizations will have to follow through on their commitments, the parties in the region will have to start cooperating with international authorities and taking on more responsibility for the fate of their region and their people.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and honor Lieutenant Commander John S. Jenkins, Jr., Judge Advocate General's Corps, United States Navy, as he departs the Office of Legislative Affairs and active duty service. 
   A native of Virginia, Lieutenant Commander Jenkins was commissioned an Ensign through the Naval ROTC Program upon graduation from the University of Virginia in 1987. 
   Serving initially as a Surface Warfare Officer, Lieutenant Commander  Jenkins performed in a consistently outstanding manner under the most challenging of circumstances during his first sea tour aboard U.S.S. Carr (FFG 52) where he was assigned as the Combat Information Center Officer. In 1988, U.S.S. Carr acted, with substantial contributions from Lieutenant Commander Jenkins, as the On-Scene Commander during the rescue of 89 U.S. sailors from U.S.S. Bonefish as a result of a fire on board that submarine. The following year, U.S.S. Carr distinguished itself during Operation Earnest Will escorting of U.S flagged tankers during the Iran-Iraq War. Lieutenant Commander Jenkins served as one of the ship's two Tactical Action Officers responsible for defending his own ship and the escorted vessels during this crucial demonstration of U.S. resolve in the Persian Gulf. In 1991, as a result of his distinguished record of achievement, he was selected from among his peers in an intensely competitive process for the Navy's funded Law Education Program. He began law studies at The George Washington University Law School that fall and graduated with high honors in 1994, receiving the Charles Glover Award for the highest grade point average as a third-year student. Upon graduation, Lieutenant Commander Jenkins was assigned as a judge advocate to the Naval Legal Service Office, Norfolk, Virginia, were he served as Senior Defense Counsel and Trial Counsel in courts-martial at the Navy's largest and busiest legal service command. 
   Since April, 1997, Lieutenant Commander Jenkins has served as Legislative Counsel in the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs. In this capacity he has been a major asset to the Department of the Navy and Congress. While relatively junior in rank, Lieutenant Command Jenkins' maturity, judgment, initiative and intelligence have made him a valued advisor to the very top echelons of the Navy and Congress on issues of great importance to our national security. His insight into the legislative process is respected and sought out by all levels of the chain of command. Lieutenant Commander Jenkins' dedicated service and his ability to effectively articulate the Navy's position to Members of Congress and their staffs have contributed directly and substantially to the Navy's future readiness and the success of its legislative initiatives. 
   Lieutenant Commander Jenkins' distinguished awards include the Meritorious Service Medal, the Navy Commendation Medal, and the Navy Achievement Medal with two gold stars in lieu of subsequent awards. 
   The Department of the Navy, Congress, and the American people have been served well by this dedicated naval officer. John Jenkins is a young man who knew he could make a difference and have an impact, and did. Those in this Congress who have had the opportunity to work with him will remember him warmly and will miss his constant energy and sincere commitment to the best interests of the Navy. We wish John, and his lovely wife Karen, our very best as he transitions to civilian law practice with one of Washington's most prestigious law firms and continued affiliation with the Navy through the Naval Reserve.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say with a great sense of humility that I have been privileged to be in public office for over 30 years. In the course of that time, I have had the privilege and wonderful opportunity to meet dozens and dozens of people who have held public office. I have listened to the very interesting comments of my colleagues with regard to the economy and interest rates and the like concerning the distinguished nominee, Mr. Greenspan. I simply go to a very simple but direct point with regard to this nomination; that is, dollars have a different meaning to people--savings, investments, and the like. But almost without exception they represent the efforts of hard work. 
   Therefore, when it comes time to preserve, invest, save, whatever you may do with those dollars--the man and woman primarily who have earned it--you want to know that the system, the value of that dollar, the protection of that dollar is there for your anticipated use and in many instances for the next generation. As to those people who are directly concerned with the regulatory process and decision process which vitally affects the value of the dollar and the protection of the investments, you want to know they are of unquestionable character. 
   I have known the nominee for many years and have had the privilege of working with him, playing golf and tennis with him. You get to know the totality of the man. This man is extraordinary. There will not be raised in the course of this debate, in my judgment, one single comment by any of my colleagues questioning this man's character. He is known by many in this community, he is known in this country, and he is known worldwide. The solidarity of his character and ethical standards is second to none. You may differ with him on some of his decisions, and that is understandable, but in terms of integrity, character, and ethics, he is beyond question. How fortunate we are that the President has selected this man to continue to serve this country and, indeed, the world because we are the world's leader in economics, national security, and in every other respect. 
   I am happy to add my few words and indicate my support that we are fortunate to have a person of his great character to step up once again and assume the arduous role and time-consuming lifestyle of this important post. But before we confer on him the advice and consent of the Senate and every other aspect, he is not infallible. As I said, I remember someone many years ago talking about Great Britain who said: You get to know a man--on the playing fields I think it was. He is not infallible. This man cannot keep a golf score. His partners constantly have to remind him. He cannot keep score in a tennis game. This is perplexing. I can bring witnesses to attest to this. But we have to overlook that minor matter as he deals with major figures, and we wish him luck with the anticipated action of this distinguished body. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senators for their indulgence in permitting me to make this statement. I feel very strongly about what I am about to say, and I wish to share some views with my colleagues. 
   Last Friday, I had the opportunity to participate in a historic mission to the United Nations. It embraced a series of events, led by the distinguished chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. On Friday, I was privileged to join the chairman and, the distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee, and other members of the committee for this historic occasion. I appreciated very much the opportunity to join the Foreign Relations Committee. For it was the first time in history that the U.S. Foreign Relations Committee conducted a hearing out of Washington, DC. I think it was most appropriate that the hearing was conducted under the auspices of the United Nations. Our distinguished Ambassador to the United Nations, Ambassador Holbrooke, facilitated these series of meetings. I commend him highly for his participation. 
   The Foreign Relations Committee events at the United Nations began on Thursday afternoon when Chairman HELMS became the first Member--very interesting, Madam President--the first Member of the Congress of the United States to address the U.N. Security Council. 
   The chairman's statement to the Security Council was tough, but those of us who have known Senator HELMS and who have had the privilege of working with him through these many years know him to be a very tough and resolute and forthright man. He spoke with candor, but, in my view, his statement was carefully measured. His objectives were constructive. In my view, he accurately portrayed the concerns of many Americans with regard to the United Nations--an important organization. 
   As I said last Friday, to the Secretary General at lunch--I spoke again to a large group of Ambassadors--and then in the course of the hearing, the world is dependent upon the existence of the United Nations to bring member nations together, and to try to work on a variety of problems throughout the world. 
   One of those problems of great concern to me is peacekeeping, which is becoming a greater and greater challenge. I do not in any way disparage the U.N. We came as a group to constructively give our viewpoints and to indicate the willingness of those of us who came and others to try to make the U.N. work more efficiently in the cause of world peace and to lessen human suffering throughout the globe. But that organization is in need of reform.

   Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I urge all of my colleagues to take a look at this statement of the distinguished chairman. I will address momentarily some troublesome criticism directed at Senator HELMS. I put his statement in the RECORD so all Americans can read it. Make up your mind for yourself with regard to the contents of his statement and the statements of others at that historic meeting, because I think we have to join together to try to help the U.N. become a more efficient, constructive 
   organization. 
   I would like to also call the attention of my colleagues to the statement made on Monday by the Secretary of State, Mrs. Albright. I quote that statement because I find it very troubling, and it prompts me to come to the floor today. 
   Secretary Albright said:  
   Let me be clear. Only the President and the executive branch can speak for the United States.  
   I say to the Secretary, for whom I have a high, professional regard, and out of respect for the very important office which she holds: Madam Secretary, you are mistaken. 
   I will not deliver a speech on the formation of our Government, but it is so basic that the Founding Fathers created three independent branches of government, coequal--I repeat: coequal--in authority. The President does not have sole authority in the area of foreign affairs. 
   I could go into detail regarding the checks and balances in the Constitution and specific reference to the responsibility of the Congress and those of the President, but clearly Congress, through its advice and consent role, deals with treaties. A treaty cannot go forward without the advice and consent of the Senate. We have seen this most recently with the comprehensive test ban treaty, a highly controversial treaty. No Ambassador can go forth from this land to represent this Nation without the advice and consent of the Senate, and no program initiated by a President requiring funding of taxpayer dollars can be implemented without the authorization of those funds by the Congress of the United States. 
   Madam Secretary, I say to you most respectfully: Reconsider that statement. I urge you to revise, as we say in the Congress, that statement in the context of the exact authority given by the Constitution to the Congress, and out of respect for the Members of the Congress who, Madam Secretary Albright, have respect for you and want to work with you, but not in the face of such a defiant proclamation as that. 
   My primary purpose in attending the hearing at the United Nations last Friday was to give my views on what I view as the tragic situation developing in Bosnia and Kosovo. Together with my senior staff on the committee, Colonel Brownlee, Mrs. Ansley, and in the company of General Clark, commander in chief of our forces in NATO, commander in chief of U.S. forces in Europe, and his deputy, Admiral Abbot, I toured both Kosovo, Bosnia, and, indeed, spent time in Macedonia. 
   I am gravely concerned. I have had a long association, as have many Members of this Chamber, with the conflicts in that troubled region. I was the first Senator to go to Bosnia, in September of 1992, in the middle of the war, arriving in the historic city of Sarajevo and seeing for myself the tragedy of war unfolding right before my eyes in the shelling of that city and the killing of innocent civilians. It was a very dramatic experience for me. 
   It motivated me to dedicate much of my time since then to that conflict and to try to do what I could, together with others, to alleviate the human suffering. I am concerned that not enough is being done in either Bosnia or Kosovo. 
   Let's look at a little history. Since NATO troops were first deployed to Bosnia in December of 1995, the United States has spent almost $10 billion to support our military commitment of troops to that nation. We are but one of many nations committing troops and funds to Bosnia. In addition, we have spent an additional $5 billion in Kosovo for the air campaign and the deployment of United States KFOR troops. Again, we are one nation, with more than 30 other nations, contributing military forces. The price tag for these military commitments of U.S. troops is roughly $1.5 billion each year for Bosnia and $2 billion a year projected for Kosovo. Those are very significant sums of money. 
   Apart from the significant sums of money is my concern for the safety and the welfare of the young men and women of the United States Armed Forces and, indeed, those of other nations who every single day march through the frozen streets of Bosnia and Kosovo, subjecting themselves to risk. The fighting still goes on in small, largely ethnic, conflict--particularly in Kosovo. Our military personnel could be caught in the crossfire tomorrow. 
   We experienced a tragic loss in Somalia--again, when the world had taken its attention away from Somalia. We had the best of intentions when we went in to relieve the human suffering in that nation. Then we drifted into nation building, and tragedy befell our Armed Forces in Somalia. A comparable tragedy could befall the Armed Forces of our country and those of other nations in either Bosnia or Kosovo tomorrow. 
   Why are our troops still in Bosnia over four years after they were first deployed? Why is no end in sight in Kosovo? The reason for that is that the  United Nations, together with other international organizations, are not doing their job. 
   We went into these military operations in both Bosnia and Kosovo with a clear understanding that if the troops performed their mission, which they have done in both countries, then the United Nations and other organizations would take the necessary steps to rebuild Bosnia and Kosovo--which is still not a sovereign nation, with no plans to make it a sovereign nation at this time; it is part of Serbia. Nevertheless, they would restore law and order and enable the people to live their lives in peace. The military has done their mission. The United Nations is failing. 
   In the course of the hearing we had in New York City, Ambassador Holbrooke, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, recounted how the United Nations had failed in its peacekeeping operations in Somalia, in Rwanda, and other areas. He said we cannot fail again. The Presiding Officer in the Chamber at this time was present during that hearing. He will remember I said that the United Nations is on the brink of failure in both Bosnia and Kosovo unless the U.N. steps up the pace of the fulfillment of its obligations, together with organizations that likewise have a commitment to provide an infrastructure of government and a rebuilding of the economy. 
   There have been positive actions; for instance, the recent elections in Croatia. Still, we are so far behind in the fulfillment of commitments to rebuild civilian administrations in both Bosnia and Kosovo. We have to move with swiftness. Otherwise, we are guilty of letting the men and women of our Armed Forces and other armed forces take on jobs for which they were never trained but which they are carrying out--jobs of being policemen, jobs of trying to bring some civil structure of life to these little villages, all kinds of jobs for which they are not trained as military people, but to their credit they are carrying out well. 
   We have to keep the pressure on the U.N. and the other organizations to do their job. There has been much discussion that the U.N. should take on enlarged obligations in Africa. We all recognize Africa is crying out for help. It has a measure of human suffering almost beyond comprehension. It has a measure of disease--primarily AIDS--beyond human comprehension. However, the problem is that until the U.N. can first fulfill its missions in Bosnia and Kosovo, I caution them not to take on additional peacekeeping actions of the magnitude of those contemplated for Africa. We have all been taught: Finish what you start before you take on a new task. I made those remarks, and I stand by them. 
   In consultation with the members of the Armed Services Committee, I will initiate a series of hearings to provide this Senate and others with an up-to-date report on the situations in Bosnia and Kosovo. Proudly, the first part of that report is that the military has done its job--the militaries of our Nation and other nations. Sadly, our report will show that the United Nations is falling behind daily in fulfilling its commitments, together with other international organizations. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Exhibit I 
   Address by Senator Jesse Helms, Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, before the United Nations Security Council, January 20, 2000 
   Mr. President, Distinguished Ambassadors, Ladies and Gentlemen. 
   Thank you for your welcome this morning. It is an honor to be here today, and to meet with you here in the Security Council. 
   I understand that you have interpreters who translate the proceedings of this body into a half dozen different languages. It may be that they have an interesting challenge today. As some of you may have detected, I don't have a Yankee accent. I hope you have a translator here who can speak Southern, someone who can translate words like ``y'all'' and ``I do declare.'' 
   It may be that one other language barrier will need to be overcome this morning. I am not a diplomat, and as such, I am not fully conversant with the elegant and rarefied language of the diplomatic trade. I am an elected official, with something of a reputation for saying what I mean and meaning what I say. So I trust you will forgive me if I come across as a bit more blunt than those you are accustomed to hearing in this chamber. 
   I am told that this is the first time that a United States Senator has addressed the United Nations Security Council. I sincerely hope it will not be the last. It is important that this body have greater contact with the elected representatives of the American people, and that we have greater contact with you. 
   In this spirit, tomorrow I will be joined here at the U.N. by several other members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Together, we will meet with U.N. officials and representatives of some of your governments, and will hold a Committee ``Field Hearing'' to discuss U.N. reform and the prospects for improved U.S.-U.N. relations. 
   This will mark another first. Never before has the Senate Foreign Relations Committee ventured as a group from Washington to visit an international institution. I hope it will be an enlightening experience for all of us, and that you will accept this visit as a sign of our desire for a new beginning in the U.S.-U.N. relationship. 
   I hope--I intend--that my presence here today will presage future visits by designated spokesmen of the Security Council, who will come to Washington as official guests of the United States Senate and the Senate's Foreign Relations Committee which I chair. I trust that your representatives will feel free to be as candid in Washington as I will try to be here today so that there will be hands of friendship extended in an atmosphere of understanding. 
   If we are to have such a new beginning, we must endeavor to understand each other better. And that is why I will share with you some of what I am hearing from the American people about the United Nations. 
   Now I am confident you have seen the public opinion polls, commissioned by U.N. supporters, suggesting that the U.N. enjoys the support of the American public. I would caution that you not put so much confidence in those polls. Since I was first elected to the Senate in 1972, I have run for reelection four times. Each time, the pollsters have confidently predicted my defeat. Each time, I am happy to confide, they have been wrong. I am pleased that, thus far, I have never won a poll or lost an election. 
   So, as those of you who represent democratic nations well know, public opinion polls can be constructed to tell you anything the poll takers want you to hear. Let me share with you what the American people tell me. Since I became chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, I have received literally thousands of letters from Americans all across the country expressing their deep frustration with this institution. 
   They know instinctively that the U.N. lives and breathes on the hard-earned money of the American taxpayers. And yet they have heard comments here in New York constantly calling the United States a ``deadbeat.'' They have heard U.N. officials declaring absurdly that countries like Fiji and Bangladesh are carrying America's burden in peacekeeping. 
   They see the majority of the U.N. members routinely voting against America in the General Assembly. They have read the reports of the raucous cheering of the U.N. delegates in Rome, when U.S. efforts to amend the International Criminal Court treaty to protect American soldiers were defeated. They read in the newspapers that, despite all the human rights abuses taking place in dictatorships across the globe, a U.N. ``Special Rapporteur'' decided his most pressing task was to investigate human rights violations in the U.S.--and found our human rights record wanting. 
   The American people hear all this; they resent it, and they have grown increasingly frustrated with what they feel is a lack of gratitude. 
   Now I won't delve into every point of frustration, but let's touch for just a moment on one--the ``deadbeat'' charge. Before coming here, I asked the United States General Accounting Office to assess just how much the American taxpayers contributed to the United Nations in 1999. Here is what the GAO reported to me: 
   Last year, the American people contributed a total of more than $2.5 billion dollars to the U.N. system in assessments and voluntary contributions. That's pretty generous, but it's only the tip of the iceberg. The American taxpayers also spent an additional eight billion, seven hundred and seventy nine million dollars from the United States' military budget to support various U.N. resolutions and peacekeeping operations around the world. Let me repeat that figure: eight billion, seven hundred and seventy nine million dollars. 
   That means that last year (1999) alone the American people have furnished precisely eleven billion, two hundred and seventy nine million dollars to support the work of the United Nations. No other nation on earth comes even close to matching that singular investment. 
   So you can see why many Americans reject the suggestion that theirs is a ``deadbeat'' nation. 
   Now, I grant you, the money we spend on the U.N. is not charity. To the contrary, it is an investment--an investment from which the American people rightly expect a return. They expect a reformed U.N. that works more efficiently, and which respects the sovereignty of the United States. 
   That is why in the 1980s, Congress began withholding a fraction of our arrears as pressure for reform. And Congressional pressure resulted in some worthwhile reforms, such as the creation of an independent U.N. Inspector General and the adoption of consensus budgeting practices. But still, the arrears accumulated as the U.N. resisted more comprehensive reforms. 
   When the distinguished Secretary General, Kofi Annan, was elected, some of us in the  Senate decided to try to establish a working relationship. The result is the Helms-Biden law, which President Clinton finally signed into law this past November. The product of three years of arduous negotiations and hard-fought compromises, it was approved by the U.S. Senate by an overwhelming 98-1 margin. You should read that vote as a virtually unanimous mandate for a new relationship with a reformed United Nations. 
   Now I am aware that this law does not sit well with some here at the U.N. Some do not like to have reforms dictated by the U.S. Congress. Some have even suggested that the U.N. should reject these reforms. But let me suggest a few things to consider: First, as the figures I have cited clearly demonstrate, the United States is the single largest investor in the United Nations. Under the U.S. Constitution, we in Congress are the sole guardians of the American taxpayers' money. (It is our solemn duty to see that it is wisely invested.) So as the representatives of the U.N.'s largest investors--the American people--we have not only a right, but a responsibility, to insist on specific reforms in exchange for their investment. 
   Second, I ask you to consider the alternative. The alternative would have been to continue to let the U.S.-U.N. relationship spiral out of control. You would have taken retaliatory measures, such as revoking America's vote in the General Assembly. Congress would likely have responded with retaliatory measures against the U.N. And the end result, I believe, would have been a breach in U.S.-U.N. relations that would have served the interests of no one. 
   Now some here may contend that the Clinton Administration should have fought to pay the arrears without conditions. I assure you, had they done so, they would have lost. Eighty years ago, Woodrow Wilson failed to secure Congressional support for U.S. entry into the League of Nations. This administration obviously learned from President Wilson's mistakes. Wilson probably could have achieved ratification of the League of Nations if he had worked with Congress. One of my predecessors as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Henry Cabot Lodge, asked for 14 conditions to the treaty establishing the League of Nations, few of which would have raised an eyebrow today. These included language to insure that the United States remain the sole judge of its own internal affairs; that the League not restrict any individual rights of U.S. citizens; that the Congress retain sole authority for the deployment of U.S. forces through the league, and so on. 
   But President Wilson indignantly refused to compromise with Senator Lodge. He shouted, ``Never, never!'', adding, ``I'll never consent to adopting any policy with which that impossible man is so prominently identified!'' What happened? President Wilson lost. The final vote in the Senate was 38 to 53, and League of Nations withered on the vine. 
   Ambassador Holbrooke and Secretary of State Albright understood from the beginning that the United Nations could not long survive without the support of the American people--and their elected representatives in Congress. Thanks to the efforts of leaders like Ambassador Holbrooke and Secretary Albright, the present Administration in Washington did not repeat President Wilson's fatal mistakes. 
   In any event, Congress has written a check to the United Nations for $926 million, payable upon the implementation of previously agreed-upon common-sense reforms. Now the choice is up to the U.N. I suggest that if the U.N. were to reject this compromise, it would mark the beginning of the end of U.S. support for the United Nations. 
   I don't want that to happen. I want the American people to value a United Nations that recognizes and respects their interests, and for the United Nations to value the significant contributions of the American people. 
   Let's be crystal clear and totally honest with each other: all of us want a more effective United Nations. But if the United Nations is to be ``effective'' it must be an institution that is needed by the great democratic powers of the world. 
   Most Americans do not regard the United Nations as an end in and of itself--they see it as just one tool in America's diplomatic arsenal. To the extent that the U.N. is an effective tool, the American people will support it. To the extent that it becomes an ineffective tool--or worse, a burden--the American people will cast it aside. 
   The American people want the U.N. to serve the purpose for which it was designed: they want it to help sovereign states coordinate collective action by ``coalitions of the willing,'' (where the political will for such action exists); they want it to provide a forum where diplomats can meet and keep open channels of communication in times of crisis; they want it to provide to the peoples of the world important services, such as peacekeeping, weapons inspections and humanitarian relief. 
   This is important work. It is the core of what the U.N. can offer to the United States and the world. If, in the coming century, the U.N. focuses on doing these core tasks well, it can thrive and will earn and deserve the support of the American people. But if the U.N. seeks to move beyond these core tasks, if it seeks to impose the U.N.'s power and authority over nation-states, I guarantee that the United Nations will meet stiff resistance from the American people. 
   As matters now stand, many Americans sense that the U.N. has greater ambitions than simply being an efficient deliverer of humanitarian aid, a more effective peacekeeper, a better weapons inspector, and a more effective tool of great power diplomacy. They see the U.N. aspiring to establish itself as the central authority of a new international order of goblal laws and global governance. This is an international order the American people will not countenance.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to explain to my colleagues an important change made to the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act of 1999, which was reintroduced as S. 1948 and included in the measure before us today. As my colleagues may know, I and other Senators had been very concerned that two sections of the legislation would unfairly have discriminated against Internet service providers. Many of my constituents were concerned that sections 1005(e) and 1011(c) of the legislation would be interpreted by the courts or the Copyright Office to expressly and permanently exclude any ``online digital communication service'' from retransmitting a transmission of a television program or other audiovisual work pursuant to a compulsory or statutory license under the Copyright Act. 
   I am pleased to report that these potentially damaging provisions were deleted from the bill before us. As my colleagues may know, these provisions originally were inserted in conference, even though the committees of jurisdiction had never held hearings on them, had never received any record evidence as to their need, and had never considered them in open debate. The committees of jurisdiction in the House and the Senate will now have an opportunity to carefully consider the application of the Copyright Act to the Internet and broadband service providers. 
   As someone proud to represent most of the major Internet service providers in the world. I have little doubt about the importance of the Internet and other online communications technologies for enhancing consumer access to information and programming. Online technology has transformed the way consumers receive information, including audiovisual works. It undoubtedly will bring other benefits, but only if Congress makes certain that it does not place unreasonable barriers in the way. 
   Because rapid technological changes are having an ever more significant impact on our economy, it is essential that the Congress give full attention to this issue early next year.

   Mr. WARNER. I rise to address a number of aspects of the State Department Authorization Act, which has been included in the final omnibus budget package of legislation. This bill contains a number of provisions that, directly and indirectly, affect the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee, and I am very concerned by the fact that this major bill was included with virtually no consultation with our committee. I believe that the process works better when the normal legislative procedures are followed. 
   I would like to raise a specific issue with the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Section 1134 of the State Department Authorization Act prohibits Executive Branch agencies from withholding information regarding nonproliferation matters, as set forth in section 602(c) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978, from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House International Relations Committee, including information in special access programs. 
   I am aware that problems with the dissemination of nonproliferation information have arisen in the past. DOD has taken steps to correct these problems and has established a policy that special access programs will not include nonproliferation information, as defined in section 602(c) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978. Based on my review of DOD's special access programs, I believe that the Department of Defense does not now have special access programs which include such nonproliferation information. I have been assured that, in the future, DOD will provide nonproliferation information to the appropriate committees of Congress.

   Mr. WARNER. I am concerned that some might interpret section 1134 of the State Department Authorization Act as requiring expanded access to sensitive DOD intelligence sources and methods, as contrasted with nonproliferation information itself. I believe that section 1134 would not require DOD to change its current procedures for protecting such sensitive sources and methods. Is this also the understanding of the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee?

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a very important issue that threatens to undermine the readiness of our Navy and Marine Corps units that are scheduled to deploy to the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf in February. That issue is the current situation on the Puerto Rican Island of Vieques where the Navy is being prevented by unrestrained civil disobedience from conducting training critical to its preparations for deploying into a possible combat environment. 
   Two weeks ago, I and four of my colleagues introduced Senate Resolution 220, that would express the Sense of the  Congress that the Secretary of the Navy should initiate the required training for the Eisenhower Battle Group and the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit on the island of Vieques, and that the President should not deploy these forces unless the President determines that they are free of serious deficiencies in their major warfare areas. 
   Over the past two weeks there have been discussions between the Federal government and the Government of Puerto Rico to try and reach an accommodation that would resolve the current impasse between the Navy and the people of Vieques. Unfortunately, these discussions have not born fruit and there is no resolution in sight. The simple fact is the President needs to act to resolve this impasse. 
   Today, the Armed Forces are at risk of reaching unacceptably low levels of preparedness. Last week we learned that two Army Divisions are not ready to execute the National Military Strategy without unacceptable risk to the personnel in those units. 
   If the required training for the Eisenhower Battle Group and the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit is not conducted in December, in February these two units will be unable to deploy without serious deficiencies in their warfighting capabilities. We cannot allow this degradation in the readiness of our Armed Forces to occur if we intend to maintain our position as a world leader, and honor our commitment to our military personnel to reduce the risk they incur when they sail into harm's way. As Vice Admiral Murphy, Commander of the Sixth Fleet of the Navy, recently testified before 
   the Armed Services Committee, the loss of training on Vieques would ``cost American lives.'' Over the past several weeks, the Armed Services Committee has held a series of hearings on the important issue of Vieques. Over the course of these hearings, I have become increasingly convinced that it would be irresponsible to deploy our naval forces without the training that takes place at the Vieques facilities. 
   On Tuesday, September 22, 1999, the Readiness and Management Support Subcommittee, under the leadership of Senator INHOFE, held a hearing to review the need for Vieques as a training facility and explore alternative sites that might be utilized. At that hearing both Admiral Fallon, commander of the Navy's Second Fleet, and General Pace, commander of all Marine Forces in the Atlantic, testified that the Armed Forces of the United States need Vieques as a training ground to prepare our young men and women for the challenges of deployed military operations. 
   On October 13th, the Seapower Subcommittee, under the leadership of Senator SNOWE, heard from Admiral Murphy, commander of the Navy's Sixth Fleet and the commander who receives the naval forces trained at Vieques, who stated that a loss of Vieques would ``cost American lives.'' 
   Earlier this month, after the release of the report prepared by the Special Panel on Military Operations on Vieques, the so-called Rush Panel, I held a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee to discuss with Administration and Puerto Rican officials the recommendations of that report, and to search for a compromise solution that addresses the national security requirements and the interests of the people of Vieques. In outlining the need for Vieques at that hearing, Secretary Danzig, the Secretary of the Navy, stated that only by providing the necessary training can we fairly ask our service members to put their lives at risk. Admiral Johnson, Chief of Naval Operations, stated that the Eisenhower Battle Group would not be able to deploy in February without a significant increase in the risk to the lives of the men and women of that battle group unless they are allowed to conduct required training on Vieques. Finally, General Jones, Commandant of the Marine Corps, testified that the loss of training provided on Vieques 
    ``will result in degraded cohesion on the part of our battalions and our squadrons and our crews, decreased confidence in their ability to do their very dangerous jobs and missions, a decreased level of competence and the ability to fight and win on the battlefield.'' 
   At that hearing, I asked Admiral Johnson and General Jones ``Is there any training that can be substituted for Vieques live fire training between now and February that will constitute, in your professional judgment, a sufficient level of training to enable you to say to the Chairman of the Joint chiefs of Staff, the Eisenhower Battle Group and the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit are ready to go.'' In response they stated ``no, sir, not without--not without greatly increasing the risk to those men and women who we ask to go in harm's way, no, sir.'' 
   I remain convinced that the training requirement is real and will continue to directly effect the readiness of our Carrier Battle Groups and Marine Expeditionary Units. As General Shelton recently testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee, the training on Vieques is ``critical'' to military readiness. He further stated that he ``certainly would not want to see our troops sent into an area where there was going to be combat, without having had this type of an experience. We should not deploy them under those conditions.'' 
   All of the military officers with whom we have spoken on this issue have informed us that the loss of Vieques would increase the risk to our military personnel deploying to potential combat environments. The Rush Panel, appointed at the request of the Resident Commissioner from Puerto Rico and the direction of the President, recognized the need for Vieques and recommended its continued use for at least five years. 
   What we have learned in these hearings is that Vieques is a unique training asset, both in terms of its geography with deep open water and unrestricted airspace and its training support infrastructure. The last two East coast carrier battle groups which deployed to the Adriatic and Persian Gulf completed their final integrated live fire training at Vieques. Both battle groups, led by the carriers U.S.S. Enterprise and U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, subsequently saw combat in Operations Desert Fox (Iraq) and Allied Force (Kosovo) 
   within days of arriving in the respective theater of operations. Their success in these operations, with no loss of American life, was largely attributable to the realistic and integrated live fire training completed at Vieques prior to their deployment. 
   According to Article II, section 2, of the Constitution of the United States, the President is the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Armed Forces. As such, he bears the ultimate responsibility for ensuring that the men and women in uniform he orders into harm's way, receive the training necessary to perform their mission with the least risk to their lives. 
   I am encouraged that the President has tried to resolve this matter with the Governor of Puerto Rico in such a way that would allow the Navy to conduct the necessary training. However, I am disappointed that the President and the Governor have been unable to achieve such a resolution. 
   Mr. President, as long as we are committing our nation's youth to military operations throughout the world; and as long as Vieques is necessary to train these individuals so that they can perform their missions safely and successfully; it would be unconscionable to deploy these forces without first allowing them to train at this vital facility. 
   Mr. President, the Eisenhower Battle Group and the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit will soon deploy to the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf. In order to do so safely, they must begin preparations to conduct the necessary pre-deployment training on the island of Vieques in December. 
   The time has come for the President to make a decision to protect our national security and the safety of our men and women in uniform. He must decide to allow the Navy and the Marine Corps to conduct this training, and to notify the Secretary of the Navy and the Governor of Puerto Rico of his decision.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a member of our Senate family who has dedicated himself for many years to serving the Senate and the Committee on Environment and Public Works--Jimmie Powell. 
   I know that our distinguished former chairman, Senator Chafee, would not have let pass the opportunity for the Senate to recognize Jimmie Powell's years of service to the Committee and his contributions to the protection of our environment. 
   Now, as he prepares to open a new chapter in his professional career and leave the Senate after some twenty years of service, I want to extend my appreciation and thanks to Jimmie on behalf of myself and the other Republican members of the Committee--Chairman SMITH, and Senators INHOFE, THOMAS, BOND, VOINOVICH, CRAPO, BENNETT, and HUTCHISON. The hallmark of his career has been his command of the issues, hard work and dedication to protecting public health and our environment. 
   As the staff director for the chairman and the Republican members of the committee, I know that Senator Chafee respected Jimmie and was grateful for his counsel and the service he provided. To staff, and to some members, Jimmie was an adversary, as well as a motivator and educator. 
   He began his Senate career with former Senator David Durenberger in 1978, serving as his staff director of the Government Affairs Subcommittee on Intergovernmental Relations and later as legislative director. In 1985, Jimmie began his long service as a professional staff member and staff director for the Committee on Environment and Public Works. While his service primarily focused on legislative priorities for Senator Durenberger, Chairman Stafford and Chairman Chafee, he worked tirelessly for all Republican members of the Committee. 
   When one examines the environmental laws enacted in the past 20 years, those of us on the committee know of Jimmie's leadership and accomplishments. This lengthy list includes the Leaking Underground Storage Tank program as part of the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984, Superfund, the 1987 Clean Water Act with groundwater protections and nonpoint source programs, the 1986 and the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act, the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments, particularly provisions on air toxics and alternative fuels, the 1991 Intermodal  Surface Transportation Efficiency Act and the 1998 Transportation Equity Act for the 21st century. 
   In every legislative challenge that came before the committee, Jimmie effectively worked to forge consensus, to find common ground, to develop solutions that represented the views of the members of the committee. While we may not have agreed on every issue, he is a person of great integrity. He effectively executed the views of the Senators he served. A Senator could ask for no more. He was tough, but fair. 
   All of us owe Jimmie Powell a debt of gratitude for the many years he has served the Senate and this country. We wish him every success and thank him for a job well done.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering legislation reported from the Committee on Environment and Public Works to make technical corrections to the Water Resources Development Act of 1999. 
   In July, 1999, the conference report on the Water Resources Development Act was enacted. The press of the conference business to reach final agreement prior to the August recess led to inaccurate cite references and omissions that need to be corrected. 
   This legislation and the accompanying amendment simply address technical modifications that have been brought to our attention by the Corps of Engineers. There are no new project authorizations, policy changes, or funding issues contained in this legislation. 
   As the Committee, by practice, has reauthorized the civil works mission of the Corps of Engineers every two years, the 1999 authorization bill is a produce initiated by the Committee in 1998. it is expected that, again next year, the Committee will examine the civil works mission of the Corps with all of the associated policy issues. 
   I respectfully request that my colleagues support this legislation and the  amendment so that WRDA 1999 can be fully implemented.

   What a man. What a life. Come with me. Let us look at how he lived and what he was made of. John Chafee said at times that the great shapers of his life were his parents, the Boy Scouts, his wrestling, the United States Marine Corps, the United States Senate and, above all, his own family.  
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today, as we gather together to witness LINCOLN CHAFEE take the oath of office to serve as the Senator from Rhode Island, I am reminded of my conversation last week with Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater. 
   We shared fond memories of our friend and spoke of his many contributions to transportation safety. Secretary Slater worked closely with Chairman Chafee on transportation issues that came before the Committee on Environment and Public Works. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD the remarks made last week by Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater on the passing of our colleagues, Senator John Chafee.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senate Armed Services Committee has taken cognizance of this very critical situation of our east coast fleet units being deployed, their state of readiness, and the degree of risk these units are facing as they deploy into the operations in Iraq, the operations in the Persian Gulf, and the unforeseen risks that seem to be ever present in that region of the world, the Mediterranean, the Persian Gulf, that arise so quickly and demand the instantaneous reaction, if so directed by the President, hopefully as a deterrence and then, if necessary, the actual combat. 
   We have seen this now for a decade. When we stop to think of the risks taken by these young men and women flying aircraft off these ships, and performing other military missions, the Senate owes them no less than the highest possible standard of training, the best possible equipment to reduce that risk. 
   Therefore, having chaired the hearings of the Committee of Armed Services of recent and, indeed, under the chairmanship of Senator INHOFE, a subcommittee of our full committee, and under the chairmanship of Senator SNOWE, a second subcommittee--two subcommittee hearings and a full committee hearing on that state of readiness and particularly as that state of readiness could be affected adversely by the absence of the ability of the United States to continue the use of the ranges on the islands of Vieques in Puerto Rico. That is the reason why I offer this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. 
   I shall read in general from this resolution and comment as I go:  
   In the Senate of the United States Mr. Warner submitted the following resolution; 
   Resolution 
   Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding the February 2000 deployment--  
   That is coming in just a matter of months--  
   of the U.S.S. Eisenhower Battle Group and the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit to an area of potential hostilities and the essential requirements that the battle group and expeditionary unit have received [that] training needed to certify the warfighting proficiency of the forces comprising the battle group and expeditionary unit. 
   Whereas the President, as Commander-in-Chief of all of the Armed Forces of the United States, makes the final decision--  
   Under our Constitution--  
   to order a deployment of those forces-- 
   And all our forces. That is his role under the Constitution. We respect that role.  
   Whereas the President, in making that decision--  
   With reference to the Eisenhower battle group--  
   relies upon the recommendations of the civilian and military leaders tasked by law-- 
   Laws passed by this body and predecessor Congresses--  
   with the responsibility of training those forces, including the Commander of the Second Fleet of the Navy and the Commander of the Marine Forces in the Atlantic; 
   Whereas the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility--  
   At Vieques--  
   has been since World War II, and continues to be, an essential-- 
   Underline ``essential''--  
   part of the training infrastructure that is necessary to ensure that maritime forces deploying from the east coast of the United States are prepared and ready to execute their assigned missions.  
   Not only execute their assigned missions, but to accept the risk of life and limb in executing those missions.  
   Whereas according to the testimony of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Chief of Naval Operations, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps, the Island of Vieques is a vital part of the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility and makes an essential contribution to the national security of the United States by providing integrated live-fire combined arms training opportunities to Navy and Marine Corps forces deploying from the east coast of the United States; 
   Whereas according to testimony before the Committee on Armed Services--  
   Just weeks ago--  
   and the report of the Special Panel on MilitaryOperations on Vieques-- 
   Again, issued a week or so ago--  
   a suitable alternative to Vieques cannot now be identified;   
   Much less identified and put into an operational status.  
   Whereas during the course of its hearings on September 22 and October 19, 1999, the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate acknowledged and expressed its sympathy for the tragic death and injuries that resulted from the training accident that occurred at Vieques in April 1999;  
   We did that with heartfelt expression during the course of our hearings just weeks ago.  
   Whereas the Navy--  
   In the judgment of the committee--  
   has failed [at times] to take those actions necessary to develop sound relations with the people of Puerto Rico;  
   Indeed, with the people most specifically on Vieques. The Navy has not done a good job, in this Senator's judgment, and collectively, I think, in the majority of the committee in carrying out its responsibility of important relationships with the people and assuring them, first, of the essential need and their contribution to our national security and how to operate this range in a manner that is safe. We acknowledge that.  
   Whereas the Navy should implement fully the terms of the 1983 Memorandum of Understanding between the Navy and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico regarding Vieques and work to increase its efforts to improve the economic conditions for and the safety of the people on Vieques; 
   Whereas in February 2000--  
   Just months away--  
   the U.S.S. Eisenhower Battle Group and the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit are scheduled to deploy to the Mediterranean Sea and the Persian Gulf where the battle group and expeditionary unit will face the possibility of combat, as experienced by predecessor-- 
   Units deploying in the past years--  
   during operations over Iraq and during other unexpected contingencies-- 
   That arise in that dangerous region of the world.  
   Whereas in a September 22, 1999 letter to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, the President--  
   The Commander in Chief--  
   stated that the rigorous, realistic training undergone by military forces ``is-- 
   I quote the President of the United States--  
   ``is essential for success in combat and for protecting our national security'';  
   The President realizes this. It is not a political document I am handling. This is the recitation of the statements by the President this year on this very subject, and he has put it down here very clearly. The purpose of this sense of the Senate is to give him the support necessary to make the tough decisions and resolve this problem.  
   Whereas in that letter the President also stated that he would not permit Navy or Marine Corps forces to deploy ``unless they are at a satisfactory level of combat readiness''; 
   Whereas Richard Danzig, the Secretary of the Navy, recently testified before the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate that ``only by providing this preparation can we fairly ask our service members to put their lives at risk.'' 
   Whereas according to the testimony of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Chief of Naval Operations, and the Commandant of the Marine Corps--  
   This testimony was just three days ago--  
   Vieques provides integrated live-fire training ``critical to our readiness'', and the failure to provide for adequate live-fire training for our naval forces before deployment will place those forces at-- 
   Listen carefully--  
   at unacceptably high risk during deployment. 
   Whereas Admiral Johnson, the Chief of Naval Operations, and General Jones, the Commandant of the Marine Corps--  
   On October 19, 1999--  
   testified before the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate that without the ability to train on Vieques, the U.S.S. Eisenhower Battle Group and the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit scheduled for deployment in February 2000 would not be ready for such deployment ``without greatly increasing the risk to those men and women who we ask to go in harm's way'';
   Whereas Vice Admiral Murphy, Commander of the Sixth Fleet of the Navy, recently testified before the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate that the loss of training on Vieques would ``cost American lives''; and 
   Whereas the Navy is currently prevented as a consequence of unrestrained civil disobedience--  
   I repeat:  
   Whereas the Navy is currently prevented as a consequence of unrestrained civil disobedience--  
   In defiance of law, in defiance of a court order--  
   Whereas the Navy is currently prevented as a consequence of unrestrained civil disobedience from using the training facilities on Vieques which are required to accomplish the training necessary to achieve a satisfactory level of combat readiness: Now, therefore, be it 
   Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the President should not--  
   I repeat: Not--  
   deploy the U.S.S. Eisenhower Battle Group or the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit until:

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I address the Senate today with regard to a bill that I am introducing which provides for the establishment of a commission to be known as the Presidential and Senatorial Commission on a Nuclear Testing Treaty. 
   On October 15, shortly after the historic debate in the Senate and the vote taken on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, I addressed the Senate, suggesting that the President and the Senate explore options by which a commission could be appointed for the purpose of assessing issues relating to testing of nuclear weapons, and the possibility of crafting a treaty that would meet the security interests of our Nation, while enabling America to once again resume the lead in arms control. 
   Following the historic debate and vote, I voted against that treaty, and I would vote again tomorrow against that treaty, and the day after, and the day after that. I say that not in any defiant way, but simply, after three hearings of the Armed Services Committee and one of the Foreign Relations Committee, after very careful analysis, after hours of discussion with my colleagues, after participating in the debate, it was clear to me that the record did not exist to gain my support nor, indeed, the support of two-thirds majority of the Senate. 
   It is my view that the Senate and the President will join together to provide bipartisan leadership to determine, in a collaborative way, how to dispel much of the confusion in the world about why this Senate failed to ratify the treaty, to explain what the options are now, and to show that we are analyzing all of the other possibilities relating to a nuclear testing treaty. This, hopefully, will dispel such confusion. Much of that confusion is based on misconceptions and wrong information. But we can overcome that. 
   We must explain that this Government has coequal branches--the executive, headed by the President; and the legislative, represented by the Congress--and how our Constitution entrusts to this body, the Senate, sole authority to give advice and consent. This body exercised that obligation, I think, in a fair and objective manner. But we are where we are. 
   My bill is somewhat unique, Mr. President. I call for a commission with a total of 12 members--6 to be appointed by the majority leader of the Senate; 6 to be appointed by the distinguished Democratic leader of the Senate, with coequal responsibility between two members to be designated as cochairmen. I did that purposely to emphasize the need for bipartisanship. We, the Senate, will not ratify the treaty unless there are 67 votes in the affirmative. This last vote was 19 votes short--votes cast by individuals of this body of clear conscience. That significant margin of 19 votes, in my judgment, can only be overcome through a bipartisan effort to devise a nuclear testing treaty seen clearly as in our national interests. 
   The cochairmen will be appointed--first, one by the distinguished majority leader of the Senate, and the second by the President, in consultation, of course, with the distinguished minority 
   leader. That brings the President well into the equation. He will undoubtedly be in consultation with the distinguished minority leader throughout the series of appointments by the minority leader. 
   This commission can have no more than two Members of the Senate appointed by the majority leader, and no more than two Members of the Senate, if he so desires, appointed by the minority leader. Therefore, up to four Senators could participate. But the balance of the 12--eight members--will be drawn from individuals who have spent perhaps as much as a lifetime examining the complexity of issues surrounding nuclear weapons, the complexity of the issues surrounding all types of treaties, agreements, and understandings relating to nonproliferation. 
   We saw them come forward in this debate--individuals such as former Secretaries of Defense, former Secretaries of State, men and women of honest, good intention, with honest differences of opinion, and those differences have to be bridged. By including eight individuals not in the Senate along with four Senators--if it is the will of the leaders--we can lift this issue out of the cauldron of politics. We can show the world that we are making a conscientious effort to act in a bipartisan manner. The experts the majority leader and the ones the minority leader, in consultation with the President, would pick will be known to the world--former Secretaries of Defense of this Nation, former Secretaries of State, former National Laboratory Directors, individuals whose collective experience in this would add up to hundreds of years. In that way, I believe we will bring credibility to this process and will result in this commission being able to render valuable advice and recommendations to the Senate and the President at the end of their work. 
   Several years ago, I was privileged to be the Ranking Member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. There was a great deal of concern in the Senate toward the Central Intelligence Agency and how it was operating at that time. As a matter of fact, some of our most distinguished Members--one indeed I remember clearly--called for the abolishment of the CIA. This individual was extremely disturbed with the manner in which they were conducting business. 
   I took it upon myself at that time to introduce in the Senate legislation calling for the establishment of a commission to make an overall study of our intelligence and to make recommendations to the President and the Congress. Congress adopted the legislation I introduced and it was enacted into law. 
   The first chairman of that commission was Les Aspin, former Secretary of Defense, who, unfortunately, had an untimely death. He was succeeded by Harold Brown, former Secretary of Defense and former Secretary of the Air Force, who I knew well. I served with him. Our former colleague, Senator Rudman, was also closely involved. I was privileged to be on that commission. It did its work. It came up with recommendations. The intelligence community accepted those recommendations. The CIA survived and today flourishes. 
   I have given the outline of the commission I am proposing today. Let me briefly refer to the basic charge given the commission and the work they should perform. 
   Duties of the commission: It shall be the duty of the 
   commission, (1) to determine under what circumstances the nuclear testing treaty would be in the national security interests of our Nation; (2) to determine how a nuclear testing treaty would relate to the security interests of other nations. I was motivated to do this because of the misunderstanding about the important and decisive action taken by this body.

   Mr. WARNER. Madam President, 30 years ago this fall, I met JOHN CHAFEE. President Nixon had just been elected and he had appointed Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird. I aspired to be the Secretary of the Navy. Laird called me to his office and he said, ``I want you to meet a very special person.'' Now, mind you, I had been closely associated with then-Vice President Nixon and worked on his campaign. Senator CHAFEE had been very closely associated to Governor Nelson Rockefeller. There was a little bit of a difference between Vice President Nixon and Nelson Rockefeller. I felt that I should be the Secretary of the Navy because CHAFEE  hadn't been quite the supporter that I had been for these many years. But Laird said to me, ``I am going to introduce you to a man that you will respect, work for, and end up loving.'' I will never forget that. And so late in November, the two of us were informed, and he became Secretary of the Navy and I became his Under Secretary. 
   We served under Melvin Laird for 3 years of the most difficult period of the war in Vietnam. Unlike myself, with very modest military service in the closing days of World War II and again in Korea, JOHN CHAFEE had been a rifleman at Guadalcanal. Those of us who had been privileged to wear marine green in the generation of the World War II era we knew full well that those who had served on the canal had seen the roughest of the fighting. It was referred to as the ``old breed.'' Those who came in later years were never quite the same as the old breed. 
   In the many years that I had been with JOHN CHAFEE, very closely associated, I never was able to get out of him all the facts--to this day--about his service in Guadalcanal. One day just a few weeks ago, we were walking down the hall. I can't remember exactly the occasion, but we saw a Marine general who had medals from up on the shoulder all the way down to his waist. I said: JOHN, that is different than the old days, where occasionally a decoration was given in the Corps. It must be different today. He said, ``Yes.'' 
   I said to him: Did you ever get a decoration besides the Purple Heart? He said: No; didn't deserve it; didn't get it. Mind you, he served on Okinawa, on Guadalcanal, survived, got malaria, went to Australia, recovered, was picked to go to officer candidate school, and served in officer candidate school. He became a platoon leader on Okinawa. He survived the kamikaze attacks going in, and the fighting in that battle was as rough as any of them. The Japanese knew they had their backs against the wall. It was very tenacious, very rough and tenacious. 
   He told me a few facts about those years. But then just a few years after World War II, surprisingly--4 or 5 years--suddenly we were in another war. We were in Korea. JOHN called up for active duty. I am sure he could have found a way not to have gone because he had served so much in World War II. But he went. When he reported for duty and went to Korea, he became a company commander. In the Marine Corps and in the Army, and the other services, that unquestionably is the toughest of all jobs, with 230-plus men depending on you, with a reinforced company, an infantry company, whatever it may be. But JOHN was there. 
   I remember not long ago the author of this book, ``The Coldest War,'' came through and visited with JOHN and me. I had been in Korea, but I had been in an air wing as a communications officer. He used to joke with me about how I slept in the tent with a little bit of a stove, which was true, and he slept in a bunker out in the open. He always used to tease me. But in this book, they captured JOHN CHAFEE. The author discussed his bravery as a company commander and his love for his men--any man who served under JOHN CHAFEE--whether it was in the Marine Corps or, indeed, in this institution. 
   How privileged I was to sit just in front of my distinguished big brother in this Senate. Any man who served with JOHN CHAFEE inherited a great deal. I say that modestly. But we all profited so much from our personal association with this marvelous man. 
   I called former Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird and talked to him by phone. He sent me a short memo.

   Mr. WARNER. Madam President, Mel Laird was a great public servant, and he still is. He said about JOHN CHAFEE:  
   Our close and lasting friendship goes back for more than 45 years and will always be remembered. All of John's friends will remember his quick smile, his lack of pretense, his loyalty, his warm compassion, his good commonsense judgment, and his special quality as a person. 
   John Chafee knew who he was. He never had to boast, he never had to brag, he never stopped to take credit, because this man knew who he was. He had tremendous inner self-confidence and a tremendous ability to be self-effacing.  
   Laird goes on:  
   John, in every way, showed he cared about all of us, his Rhode Island constituents, and our country in a most wonderful way. But his real love was his family. Ginny--  
   I talked to Ginny this morning at the crack of dawn. We exchanged a few words. Then we immediately recalled the happy days together throughout these 30 years--and laughter, for both of us, for a few minutes on the phone. She had the courage, like JOHN, to muster laughter in a moment such as this. 
   He loved his children--Zechariah, ``Zach,'' Quentin, Lincoln, John Jr., and Georgia, and was a special granddad to his many grandchildren. They will miss him very much. 
   Yes, JOHN was a hero in every sense of the word. But he was the greatest hero to his family. 
   Laird goes on:  
   There were many unusual associations we had over these 45 years--going back to Republican National Conventions, his service as Governor, his service as Secretary of the Navy, and his years in the U.S. Senate. His last interview in office occurred just last Friday with Dale Van Atta, who is working on a book on the Laird-Packard Pentagon Team.  
   That was the team JOHN and I joined 30 years ago. 
   For 2 hours I worked with JOHN last Friday setting up a hearing on the Environment and Public Works Committee, where I was privileged to be his deputy, second always in command. I will never be first. Even though he is not here, I will still get his orders. But we were there working last Friday. 
   Yes, he was a little less spry in his step as he was recovering from his operation. But we have to remember  every day in this great institution that, yes, we have our debates, we have our differences, but the man or the woman to your left or right in this magnificent institution could be gone the next day by the will of God. I always think of that. We have to treasure and value every moment we have with each other in this great institution because it brings us together. 
   This paragraph in Laird's letter I am amused by:  
   I remember calling JOHN in December of 1968 and asking him to be Secretary of the Navy on the Laird-Packwood Team in the Pentagon. There were many candidates suggested for this position--President Nixon had a candidate, as did Senator Dirksen, Senator Hugh Scott, Senator George Murphy, and many others. Under the arrangement I had with President Nixon, it was my choice, and I never regretted that choice--John Chafee was terrific.  
   There are so many. I think in the days to come I will seek the privilege of speaking again of JOHN CHAFEE solely for the purpose of introducing into the RECORD some marvelous statements. I worked with his personal staff today in collecting some of his statements and with the staff of the Environment and Public Works Committee. There are so many lives this great American touched. 
   He loved his work in the Pentagon for those 3 years because it brought into focus everything he had learned as a young marine on Guadalcanal, as the platoon commander on Okinawa, and as a company commander in Korea. 
   I remember one day so well. Laird called us up. Laird was 
   short, got on that phone, and issued an order quickly. It was Saturday. Of course, we worked Saturdays. The war was on. Absolutely, we wanted to be there. It was our choice. It was a heavy burden and responsibility. We were losing tens of thousands of casualties every week. 
   We just finished this engagement in Kosovo casualty-free. In Vietnam, thousands of men and women were killed and wounded week after week. It is so hard to believe now. It is so hard to explain war to the current generation. 
   But anyway, Laird called up, and he said: You two guys go down to The Mall and give me a report on what is going on. 
   There was a demonstration down there. CHAFEE and I were dressed in our blue suits as worn by the Navy today. We stripped them down and put on some old khakis. We had some tennis shoes. He and I used to play a little squash in the Pentagon. We put on a couple of old T-shirts. We got into an old car. We had chauffeur-driven cars in those days. Forget them. We got in an old car and drove down to The Mall. I will never forget that sight. There were over 1 million young men and women, in a peaceful way largely, demonstrating against that war in the heart of the Nation's Capital on The Mall between this building and the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. There they were--1 million. 
   I could see JOHN was so terribly upset because it brought back the carnage he had seen in his previous military experience when the whole nation, every American, was solidly behind every person in uniform (abroad or at home). The Nation stood in solid support. 
   We went back to the Pentagon that afternoon, and we sat in Laird's office. 
   As I reminisced this morning, Laird had only been in office a comparatively short time and there was a lot of thought about how we were going to get America disengaged from that conflict, how we were going to stop the casualties. JOHN CHAFEE from that moment on became a very special counselor to the Secretary of Defense and, indeed, to the President on the need to bring that conflict somehow to a termination with regard to these losses. Over 50,000 young men and women were killed in uniform in that conflict in Vietnam. 
   Tough? Yes, he was a tough man. He was tough as they come. They used to say at Yale he was a wrestler; you will not get JOHN CHAFEE's shoulders to the mat; you will not get them to the mat. No one ever got them to the mat. I never did. I tried. I don't think in his distinguished career anybody in this great body ever did. 
   The interesting thing about that man, so full of courage and so full of toughness, I never heard him use a word of profanity, never a curse word. When JOHN would get upset and he was concerned about something, he would say: ``Oh, dear.'' Remember that, colleagues? How many of you heard him say, ``Oh, dear''? That was his way of saying, hey, we have a problem, but we are going to solve it. A remarkable man. 
   We will remember him for his modesty. I searched his web page: 40 years of public service condensed to one page. A modest man, never boasted. He had the self-confidence. I was asked, Who will take his place? Without thinking I simply said: No one. No one will take his place. 
   God bless you, JOHN, and your family.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join in supporting this legislation and, also, as a cosponsor of the amendment offered by Chairman THOMPSON and Senator VOINOVICH. 
   This important legislation will provide high school students from the District of Columbia significant financial relief to assist them in attending a public or private university in Virginia or Maryland. 
   I am grateful to Chairman THOMPSON, Ranking Member LIEBERMAN and particularly Subcommittee Chairman VOINOVICH for taking on this effort and moving swiftly to bring this bill before the full Senate. 
   I have had a particular interest in expanding the educational opportunities available to District students by ensuring that they are eligible to receive the reduced tuition rate or grants to attend any of the exceptional Historically Black Colleges and Universities in Virginia or Maryland. Many students from the District of Columbia currently attend an Historically Black College or University in Virginia or Maryland and there is a great tradition among these schools and District students. 
   In Virginia, we are privileged to have five exceptional Historically Black Colleges and Universities--Hampton University, Virginia State University, Virginia Union University, Norfolk State University and St. Paul's College. I am pleased that the amendment offered today with this legislation incorporates a provision I requested to make each of these institutions eligible under this legislation. With the passage of this amendment to the bill, students from the District of Columbia will now be able to receive either in-state tuition rates or grants to attend any public institution or Historically Black College or University in Virginia. 
   Mr. President, I applaud the efforts of my colleagues, Senator VOINOVICH and Chairman THOMPSON, and appreciate their attention to the matters involving Historically Black Colleges.

   Mr. WARNER. Madam President, it is unfortunate that the procedural structure that has been erected stands in the way of moving forward on significant and thoughtful reform to our campaign finance laws. I would like to have the opportunity to debate and vote on some of those reforms, particularly the measure offered by Senator HAGEL, but we are precluded from doing so. Today, I want to speak about campaign finance reform legislation I introduced earlier this year and about an amendment I am prepared to offer. 
   This past May I introduced the Constitution and Effective Reform of Campaigns Act of CERCA, which I first introduced during the 105th Congress. This legislation is the product of 2 years of hearings during my chairmanship of the Rules Committee, discussions with numerous experts, party officials, and candidates, and nearly two decades of participating in campaigns and campaign finances debates in the Senate. 
   I view my legislation as an opportunity for bipartisan support. It is a good faith effort to strike middle ground between those who believe public financing of campaigns is the solution, and those who believe the solution is to remove current regulations. If offers a package of proposals which realistically can be achieved with bipartisan support and meet the desire of the majority of Americans who believe that our present system can be reformed. In my judgment, we will not succeed with any measure of campaign reform in this complicated field without a bipartisan consensus. 
   In drafting this legislation, I began with four premises. First, all provisions had to be consistent with the first amendment: Congress would be acting in bad faith to adopt provisions which have a likelihood of being struck down by the Federal courts. 
   Second, I oppose public financing and mandating ``free'' or reduced-cost media time which in my mind is neither free nor a good policy idea. Why should seekers of Federal office get free time, while candidates for State office or local office--from governors to local sheriffs--do not receive comparable free benefits? Such an inquity and imbalance will breed friction between Federal and State office seekers. 
   Third, I believe we should try to increase the role of citizens and the political parties. 
   Fourth, any framwork of campaign reform legislation must respect and protect the constitutional right of individuals, groups, and organization to participate in advocacy concerning political issues. 
   The McCain-Feingold bill has been debated thoroughly in the Senate, and any objective observer of the Senate would agree that we are genuinely deadlocked. This body needs to move beyond the debate of McCain-Fiengold. I hope that all Members will review my bill as an objective and pragmatic approach to current problems with our campaign system. I commend other Members for coming forward, as I have,  with proposals which objectively represent pragmatic approaches to what can be achieved. 
   Several of the issues addressed in my legislation have been raised by other Members in the context of this debate. Amendments have been proposed on foreign soft money, increasing the hard dollar contribution limits, and disclosure of last-minute expenditures, among others. 
   My focus today is how can we expand participation in the political process--both by voters and by potential candidates. I hope that any reform carries with it the opportunity for more small contributors to participate in the political process. And, I hope that reform will bring more candidates into the arena. 
   To this end, I want to focus on two reforms contained in my original legislation. First, we need to ensure that the average voter can, and will, contribute to the candidate of their choice. The influence of voters on campaigns has been diminished by the activities of political action committees and interest groups. Therefore, I propose a $100 tax credit for contributions made by citizens, with incomes under specified levels, to Senate and House candidates in their states. This credit should spark an influx of small dollar contributions to balance the greater ability of citizens with higher incomes to participate. In addition, the increased individual contribution limit, as proposed by others, should balance the activities of political action committees. 
   Second, we need to remove barriers to challengers. Compared to incumbents, challengers face greater difficulties raising funds and communicating with voters, particularly at the outset of a campaign. My solution is to allow candidates to receive ``seed money'' contributions of up to $10,000 from individuals and political action committees. 
   This provision should help get candidacies off the ground. The total amount of these ``seed money'' contributions could not exceed $100,000 for House candidates or $300,000 for Senate candidates. To meet the constitutional test, this provision would apply to both challengers and incumbents alike, but in the case of an incumbent with money carried over from a prior cycle, those funds would count against the seed money limit. In addition, Senate incumbents would be barred from using the franking privilege to send out mass mailings during the election year, rather than the 60-day ban in current law. 
   But elective office should not be for sale. Campaigns should be competitive. Candidates with personal wealth have a distinct advantage through their constitutional right to spend their own funds. Therefore, if a candidate spends more than $25,000 of his or her own money, the individual contribution limits would be raised to $10,000 so that candidates could raise money to counter that personal spending. Again, to meet constitutional review, this provision would apply to all candidates. 
   Mr. President, if we can do these two things--enhance citizen involvement, and level the playing field for condidates--we will have made significant progress. Again, I hope the Senate will have the opportunity to address these issues. I was prepared to offer my amendment and I hope I will have the opportunity to do so. 
   These are the problems which I believe can be solved in a bipartisan fashion. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact meaningful campaign reform, by looking at creative solutions to address the real problems with our present campaign system.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on Wednesday evening, the Senate cast a historic vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   In the aftermath of this vote, I am reminded of the old saying, ``The past is prologue.'' 
   At some point we have to lift this issue from the cauldron of politics. 
   Now, is it not time to build bridges and find common ground on the issue of a possible treaty covering nuclear testing? Let the issues be worked on, for a while, by people of the caliber, of the experience, of those who wrote to the Senate, who testified, and called or sent statements during the Senate's debate. Their wisdom can then be returned to our next President and the 107th Congress. 
   That is why, today, I propose the creation of a bipartisan, blue ribbon commission of experts, representing differing viewpoints on the basic issues, to study this issue and make recommendations--including possible changes to the treaty. Colleagues, I ask for your ``advice and consent'' as I pursue this goal of a commission. 
   During the course of the debate in the Senate, it was clear that a number of Members could have supported some  type of a test ban treaty, but were troubled by several key provisions in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty that was before us. 
   Of a particular concern was the zero-yield threshold. Legitimate concerns were raised about our ability to monitor violations down to the zero-yield level, and with our need to conduct, at some point in the future, very low yield nuclear explosions to verify the safety of our stockpile, or to ensure the validity of the stockpile stewardship program. Perhaps it would have been better to agree to a Treaty which allowed very low yield testing--as all past presidents, beginning with President Eisenhower, have proposed. 
   Another grave concern was the fact that this Treaty bans nuclear testing in perpetuity. When we are dealing with the safety and credibility of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, we should exercise the greatest degree of caution. Would it not have been better to have a treaty which required, specifically in its text, periodic reviews, at fixed intervals, as did the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, NPT. At the time the Senate considered that Treaty, the NPT provided for automatic reviews every 5 years. 
   The Stockpile Stewardship Program was another issue of concern. In my view, it is just not far enough along, as confirmed by qualified experts, for the United States to stake the future of its nuclear arsenal on this alternative to actual testing. More needs to be done on that issue. For example, there is currently underway a panel, pursuant to a provision in the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, to study and report on the reliability, safety and security of the U.S. nuclear stockpile. Perhaps some of the fine work of this commission, which is comprised of experts such as former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger and Dr. Johnny Foster, could be incorporated into the work of a test ban commission. 
   These are but examples of a number of issues related to this Treaty where there are honest differences of opinion, and over which bridges must be built to reach common ground. These issues could benefit from examination now by a group outside of the political arena--a group of experts. 
   Recent history is replete with examples of commissions, composed of a bipartisan group of experts, who have successfully advised the Congress, the President. 
   For example, in 1994, when I was Vice Chairman of the Intelligence Committee and the CIA was under attack, I included legislation in the FY 1995 Intelligence Authorization Act establishing a commission to study the roles and capabilities of the Intelligence Community. The commission was formed by the President and the congressional leadership. It was chaired by former secretaries of defense Les Aspin and Harold Brown and former Senator Warren Rudman. They met the challenge; their advice was accepted. 
   Let's join together; get it done.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I want to congratulate my dear friend, Chairman STEVENS, and the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, Senator BYRD, for bringing to the floor a conference report that I know was reached through very difficult negotiations. 
   There is no doubt that the conference on the Fiscal Year 2000 Defense Appropriations Bill was the most contentious in recent history. As the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, I am aware of the difficult decisions that had to be made to reach a consensus with the House, and I will vote in favor of the conference report. 
   Despite my over all support of this conference report, I must point out one provision in the bill that is fraught with danger. That provision is section 8160 which states: ``Not withstanding any other provision of law, all military construction projects for which funds were appropriated in Public Law 106-52 are hereby authorized.'' As all my colleagues are aware the Armed Services Committee has original jurisdiction for military construction and authorizes for appropriations each military construction project. In fact, the law requires that each military construction and military family housing construction project be both authorized and appropriated. The projects authorized in this conference report were not authorized in either the Senate or House Authorization Bills. The act of authorizing military construction projects in this conference report has a profound impact on the legislative process. 
   Senator STEVENS and I work closely in developing our respective bills. We have directed our staffs to share information and resolve differences in the bills before the Senate considers them. In fact, Chairman STEVENS commented in his floor statement on the Fiscal Year 2000 Defense Appropriations Bill that his bill mirrors closely the actions of the Armed Services Committee. This conference report is not consistent with that cooperation. It usurps the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee and may set a terrible precedent. 
   While the rules of the Senate do not allow us to correct this in this bill, I trust that Chairman STEVENS will acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Armed Services Committee over these matters and provide us his assurance that this conference report does not set a precedent and that military construction and military family housing projects will not be authorized in future appropriations bills.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman. I thank the distinguished ranking member. 
   This has been, under the limitations, an excellent debate for the Senate. This is my 21st year in the Senate, and I can think of few debates in that time that have been as informed as this one. I strongly disagree with a very dear friend, Brent Scowcroft, who described this debate otherwise. While not a Member of the Senate, he is one whom I respect. His remarks were reported widely in the newspapers this morning. 
   This has been a good debate. Senators on both sides have stood up and displayed courage. Our two leaders, Senator LOTT and Senator DASCHLE, have displayed the courage of their convictions. In the many consultations over the past week that I have had with the distinguished chairman and ranking member, and our leadership, I have always left with the belief that they placed the security interests of this country foremost, as each day decisions had to be made regarding this treaty. 
   I also say to my dear friend, Senator MOYNIHAN, I thank him for the leadership he has shown. We embarked together on a bipartisan effort, and we were joined by a very significant number of our colleagues--whose names will be a part of the RECORD at a later time--in an effort simply to recognize that in the course of the hearings and in the course of conversations and consultations with so many people not only here in the United States but across the seas, that there were clearly honest differences of opinion from individuals who have spent much of their lifetime on this subject--honest differences of opinion. 
   But lacking is that burden of proof, some would say beyond a reasonable doubt, that this treaty would not put at risk the security of this country by virtue of the terms of the treaty as presently written. 
   This treaty requires that we put at risk in perpetuity--not just today, not just tomorrow, but in perpetuity--a stockpile which today is safe and credible, which tomorrow will be safe and credible--for the foreseeable next few years to come. Let there be no doubt in anyone's mind of that fact. But can we say that that will be the case forever? 
   As our military examined this treaty, it is clear that they said we support the treaty, but only if the safeguard is in place which says we can get out of the treaty if the President makes that determination, and only if the Stockpile Stewardship Program--the computer simulations which are to replace actual testing--can be put in place and proven to ensure that our nuclear stockpile remains credible and safe. 
   The Record before the Senate today does not justify that support. It does not say that each of the components of the Stockpile Stewardship Program will be in place and will work in a way that will put our stockpile, in the future, in the same category that it is in today. We do not know. There is a reasonable doubt. We simply do not know. For that reason, regrettably, I shall have to vote--that vote occurs shortly--against this treaty. 
   But I say that honest individuals have done their very best in this Senate, and I thank all those beyond the Senate who have made very valuable contributions to this debate. 
   I shall put in the RECORD, by unanimous consent, further documentation on the laboratory directors. Of all the testimony that came before the Armed Services Committee, the testimony of the lab directors was the most compelling. And indeed, that of the intelligence community, which, in a sense, asked for more time to do the work they thought necessary in assessing our ability to monitor this treaty. And many former Secretaries of Defense had an 
   honest difference of opinion. 
   As Senator KYL, who has worked so hard on this treaty and probably knows it better than anyone else, has said clearly--Secretary Kissinger, one of several Secretaries of State who have expressed their opinions--has now indicated his opposition. These are men and women who have spent their lifetime on this subject. Reasonable doubt is to be found there. 
   Lastly, the laboratory Directors: I would like to respond to some of my colleagues and the media's mis-portrayal of the testimony given at last Thursday's hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee by the Directors of the three National Labs--Dr. Paul Robinson of Sandia National Laboratory, Dr. C. Bruce Tarter of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, and Dr. John C. Browne of Los Alamos National Laboratory. It is important to have a full picture of what was said at our hearing last week Many of these statements used by my colleagues and the media were taken out of context. For instance, the line of questioning that the Ranking Member engaged in with the Lab Directors on whether they were ``on board'' with the treaty, I believe has been mis-characterized. I'd like to read from the transcript the exchange that occurred between the Ranking Member and the Lab Directors.  
   Senator LEVIN. What you are telling us is that if this safeguard and the other safeguards are part of this process that you can rely on, that in your words, Dr. Robinson, you are on board in terms of this treaty; is that correct? 
   Dr. ROBINSON. I am on board that science-based stockpile stewardship has a much higher chance of success and I will accept it as the substitute. 
   Senator LEVIN. For what? 
   Dr. Robinson. I still had other reservations about the treaty----  
   At this point, Dr. Robinson was cut off and was unable to finish his answer. In response to this line of questioning, a Senator from the minority side, said that he ``detected an uneasiness on the part of some of those who testified'' and expressed concern that Dr. Robinson's response that he had other concerns with the treaty was ``blurred''. 
   Senator LEVIN then asked Dr. Tarter, Director of Lawrence Livermore Labs, to respond to the same question, Dr. Tarter responded:  
   A simple statement again: It is an excellent bet, but it is not a sure thing. 
   Senator LEVIN. My question is, are you on board, given these safeguards? 
   Dr. TARTER. I can only testify to the ability of stockpile stewardship to do the job. It is your job about the treaty. 
   Senator LEVIN. Are you able to say that, providing you can rely on safeguard F and at some point decide that you cannot certify it, that you are willing under that condition to rely on this stewardship program as a substitute for actual testing? 
   Dr. TARTER. Yes.  
   Dr. Tarter never said that he was ``on board with the treaty.'' In fact, he attempted to avoid directly answering Senator LEVIN's question. Clearly, Dr. Tarter was uncomfortable with this line of questioning. It was only after Senator LEVIN significantly modified the question by adding certain qualifications that Dr. Tarter finally responded affirmatively. 
   Senator LEVIN asked Dr. Browne whether he was on board with the treaty and Dr. Browne responded:  
   Senator Levin, if the government provides us with the sustained resources, the answer is yes, and if safeguard F is there, yes.  
   Dr. Browne said that he was ``on board with the treaty'' but only if certain conditions were met. 
   In examining the complete record and considering the manner in which the responses were elicited, it is clear that the labs directors had reservations about the treaty. They were clearly uneasy with the question and the manner in which they were questioned. They were certainly not enthusiastic in indicating any support for the treaty--even with the qualifications (i.e., safeguards) that were added.  
   In addition to the previous line of questioning the transcript includes numerous statements by the Lab Directors which I believe, taken together, indicate that these experts have serious issues with this treaty as well as the Stockpile Stewardship program. I note that the endorsement in January 1998 of the CTBT by Generals Colin Powell, John Shalikashvili, David Jones, and Admiral William Crowe, former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was conditioned, like that of the Lab Directors, on the six safeguards submitted by the President along with the treaty to the Senate for advice and consent which included a Stockpile Stewardship program to ensure a high level of confidence in the safety and reliability of nuclear weapons in the stockpile. 
   Here are some of the statements by the Lab Directors on the Stockpile Stewardship program: 
   Dr. Browne, Director of Los Alamos stated:  
   Each year, through a comprehensive program of surveillance of the stockpile, we find one or more problems in each weapons system that may require attention. ......we have identified several issues that, if they had occurred when testing was active, most likely would have been resolved by nuclear testing.'' He went on to state: ``The issue that we face is whether we will have the people, the capabilities, and the national commitment to maintain.......confidence in the stockpile in the future, when we expect to see more significant changes. Although we are adding new tools each year, the essential tool kit for stockpile stewardship will not be complete until some time in the next decade.  
   Dr. Tarter, Director of the Lawrence Livermore stated:  
   I think we have a challenging program [stockpile stewardship], one that is very difficult to achieve. I think, although both the administration and the Congress have had increasing levels of support for the stewardship program over these past years, they have not quite met what we said was necessary to achieve the program on the time scale that we believed was necessary in view of the aging of the designers and of the weapons. I think we all feel under a great deal of stress to try to make those deadlines with the current resources. ..... So I think to date I would give the program a--I think we have done a good job. I think we have learned things. It is not a perfect job, but I think it has been a very, very good start. I think the challenge lies in the longer term, and I think ..... if I had one simple phrase I think that the stewardship program with sustained support is an excellent bet, but it ain't a sure thing.  
   Dr. Robinson, Director of Sandia, stated:  
   I question the expectations many claim for this treaty. ..... I think we have got to specify with a lot more character what is the real purpose of the treaty. I secondly discuss [in his written statement] a lot of the important technical considerations as we have tried to substitute other approaches, which has come to be known as the science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program, for the value that tests had always provided us in previous decades. I can state with no caveats that to confirm the performance of high tech devices--cars, airplanes, medical diagnostics, computers, or nuclear weapons--testing is the preferred methodology. ..... My statement describes the work involved in attempting to substitute science-based stockpile stewardship. It is an enormous challenge, but I agree, much very good work has been done. Much has been accomplished. But we still cannot guarantee that we will ultimately be successful. Science-based stockpile stewardship is the best way we know of to mitigate the risk to the extent that is possible. 
   ..... But the question and where we (those who support or oppose testing and the treaty) differ the greatest is what is the best way to achieve that peace with stability. At least two very dichotomous approaches. Is the world better off with nuclear weapons in the hands of those who value peace the highest, who will maintain their nuclear arsenals in order to deter aggression and to prevent major wars, or would the world be better off it there were no more nuclear weapons, and is there really a sound plan for how you might ever achieve that?

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and say farewell to an outstanding Naval Officer, Rear Admiral Norbert R. Ryan Jr., as he completes more than three years of distinguished service as the Navy's Chief of Legislative Affairs. It is a privilege for me to honor his many outstanding achievements and commend him for his devotion to the Navy and our great Nation. 
   A native of Mountainhome, Pennsylvania, Rear Admiral Ryan is a 1967 graduate of the United States Naval Academy. An outstanding aviator and officer, Rear Admiral Ryan was assigned as Chief of Legislative Affairs from August 1996 to October 1999. Through tireless effort, a keen sense of timing and decisive action, Admiral Ryan navigated Navy leadership through aggressive and demanding Congressional action on a wide variety of Navy programs during three complete legislative cycles. He ensured support for a difficult series of high profile and at times challenging issues to include the F/A-18 E/F, CVN-77/CVNX, DD-21 Acquisition Strategy, Tactical Tomahawk, Virginia Class Submarines, Shipyard maintenance, and the Navy's role in Kosovo. 
   Admiral Ryan initiated a ground-breaking series of Congressional Constituent Caseworker Workshops by geographical area to ensure congressional staff at the district level were provided the necessary tools and information on Navy and Marine Corps programs to be responsive to their constituents. He forged strong bonds with many key Members and their staffs ensuring the best interests of the Navy were fully understood and supported. 
   Admiral Ryan provided outstanding advice, recommendations, and strategies to the Secretary of the Navy and Chief of Naval Operations that have significantly and positively affected the future size, readiness, and capabilities of the Navy. As a result, Congress passed the FY00 Defense Authorization Bill that has been lauded by many Members as the best defense bill ever written. 
   Rear Admiral Ryan is a dynamic and resourceful naval officer who, throughout his time in Navy Liaison, has proven to be an indispensable asset to our Nation. He is a passionate advocate of the Navy, our Sailors and their families understanding better than anyone that they are truly the backbone of our national defense. His superior contributions and distinguished service will benefit both the Navy and the country he so proudly serves for years to come. As Rear Admiral Ryan leaves, we will certainly miss him. I am proud to thank him for his service as the Chief of Legislative Affairs and look forward with pride and deepest respect as we continue to work with him in his new assignment as Chief of Naval Personnel. There is no better officer aptly suited to lead the officers and Sailors into the 21st century.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on the time allocated to those in opposition, I want to ask my good friend a question. 
   First, we joined this institution at about the same time a number of years  ago. I very much respect the Senator. So much of the Senator's career has been devoted to international relations, and he reflects very warmly one of the great teachers he had, and that was Senator Tower, former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 
   But I want to go back to a particular reference that the Senator made in his opening remarks to the support by the uniformed officers of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs and others for this treaty. It is true that there is a division of opinion between the Joint Chiefs. I don't speak in terms of those in opposition today, but I mean those who precede. 
   We have letters on both sides pointing out how men and women of good conscience--men and women who have had extensive experience in these fields--are different on this treaty. But the question I put to my good friend relates to the President's letter of transmittal of this treaty on September 22, 1997. I am reading from that document which accompanied the treaty to the Senate. There is a provision in there called ``the safeguards.'' 
   I recite a sentence of that.  
   The understanding that if the President of the United States is informed by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy (DOE)--advised by the Nuclear Weapons Council, the Directors of DOE's nuclear weapons laboratories, and the Commander of the U.S. Strategic Command--that a high level of confidence in the safety or reliability of a nuclear weapon type that the two Secretaries consider to be critical to our nuclear deterrent could no longer be certified, the President, in consultation with the Congress, would be prepared to withdraw from the CTBT under the standard ``supreme national interests'' clause in order to conduct whatever testing might be required.  
   Speaking for myself--and I have in the course of the last several days as Chairman of the Armed Services Committee dealt extensively with this entire issue before the Senate today--I have time and time again referred to the fact that it is my conclusion, drawn from talking with a number of these senior military officers who have given their support, and who in years past have given their support, that it is this clause that is the foundation for their opinion of support. 
   But I say to my good friend that were we to ratify this treaty, and if it would go into force, then many nations could rely on the act of the United States--as a matter of fact, one of the principal reasons for this treaty is to induce other nations to follow--and then 8, 10, or 15 years down the road we exercise the right under this, what happens to those nations? They are left out there stripped of protection that they could, with their own systems, have developed. And, worse yet, if we were ever compelled to announce to the world that we have concern about the credibility and safety of our nuclear arsenal, that would send a frightening message across the land that what we have had in place these 50 years, referred to as the ``nuclear umbrella,'' which umbrella preserved the peace from major conflict in Europe for 50 years, is now in doubt. 
   Mr. President, as you talk about who is supporting the treaty, let's go back and examine the reasons. 
   I say that the military relied very heavily on that clause. In my judgment, if that clause were ever utilized, this country would be in a far worse position than if the Senate were to exercise its right and withhold the advice and consent on ratification. 
   I ask my good friend, if that clause were invoked, what would be the reality among the world's community of nations? What would be the reality of the signal going out that our credible deterrent is in question?

<DOCNO>106-warner-va-5-19991008</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I simply focus your attention on one or more nations, should this treaty be ratified, saying there is no necessity for us to launch our own program because there stands the United States, the leader. And nowhere in the history of the United States have we ever exercised such a clause as this, I say to my good friend. I don't think there is a precedent in our 200-year history of ever pulling out. But, nevertheless, we could be faced with those facts. Otherwise, there would have been no reason to have put that clause in there. 
   It was a real situation to the President at that time in transmitting the treaty to the Senate that these conditions could arise, and he put that clause in. I daresay it was put in there such as the military uniformed community could lend their support. 
   But what happens to that nation that did not start this program and 10 or 12 years hence is left out there? Take, for example, Japan. It has the capacity to generate a program in a matter of a few years. They have relied in many respects on our nuclear deterrent. But if that is ever put in doubt, that nation and others would want to start this program. But it would take a decade for them--perhaps not Japan but most nations--to put into place any credible nuclear deterrent. 
   I say to my good friend--I know other Senators want to speak; it is important, and we are going to have a good debate today--in my opinion, you jeopardize substantially the world community if at any time you say we might pull out pursuant to that clause.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have had some discussions with the distinguished senior Senator from New York, as have others, on the question of the timing of the Senate's final deliberation of the treaty. Indeed, I think our leadership and all of us are looking at this in a very serious way. But it seems to me--and this is my judgment--that an element of such consideration has to be a recognition that under our Constitution, next year elections are held across this Nation for the Office of the Presidency, one-third of the Senate, and the entire House. To inject a treaty which, in the minds of many--not this Senator, but I respect the views of others--is so vital to our security interests into that atmosphere and the dynamics of an election year, in my judgment, would not give a fair and objective opportunity for this treaty to be considered solely on its merits. I use the phrase ``solely on its merits.'' Does my colleague agree with me?

   Mr. WARNER. Earlier, my distinguished colleague referred to General Powell. I have had the opportunity to be counseling with General Powell, soliciting his views, and he has been soliciting mine for some several days. He just telephoned me because he is watching this debate. He authorized me to say the following, that in view of the mounting conflicting testimony--primarily before the Senate Armed Services Committee in the course of the three hearings which my colleague is now addressing and I shall address at some point here--in view of the mounting conflict of testimony, particularly as it relates 
   to the credibility of this deterrent and, indeed, safety issues--we need only look at the testimony by the lab Directors yesterday--he has authorized me to say at this time he joins those who recommended the delay of final consideration of the treaty at this point in time. 
   That should be clearly understood. He feels it should not be killed because he thinks, hopefully, if it is modified in certain ways, that it can be another brick in our walkway leading towards nonproliferation and stronger arms control regimes. However, at this time, he wishes to be on record as saying the Senate should not act and should not act because of the mounting conflicting testimony on the key essential elements that he and other uniformed officers--I addressed this earlier in the safeguards provision and likewise, which says at some point in time a President could withdraw from this treaty because of information brought to his attention. 
   So that is an important part of the treaty. It is under the ``supreme'' clause, which is in all of our treaties, but it is amplified. So I just wanted to correct the record.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield on our time. The distinguished ranking member of the Armed Services Committee and I, the distinguished ranking member of the Foreign Relations and Senator MOYNIHAN--a group of us are trying to work on a framework for the purpose of our two respective leaders, and, indeed, the President is involved. 
   Yesterday, in the course of our hearings, I addressed my concern--I support the delay of the final consideration, as now under the UC, but I am also very concerned that whenever the Senate resumes consideration of this treaty it be done in a time period after careful records have been created on this treaty and questions that concern General Powell about the conflict of testimony have been resolved to the best of our ability, and that it not be done under the dynamics of the U.S. constitutional process of electing a President and the Members of the Congress. That is the thing that concerns me. Those dynamics might, in all fairness, affect the outcome of this treaty which could be adverse to the national security interests of this Nation and our allies who depend upon us. 
   In searching for the format of a consensus to move off the UC consent of  having the vote next week, we need to address that issue. Will my dear colleague say exactly what he did in open session yesterday about how he basically endorses my concerns over the year of the national elections under our Constitution?

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is the time for cool heads, sound minds, to make most difficult decisions. I listened very carefully to our distinguished majority leader. And I have listened to my colleague and friend from Delaware. 
   My colleague from Delaware dwells on the process. This situation today is solely the result of the unanimous consent agreement, proposed at first by the majority leader of the Senate, and studied for a period of 3 days. Our majority leader has a right to believe that 3-day period of study enabled my good friend from Delaware and all others to examine this situation and determine, on the fairness, the propriety and, indeed, the national interest of bringing this treaty up today and Tuesday for floor debate. 
   And for having hearings in the Senate Armed Services Committee--I am sorry that my friend somewhat disparages the jurisdiction of this committee. But we have the jurisdiction. And I can point to the rules over the critical part of this debate, and that is the stockpile of nuclear weapons; that is the exclusive province of our committee. It is an integral part. 
   In that vein, we held 3 days of hearings. One was behind closed doors, when the intelligence community, to the extent I can reveal it, on their own initiative brought up the need to start a total new survey about the ability of this country, and indeed others, to monitor the terms of this treaty. We did not ask for it. They did it on their own initiative. They brought it up. That survey and study will take a period of some months and go into next year. 
   But the point is, I say to my distinguished friend from Delaware, this institution operates on the basis of rules. It was total comity between the distinguished majority leader and the distinguished minority leader for a period of 3 days; and finally the Senate--all 100 Senators--participated either by being on the floor or consultation with their respective leaders in the unanimous consent agreement. So process is behind us. 
   To me, to constantly bring up, as the Senator from Delaware did, the issue of the process, it has been covered by our distinguished leader today. It has been covered by the Senator from Delaware. We should move forward at this moment with this serious debate on the fundamental issue; and that is whether or not this treaty is in America's national security interest. 
   I think the press is accurately reporting the facts of the hearing held yesterday, again in the Armed Services Committee, when the Directors of the laboratories--these are not politicians, these individuals who have served in their capacity as top scientists for our country for 10, 12, 15 years--came before the Senate Armed Services Committee and told us, with the Secretary of Energy, their boss, sitting right there, their own opinions. 
   Any reasonable individual, in examining their statements in their totality, must come to the conclusions which are accurately reported in the very article that appeared today in the New York Times: They cannot give that degree of opinion that is needed to move forward on this treaty. They simply cannot do that.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are going to be here. But as a matter of courtesy, I just wanted to thank my colleague for his very valuable contribution. 
   He is a member of our committee. He attended the hearings that we have had in the course of this week, and he referred, with great accuracy, to the testimony that was given to our committee. 
   But clearly, good, sound, public servants, nonpoliticians, having spent anywhere from a decade to three decades of their lives working in their respective fields--whether it was the technical field, with the laboratory directors, or the military field, they had honest differences of opinion. There was no consensus, no strong consensus except the case, the weight of the case against the treaty grew day, by day, by day from that testimony, culminating, as you know, in this article in the New York Times this morning, which addresses the very heart of this treaty in which these lab directors--I don't know whether they are Republicans or Democrats or what they are; they are not wrapped up in this process of the Senate; they are not arguing a unanimous consent--are simply telling their fellow scientists the world over, the citizens of this country, the scientists in charge of maintaining the safety and reliability of the Nation's nuclear arsenals, they might not be able to do their job without nuclear tests. That is actual firing of weapons that would be outlawed--outlawed, they used the word--under this treaty. 
   I thank the Senator. I want to come back to the laboratory, the testimony my colleague from Delaware and I were in colloquy about. We intermittently yield to other Senators. I yield at this time.

   Mr. WARNER. We serve together on the Armed Services Committee. The Senator from West Virginia came to every hearing and listened. And he asked the question that elicited a critical answer which indicated that the intelligence community needed time within which to complete this analysis regarding the ability of our country tomorrow or in the future to monitor another nation's testing if that testing constituted cheating under the treaty. The Senator was there yesterday throughout the laboratory hearing, and he had the courage to stand on this floor and say that he listened to those Directors, and, indeed, those raised the legitimate concerns.

The Senator from West Virginia knows in private conversations I have had with him and other colleagues that this Senator on this side of the aisle is doing what I can, although I will vote against that treaty today, and tomorrow, and the next day, as it is currently written. I recognize its importance. 
   I stayed here until 9:30 last night working with others to see what we can do to adopt a framework. I just left the Press Gallery. They asked me, Senator, what are the components? I said the essential component is for the President to share equally the responsibility of the very serious decision that our two leaders, Democrat and Republican, are faced with about vitiating this time agreement. The Senator from West Virginia recognizes that as a former majority leader himself. 
   I have just been handed this document.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am anxious to receive the remarks of our distinguished chairman. But I was right there when Senator LEVIN asked the questions. I will put in the RECORD my edification of their replies. 
   We have to understand, this Stockpile Stewardship Program, SSP, is basically a computer and other adjuncts, scientific devices that we are going to put in place--that is the key, ``put in place''--at the minimum, 5 or 6 years from now, but more likely 10 years from now. In the opinion of the Director of Sandia Laboratories, it could be 20 years. That is all in the RECORD in response to my question. 
   These Directors carefully said: Yes, we are meeting the current milestones in putting together this computer and other high-tech test programs, but we are a long way away. It could be as much as 20 years. So we could go to a period of, at a minimum, 8 to 10 years without any testing of the type that is a substitute for actual testing. Today, the stockpile is safe. Tomorrow, it is credible and safe. But as the years go on--and Senator BYRD used the words, as the years go on--the natural degrading under the law of physics of metallic parts, of chemical parts, and other parts takes place. 
   Therefore, this hope for SSP, in sum, is almost a dream, but these men conscientiously are working on it day and night. Hopefully, in a period of anywhere from 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, maybe 20 years, it will be on line for that type of database which actual testing will give. 
   In the meantime, we are going through with part of the SSP program, but not all of it--bits and pieces of it--largely relying on the test data of a bank of information we have in this country developed over the period of 50 years in which we did actual tests. 
   I thank my colleague.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the best deterrent from keeping those thousands of missiles coming in is precisely what we have had these 50-plus years--a credible safe deterrent in our stockpile. And the person whose finger is on the button firing those missiles knows that. 
   I am reading from yesterday's proceedings of the Senate Armed Services Committee on page 50 where the chairman, myself, asked the following questions. This is one of the laboratory Directors testifying: 
   ``We moved this year toward the development of the SSP, and last year toward putting in place the supercomputers on a path that we think we need to have. We are on a path that by 2004 we will have a supercomputer in place that begins''--begins--``to get us into the realm of what we need to do this job''--namely certifying the stockpiling. 
   ``The issue that I think you are trying to address''--this is the hardest point I think as a scientist--``is that we cannot predict that by such and such a date we will know everything we need to know.'' 
   ``It is an evolving process. Each year we learn something else.'' 
   Bit by bit, year by year. 
   I then asked: ``My time is running out.'' 
   And it is running out. We want to control time. 
   ``Give us your best estimate, doctor,'' Senator WARNER said. 
   ``Dr. Brown: I think we are going to be in the best position sometime between 2005 and 2010.'' 
   ``Chairman WARNER: Dr. Tarter.'' 
   ``Dr. Tarter: I agree with Dr. Brown.'' 
   ``Dr. Robinson: My guess is somewhere in the 10 years hence to 20 years hence period.'' 
   There it is, short answers directed to the question.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I introduce a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow penalty-free distributions from qualified retirement programs of individuals residing in Presidentially declared disaster areas. 
   I and so many of my colleagues have been visiting our States and working with our Governors and State legislators, city councilpersons and mayors particularly with regard to the devastation of floods we have seen as a consequence of the most recent hurricane. 
   I looked into the faces of these suffering people. And one of them--this was not my idea--one of them came to me with the simplest type of request. I thought it merited the attention of the Senate. I put it into this bill that I now introduce in the Senate. 
   Despite an individual's or family's best efforts to plan for the future, sometimes the unexpected strikes--hurricanes and natural disasters. When that happens, people need all the tools available to rebuild their lives, the lives of their families, and to become an integral part of those communities. 
   One community, Franklin, VA, which is in the central part of the State, in the old rural part of the State, dependent largely on agriculture, which has flat land--I say to my distinguished colleague, Senator HELMS, how badly his State was hit by the same storm--had 18 inches of rain in less than 2 hours. There is no large riverbed there or drainage ditches. And as a result, the water rose in this town up to the second level of the stores and the houses. It went into a railyard and toppled enormous freight cars, particularly tank cars with petroleum. And suddenly this whole community was awash in foul water of 8 to 10 to 12 feet some places in height. There was no place for the water to run off, except gradually over this flat territory. 
   These people need to rebuild their lives and their homes. Families are faced with repairing and replacing damaged property and lost property. Many are forced to draw on savings, including their retirement accounts, to meet expenses. However, if they choose to tap upon their retirement plans or accounts, they are saddled with a 10-percent additional Federal tax for 
   early distribution. That was put in the law for good reason--to deter people from going into these plans where they had some tax benefits. But let's stop to think: That may be the only recourse to financial salvation in the wake of an act of God Almighty. 
   They need help. Taxpayers coping with these disasters should not have to face the burden of a Federal tax penalty. This bill is very simple. It waives the 10 percent additional tax levied on early distributions from qualified retirement plans or retirement accounts for residents of federally declared disaster areas--that means the President of the United States has declared that county a disaster area--designated after July 31, 1999. 
   It is my intention that these distributions will be used for the repair or replacement of property destroyed or damaged by an unforeseen natural disaster or for emergency expenses arising from such a tragic event. 
   The taxpayer must be a resident of an area declared eligible. I point that out: a resident of an area eligible by the President for Federal disaster assistance, and the distribution must be taken within 1 year of the disaster declaration. 
   The current Tax Code waives the 10-percent penalty for distribution for certain medical expenses, health insurance premiums for the unemployed, higher education expenses, and the purchase of a first home. In my view, eliminating this additional tax for individuals and families suffering from the effects of unforeseen natural disasters makes plain common sense. 
   How grateful all of us are for our constituents coming to the great city of Washington, DC, and supplying us with  ideas which probably are before us every day but somehow we overlook them. 
   Tropical Storm Dennis and Hurricane Floyd have had a devastating effect on my State. People in Southside and Tidewater, VA, are attempting to rebuild their lives and to recover some of what they lost. We should remove any disincentive, any roadblock that may hinder rebuilding and recovery.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the Senate will resume consideration of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty at 9 a.m. on Tuesday, October 12. On Tuesday, there will be approximately 6 hours of debate remaining on the treaty. Therefore, that debate will consume the day until 4:30 p.m., at which time the Senate will resume consideration of the conference report to accompany the Agriculture appropriations bill. Cloture was filed on the conference report on Thursday with a vote scheduled to occur at 5:30 on Tuesday. It is expected that the vote on the CTBT will occur on Wednesday, at some point following the adoption of the Agriculture Appropriations conference report. Therefore, the next rollcall vote will occur at 5:30 p.m. on Tuesday, October 12. 
   Mr. President, in addition, as a reminder, the two amendments in order to the CTBT must be filed at the desk by 9:45 a.m. on Tuesday, October 12.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have a second degree amendment to Senator DEWINE's amendment on higher education, amendment No. 1847. 
   Senator SPECTER, Senator HARKIN and my other distinguished colleagues on the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education Subcommittee certainly have your work cut out in crafting S. 1650, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. The subcommittee was faced with a difficult task of appropriating limited funds to hundreds of programs. 
   I commend the subcommittee for its hard work and for its dedication to education funding. This bill provides $37.6 billion for the Department of Education. This amount is more than $2 billion above fiscal year 1999 levels and $537 million above the Administration's request. 
   Of this $37.6 billion, the committee bill provides over $139.5 million for the fund for the improvement of education. This amount is $500,000 over fiscal year 1999 appropriations. These funds are provided to support significant programs and projects to improve the quality of education, help students meet high academic standards and contribute to the achievement of educational goals. 
   During the appropriations process, Senator SPECTER, I submitted a letter requesting that the subcommittee provide $1.5 million in funds for an innovative educational program known as the Youth Leadership Initiative (``YLI'') at the University of Virginia. I am thankful for the subcommittee's consideration of my request and am grateful that the subcommittee recognized the importance of YLI by including report language on this invaluable educational program. 
   The goal of YLI is to work with America's middle and high school students to prepare them for a lifetime of political participation. YLI seeks to transform the way students view their role in our democracy, develop their trust in and awareness of our system, and instill in our students the core values of good citizenship and democracy. 
   To achieve its goal, YLI teaches students in the functional components of America's political process. Among other things, YLI students will learn how to run student-forged mock campaigns, organize political events, conduct election analysis, and hold mock elections. 
   Senator SPECTER, these lessons need to be taught and are of paramount importance. In 1998, voter participation during the mid-term Congressional elections was the lowest since 1942. Almost every survey of public opinion shows growing disinterest in the American electoral process, and disinterest is strongest among our young people. 
   Thomas Jefferson once warned Americans about the ramifications of such disinterest in our political system, stating, ``Lethargy is the forerunner of death to other public liberty.'' America's form of government is uniquely dependent upon the active participation of its citizens. Therefore, if voter participation continues to decrease, then our democracy will suffer. 
   By combining academic excellence with hands-on civic activity, YLI will help turn our schools and communities into hotbeds for the rejuvenation of our democracy. Since its launch last spring, YLI has attracted national attention for its unique approach to teaching our young people about democracy. In a pilot program currently in progress in several Virginia communities, thousands of students in hundreds of classrooms are experiencing the wonders of this pioneering program. Students and teachers have participated in YLI training sessions and members of the inaugural class of youth leaders are already hard at work organizing public debates between actual legislative candidates which they will host in the coming weeks. 
   On Tuesday, October 26, 1999, nearly 35,000 middle and high school students will be eligible to participate in the largest internet ballot ever conducted. On this day, YLI students will be voting on-line using a secure, encrypted state-of-the-art ``cyber-ballot'' that is specifically tailored to each student's voting precinct. 
   These achievements are only the beginning. YLI is a national crusade. This year's pilot program in Virginia is laying the foundation for next year's expansion throughout Virginia. Plans are already underway to make this program available to every middle and high school in the United States soon after the 2000 elections. 
   YLI already has the financial support of the Commonwealth of Virginia and  many of America's leading corporations, foundations and individuals. YLI is a model public-private partnership that will make available to all Americans students a program which will increase participation in our democracy for future generations. Senator SPECTER, a small investment today will pay dividends for many generations to come. 
   Again, I say to the Senator from Pennsylvania, I certainly understand the difficult task facing your subcommittee in crafting a bipartisan, fiscally responsible appropriations bill. I know you recognize the importance of YLI and that's why report language was included in the Committee's report. I ask my distinguished colleague, however, to ensure that YLI receives the requested funding in the eventual bill that emerges from conference.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to address the issue of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and to apprise the Senate of information presented at hearings of the Armed Services Committee over the last two days. The committee today conducted the second of its series of three hearings this week on the CTBT. 
   Yesterday morning, the Armed Services Committee heard classified testimony from career professionals, technical experts with decades of experience, from the Department of Energy laboratories and the CIA. At that hearing, the committee received new information having to do with the Russian nuclear stockpile, our ability to verify compliance with the CTBT, as well as DOE lab assessments of the U.S. nuclear stockpile. Much of what the committee heard during that hearing was new information--information developed over the past 18 months--and therefore was not available to the Congress and the President when the CTBT was signed in 1996. Since 1997, when the intelligence community released its last estimate on our ability to monitor the CTBT, new information has led the intelligence community--on its own initiative--to conclude that a new, updated estimate is needed. I have been informed that this new estimate will be completed late this year or early next year. 
   This morning, the Armed Services Committee heard from the Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton. This afternoon, we heard from Dr. James Schlesinger, former Secretary of Defense and Energy and former Director of Central Intelligence, and General Shalikashvili, former Chairman of the JCS. Their testimony is available on the Committee's web page. 
   In today's hearing, I highlighted my serious concerns with the CTBT in three areas: 
   1. We will not be able to adequately and confidently verify compliance with the treaty. 
   2. CTBT will preclude the United States from taking needed measures to ensure the safety and reliability of our stockpile.  
   3. The administration has overstated the effectiveness of the CTBT in lessening proliferation. 
   Regarding the safety of the U.S. nuclear stockpile, today's witnesses highlighted the fact that only half of the nuclear weapons in the U.S. stockpile today have all the modern safety features that have been developed and should be included on these weapon systems. We will not be able to retrofit these safety features in our weapons in the absence of nuclear testing. These are weapons that are stored at various locations around the world; weapons that rest in missile tubes literally feet away from the bunks of our submarine crews; weapons that are regularly moved across roads and through airfields around the world. 
   Regarding the reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile, Secretary Cohen and General Shelton acknowledged that it could be ten years or more before we will know whether the Stockpile Stewardship Program--computer simulation tools--needed to replace nuclear testing will work. Secretary Schlesinger clarified that, if we substitute computer simulation for actual nuclear testing, the most we can hope for is that these computer tools will slow the decline--due to aging--in our confidence in the stockpile. Will we ever be able to replace nuclear testing? 
   Regarding proliferation, Secretary Schlesinger highlighted the 
   fact that the diminishing confidence in our stockpile, which is inevitable if we were to ratify CTBT, may actually drive some non-nuclear countries to reconsider their need to develop nuclear weapons to compensate for the diminished credibility of the U.S. deterrent force. This declining confidence in the U.S. stockpile is a fact of science that has been progressing since the United States stopped nuclear testing in 1992. Our nuclear weapons are experiencing the natural consequences of aging. Dr. Schlesinger stated it clearly when he asked: ``Do we want a world that lacks confidence in the U.S. deterrent or not?'' 
   Regarding verification, this morning Secretary Cohen confirmed that the United States will not be able to detect low yield nuclear testing which can be carried out in violation of the treaty. In addition, we exposed the fallacy of the administration's claim that CTBT will provide us with important on-site inspection rights. We would need to get the approval of 30 nations before we could conduct any on-site inspections. That will be very difficult, to say the least. 
   Although I believe all of our witnesses have conducted themselves very professionally, I heard nothing at either of our hearings that changes my view of the CTBT. I am deeply concerned that the administration is over-selling the benefits of this treaty while downplaying its many adverse long-term consequences. 
   My bottom line is this: reasonable people can disagree on the impact of the CTBT for U.S. national security. As long as there is a reasonable doubt about whether the CTBT is in the U.S. national interest, then we should not ratify it. 
   Mr. President, tomorrow morning the Armed Services Committee will conduct the third of its CTBT hearings. We will hear from the DOE lab directors and others responsible for overseeing the stockpile. We will also hear from former officials and other technical experts with years of experience in developing, testing and maintaining our nuclear weapons.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will offer an amendment to give Reagan National and Dulles International Airports equitable treatment under Federal law that is enjoyed today by all of the major commercial airports. 
   Congress enacted legislation in 1986 to transfer ownership of Reagan National and Dulles Airports to a regional authority which included a provision to create a Congressional Board of Review. 
   Immediately upon passage of the 1986 Transfer Act, local community groups filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the board of review. The Supreme Court upheld the lawsuit and concurred that the Congressional Board of Review as structured as unconstitutional because it gave Members of Congress veto authority over the airport decisions. The Court ruled  that the functions of the board of review was a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. 
   During the 1991 House-Senate conference on the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), I offered an amendment, which was adopted, to attempt to revise the Board of Review to meet the constitutional requirements. 
   Those provisions were also challenged and again were ruled unconstitutional. 
   In 1996, in another attempt to address the situation, the Congress enacted legislation to repeal the Board of Review since it no longer served any function due to several federal court rulings. In its place, Congress increased the number of federal appointees to the MWAA Board of Directors from 1 to 3 members. 
   In addition to the requirement that the Senate confirm the appointees, the statute contains a punitive provision which denies all federal Airport Improvement Program entitlement grants and the imposition of any new passenger facility charges to Dulles International and Reagan National if the appointees were not confirmed by October 1, 1997. 
   Regretfully, Mr. President, the Senate has not confirmed the three Federal appointees. Since October 1997, Dulles International and Reagan National, and its customers, have been waiting for the Senate to take action. Finally in 1998, the Senate Commerce Committee favorably reported the three pending nominations to the Senate for consideration, but unfortunately no further action occurred before the end of the session because these nominees were held hostage for other unrelated issues. Many speculate that these nominees have not been confirmed because of the ongoing delay in enacting a long-term FAA reauthorization bill. 
   At the beginning of the 105th Congress in January 1997, Commerce Committee held hearings and approved the three nominees for floor consideration. Unfortunately, a hold was placed on them on the Senate floor at the very end of the Congress. All three nominees were renominated by the President in January 1999. Nothing has happened since. 
   Mr. President, I am not here today to join in that speculation. I do want, however, to call to the attention of my colleagues the severe financial, safety and consumer service constraints this inaction is having on both Dulles and Reagan National. 
   As the current law forbids the FAA from approving any AIP entitlement grants for construction at the two airports and from approving any Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) applications, these airports have been denied access to over $146 million. 
   These are funds that every other airport in the country receives annually and are critical to maintaining a quality level of service and safety at our Nation's airports. Unlike any other airport in the country, the full share of federal funds have been withheld from Dulles and Reagan National for over two years. 
   These critically needed funds have halted important construction projects at both airports. Of the over $146 million that is due, approximately $161 million will fund long-awaited construction projects and $40 million is needed to fund associated financing costs. 
   I respect the right of the Senate to exercise its constitutional duties to confirm the President's nominees to important federal positions. I do not, however, believe that it is appropriate to link the Senate's confirmation process to vitally needed federal dollars to operate airports. 
   Also, I must say that I can find no justification for the Senate's delay in considering the qualifications of these nominees to serve on the MWAA Board. To my knowledge, no one has raised concerns about the qualifications of the nominees. We are neglecting our duties. 
   For this reason, I am introducing an amendment today to repeal the punitive prohibition on releasing Federal funds to the airports until the Federal nominees have been confirmed. 
   Airports are increasingly competitive. Those that cannot keep up with the growing demand see the services go to other airports. This is particularly true with respect to international services, and low-fare services, both of which are essential.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I just attended a ceremony at the Department of Defense, at which time the President signed the authorization bill for the Armed Forces of the United States for the year 2000. I was necessarily delayed in returning to the floor. My colleague, Senator ROBB, accompanied me, and he will be here momentarily. We worked together on this amendment, as we worked together on this project from the inception, a project basically to try to get National Airport and Dulles Airport into full operation. 
   Our aim all along has been to let modernization go forward and, to the extent we can gain support in this Chamber, limit any increase in the number of flights. We do this because of our concerns regarding safety, congestion, and other factors. I say ``other factors'' because at the time the original legislation was passed whereby we defederalized these airports and allowed a measure of control by other than Federal authorities, giving the State of Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the District of Columbia a voice in these matters, it was clear that Congress should not micromanage these two airports. 
   We went through a succession of events to achieve this objective, and we are here today hopefully to finalize this legislation--and I have already put in an amendment to allow the modernization to go forward--and to do certain other things in connection with the board, to let the board be appointed. 
   Now we come to the question of the increased flights, and I support the amendment by my distinguished colleague. 
   I want to cover some history. 
   My remarks today will focus on the unwise provisions included in this bill which tear apart the perimeter and high density rules at Reagan National Airport. These rules have been in effect--either in regulation or in statute--for nearly 30 years. Since 1986, these rules have been a critical ingredient in providing for significant capital investments and a balance in service among this region's three airports--Dulles International, Reagan National, and Baltimore-Washington International. 
   First and foremost, I believe these existing rules have greatly benefitted the traveling public--the consumer. 
   Mr. President, to gain a full understanding of the severe impact these increased slot changes will have on our regional airports, one must examine the recent history of these three airports. 
   Prior to 1986, Dulles and Reagan National were federally owned and managed by the FAA. The level of service provided at these airports was deplorable. At National, consumers were routinely subject to traffic gridlock, insufficient parking, and routine flight cancellations and delays. Dulles was an isolated, underutilized airport. 
   For years, the debate raged within the FAA and the surrounding communities about the future of Reagan National. Should it be improved, expanded or closed? This ongoing uncertainty produced a situation where no investments were made in National and Dulles and service continued to deteriorate. 
   A national commission, now known as the Holton Commission, was created in 1984. It was led by former Virginia Governor Linwood Holton and former Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole and charged with resolving the longstanding controversies which plagued both airports. The result was a recommendation to transfer federal ownership of the airports to a regional authority so that sorely needed capital investments to improve safety and service could be made. 
   I was pleased to have participated in the development of the 1986 legislation to transfer operations of these airports to a regional authority. It was a fair compromise of the many issues which had stalled any improvements at both airports over the years. 
   The regulatory high density rule was placed in the statute so that neither the FAA nor the Authority could unilaterally changes it. The previous passenger cap at Reagan National was 
   repealed, thereby ending growth controls, in exchange for a freeze on slots. Lastly, the perimeter rule at 1,250 miles was established. 
   For those interested in securing capital investments at both airports, the transfer of these airports under a long-term lease arrangement to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority gave MWAA the power to sell bonds to finance the long-overdue work. The Authority has sold millions of dollars in bonds which has financed the new terminal, rehabilitation of the existing terminal, a new control tower and parking facilities at Reagan National. 
   These improvements would not have been possible without the 1986 Transfer Act which included the high density rule, and the perimeter rule. Limitations on operations at National had long been in effect through FAA regulations, but now were part of the balanced compromise in the Transfer Act. 
   For those who feared significant increases in flight activity at National and who for years had prevented any significant investments in National, they were now willing to support major rehabilitation work at National to improve service. They were satisfied that these guarantees would ensure that Reagan National would not become another ``Dulles or BWI''. 
   Citizens had received legislative assurances that there would be no growth at Reagan National in terms of permitted scheduled flights beyond on the 37-per-hour-limit. Today, unless the Robb amendment is adopted, we will be breaking our commitments. 
   These critical decisions in the 1986 Transfer Act were made to fix both the aircraft activity level at Reagan National and to set its role as a short/medium haul airport. These compromises served to insulate the airport from its long history of competing efforts to increase and to decrease its use. 
   Since the transfer, the Authority has worked to maintain the balance in service between Dulles and Reagan National. The limited growth principle for Reagan National has been executed by the Authority in all of its planning assumptions and the Master Plan. While we have all witnessed the transformation of National into a quality airport today, these improvements in terminals, the control tower and parking facilities were all determined to meet the needs of this airport for the foreseeable future based on the continuation of the high density and perimeter rules. 
   These improvements, however, have purposely not included an increase in the number of gates for aircraft or aircraft capacity. 
   Prior to the 1986 Transfer Act, while National was mired in controversy and poor 
   service, Dulles was identified as the region's growth airport. Under FAA rules and the Department of Transportation's 1981 Metropolitan Washington Airports Policy, it was recognized that Dulles had the capacity for growth and a suitable environment to accommodate this growth. 
   Following enactment of the Transfer Act, plans, capital investments and bonding decisions made by the Authority all factored in the High Density and Perimeter rules. 
    Mr. President, I provide this history on the issues which stalled improvements at the region's airports in the 1970s and 1980s because it is important to understanding how these airports have operated so effectively over the past 13 years. 
   Every one of us should ask ourselves if the 1986 Transfer Act has met our expectations. For me, the answer is a resounding yes. Long-overdue capital investments have been made in Reagan National and Dulles. The surrounding communities have been given an important voice in the management of these airports. We have seen unprecedented stability in the growth of both airports. Most importantly, the consumer has benefited by enhanced service at Reagan National. 
   For these reasons, I have opposed an increase in slots at Reagan National. There is no justification for an increase of this size. It is not recommended by the administration, by the airline industry, by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority or by the consumer. 
   The capital improvements made at Reagan National since the 1986 Transfer Act have not expanded the 44 gates or expanded airfield capacity. All of the improvements that have been made  have been on the land side of the airport. No improvements have been made to accommodate increased aircraft capacity. Expanding flights at Reagan National will simply ``turn back the clock'' at National to the days of traffic gridlock, overcrowded terminal activity and flight delays--all to the detriment of the traveling public. 
   This ill-advised scheme is sure to return Reagan National to an airport plagued by delays and inconvenience. This proposal threatens to overwhelm the new facilities, just as the previous facilities were overwhelmed. 
    Mr. President, it is completely inappropriate for Congress to act as ``airport managers'' to legislate new flights. Those decisions should be made by the local airport authority with direct participation by the public in an open process. Today, we will be preventing local decisionmaking. 
   I know that my colleagues readily cite a recent GAO report that indicates that new flights at Reagan National can be accommodated. This report, however, plainly includes an 
   important disclaimer. That disclaimer states:  
   This study did not evaluate the potential congestion and noise that could result from an increase in operations at Reagan National. Ultimately, ..... the Congress must balance the benefits that additional flights may bring to the traveling public against the local community's concerns about the effect of those flights on noise, the environment, and the area's other major airports.  
   Surely, we cannot make this important decision in a vacuum. Determining how many flights serve Reagan National simply by measuring how quickly we can clear runway space is not sound policy. 
   For these reasons I urge the adoption of the Robb amendment. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   In the year 2000 the United States Navy Submarine Force celebrates its one hundredth anniversary. 
   The Submarine Force began with the purchase of U.S.S. Holland on April 11, 1900. The past 100 years have witnessed the evolution of a force that mastered submersible warfare, introduced nuclear propulsion to create the true submarine, and for decades patrolled the deep ocean front line: the hottest part of an otherwise cold war. 
   Beginning in World War I the Submarine Force began to support national interests through offensive and defensive operations in the Atlantic. Using lessons learned from German U-boat design, the US Submarine Force developed advanced diesel submarine designs during the inter-war years. In spite of a hesitant beginning due to Pearl Harbor and difficulties with defective torpedoes, the World War II submarine force destroyed 1,314 enemy ships (5.3 million tons), which translated into 55 percent of all enemy ships lost. Out of 16,000 submariners, the force lost 375 officers and 3,131 enlisted men in fifty-two submarines, the highest casualty rate of any combatant submarine service on any side in the conflict. Seven Congressional Medals of Honor were awarded to submariners during World War II for distinguished gallantry in combat.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, with my distinguished leader and Senator HELMS, we met today for the better part of an hour--and through Senator LEVIN. As my colleague knows, he is absent for reasons of a personal need today. We have carefully laid the foundation for a very thorough hearing by the Armed Services Committee. Our committee has supervision over the stockpile, and really the stockpile is a central body of fact which I urge each Senator to study very carefully. 
   What we have proposed to do on Tuesday of next week is to have the experts from the Central Intelligence Agency, from the various laboratories, in closed hearing to lay out the facts with regard to this stockpile. The following Wednesday, we are going to invite the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, and former Secretaries of Defense and former Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs, and Senator LEVIN, of course, will have his selection of witnesses. 
   The following day, on Thursday, we again, with the directors of the laboratories and others, will cover more details about the stockpile issue and the efforts by this country to put in place testing to be a substitute--that is, computer analysis, and so forth, as a substitute for actual testing. 
   Our committee will have a very thorough set of hearings. We will distill the facts, provide them for the record, and bring them to the respective leaders, and hopefully perhaps the Senate, as a whole, can consider parts or all of this important testimony.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say most respectfully to my good friend, the minority leader, each year the Armed Services Committee reviews the stockpile issues. Each year we go through our normal oversight hearings. A part of it relates to the very issues that we will again bring to the Senate by virtue of the hearings in our committee and the record that we will put together. 
   So I must say, most respectfully, our committee annually looks at these issues. So for members of our committee, and to the extent others have been interested, in fact, the record is there.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my concern, as you have said, is a decade hence. Will there be some leader in the world or, indeed, some rogue or some other individual who wants to challenge our country who will have any basis to believe we have less than 100-percent reliability in that arsenal of weapons we will have in a decade or 15 years out? That is the critical period of time. 
   I say to my good friend, Senator DASCHLE, everyone knows my very strong opposition to this treaty. Frequently, colleagues on both sides of the aisle engage me in informal debate of what it is about the treaty, what it is about the facts that lead me to this conclusion. 
   So, yes, perhaps we could have been more formalized at some point in time. But I think it is important that we focus on it at this critical time, and that we are going to have very thorough hearings in our committee. I have looked over the hearings of the Foreign Relations Committee over the year and they, indeed, covered many of the subjects relating to this treaty in that period of time.

   Mr. WARNER. First, I wish to commend our colleague for the very forthright way in which he has, for some period of time, expressed his strong views, the need for this treaty to be considered by the Senate. I strongly support the request of the majority leader, and I share with you the hope that our leadership can work this out and we can move expeditiously. 
   I assure my colleague, I have just had the opportunity to speak with my distinguished ranking member, Senator LEVIN. The Armed Services Committee will promptly conduct hearings regarding that area for which we have oversight responsibility. 
   The point I wish to make to my colleague is, it is going to require the most careful consideration by all Senators to reach this vote. Much of the relative material that convinces this Senator to oppose the treaty simply cannot be disclosed in open. I am going to urge our colleagues, and I am sure with the assistance of our leadership, we can provide more than one opportunity for each Senator to learn the full range of facts regarding this treaty and its implications for this Nation. 
   Yes, I want to see America lead, but I want to make certain that leadership role that exists today can exist a decade hence, 15 years, 20 years hence. That is the absolute heart of this debate: What steps do we take now to ensure that our country can maintain its position of world leadership in the decades to come? 
   We shall develop the facts, those of us who are most respectful of your viewpoint, as I am sure you are of mine. It will be a historic vote for this Chamber. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. 
   Mr. President, last week the Senate Appropriations Committee completed action on the appropriations bill for a number of Federal agencies including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. I commend Senator BOND and Senator STEVENS for their efforts to support the full request for NASA in the midst of extreme budget pressures. The NASA funding in the Senate bill will face a stiff challenge in the conference with the House, however. I want to take this occasion to reflect on the importance of investment in research and development in the NASA budget to civilian and military aeronautics. 
   The aerospace industry in the United States has undergone a dramatic transition in the last ten years. In 1986, 70 percent of the sales of this industry were to the government, primarily for the defense market. Less than 30 percent of the business base of the industry consisted of commercial products. At that time, Federal research and development supporting aerospace technology was largely funded by the Defense Department. 
   Today, the situation has reversed. The defense portion of U.S. aerospace business is at 29 percent, and the defense share continues to shrink. Although Federal funding for military-unique hardware will always be needed in the interests of national security, non-defense research from agencies such as NASA is growing in importance to the industry. Nearly 70 percent of aerospace sales are in the commercial arena, and 41 percent of aerospace production in this country is for export. 
   As we grow increasingly concerned about monthly trade balance figures, the importance of these aerospace exports for our national economy grows. The aerospace industry was responsible for $59 billion in exports and $22 billion in imports in 1997. This resulted in a positive trade balance of $37 billion--the single biggest trade balance of any sector in the entire American economy. In 1998, our exports grew to $64 billion in equipment with total imports of $23 billion. The industry trade surplus of $41 billion has widened the gap between the aerospace industry and all other sectors. Make no mistake; we are competing in an aggressive global marketplace. Technological leadership is absolutely essential if the U.S. aerospace industry is to continue successfully competing in an increasingly complex and sophisticated world economy. 
   Some long-term trends for the health of the aerospace industry are troubling, however. There has been a dramatic reduction in Federal aerospace R&D funding. During the Carter administration, we invested 18 percent of our R&D funding in the U.S. aerospace community. That amount increased to 21 percent during the Reagan years. Today, it is only 8 percent and declining. 
   The reductions have been even more severe in certain specific areas. The aeronautics budget in NASA has declined from $920 million in fiscal year 1998 to $620 million in the request for fiscal year 2000, a reduction of almost a third over just three years! Reducing research and development funding for this vital industry runs counter to all of our historical economic experience. 
   We are experiencing a time of tremendous economic expansion in our country, but we seem to have forgotten the tremendous role R&D plays in sustaining this growth. Alan Greenspan recently testified that rapid technological change has made a significant contribution and is a major force in this expansion. We cannot, and as long as I am a Member of the United States Senate, we will not forget this! 
   In 1804, the venerable president from Virginia, Thomas Jefferson, with the full support of Congress, set in motion the first official exploration of our new frontier. He boldly sanctioned the Lewis & Clark expedition not only to map the new territories of the United States, but also to satisfy an American passion for discovery--the same passion that has led our country to be the leader among nations. That first step paved the way for today's exploration of the solar system, the continued exploration of communication technologies, and the future exploration of the planet Mars. 
   The very year the United States landed a man on the moon, the Department of Defense had begun to work on a new technological concept that is now coming into its own. I speak of the Internet that is transforming the structure of our economic life. The technological wonders that support our national security and fuel our economic growth were not invented overnight. We must be prepared to weather the slow and often tedious process of design and development of products and systems necessary to bring them to maturity. 
   It is no different in aeronautics. I am concerned that 
   without a national strategy for aeronautics R&D investment, we will gradually lose the technological edge of which we are so proud and which is key to our competitiveness in the global economy and our security as a nation. We should not delude ourselves; America will lose its preeminence in aeronautics unless we adequately fund aeronautics research at NASA. 
   For instance, the Appropriations Committee in the House recently cut the NASA budget so severely that it will cause a major employment problem and will devastate advanced technology programs so carefully planned for implementation. The House reduced NASA numbers by $1 billion in order to pay for more housing and veteran programs. I appreciate the position facing the Appropriators, but to halt some 30-science programs in their tracks and halt vital research in the aeronautics area is nothing short of foolhardy. I applaud the recent action of the Senate Appropriation's Subcommittee in reversing this House action and urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to insure the Senate position prevails in the coming conference. 
   Programs such as those at NASA cannot be turned off and on like a light switch. It takes time to realize the fruits of our labors. We must not so cavalierly cancel programs and efforts just as they are beginning. A reduction of the magnitude proposed by the House will devastate both research in astronautics and aeronautics in this country. 
   In my travels through Virginia over the recess, I was made aware of the real effect of reductions in the NASA aeronautics R&D budget proposed by the House of Representatives. I visited the NASA facility in Langley, Virginia that leads the nation in aeronautical research and aviation safety technology. It has led this nation in aeronautical breakthroughs from the development of the super critical wing used on many commercial aircraft flying today, to the development of a new collision-avoidance aircraft system for the FAA. This is the center that gave us the magnificent leaders of our Manned Space Program like Dr. Bob Gilruth, Dr. Chris Kraft, Dr. Max Faget, and many others who left Langley to lead our Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs. NASA Langley has exemplified a passion for excellence from its earliest days when it conducted research to produce safe, more efficient and technically superior aircraft for both the military and commercial markets. 
   Given that 70 percent of NASA Langley programs are funded through the NASA aeronautics budget, the future of this national resource is in doubt unless Congress and the Administration can find ways to reverse the severe reductions to this part of our national R&D effort.  
   This nation's leadership in aerospace is not an accident of history, Mr. President. It was made possible by dedicated leaders who looked beyond the present and dreamed of the future that could be. People like those at Langley and throughout NASA. We must not forsake this global leadership in aeronautics technology. We must work together to balance critical priorities and provide the leadership, sacrifice, and enduring commitment to technology, research, and most of all learning. We must continue to fund a robust R&D program through these agencies. 
   Let me close, Mr. President, with a final thought. As Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, I am keenly aware of the challenges our military forces face as they attempt to maintain our security in the face of ever declining resources. Part of the strategy of our leadership at the Department of Defense is to save resources by buying commercial aerospace products wherever possible. This dependence on the commercial marketplace is increasing dramatically. Because of this there is an increasing security dimension to the R&D we accomplish at NASA. This is yet another reason to insure that the effort is funded properly. 
   Mr. President, my concern is as follows. 
   This very important appropriations bill which I will support contains the basic funding for NASA. My concern is that within the NASA budget there is a growing decline and emphasis on research and development funds for aerospace. I say marshal the aerospace industry as it relates to civil aircraft and military aircraft. Frankly, the rush to get to space, the rush to develop the space station--I must say components of that are being made in my State--concern me greatly as I see the following. 
   Some long-term trends for the health of the aerospace industry are troubling. 
   There has been a dramatic reduction in Federal aerospace R&D funding. 
   During the Carter administration, we invested 18 percent of our R&D funding in the U.S. aerospace community. That amount increased to 21 percent during the years under President Ronald Reagan. Today, that category of R&D is only 8 percent and continuing to decline. The funds are being siphoned off into the space program. 
   This Chamber will be in recess probably in several hours. Seventy-plus percent of my colleagues are going to depend on civil aviation to transport themselves back to their home districts and their States for continuation of the business in the Senate. I am among them. 
   I visited Langley Research Center just a short time ago. There I saw a test bed of a program which the technicians told me--these are not politicians, these are trained technicians--Senator, if we can continue our funding, we are going to come up with the software and the hardware which, hopefully, can reduce by over 50 percent the accidents that planes experience every day in either the landing or the take-off phases. Therein is the high risk in aviation. That same research and development can be applied to our military aircraft. It is common to both aircraft. It is a very small amount of money. 
   Fortunately, I received the assurance from the NASA Administrator when he visited my office a few days ago that the program will stay intact. 
   I cited other programs in here, such as noise reduction. More and more the airports are growing around the highly populated areas, and noise becomes a problem. At National Airport it is a very significant problem. 
   Again, a relatively small amount of money can make a difference in years to come--a small amount in comparison to the enormous sums of money going towards the space station and other related infrastructure. We will get to space someday. But in the meantime, we cannot turn our backs on civil aviation. 
   Our exports on civil aviation products--largely airplanes--is one of the biggest, positive factors in our ever-declining balance of trade. It is a major offset. 
   I am pleased to join my distinguished colleague in offering this amendment. It has been my intention, frankly, to go for a cut--a specific cut. 
   But I have been in consultation with the distinguished Senator from Maryland, the distinguished Senator from Missouri, the chairman of the subcommittee, and the chairman of the committee, Mr. STEVENS. 
   First, they made a heroic effort to get more money back into these accounts. They are being watchful of the same 
   problems that concern me. 
   So I decided to withdraw my amendment which would have gone to specific cuts to fund what I believe would be an adequate amount. 
   I am now going to join my distinguished colleague, Mr. ROBB, in another approach on this. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to recognize the exceptionally distinguished service of Ms. Linda Coleman, who is leaving Federal Service on September 30, 1999, after 30 years. She has been the mainstay within the Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison, United States Army for the past 20 years. It is a privilege for me to recognize the many outstanding achievements she has provided the Congress, the United States Army and our great Nation. 
   Linda Coleman has worked for every Member of the Congress as the Secretary of the Army's legislative liaison within the Army's House Liaison Division, Congressional Inquiry Division, and Programs Division. Initiative, caring service, and professionalism are the terms used to describe Linda Coleman. She has been instrumental in providing information and explaining the diverse programs within the United States Army. Ms. Coleman is an expert in coordinating the interface between the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Army and Members of Congress. She is an expert at cutting through the red tape of the bureaucracy without losing sight of the fact that taking care of the soldier is the ultimate goal. I have never known of an instance in which Ms. Coleman would back away from doing the right thing for the Army, the soldier or family members, or the Congress she served. 
   Ms. Coleman has earned a reputation on Capitol Hill as someone who could be relied upon to respond to inquires in a responsive, professional manner. She expanded the Army's understanding of Congress and the Army's role in the legislative process through continuous interaction with Members of Congress and the Army's leadership. Ms. Coleman established procedures to assist in informing and explaining the Army to Congress. Ms. Coleman prepared the Army's senior leaders for all of their meetings with Members of Congress. For each meeting, she prepared the Army senior leader with detailed information on the issues and the interests of the Members of Congress involved in the meetings. Ms. Coleman has been the ``go to'' person in Army Legislative Liaison. When Members of Congress had a really complex issue, the legislative action officers and assistants would go to her for advice. 
   Ms. Coleman is able to communicate effectively with both military officials and Congressional staff members and has developed superb working relationships. Her professional abilities have earned her the respect and trust which served her, the Army, and Congress so well. 
   Mr. President, Linda Coleman is a great credit to the Army and this great Nation. As she now departs after 30 years of Federal Service, I call upon my colleagues to recognize her great contribution to the Nation, and in particular, the Congress. I wish her well in her future endeavors.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senate worked well into the evening last night, and we had about an hour and a half of deliberations regarding this bill. We are prepared this morning, the distinguished ranking member and myself, to conclude that debate. 
   Once again, I pay my heartfelt tribute to my distinguished ranking member and the staff of the committee for a job well done. We have produced a work product in which I believe this institution can take great pride. 
   Mr. President, the Senate is a constant learning experience, and although I have been privileged to have represented the Commonwealth of Virginia for some 21 years in the Senate, I experienced last night an event which I shall always remember. We had concluded our debate, and I was proceeding to do the wrapup on behalf of the majority leader, and when the Senate concluded its work, I was suddenly surrounded by the pages, shaking hands, and expressing their great appreciation. It then took me a minute to realize that we had concluded debate beyond the hour of 9 p.m., thereby foreclosing any requirement that they perform their homework. That was a tribute that I shall long remember. 
   The other experience last night was my distinguished good friend and ranking member, the senior Senator from Michigan, announcing that he would support this bill. I recognize it has been a serious struggle for him and others occasioned by the amendment  on the bill regarding the reorganization of the Department of Energy. 
   I feel very strongly that the Senate did its duty on behalf of the country and put on that bill legislation in the course of the conference that is badly needed to reorganize that Department. I am confident the current Secretary has the ability within this statute to lead that Department, restructuring it in a manner that it can continue to serve the United States and at the same time protect the vital security matters that come before that Department. 
   The bill before us now marks a necessary turning point in reversing the dangerous trends that we have witnessed in our military after 15 years of declining defense spending. While the world has changed in many ways since the end of the cold war, what has not changed is that America's Armed Forces are bearing our commitments as they have always done. There are, however, limits to that commitment by the men and women who proudly serve in uniform. Our forces are clearly overstressed in commitments throughout the world, the most recent being East Timor, where there was clear justification for U.S. participation. 
   Over the past decade, our military manpower has been reduced by one-third, from 2.2 million to 1.4 million, and during this same period our troops have been involved in 50 military operations worldwide. As the force levels have been brought down, as the defense spending in that same period was brought down, up went the number of times that President Clinton and, indeed, President Bush sent our troops beyond our shores--50 times. Compare that period of 10 years to the end of the Vietnam war, in 1975, when we had a bipolar world--the Soviet Union and the United States. In that period from 1975 until roughly 1990, a 15-year period, U.S. military forces were engaged in only 20 deployments beyond our shores. 
   Therein is the reason why our committee, with the strong support of the leadership--certainly Senator LOTT initiated the correspondence that began to bring to the attention of the President, and indeed this body, the need for increased defense spending. Eventually the President did recognize that need and indicated a willingness to increase that spending. 
   Our committee, I am very proud to say, even went beyond the President's number for defense spending. We did so with the very able help and assistance of the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. On two occasions they came before our committee and clearly told us their own personal views regarding the need for additional pay for the men and women in the Armed Forces, additional money for research and development and procurement, and, indeed, it was their testimony that laid the solid foundation on which we come before the Senate today, proudly, with a bill, for the first time in 15 years, increasing defense spending. 
   I yield the floor at this time to my distinguished colleague.

   The House of Representatives sent a strong signal which I hope, within the next 30 minutes, will likewise be sent by the Senate. That signal went worldwide to the men and women of the Armed Forces, many of whom are serving in harm's way to defend the very flag to which we pledged our allegiance today. That vote was 375 to 45. I urge all Senators to give, likewise, support to this bill.

We consulted on this, and I am hopeful that he will consider a follow-on hearing, because as I look over tomorrow's agenda, given the time we have, it is my view that we will need a subsequent hearing on this.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I agree that we will look at the policy issues involved. At the moment, we need to have a record before the Senate on the absolutely vital nature of this range to the very safety of individual service persons, primarily those flying aircraft, but in every respect those in the Marine Corps doing amphibious work. 
   Mr. President, we cannot send, as the Senator from Oklahoma said, these individuals into harm's way without adequate training. We are doing that with the next battle group, as you pointed out. 
   So I think we should advise the Senate of the hearing tomorrow, the importance of that, the subsequent hearing, maybe at the subcommittee level, depending on further readiness aspects, and then the full committee on a policy issue.

   Mr. WARNER. I am sure you mentioned that across the board the uniformed side of the Department of Defense stands foursquare with the comments that you have made today. I have had consultations, as you have had, with the Chief of Naval Operations, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Shelton, the Chairman, and others, on this issue. 
   This is an issue that I have had considerable familiarity with for many years--when I was the Under Secretary and Secretary of the Navy in 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, and 1972. We had recurring problems of this nature down at Vieques. We constantly worked with the political structure at that time to resolve the problems. 
   But I think you are absolutely correct. At the moment, we have to regain control of this range for training purposes. I hope the commission--the several officers looking at this--will come forward with a program that will indicate to the Puerto Ricans we want not to be offensive to the people of Puerto Rico but to indicate the need for this area and, hopefully, to have some program by which we can meet the desires of all parties to work it out in some way. 
   At this moment, I am not prepared to indicate what the workout should be. I want to study the report of this commission. The Senator from Oklahoma and I should have private consultation with the Secretary of Defense and others. But let's see what we can do to meet the requirements of all parties involved but focusing on the essential nature of this range to America's readiness of its Naval and Marine Corps forces and embarking periodically to trouble spots in the world from the East Coast. 
   I thank the Senator.

   However, I observed our distinguished colleague from New Mexico in the Chamber. It was my understanding he desired to lead off the comments on this bill tonight since the bill incorporates a very important provision which was sponsored by Senator DOMENICI, Senator MURKOWSKI, and Senator KYL. Seeing Senator DOMENICI I yield the floor to him.

Of course, the Senator is aware that the Armed Services Committee oversees about 70 percent of the budget of the Department of Energy, so this is a very logical piece of legislation on which to put the important provision. And, of course, you and I worked together on it.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have had the real privilege of working with Senator DOMENICI on this particular amendment from its inception. Together with Senators MURKOWSKI and KYL, we crafted this very carefully. 
   The original concept was adopted by the Senate in the consideration of the intelligence bill. We then incorporated it in our bill, and we worked it with the House. I will go into further details. 
   Throughout, Senator DOMENICI has been really the leader of this effort. The Senate owes Senator DOMENICI a deep debt of gratitude for his perseverance on this provision. I am sure that America will recognize that service because it is in the best interests of the country. It was not motivated by politics. It was crafted carefully on the report of our distinguished colleague, Senator Rudman, who, of course, is one of the principal advisors to the President on intelligence and other matters. He was selected by the President to do this report. So we thank you, I say to the Senator. 
   Last night, Senator DOMENICI took the initiative of going down to see the President. I was privileged to accompany him and join in that meeting. We were going to have a meeting for, I suppose, 20 minutes or so. The President had just arrived. He still had a little mud on his boots from visiting a flood area and was in his clothes from the trip, his casual clothes. He was preparing his address to the United Nations. 
   But he stopped to take the time to carefully evaluate the concern of the Senator from New Mexico, and a meeting of 20 minutes lasted well over an hour on this and other subjects. But primarily he has a grasp of the issues. He asked specific questions. And the Senator from New Mexico, together with his able staff member, Alex Flint, who was also there with us, responded. 
   The Senator from New Mexico talked to one question tonight. But I wanted to raise the second question and put it in the RECORD. 
   He will recall the concern he had about the split provision and where it was. I went back, researched, and found in our record a letter dated July 29 from Jacob Lew, Director of the Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget. Mr. Lew wrote me the following: 
   I understand that Representative Spence has proposed an amendment for the FY 2000 defense authorization bill conference concerning the creation of a National Nuclear Security Administration at the Department of Energy. The Administration strongly opposes this language because it does not provide sufficient authority to the Secretary of Energy to assure proper policy development for, and oversight of, the new organization at the Department of Energy. The language jeopardizes the creation of sound counterintelligence, intelligence, and security efforts, and environmental, safety, and health compliance activities at the new organization. If this legislation were presented to the President, his senior advisors would recommend that it be vetoed.  
   We carefully tried to take into consideration Mr. Lew's concerns. We drafted that provision for that specific reason. So we were trying to follow the directions of the Director of Budget.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this evening we consider the conference report to accompany S. 1059, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2000. 
   I am pleased to report for the first time in 15 years--I want to repeat that and let it sink in, 15 years--the defense budget before the Senate represents a real increase above the normal allowance we make for inflation. This is above inflation for defense spending. 
   I rejoice in that as all members of our committee do. I am hopeful that all Members of the Senate, likewise, do. We authorize $288.8 billion in defense funding for next year, which is $8.3 billion above the President's budget request, and a 4.4-percent real increase in spending from last year. 
   I acknowledge the roles particularly of the Members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who appeared before the Armed Services Committee on two occasions. We have a longstanding tradition in our committee that when these individuals are confirmed before our committee, we obtain from them a commitment that at any time the committee desires to receive their personal, professional, military opinion on matters, and those issues could be contrary to the policies of the administration which they proudly serve, they will be received. 
   These individuals testified to the needs of their respective services which were over and above the dollar figures, the budget allocations set by OMB and, indeed, the administration. That gave the foundation of evidence that enabled Members, first in committee, and then before this body, in passing the bill to get the increased sums I have just referenced--$8.3 billion above the President's budget request. 
   The President himself this year took an initiative to get additional defense spending. To the credit of our former colleague, Senator Cohen, he, likewise, was very supportive of the President and took the initiative that led to the President increasing the defense budget. However, our committee was of the opinion, again, based largely on the testimony of the Joint Chiefs, that we needed dollars above the President's figure and we obtained them. 
   First, a quick review of the precarious international situation. Remember, much of the budget consideration started with the problems in Bosnia, the problems with reference to Kosovo. All during that timeframe, the committee was holding hearings and working on its budgets. Most recently, the crisis in East Timor. Incidentally, in consultation with the President, I indicated I supported the action of sending U.S. troops as a part of the security force under the U.S. auspices to save the people of East Timor. 
   But I mention this is a very troubled world. It is a far different one than when I first came to the Senate 21 years ago, when it was a bipolar world dominated by the Soviet Union, at that time, and the United States as the two superpowers. We didn't realize the degree of stability we had during that period of the two superpowers in a bipolar world, but we appreciate it in today's world where we see so many ethnic, religious, and racial tensions which have now come to the forefront and have exploded into strife in various areas of the world. Russia evolved from that sort of crisis. But it does not remain, of course, as a superpower. 
   Many nations, therefore, and the United Nations, have turned to the United States as the sole remaining superpower to solve new types of conflicts and tensions around the world. We are called upon to be--to use a phrase which I dislike, but it is well ingrained in the media--the world's policeman. We are not the world's policeman. Our President--in my judgment too many times, but nevertheless by and large I have supported him on most of the occasions, such as East Timor--has directed our Armed Forces beyond our shores more times than any President in the history of the United States of America. All this to say that is justification for the additional defense spending, justification for the very significant sum of money embraced in this bill. 
   It is fascinating to pause and go back and examine just what has transpired in a very brief period of time in our history. We face and bear these new developments with a force that is overstretched around the world and operating on a shoestring. Over the past decade, our military manpower has been reduced by one-third, from 2.2 million men and women in uniform to now 1.4 million in uniform. At the same time, during that decade, those very young, magnificently trained, dedicated, committed young men and women were involved in 50 military operations worldwide. At the same time that we came down in force structure, up rose the number of occasions in which the Commander in Chief--successively, three Commanders in Chief--have deployed them throughout the world. 
   By comparison, let's look at another chapter of history. From the end of the war in Vietnam, 1975, until 1989, U.S. military forces were engaged in only 20 military operations. What a sharp contrast, and it is reflected by the ever-increasing threat from weapons of mass destruction; that is, weapons composed of fissile material, biological material, and chemical materials. 
   All of the ethnic and religious and racial tensions that are breaking out all over the world--that is the reason the President has had to send for our troops to meet these crises, but troops which are diminishing overall in numbers. It is critical the funding and the authorities contained in this conference report be quickly enacted into law so we can send a very clear message--we, the Congress of the United States--send a very clear message to our troops: We are behind you. We recognize that you are stretched. We recognize the hardships on your families. We recognize the risks you are taking. And we, the Congress, have responded by increasing the defense budget, by increasing the money for your salaries, increasing the money so that your salaries can begin to move up--and I carefully say move up--towards salaries commensurate with those in the private sector. 
   A sergeant in our military today with, say, 4 or 5 years of service and training in a specialty can command a much higher salary in the private sector. How well we know that because they are not staying. Our retention of those well-trained people is at levels below the needs of the military. That is why, sergeant, we are raising your salary. That is why, captain, major, we are raising your salary. Because we know you are at that juncture in your career where you have to make a decision for yourself--and your family, in most cases--as to whether to stay at this current salary or go into the private sector where you can get a 10, 15, 20, 30, 100 percent increase in salary. We recognize your commitment to your country, your selflessness to serve your Nation, and joined with your family, we give you this recognition in this bill of a very significant pay raise, together with certain retirement benefits which more nearly meet your long-term projected goals. 
   This is personnel reform. I thank Senator LOTT, who initiated correspondence with the President of the United States just as soon as this session of the Congress began and pointed out to the President the need for certain personnel reforms. In weeks thereafter, he was joined by other Senators--Mr. MCCAIN, Mr. ROBERTS--and the committee, in every respect that we could, followed the goals those three individuals laid down in devising this pay and benefits and retirement bill. 
   The result of this conference report is to aggressively close the gap between military and private sector wages by providing a 4.8-percent pay  raise and ensuring military personnel will be compensated more equitably. We did not get it all the way up to where they can draw a line equal to the private sector, but we came a long way. 
   The military retirement system will be reformed by 
   providing military personnel with a choice. They will be allowed to choose to revert to the previous military retirement system or accept a $30,000 bonus and remain under the Redux system. This may not be clear to all those who are not familiar with it, but I assure you this retirement system was derived by our committee and legislated by the Senate as a whole and adopted by the conference after the closest consultation with the senior uniformed personnel, as well as all grades and ranks, to make sure we got it right this time. I am pleased to give my colleagues that assurance. We did get it right. 
   Military members will also be given the opportunity to participate in the Federal Thrift Savings Program; again, an incentive for them to remain in the military. 
   During the course of our review, the committee found the single most frequent reason departing service members cite is that of family separation, occasioned most often by the back-to-back deployments of the uniformed member who has family, be it a male or a female, to the various parts of the world to meet the requirements of 50 deployments in this past decade. That puts a strain on families. For us, those who have the relative enjoyment of being with our families at all times, it is hard to understand. You are given orders: In 72 hours you are going to be aboard that plane or that ship and you have to leave your family and go abroad for, most often, an indefinite period of time. 
   Let every young wife and let every child put themselves in the place of a military family where your father, or, indeed, your mother as the case may be, comes home and says: My orders read I must leave in 72 hours and I am not sure when I will be back. That is a tough lifestyle. But these young people are accepting it. I hope as a consequence of this bill, greater numbers will elect to retain their current positions and continue to advance and serve this country in their expertise. 
   In addition to enhancing the quality of life for military personnel, this bill focuses on providing our Armed Forces the tools they need to meet their commitments worldwide. For example, this year the bill provides for $1.5 billion increased funding above the President's request for military readiness. This includes an additional $939 million to reduce equipment and infrastructure maintenance backlogs, $179 million for ammunition, and $112 million for service training centers. 
   The conference report also stresses the problem of aging infrastructure by fully funding $8.5 billion in military construction projects, which is $3 billion above the administration's request. Much of this additional funding is targeted for housing and other projects that will enhance the quality of life of the men and women in the Armed Forces--just really meeting the basic requirements for a standard and a quality of life that they have earned many times over. 
   The conference report also contains additional information about the modernization and specific provisions covering modernization and research and development funding to provide the requirement capabilities for the future. We try to look out a decade. What are the likely adversaries we will have 10 years from now, and what will be their military capabilities in terms of hardware? What is it the United States needs, to begin now or to continue research and development on, so as to meet those threats 10 years out and meet and exceed the capabilities of the military equipment likely to be in the possession of our adversaries a decade hence. 
   The F-22 is a clear example of that. Senator STEVENS, with whom I was consulting earlier this evening, is doing the very best he can to restructure, with the House of Representatives, that program so we can continue to develop that vital aircraft. I say vital because this Nation has adopted so many, if not all, of its military plans for combating an enemy on the concept of air superiority. 
   We have had air superiority since the Korean war, in which I played a very modest role as a communications officer in the First Marine Air Wing. That was the last war--in Korea--in which we lost airmen as a consequence of aerial combat. Our distinguished colleague, Senator Glenn, who retired last year, was very much involved in that. That is the last time we experienced a threat in air-to-air combat from military aircraft of any great significance. 
   There has been an isolated case here and there. I know at one point in time several planes took off during the Kosovo operation, but they were quickly knocked down and sent back to their bases. The same thing happens in Iraq today. Periodically, Saddam Hussein sends them up. They make a U-turn and scatter back home very quickly. Again, the reason they scatter back home quickly is the reason Milosevic was unsuccessful in his aircraft: Because we have air superiority. That is in air-to-air. 
   Where we must stay abreast in air superiority is in what we call ground-to-air missiles. That is an entirely different threat and one that, every day that goes by, other nations are getting capability to shoot from the ground into the air, at almost all the altitudes at which our aircraft operate, very dangerous missiles to knock down our aircraft. It is for that reason we have to have the F-22 and other modern aircraft which provide for our men to maintain air superiority. 
   The bill authorizes $55.7 billion in procurement funding, $2.7 billion more than the President's request, and $36.3 billion in research and development spending, $1.9 billion more than the President's request. In considering where to add money, the conferees focused on those items contained in the service chiefs' list of critical unfunded requirements. 
   We did not just go straying off. We said to the chiefs: We recognize the President set a budget target within which you had to do your budgeting; but in the event the coequal branch of our Government--the legislative branch, the Congress--comes along and makes a determination that more money should be added to this budget, then where, in your professional judgment, should that money be added: In the Department of the Army? The Department of the Navy? The Department of the Air Force? That is what we used as guidance in adding moneys over and above the President's request to specific programs. 
   Our Nation is facing very real threats from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, international terrorism, information warfare, and drug trafficking. These are the dangerous threats that keep our Nation's leaders up at night and that require substantial investments to counter. To meet these challenges, the Emerging Threats Subcommittee--under the superb leadership of Senator ROBERTS--pursued a number of initiatives that were adopted by the conference including authorizing 17 new National Guard RAID Teams to respond to terrorist attacks in the United States; initiating better oversight of DOD's program to combat terrorism; and establishing an Information Assurance Initiative to strengthen DOD's information security program. 
   Now let me discuss the provisions in the bill that would reorganize the national security functions of the Department of Energy. A degree of controversy has arisen over these provisions and I wish to outline for my colleagues what the conference report does and, specifically, what it does not do. 
   The conference report includes a subtitle that would restructure the Department of Energy by consolidating all of its national security functions under a single, semi-autonomous agency within DOE, known as the National Nuclear Security Administration. This action represents the first significant reorganization of DOE in over 20 years and is in direct agreement with the June 1999 recommendation from the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, which called for the creation of ``a new semiautonomous Agency *.*.* whose Director will report directly to the Secretary of Energy.'' 
   There have been countless other reports that have questioned the management structure of the Department. But by far, the President's own Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board had the most damming assessment. This report  states that ``the Department of Energy, when faced with a profound public responsibility, has failed.'' The report goes on to say that ``the Department of Energy is a dysfunctional bureaucracy that has proven it is incapable of reforming itself''. 
   It has been asserted that the conference report could diminish the role of the States in DOE cleanup actions and blur the authority of the Secretary of Energy to manage the national security function of the Department. Let me state clearly that each of these accusations are wholly untrue. 
   Language to maintain environmental protection was included that is identical to the language in the amendment offered by Senators LEVIN, BINGAMAN, and others in the Senate. This amendment was included in the DOE reorganization provision which 
   overwhelmingly passed the Senate by a vote of 96-1 as part of the Intelligence Authorization Act. This vote on a very similar reform package as contained in the conference agreement demonstrated the clear intent of Congress that the current management structure at the Department was broken and was in need of reform. 
   With regard to the authority of the Secretary of Energy, the conferees were very careful and could not have been clearer in retaining the authorities of the Secretary necessary to manage, direct, and oversee the activities of the new Administration. I and most of the other conferees believe this new DOE organizational framework will dramatically streamline the management of our Nation's nuclear weapons labs, establish clear accountability, and ensure full compliance with the Secretary of Energy's direction and all applicable environmental laws. 
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, however, has indicated that this new organizational framework would make it ``impossible for any Secretary of Energy to run the Department.'' Let me say, with all due respect to my good friend Mr. Richardson, I disagree. I was a Secretary of a military department and know what is required to make an organization work. I believe that the organizational structure that is created in this conference report could be successfully managed by a strong Secretary of Energy--and he should step up to this challenge. 
   In conclusion, I want to thank all the members and staff of the conference committee for their hard work and cooperation. This bill sends a strong signal to our men and women in uniform and their families that Congress fully supports them as they perform their missions around the world with professionalism and dedication. Many organizations including The Military Coalition and The National Military and Veterans Alliance, two consortiums of nationally prominent military and veterans organizations representing millions of current and former members of the uniformed services, their families and survivors, strongly endorse enactment of this bill. 
   I am confident that enactment of this bill will enhance the quality of life for our service men and women and their families, strengthen the modernization and readiness of our forces and begin to address newly emerging threats to our security. I urge my colleagues to adopt the recommendations of the conference committee.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will allow me to make clear for the Record, while I addressed the President about the importance of the bill as a courtesy to him, I never tried to elicit that response. But I certainly left that meeting with the impression, No. 1, that the President has given a lot of study to the issues that my distinguished good friend and colleague, Senator LEVIN, has raised tonight. He is carefully briefed on it. His questions were very precise on it. 
   Senator DOMENICI and I provided responses which I hope were quite informative to the President. But I in no way wish to indicate that he likewise indicated what he would do. 
   I certainly have the impression from that meeting and from everything else I gained that there is not as much fervor down at the White House for a veto, and I am confident that Secretary Cohen likewise contributed his views to the President on this. I am confident he urged the President to sign. He is the principal Cabinet officer involved. 
   With regard to Secretary Richardson, he has always been, I think, well received by the Members up here who have listened to his overtures on this question. I spoke with him about 10 days ago in my office. I told him at that time precisely what the Senator from Michigan just said--that I thought, to the extent 
   there are ambiguities, together with valuable legal counsel--and I also mentioned this to the President last night--I am confident he can run this Department. If he has the desire and the commitment to do so, he can operate this Department. The Constitution provides for separate branches of Government. The President has the administration of the executive branch. He delegates certain responsibilities to his Cabinet officers. It was not the intention of the Congress to take away from the President's authority. 
   I am very pleased, if I may say to the President and to the Senator from  Michigan, that I learned tonight the Senator from Michigan will vote in favor of this bill. I was terribly concerned that at the time he couldn't sign the conference report. But he, too, has fought the good battle in terms of his views about this reauthorization. I take those to heart. 
   Let us look at this in a positive light--that this Secretary will take the reins and look at this statute. It challenges him to run a strong Department. It is my expectation that he will do it and that in a period of reasonable time he will have proven not only to his Department but to all of us in the executive branch and the legislative branch that this can be done. 
   Thank you, Mr. President, and my colleague, because I value our work and relationship. We came to the Senate together 21 years ago. We have been through many struggles. And for the foreseeable future we have certainly another year to work together to devise a bill.

   I would like to make one recommendation to my good friend from Michigan. You need a deputy director. I have Judith Ansley. If the Senator from Michigan had a magnificent deputy director like her to help him curtail the top hands--Les Brownlee and David Lyles--it would be great, and I would see to it that the Senator got a little money from the budget for that.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we have done our job. 
   I can't tell the Senator from Michigan the great respect that I have for him. I know how difficult this provision on the Energy reorganization has been. It is on our bill for valid reasons. We have somewhere between two-thirds and 70 percent of the funds that go into that Department under our overview. We do careful overview on the weapons program. 
   But the fact that the Senator from Michigan has announced tonight that he will support that bill is very important. I think it will be important to the President as he carefully deliberates such petitions as may be before him by the Secretary of Energy and others on this issue. 
   Mr. President, I think we have concluded. I thank the Chair and the staff of the Senate.

   Mr. WARNER. My distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, the chairman of our air/land subcommittee, is absolutely correct. Committee records were reviewed, and the conferees to the fiscal year 2000 National Defense Authorization Act did, in fact, agree to increase the EA-6B authorization by $25.0 million for the procurement of modified band 9/10 transmitters. An error in the printing process was made, and the Government Printing Office will be preparing an errata sheet to correct this error.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I pick up on the concluding note of my good friend, the ranking member of our committee. 
   We marked up the bill barely 30 days ago and pledged our allegiance to rule XVI. Now, the essence of what this debate is all about: Are we going to do a 180 and all run downhill? What is the public going to think of the Senate and how it conducts itself and how it observes its rules? That should be foremost in the mind of every Senator as that vote bell rings, hopefully, in but a few minutes, as this debate concludes. 
   As our distinguished chairman and ranking member have clearly said, our committee worked hard, not for a month, not for 2 months. I was subcommittee chairman of the subcommittee that did the initial draft of TEA 21. 
   It was a 2-year task, 2 years carefully going out amongst the 50 States and evaluating proposals of the various Governors, of the organizations that devote full time to America's transportation needs and they came forth with a variety of proposals. We worked very diligently to take all of that into consideration, and over a 2-year period we had many, many subcommittee hearings, and, indeed, hearings of the full committee, and crafted this legislation with the intent of seeking equity and fairness among the 50 States, of correcting what many of us viewed as an inequity between the donor States, of which mine was one, and the donee States. Therein was the most difficult battle. Two years' work stands on the brink of being disassembled on this vote. The precedent of rule XVI stands to be stripped down momentarily on this vote. 
   As my colleague from Montana stated, if this provision regarding the surplus is changed, what is next year? Is it the donee-donor fight? Does that become the next debate within the appropriations cycle? It was for the very reason this institution has regarded this legislation as law it should remain intact for 6 years. This is not a 1-year bill or a 2-year bill; this is a 6-year bill, a formula to remain in place to provide equity among the States for 6 years. Momentarily, the vote will be taken to make the first break, barely after 1 year of operation of this bill. 
   There is a tradition in this great body not to personalize anything, but I just happened to observe there were 70 Senators who sought the exact provision that is the subject of this amendment, and that was a 10-percent set-aside for Federal programs. Seventy Senators came to our committee with a wide range of programs they felt were essential for their States which would not be covered in the general disbursal of the balance of the 90 percent. How interesting, the State of New Jersey fought hard for the Intelligent Transportation Systems funds, ITS; the State of Alabama fought hard for new corridor programs and ARC, just two little footnotes. 
   I urge Senators to go back--we have it here in the correspondence--and have the staffs advise their Senators what they asked of the Environment  and Public Works Committee, and what was included in this bill in direct recognition of their needs, 70 colleagues. That is the reason for the creation of this provision. 
   Our chairman mentioned the House. The House appropriations bill, I say to the chairman, as he well knows, had a number of provisions in there which his counterpart, Congressman SHUSTER, recognized as legislation on an appropriations bill. He went to the floor of the House, and in 18 consecutive instances the House backed up their chairman and struck those provisions, one by one, from that bill. 
   I daresay, should this provision survive, regrettably, that same chairman will see in conference that it is removed. That is why I think it is incumbent on our body to likewise remove this legislation, and at the same time uphold the credibility of our action some 30 days ago and reaffirm rule XVI. This is equity. This is legislative process to achieve that equity. 
   We put in place a magnificent piece of legislation, accepted all across America. As I traveled my State this summer, I saw instance after instance of construction on our roads. I said to myself: There is the taxpayers' money coming back from the highway trust fund, going straight to the States, and now being used to improve our system. It is working. TEA 21 is working. That is why we are here today, to ask our colleagues to let it remain intact because it is serving the purpose for which this body adopted it but a year ago. 
   I yield the floor.

If you did not have this provision in there, these funds would flow precisely as this Chamber directed those funds to flow when they overwhelmingly adopted TEA 21. 
   I say to my good friend, it is clear as the light of this given day what is taking place.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WARNER. I understand the need to adequately address arts funding and commend the Chairman's leadership in securing $500,000 above last year's appropriations for our nation's museums and libraries. However, this is still $500,000 short of the House funding level to continue the great work done by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). 
   As the Chairman knows, federal funds play an important role in assuring that Americans have access to excellent museum services. 8,000 museums and 120,000 libraries throughout the country have benefited from Congressional support of IMLS. 
   IMLS programs affect a broad segment of Americans and not an elite few. It helps small, rural museums gain access to resources such as database technology development by the larger museums. IMLS improves public accessibility of museums, while allowing local communities to decide on the content and programs of their own museums. 
   Additional funding will allow IMLS to provide technological improvements, making museum and library collections available online and accessible to learners of all ages. 
   I ask you to urge the Senate conferees to recede to the House position on IMLS funding and support a relatively modest $500,000 increase in the IMLS budget so museums and libraries across the country will be able to extend their educational services, expand teacher training, preserve our cultural heritage for our posterity and increase access to valuable resources for America's children.

Following disposition of the Holbrooke nomination, the Senate will resume consideration of the Interior appropriations bill with amendments expected to be offered and debated. In addition, when the Senate receives the tax reconciliation conference report from the House of Representatives, it is expected that the Senate will begin consideration of that legislation.

   Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, I thank the Senate leadership with respect to this nomination. It has been a unique one for various reasons. The elements of that uniqueness are well known to my colleagues. I shall not speak in detail about the tradition of ``holds'' but I think much of the general public is somewhat perplexed about the procedures in the Senate. 
   There has been discussion as to the procedure on this nomination and the use of what is referred to as a ``hold.'' There is a diversity of views within this body on the use of a ``hold,'' but, in my judgment, it is an important and proper procedure utilized by Senators in conjunction with what I view as the balance of power established by the Constitution in the coequal branches of the Government: the executive branch, the power of nomination by the President, and the Senate and its power of advice and consent. 
   The use of the hold is an exercise of that balance of power between the two branches. In this instance, I thank the distinguished majority leader and, of course, the minority leader, and others who have worked to bring this nomination to this point where today the Senate will render its advice and consent on this very important nomination.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Maryland. He is quite accurate in his recitation of the rules of the Senate. This is by tradition. I suggest we not deal too much with what took place in the past on this nomination, but I felt that this RECORD this morning should reflect, for those who are following the nomination, my judgment with regard to the tradition of a Senator seeking a hold. 
   Again, it is part of that balance of power between the two branches. For example, Senator GRASSLEY, in his case, feels very strongly about the need to protect those individuals who are commonly referred to as whistleblowers. They should be protected. Senator GRASSLEY, after having talked with him many times, recognized the Holbrooke nomination is of importance, but he carefully evaluated his responsibility as one of those leaders in the Senate who have protected the rights of whistleblowers. That is behind us. 
   Many Senators have worked on this nomination. I express my appreciation again to the leadership and those Senators, particularly the Senator from Delaware. 
   The facts about this nominee are well known. I have known him personally for a number of years. I have watched his distinguished career, and in the course of the morning, I will add some facts. But I want to yield the floor momentarily to my colleague from Delaware. 
   The point is that my concern about this nomination and its timeliness is because of the fact that we now have in Kosovo a force under the NATO Command of General Clark, Operation Joint Guardian. While we had hoped that this military operation would have had a smooth operational history, in fact it has encountered many unforeseen problems, problems where our troops and the troops of other nations had to perform all types of diverse duties. Many of these young men and women who are courageously participating in this operation have had no formal training in the military with respect to many of the responsibilities they are now undertaking. 
   The United Nations, under a force known as United Nations Mission in Kosovo, referred to as UNMIK, has had a very slow start getting organized and into the field to perform duties that are currently being performed by the NATO military. 
   One of the reasons for working to accelerate the consideration of this nomination is that in knowing Mr. Holbrooke and his forcefulness and his background, he, I believe, is better qualified than anyone else I know of today to take on this important post and to accelerate the functions of the United Nations in this region. 
   The sooner they get in, the less risk to the men and women of the Armed Forces currently undertaking many missions which they are doing quite  well, despite the fact they have had little or no formalized training in operating civil, local governments in the village of Kosovo. Fortunately, this force is under the command of the NATO Commander, General Clark. General Clark and Ambassador Holbrooke have known each other for many years. They have worked together. They participated in the Dayton accords, for which Ambassador Holbrooke deserves great credit, and I will have further comment on that later. 
   Also, Ambassadors, when they report for their duties, may be fortunate to have a spouse who is quite interested in those duties and perform as a team. This is going to be an extraordinary husband and wife team of Richard Holbrooke and Kati Marton, his wife. She is a noted authoress. She has roots in central Europe. She is a beautifully educated and cultured woman. I have had the privilege of knowing her for a number of years. They will be an extraordinary team in this important post. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD a biography of Richard Holbrooke.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today will enact the Water Resources Development Act of 1999. This important legislation continues the Corps of Engineers civil works critical mission to provide flood control, hurricane protection, river and harbor navigation improvements, environmental restoration of our nation's waterways and other water resource infrastructure improvements. 
   Since 1986 when the Congress and the Executive Branch reach agreement on landmark cost-sharing principles that apply to the preparation and construction of these projects, the Congress has endeavored to enact this reauthorization bill on a two-year cycle. 
   As the former Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, the Congress enacted a water resources reauthorization bill in 1996. Regrettably, due to the complexities involving a project to provide flood protection for the Sacramento, California area, the House and Senate were unable to resolve the differences concerning this project in 1998. 
   Today, the conference report before the Senate includes those projects in last year's bill along with other construction projects that the Corps of Engineers has reviewed and judged to be in the national interest. Through a comprehensive process to study and analyze the scope of individual projects, the Chief of the Corps of Engineers has found the 45 authorizations for new construction projects to be technically sound, economically justified and environmentally acceptable. 
   Mr. President, this simply means that the Federal taxpayer will receive a higher return on the economic benefits resulting from construction of these projects compared to the individual construction costs. Also, for these projects, a state or local government will provide from 35 percent to 50 percent of the costs of construction. 
   The Corps civil works program provides significant protection to lives and property from flooding and coastal storms. The maintenance of our river and harbor navigation channels are critical for us to maintain a competitive edge in a ``one-world'' economic market. 
   The value of water resource projects is well-documented. In 1997, Corps flood control projects prevented approximately $45.2 billion in damages. The Corps continues to support the navigation channel deepening projects so that the larger class of cargo ships and super coal colliers can call on our commercial water ports. The value of commerce on these waterways totaled over $600 billion in 1997, generating approximately 16 million jobs. 
   Mr. President, the conference report also contains very important provisions to strengthen and expand the Corps new focus on environmental restoration of our nation's waterways. We have established a new program, known as ``Challenge 21'', which provides the Corps with the direction to work with local communities to developed non-structural flood control projects. This is an initiative that will hopefully produce less-costly flood control options. This program will be important to financially-strapped communities who may not be able to afford to provide the 35 percent local costs for a traditional flood control project. Also, this program will foster the preservation of sensitive ecosystems that provide vital flood protection in the floodplain. 
   Challenge 21 also has the potential to produce significant savings in the reduction of flood damages and Federal flood damage assistance costs. 
   Mr. President, since the enactment of the 1986 water resources bill which established cost-sharing requirements for the construction of water projects, I have been committed to applying these requirements to projects authorized in subsequent bills. I applaud my Senate colleagues for enacting Senate legislation that adhere to these rules. The cost-sharing requirements have been successful in leveraging non-Federal funds and they have ensured that only those projects with the greatest merit, economic benefit and local support move forward. 
   It was my view, along with Chairman CHAFEE and the Ranking member, Senator BAUCUS, that we must insist on the cost-sharing requirement for projects authorized in this bill. I regret, however, that the conference report does not apply the cost-sharing principles in all cases. 
   I would just ask my House and Senate colleagues to remember the 10-year stalemate that existed between the Congress and the Executive Branch from 1975 to 1986. At that time no water resource projects moved forward because the Executive Branch insisted on some level financial contribution from those who would benefit from these projects. By 1986, the Congress and the Administration reached agreement on a fair allocation of costs and since that time there has been an orderly process for planning, designing and constructing water resource projects. 
   We must not abandon cost-sharing rules, or else there is the very real possibility of again triggering a halt to Federal funding for these important projects. I will continue to work to follow the requirements of the 1986 bill and stand ready to work with my colleagues on this issue. 
   Mr. President, this legislation, which was three years in the making, involved a great deal of staff time and commitment. I want to express my appreciation to the staff of the Environment and Public Works Committee--Jimmie Powell, the Staff Director, Dan Delich, Abigail Kinnison, Chelsea Henderson, Jo-Ellen Darcy, Ellen Stein and Peter Washburn for all of their efforts. Also, the professional expertise of the Corps of Engineers was invaluable. I particularly want to thank Larry Prather, Gary Campbell and the many dedicated professionals at the Corps of Engineers Headquarters for their technical evaluation of the many projects that came before the Committee for consideration. 
   Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the conference report.

   Mr. WARNER. I join my colleague in this effort. Mr. President, the construction funding request by the National Park Service budget would help protect and expand the facility to provide a better legacy for our children. Educational programs for all children, especially the children of Virginia, will serve as a living reminder of the prejudice that took place in our country at the turn of the century, and Maggie Walker's life will provide a strong role model for present and future generations seeking to overcome adversity. 
   Maggie Walker urged women to work together to advance their place in society. She said, ``If our women want to avoid the traps and snares of life, they must band themselves together, organize, acknowledge leadership, *.*.* and work *.*.* for themselves.'' Maggie Walker also stressed the empowerment of minorities in the business field. She recognized the ``need of a savings bank, chartered, officered, and run by the men and women of this [community] *.*.* Let us have a bank that will take the nickels and turn them into dollars.'' The Maggie Walker House symbolizes the persistence of an individual in the face of prejudice. For citizens in Richmond, the life of Ms. Walker, and her National Historic Site, are a daily inspiration. 
   I hope the construction money allotted to the Maggie Walker National Historical Site in the National Park budget and approved by the President will be provided. I thank my colleagues for considering this matter, and I'd appreciate hearing the managers' views on this project.

   Mr. WARNER. I support the view of my colleague. We wish to briefly review the issue for the Managers and explain why we believe that an injustice has been done to the City of Virginia Beach. 
   For past 25 years, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in conjunction with the City, has been working to complete the Sandbridge Beach Erosion Control and Hurricane Protection Project, one of the region's highest priorities. Early in 1998, several Nor'easters struck the east coast and literally demolished Sandbridge Beach, which is a very important barrier island that provides protection for the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge. Forty homes were lost to the storms, and more than 300,000 cubic yards of protective beach sand were washed away. As a result, there was an immediate, critical need to replenish the beach. Although the Corps has the responsibility of annual renourishment of Sandbridge, as it is a federally-authorized project, the City advanced the money to replenish the beach because it was in a state of emergency. 
   I wish to emphasize that point. Instead of waiting for the Congress to appropriate the funds to the Corps, the City spent $8.1 million of its own money for the Sandbridge Beach Renourishment, which is an option Congress allowed the City under the Water Resources Development Act. 
   The Minerals Management Service (MMS) became involved when the Corps selected a location to mine the sand for Virginia Beach. The location selected, the bottom of the ocean three miles off the coast, is an area legally designated as the ``outer continental shelf.'' Pursuant to the 1994 amendments to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OSC), the MMS negotiates agreements for the right to extract minerals from the outer continental shelf. Under this authority, the MMS made a decision, which we believe to be both unfair and poor policy, to charge the City of Virginia Beach for the sand mined. 
   The MMS has the authority to change its decision, and I believe this would be the right thing to do. First, with respect to the discretion of the MMS, the MMS's own Proposed Policy and Guidelines state that: 
   The new law provides that the Secretary may assess a fee. This affords discretion not to assess a fee on a case-specific basis.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WARNER. Yes, there are. The MMS waived the fee for two other requests for use of OCS sand for shore protection projects sponsored by the corps. One was in Duval County, FL, and the other in Myrtle Beach, SC. For these two cases, the MMS ruled that project-related activities had progressed to the point that an ``assessment of a fee for the OCS sand resources could have delayed or prevented project construction''. The MMS therefore determined that waiving the fee would be in the best interest of the public in those two cases. In the case of Sandbridge Beach, we believe that it was in the best interest of the public for the MMS to waive the fee as it not only is a Congressionally authorized project, but it also protects a federally owned wildlife refuge, the Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge.

   Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from Washington and the Senator from West Virginia. Senator Warner and I want to reemphasize that this is a situation of basic fairness, and action is needed to correct an injustice imposed by the federal government. We ask that if funds become available during the House-Senate Conference, that the Managers provide $198,000 to reimburse the City of Virginia Beach. We thank our colleagues.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to thank our distinguished colleague, together with Senators DOMENICI and MURKOWSKI and their respective staffs. Indeed, the staff of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the House Armed Services Committee all collaborated to try to make this a constructive, constitutional, and balanced approach. 
   But if I could ask the Senator a question, so those persons who have not had the opportunity to follow as closely as he the progress of this legislation, does the Senator think the product created by the House-Senate conference represents a piece of legislation that is stronger, in terms of creating this concept of a separate entity within the DOD, than was the bill passed by the Senate at 93-1?

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, to use an old naval phrase, ``with all deliberate speed.'' 
   I know the Senator's concern about the insertion of a date in March with regard to the final achievement by, presumably, the current Secretary; if Secretary Richardson will carry this through. Certain sections, however, of this legislation are quite clear that he should start the day after the President, hopefully, affixes his signature to this piece of legislation. 
   It is a phasing process. We looked at the date of March, and it should not, in my judgment, be interpreted as any lack of resolve by the Congress. To the contrary, it is a recognition that a major reorganization of this proportion will require a period of time within which to achieve it. 
   The opposite side of the argument of those who say we should not have had that date would be, if you did not put in a recognition that it would take time, then presumably 1 week after the President affixes his signature, we could haul the Secretary of Energy up here and say: You haven't achieved this in 1 week's time, 2 week's time or 30 days' time. 
   We had to strike a balance. I know that has been of great concern to my distinguished colleague.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, certainly it is to be viewed the time within which to be completed. Given the certain constructive steps the current Secretary, Secretary Richardson, has taken, I presume he will have achieved the reorganization in a time shorter than that. But I must say to my colleague, you cannot satisfy everybody. 
   This is my 21st year on the Armed Services Committee, and as we file tonight the signatures of those members of the respective committees, House and Senate, who have approved the conference report, it is my understanding that no Democrat member of the Armed Services Committee in the Senate will be signatory. That comes as a personal disappointment to me as chairman in my first year. 
   I met with the committee this afternoon. There was representation of probably seven or eight members on the Democrat side. The ranking member let me know beforehand of his concern, and I understood him throughout. We tried as best we could to work with the minority on our committee on this issue, as we do all issues. It is a matter of deep regret that we were not able to reconcile the differences that apparently were very significant between the Democrat approach to this and the Republican majority approach. 
   I will accept the consequences. I am the captain of this ship now, and I accept full accountability. I do note, however, that my understanding is, as of this hour, most, if not all, the Democrat Members of the House have signed, of course, the identical conference report.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, one last observation, if the Senator will remain for a moment, and that is, I think we should acknowledge in this RECORD tonight the work of the Intelligence Committee, the Governmental Affairs Committee, the Energy Committee, and the Armed Services Committee. There were four committees that worked diligently. 
   Our distinguished majority leader would have periodic meetings of the chairmen, and others such as yourself, who had an interest. Senator DOMENICI attended all of those meetings. On this side of the aisle, from our top leadership down through the committee chairmen and others, we worked together as a team to address this national, if not international, crisis of the leakage of information from these magnificent laboratories. Our national security is absolutely dependent on their work product and the security of that work product today and tomorrow and for the indefinite future. 
   I thank all chairmen. They had a number of hearings. My estimate is that we in the Senate, among the four committees, must have had 25 hearings on this subject.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. I also observe, yes, but he was very objective about the seriousness of this problem. Throughout his deliberations, whether in Senator LOTT's office or the hearings or in our consultations together, he was always very objective, and he put national interests first at every step. So the Senator is correct. 
   I conclude with one sentence to my friend. I do not think if we recalled William Shakespeare from the grave that this provision on reorganization could have been written on the Department of Energy to satisfy everyone. That is the reason I have such deep regret about my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Many times we consulted them right down to the word and the comma and the like. We just did the very best we could, and I am proud of the work our committee did. I pay tribute to the respective staffs and my colleagues who worked on it. 
   We are fully accountable for the effectiveness, and we, as a committee, perhaps with other committees, will hold a hearing very early next fall to determine the progress, assuming this is signed, within a period of, say, 2 months after the President's signature is affixed. 
   I thank my distinguished colleague. 
   Mr. President, I want to make a few more comments regarding the conference of the House and the Senate. Quite apart from the DOE provision, we are very pleased that we made major strides in this legislation on behalf of the men and women of the U.S. military. 
   We have an authorized funding level of $288.8 billion, which is $8.3 billion above the President's budget request. And that is in real terms. This is the first time in 13 years that there has been a real--I repeat--real increase in the defense budget. 
   Our distinguished Presiding Officer is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He actively participated in structuring this piece of legislation. We have approved a 4.8-percent pay raise for military personnel, reform of the military pay tables, and annual military pay raises 0.5 percent above the annual increases in the Employment Cost Index. 
   We provide military members with a wider choice on their retirement system. We allowed both Active and Reserve component military personnel to participate in thrift savings. There is nothing more important. Indeed, the tax legislation just passed --always, certainly, on this side of the aisle we are trying to seek ways to increase savings in our United States. I am pleased now we give wider opportunity to the men and women of the Armed Forces. 
   Strategic forces: We authorize a net increase of $400 million for ballistic missile defense, a program that finally has achieved recognition under our distinguished colleague, Senator COCHRAN of Mississippi, in passing here a week ago, the important legislation, which the President has now signed, to take another step forward in protecting America against the likelihood that possibly some accidental firing or limited attack could be launched against this country. We have a long way to go, but through the leadership of Senator COCHRAN, and others, we have finally forged, I think, another, should we say, 10 yards on this lengthy ball field. 
   We authorize an increase of $212 million for the Patriot PAC-3 system, again missile defense. 
   Seapower authorized a $1 billion increase to the procurement budget request of $18 billion and a $251 million increase to the research, development, test, and evaluation budget request of $3.9 billion for the Seapower Subcommittee under the chairmanship of Senator SNOWE. 
   Very able work was done on behalf of Senator SNOWE and the ranking member, Senator KENNEDY, for the Navy and the Marine Corps and a limited number of Air Force programs under their jurisdiction. 
   We extended the multiyear procurement authority for the DDG-51 procurement and authorized advance procurement and advance construction for the LHD-8. We authorize construction of three DDG-51 Arleigh Burke class destroyers, two LPD-17 San Antonio class amphibious ships, and one ADC(X), the first of a class of auxiliary refrigeration and ammunition supply ships. 
   We authorize advance procurement for 2 SSN-774 Virginia class attack submarines, and $750 million for the CVN-77, the last of the Nimitz class aircraft carriers currently in planning. We will, however, go on with another class of carriers, and that is the subject of research and development. 
   In the readiness, we increase funding for military readiness by $1.5 billion. It provides for the protection of the military's access to essential frequency spectrum. That was a highly contested issue in our legislation. The private sector had concerns that the Pentagon would absorb a proportion of the spectrum beyond its needs. But in consultation with Congressman BLILEY, the  chairman of the House committee with jurisdiction, Senator MCCAIN, a distinguished member of our committee, as well 
   as chairman here of the Commerce Committee, we reached this compromise, which I hope all will find satisfactory. 
   In the Airland area, we had an additional $1.5 billion for critical procurement requirements and an additional $400 million for research and development activities above the President's request. We fully authorized the development and procurement budget request for the F-22 Raptor. 
   It is with some regret that the House did not adequately fund that program, in my judgment. That is a subject that is actively before the two Appropriations Committees. But both the House and the Senate authorizing committees fully funded that program. 
   Lastly, upon assuming the chairmanship of this committee from my distinguished predecessor, Senator THURMOND, I decided to establish a new subcommittee entitled ``Emerging Threats.'' That committee, under the great leadership of Senator ROBERTS, moved out, and here are some of the initiatives taken by that subcommittee. 
   We authorize and fully fund 17 new National Guard Rapid Assessment and Initial Detection--commonly known as RAID--Teams to respond to terrorist attacks in the United States--12 more than the administration request. 
   It was my judgment, and Senator ROBERTS' and the members of the committee, that this is the greatest threat poised at the United States today--the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, whether they be biological, chemical, or possibly the incorporation of some crude weapon involving fissionable material. We have to move out on that. Progress was made by this new subcommittee. 
   Further, we required the department to establish specific budget reporting procedures for its Combating Terrorism Program. This will give the program the focus and visibility it deserves while providing Congress with the information it requires to conduct thorough oversight of the department's efforts to combat the threat of terrorist attack both inside and outside the United States. 
   We authorize $475 million for the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program to accelerate the disarmament of the former Soviet Union--now Russia--strategic offensive arms that always threaten the United States. That was commonly referred to as the Nunn-Lugar program for a number of years. 
   We establish an Information Assurance Initiative to strengthen DOD's information assurance program and provide for an additional $150 million to the administration's request for information assurances programs, projects, and activities. 
   In cyberspace today, with the rapid research and development--indeed, achievement--of many technical initiatives, the whole area of cyberspace is threatened by an ever-growing number of sources of invasion and compromise, and indeed, disabling of the systems themselves. 
   I thank my colleagues for indulging me to speak to this important piece of legislation which will be filed tonight in the House and, of course, automatically in the Senate. 
   I shall now inquire of our staff as to the desire of other Members to speak, as well as the wrap up for the evening.

   Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator very much for his kind comments. But the Senator has brought to mind the fact that our majority leader, Senator LOTT, made a decision to support our committee in putting through S. 4, I think the earliest bill in the Senate, which brought about the pay raises and retirement adjustments, which, hopefully, will increase our readiness by encouraging more young men and women to join the Armed Forces--our recruiting having fallen off--and retaining the skilled personnel that we now have. 
   Also, it was the Joint Chiefs of Staff that on two occasions came before our committee--in September of last year and again in January of this year--and unequivocally stated, in their best professional judgment, the need for additional dollars, and how best those funds could be expended by the Congress, and putting particular emphasis on the pay and allowances, which is always the top priority of the Chiefs for their men and women of the Armed Forces. 
   I thank my colleague.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to pay tribute to a great patriot, soldier, and father, Colonel Charles W. Alsup. After nearly 28 years of dedicated service around the world, Colonel Alsup will retire from the United States Army on September 30, 1999. Colonel Alsup was born in Birmingham, Alabama. He enlisted in the Army in 1971 as a private and was later commissioned as a Military Intelligence Second Lieutenant upon completion of the Infantry Officer Candidate School at Fort Benning, Georgia. 
   Throughout his military career, Colonel Alsup distinguished himself as a true professional and an exceptional leader. His initial assignments included: a tour with 8th Special Forces Group, Fort Gulick, Panama; duties as a counterintelligence special agent and staff officer with the 902th Military Intelligence Group, Fort Meade, MD; and intelligence officer, 4th Battalion, 69th Armor Regiment, 8th Infantry Division in Mainz, Germany during the height of the Cold War. He successfully commanded at the company, battalion, and brigade levels, culminating with the prestigious 501st Military Intelligence Brigade, Yongsan, Korea. 
   Colonel Alsup also excelled at a variety of teaching and staff officer positions, including Reserve Officer Training Corps duty at the University of Alabama; Staff Group Leader, Combined Arms and services Staff School, Fort Leavenworth; Director of Intelligence, 24th Infantry Division, Fort Stewart, GA; Director of Intelligence, Eight U.S. Army, Yongsan, Korea; and duty on the Army Staff in Legislative Liaison and the Directorate for Operations and Plans. 
   Colonel Alsup's final assignment as Assistant Director of Intelligence for the Joint Staff, Washington, DC, showcased his superior grasp of national intelligence issues, his impressive management skills, and his ability to perform under pressure. Colonel Alsup provided unparalleled intelligence support to the senior leadership of the Executive and Legislative Branches, contributing significantly to their understanding of national level crisis and contingencies. His positive impact on the Joint Staff, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the intelligence community will be felt for years to come. 
   Colonel Alsup is a distinguished graduate of the U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, Fort Leavenworth and the Naval War College, Newport, Rhode Island. His awards and decorations include the Defense Superior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, the Meritorious Service Medal with Four Oak Leaf Clusters, the Army Commendation Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters, the Special Forces Tab, the Senior Parachutist Badge, and the Ranger Tab. 
   Through his distinctive accomplishments, Colonel Charles W. Alsup culminates a distinguished career in the service of his country and reflects great credit upon himself, the United States Army, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Department of Defense. 
   I wish every success to Colonel Alsup as he finishes his truly remarkable military career and thank him for a job exceedingly well done.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the retirement of Robert Tobias, President of the National Treasury Employees Union. I would like to take a moment to recognize the hard work and accomplishments of Mr. Tobias who, during a career with the NTEU of 31 years, has served as a prominent advocate for the over 155,000 federal employee members of the Union. 
   Under Bob's leadership, the NTEU has grown to become the nation's largest independent federal employees union, representing workers from 18 government agencies. Bob is one of the foremost authorities on federal employee issues and has been a vital resource to those of us who work on Capitol Hill, to the agencies he represents and throughout the federal government. Bob is highly respected among labor relations specialists as well. He has been instrumental in developing and enacting major legislation effecting federal employees including, creation and implementation of the Federal Employees Retirement System, pay parity issues, and he served as a member of the bipartisan National Commission Restructuring the IRS whose work was the basis for the comprehensive IRS reform legislation passed in the 105th Congress. 
   Furthermore, Bob has been successful in numerous landmark legal battles impacting employee rights in court and before various federal oversight bodies, such as the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Federal Labor Relations Authority and the Office of Personnel Management. 
   Again, I commend Mr. Tobias for his invaluable work on behalf of federal  employees, and I wish continued success for Mr. Tobias in his future endeavors.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution that passed the United States Senate by unanimous consent each of the last two years. I am pleased to join Senator MURRAY in establishing October 21, 1999, as the Day of National Concern About Young People and Gun Violence.  
   On April 20, 1999, two teenagers wearing long black trench coats over fatigues began shooting their fellow classmates and faculty at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. In the end, 15 people died and many others were injured, in the bloodiest school shooting in America's history. Unfortunately, the atrocity that occurred in Littleton, Colorado, is not an isolated incident. Before the shooting in Columbine High School, recent school shootings occurred in Pearl, Mississippi; West Paducah, Kentucky; Jonesboro, Arkansas; and Springfield, Oregon. After Littleton, six students were shot in Conyers, Georgia, by one of their fellow students. 
   The problem of young people and gun violence expands beyond school shootings. Every day in the United States, 14 children under the age of 19 are killed with guns, and in 1994, approximately 70 percent of murder victims aged 15 to 17 were killed with a handgun. America has lost thousands of children in what has become the all-too-common violence of drive-by shootings, drug wars and other crimes, as well as in self-inflicted and unintentional shootings. 
   In the aftermath of these tragedies, we all find ourselves looking for answers. While there is no simple solution as to how to stop youth violence, a Minnesota homemaker, Mary Lewis Grow, developed the idea of a Day of National Concern About Young People and Gun Violence. I believe this idea is a step in the right direction, as do such groups as Mothers Against Violence in America, the National Association of Student Councils, the American Federation of Teachers, the National Parent Teacher Associations, and the American Medical Association. 
   Simply put, this resolution will establish October 21, 1999, as the Day of National Concern About Young People and Gun Violence. On this day, students in every school district in the Nation will be invited to voluntarily sign the ``Student Pledge Against Gun Violence.'' By signing the pledge, students promise that they will never take a gun to school, will never use a gun to settle a dispute, and will use their influence in a positive manner to prevent friends from using guns to settle disputes. 
   Mr. President, losing one child from gun violence is one too many. Though this resolution is not the ultimate solution to preventing future tragedies like Littleton, if it stops even one incident of youth gun violence, this resolution will be invaluable. I urge all of my colleagues to join in this resolution to focus attention on gun violence among youth.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for his comments. I have worked along with the team, the principals. They were going to put the amendment on the armed services authorization bill. I thought at that point in time that an insufficient number of Senators had had an opportunity to acquaint themselves with the seriousness of this issue and that we should wait for the bill of our distinguished colleagues from Alabama and Nebraska. A number of Senators have now acquainted themselves with those provisions. We have an impressive number of cosponsors, and I am privileged to be one. 
   I don't view this as any retribution against the President or the Secretary of Energy. It is something that simply has to be done with these institutions that are enormously valuable to the Nation and our national security. I use the word ``enormously'' because I can't think of another word that connotes a greater degree of importance to our country. 
   I went out a week ago yesterday and spent several hours at Los Alamos and then went on to the other laboratory. I must say, the impression I gained from talking with a fairly significant number of individuals, both at Sandia and Los Alamos, was that they are willing to work with this proposition as laid out in the Senator's amendment and make it work. 
   I have listened to those who have some questions. As a matter of fact, I made myself available to work with Senator LEVIN. We worked together on the Armed Services Committee. It is still not clear in my mind exactly what he hopes to achieve. It is my expectation we will address it tomorrow when the amendments come forward. 
   I know it is the right thing to be done in the interests of the country. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Intelligence Committee. Indeed, his committee has held 11 hearings. The Senate Armed Services Committee also has had several. One broke a record; it was 7 continuous hours of hearing. It convinced our membership we are behind it.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to speak with regard to the feelings in my heart and in the hearts of my daughter Mary, my daughter Virginia, and my son John on behalf of the Kennedy family. 
   My daughter Mary was a member of the play group at the White House formed by the President and his lovely wife Jacqueline Kennedy for their daughter Caroline and, my recollection is, three or four others of the same age. They were perhaps among the most photographed young people in America at that time. Our family cherishes the pictures with Caroline and in some John-John was there. It was just a warm experience for these youngsters to start their life. 
   Jacqueline Kennedy was so gracious to all of us in our family. I had known Mrs. Kennedy when I was, my recollection is, in my early twenties, and we were in the same group of young people who mingled together at various events in those days. I remember the absolute startling beauty of that magnificent woman. We remained friends throughout her life. She and the President briefly had a farm in Virginia which abutted on the farm that my then-wife Catherine and I had, and I frequently saw her at sporting events. 
   The families were intertwined at a very young age. Previously, at the University of Virginia Law School, while my period at that school was interrupted by service in the Marines during the Korean war, Bobby Kennedy was there, and we overlapped for a period of time. I remember participating in some of the touch football games and getting my first insight into that extraordinary family. 
   My daughter Virginia knew John-John quite well. In past years, prior to marriage, they were in the same group that often attended events together. 
   This has left a very deep and sad feeling in the hearts of my children, and I know they would want their deepest sympathy conveyed to the members of the family. I do that tonight, being privileged to be on the floor of the Senate and talking about this most distinguished family. 
   I met President Kennedy on several occasions. I knew him, as a matter of fact, when he was a Senator. I remember very well one night going to a television studio with him and some other people. I cannot recall exactly what the show was, but that night, for various reasons, is tucked away in my memory. 
   Then, of course, in the campaign of 1960, I was the advance man for President Nixon; and Bobby Kennedy was the advance man for his brother. We had frequent but always pleasant and cordial meetings on the campaign trail of 1960. 
   But the main purpose of my taking the floor is to express, on behalf of my children, our profound sorrow for this tragic event, and how we are all deprived of what I think in our hearts we believe would have been a great future for this young man, had the Lord seen fit to have him remain with us. He was destined to go on to greatness, and we, as a nation, have been deprived. But we accept the Lord's will in this case. 
   All that could be done was done, primarily by the Coast Guard, the Navy, the National Transportation Safety Board, and others. I think they are worthy of commendation for their services. 
   To our distinguished colleague, Senator KENNEDY, I know, having spoken with him, he was looking forward to this wedding. So often this family has come together in hours of tragedy, but this wedding was to be an hour of pure joy. He looked forward to it with expectation. But now, of course, that has to be postponed, I hope for a brief period. 
   But I remember how hard the Senator worked on the Patients' Bill of Rights. I voted against him on every vote except one, and that has often been the case in my 21 years in the Senate serving with my friend. And we have had many opportunities to work together on various things. He is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, of which I am privileged to be chairman. When I was ranking member on the Seapower Subcommittee, he was chairman; and then for a brief period, when I was chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee, he was ranking member. 
   But I remember how hard he worked last week. His heart was in that bill regarding the health of the citizens of our Nation. It was just another chapter in his long and distinguished career in the Senate. 
   I believe on both sides of the aisle he is regarded as one of the hardest working, most conscientious Members of the Senate. We have nothing but profound respect for him and the manner in which he, as one of the heads of this distinguished family, has worked to bring this family once again to the realization of a loss that they must accept. 
   Mr. President, we conclude today's proceedings by several of us speaking on this. We do so from the heart and convey our prayers and sympathy to this family. 
   Mr. THOMPSON addressed the Chair.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to introduce today legislation to complete the commitment to finance the federal share of the cost of constructing the new Woodrow Wilson bridge. 
   As my colleagues are aware, this 40-year-old bridge which links Interstate 495 between Maryland and Virginia, is owned by the federal government. For over a decade, the U.S. Federal Highway Administration, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia and affected local governments have conducted an extensive public process to select a design for a replacement facility for the Wilson bridge. 
   The Record of Decision on the Environmental Impact Statement selected an alternative for a 12-lane bridge, of which 10 lanes are for all traffic and 2 lanes are dedicated for HOV. 
   The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, TEA-21, provides $900 million for planning, engineering, design and construction from 1998 through 2003 for this design. This funding level represents approximately half of the estimated total project cost of $1.9 billion. 
   The legislation I am introducing today, along with my Senate colleagues, Senator ROBB, Senator SARBANES and Senator MIKULSKI, provides the final installment of federal funds for the project. Also, this legislation has been reviewed by the Administration and it compliments the legislation requested by the Administration earlier this month. 
   Specifically, the bill provides a total of $600 million from the Highway Trust Fund in fiscal years 2004 through 2007, at an annual funding level of $150 million. Our bill adds a requirement not present in the Administration's bill that Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia must provide $400 million before any of the funds can be obligated. 
   The requirement for matching funds from the capital region jurisdictions ensures that the total project cost of $1.9 billion is fully financed. Also, this matching provision responds to a major issue that came before a federal court earlier this year. In that litigation, the court ruled that the project had not fully met the transportation conformity requirements of the Clean Air Act. Conformity requires that sources of funding for transportation projects be identified and that state transportation plans for building transportation projects ``conform'' with state implementation plans designed to meet air quality standards. 
   Mr. President, the funding provided in this legislation also ensures that this project will receive the same financial treatment as other highway construction projects around the nation. Under TEA-21 and prior federal transportation laws, 20 percent of state funds are required to match 80 percent of federal dollars used on any highway construction project on the federal-aid system. This 80 percent federal/20 percent state requirement will now be applied to the Wilson bridge project when this legislation is enacted. 
   Mr. President, now is the time to act on this legislation. The project is at a critical juncture as we work to meet the construction schedule. While the funds authorized in this bill will not be available until 2004 through 2007, full funding must be identified and committed now before any construction can begin. The current schedule is for construction to begin by the fall of 2000. 
   Let me be clear to my colleagues that this legislation continues all of the requirements set for the capital region jurisdictions established in TEA-21. Specifically, Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia must develop a financial plan and enter into an agreement with the federal government to determine which jurisdiction will take title to the new bridge. 
   Also, this legislation does not waive any federal environmental laws. Those issues are before federal court and efforts to resolve them are ongoing between the Federal Highway Administration and the plaintiffs. 
   As it has been stated previously, the useful life of the current bridge is nearly expired. Daily traffic of over 175,000 vehicles per day is causing irreparable damage to the bridge structure. It is prohibitively expensive to continue spending scarce transportation dollars to repair the bridge when its projected lifespan is rapidly expiring. The Federal Highway Administration has confirmed that we can keep the bridge open to all traffic until about the year 2004, but those estimates can change overnight as monthly safety inspections reveal continuing damage. 
   Today, we are introducing two bills in the Senate to accomplish this funding initiative because of the committee jurisdictional issues. As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I am sponsoring the bill to provide $600 million from the Highway Trust Fund beginning in 2004. My colleague, Senator ROBB, as a member of the Finance Committee, will be introducing legislation to permit these Highway Trust Fund dollars to be obligated in 2004 and beyond. Current tax law limits the obligation of new Highway Trust Fund dollars beyond the current TEA-21 authorization period of 2003.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I address the Senate regarding Executive Calendar No. 135, the nomination by the President of the United States of Richard Holbrooke of New York to be the Representative of the United States of America to the sessions of the General Assembly. That was presented to the Senate by the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. HELMS, on June 30, 1999. Following the favorable reporting by the Committee. It is now pending. 
   I have been in this magnificent body, privileged by the State of Virginia, for 21 years. I fully recognize the rights of Senators to place holds on nominations. I respect that right. I respect them for the reasons they have done it. I have done it myself, although sparingly. But in my judgment, the urgency for the Senate to address this nomination is increasing daily. I urge the Senate to proceed to an up-or-down vote because the United States of America, in my judgment, is increasingly in need of having a very powerful voice at the U.N. 
   Ambassador Holbrooke, in my judgment, is eminently qualified. He is well experienced with the complex issues in the Balkans. 
   I ask unanimous consent that at the end of my remarks there be printed an article in today's Washington Post.

   Mr. WARNER. It covers the following:  
   Five weeks after the end of bitter ethnic war and the arrival of NATO troops in Kosovo, growing confusion among Western officials, local politicians and Kosovo's population about who controls the province is hampering efforts to begin rebuilding its tattered economy and political structure and social services.  
   The essence of this article captures a concern of this Senator, that the men and women in the Armed Forces, be they wearing the uniform of the United States or the uniform of our other NATO allies, all under the command of an American officer, General Clark, are at increasing personal risk because the United Nations is not able, perhaps for valid reasons, perhaps for invalid reasons, to take up their allocation of responsibilities and relieve the burdens from the troops so they can restrict their responsibilities to professional military duties. 
   I believe we should proceed with this nomination, have a vote up or down. Hopefully, this nomination will be approved by the Senate, and we can have a strong voice to enter into this very serious situation in Kosovo. We have invested billions of dollars. We have put at risk tens of thousands of lives, the men and women of the Armed Forces of this country and other countries, to reach the conclusion we now have of relative stability, in clear contrast to the cruel ethnic cleansing inflicted upon the people of Kosovo.  
   I think the time has come. I ask those who have reasons to be further considering this nomination--I am actively working to resolve those problems--to weigh the risk to the men and women of the armed forces of all nations involved in Kosovo.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this week the United States Senate has been debating the provisions of two pieces of legislation dealing with increased patient protections for individuals with health plans. The bill that I support is called the ``Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act.'' The other bill under consideration is called the ``Patients' Bill of Rights.'' Though these bill have similar names, they differ greatly in what they will in fact accomplish. After I briefly summarize the major components of these bills, it will be clear that the title of the ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' is a misnomer. It will also be clear that the ``Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act'' is a bill that is truly focused on the American people. Through its major components, this bill will provide consumer protections, enhance health care quality, and increase access to healthcare. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act contains a number of provisions that are key consumer protections. These provisions will greatly enhance the health plans of the 48 million Americans who are covered by self-funded group health plans governed exclusively by the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act (``ERISA'') and will enhance the quality of healthcare. 
   First, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act has emergency care protection for consumers. Currently, some plans and managed care organizations require prior authorization for emergency department services and/or have denied payment for emergency room services if it turns out the patient's situation does not meet the plan or organization's definition of an emergency. As a result, a participant may be liable for the entire emergency room bill. This potential large cost to the patient, and the uncertainty of coverage, has a significant negative impact on the patient seeking emergency room care, even if such a visit is reasonable. What a tragedy it would be for a person to die because that person refused to go to the emergency room out of fear that coverage would be denied later? 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus remedies this situation in a cost effective manner by requiring self-funded ERISA plans that provide coverage for emergency services to pay for emergency medical screening exams using a ``prudent layperson standard.'' The bill also requires these ERISA plans to provide coverage for any additional emergency care necessary to stabilize an emergency condition after a screening exam. Under the prudent layperson standard, an ERISA plan would be required to cover emergency medical screenings if a person with an average knowledge of health and medicine would expect that the absence of immediate medical attention would result in serious jeopardy to the individual's health. For example, let's say an individual is experiencing chest pain. Though I am not a doctor (my father was), I do know that chest pain could at least be a symptom of indigestion, heart burn, or a heart attack. If this individual went to the emergency room because of these chest pains, the prudent layperson standard would cover emergency screening, even if the heart pain turned out to be a case of indigestion. 
   Another problem that I continuously hear people complaining about is gatekeepers. Many plans require patients to visit their primary care physicians and obtain a referral before they can visit a specialty doctor. These gatekeeping provisions can, in certain circumstances, drive up the cost of healthcare, and also make it more difficult for patients to access appropriate medical care. Moreover, certain gatekeeping provisions fail to recognize that women and children have unique health care needs. The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act also remedies these problems by requiring self-funded ERISA plans to provide direct access to routine obstetric and gynecological (``ob/gyn'') care and routine pediatric care without requiring prior authorization. 
   Third, in addition to improving access to emergency care services, ob/gyns, and pediatricians, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act ensures access to covered specialty care by requiring ERISA plans to provide patients access to covered speciality care within network, or, if necessary, through contractual arrangements with specialists outside the network. While this bill would not prevent a plan from requiring a referral by a patient's primary care physician in order to obtain some specialty services, the bill does require a plan to provide for an adequate number of visits to the specialist when the plan requires a referral. 
   Fourth, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act also addresses the situation of when a patient's physician under a  plan is terminated or is not renewed by the plan. This bill requires an ERISA plan to continue coverage with a patients' provider, if the patient is undergoing a course of treatment that includes institutional care, care for a terminal illness, or care starting from the second trimester of pregnancy. Coverage duration is for up to 90 days for a patient who is terminally ill or who is receiving institutional care. For a pregnant woman who is in her second or third trimester, coverage is required to be continued through the postpartum period. 
   In addition to providing these key consumer protections to the 48 million Americans who are covered by self-funded group health plans governed exclusively by ERISA, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act creates appeals procedures for the 124 million Americans covered by both self-insured and fully-insured group health plans. These appeal provisions are essential protections to ensure that Americans receive the service and coverage they are entitled. 
   Simply put, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act requires an internal and external review process under which consumers can appeal a plan's denial of coverage. A plan must complete a consumer's internal appeal within 30 working days from the request for an appeal. An internal coverage appeal can also be expedited, meaning the determination must be made within 72 hours, in accordance with the medical exigencies of the case, after a request is received by the plan or issuer. In the event that the plan denies coverage because the treatment was not medically necessary or appropriate or was experimental, the internal review must be conducted by a physician who has appropriate expertise and who was not directly involved in the initial coverage decision. 
   A consumer who is denied coverage and who loses an internal appeal still may have an avenue to pursue coverage through an external appeal. An external review is available when a plan has denied coverage based on lack of medical necessity and appropriateness and the amount involved exceeds a significant financial threshold or there is a significant risk of placing the life or health of the individual in jeopardy. Once an external review is requested, a plan must select a qualified external review entity, in accordance with the medical exigencies of the case. The plan must select the entity in an unbiased manner and the entity must be: (1) an independent external review entity licensed or credentialed by a State; (2) a State agency established for the purpose of conducting independent external review; (3) an entity under contract with the Federal Government to provide independent external review services; or (4) any other entity meeting criteria established by the Secretary of Labor. 
   The external review entity then selects the independent expert to conduct the external review. This independent expert reviewer must have appropriate expertise and credentials, must have expertise in the diagnosis or treatment under review, must be of the same specialty as the treating physician when such an expert is reasonably available, and must not have certain 
   affiliations with the case or any of the parties involved. This expert's job under the external review is to render an independent decision based on valid, relevant, scientific, and clinical evidence. This includes information from the treating physician, the patient's medical records, expert consensus, and peer-reviewed medical literature to assure that standards of care are reviewed in a manner that takes into account the unique needs of the patient. 
   This internal and external review process is integral to ensuring that patients get the medical care they need. Again, the bill provides for an Independent medical judgment by a qualified and non-biased medical expert. This will protect against the possibility that a health plan might try to ``short change'' its consumers. Our bill is a responsible approach that will not drive up costs and cause more Americans to lose health insurance coverage. 
   Sixth, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act protects health insurance consumers against the use of a technological innovation that could prove costly to them. Scientists today believe that most people carry genes with certain characteristics that may place these people at risk for future diseases. Consequently, insurance companies could use this technology and charge higher premiums to those individuals who are genetically predisposed to certain diseases. The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act protects against this by prohibiting all group health plans and health insurance issuers from denying coverage, or adjusting premiums or rates based on ``predictive genetic information'' for the 140 million Americans covered by both self-insured and fully insured group health plans and individual health insurance plans. 
   Finally, this bill protects consumers and increases the quality of health care by protecting patient-provider communications. The communications are protected through the elimination of gag rules, which restrict physicians and other health care providers from discussing patient treatment options not covered by patients' plans. I believe in providing patients with the most information possible so that they can make informative healthcare decisions, in consultation with their health care provider. The gag rule prohibition in this bill will permit health care professionals to discuss treatment alternatives with patients and render good medical advice, regardless of whether the treatments or alternatives are covered benefits under the plan. 
   Not only does the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act provide consumer protections and increase health care quality, this legislation also increases access to the health care system. First, this bill expands the use of Medical Savings Accounts (``MSA''). These accounts were created in 1994 but are currently only available for employees of firms with 50 or fewer employees. This bill expands MSA availability to all individuals. This bill also loosens some of the restrictions on Flexible Savings Accounts (``FSA''). An FSA is an account which an employee can deposit money into to cover healthcare costs that are not covered by the plan. Current law, however, provides that any money in the FSA that is not used by the end of the year is lost. This bill would allow workers to keep up to $500 of unused FSA funds in tax-preferred accounts every year, giving those patients greater control over their health care. I have long been a supporter of giving Americans the ability to better control their own health care costs by purchasing special tax-preferred savings accounts for basic medical expenses. Finally, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act expands access to health care by allowing self-employed Americans to deduct 100 percent of health insurance expenses from their taxes. Combined, MSAs, FSAs, and the full deductibility of health care costs for the self-employed will increase Americans flexibility in health care coverage options and decrease the number of uninsured. 
   Mr. President, this is just a brief summary that highlights some of the major provisions of the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act. As I am sure you can see Mr. President, that this bill is truly a Patients' Bill of Rights. This bill provides consumers with a number of protections against health plans and increases accessibility to the health care system. Consequently, I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important piece of legislation. 
   On the other hand, because I feel so strongly that we as a Congress must work toward increasing accessibility to the heath care system, I feel compelled to speak out against the so called ``Patients' Bill of Rights.'' This bill, by prescribing more mandates, more regulations, more bureaucracy, and more lawsuits, will certainly raise the costs of health care and close the access door to many Americans. 
   Health care costs are already high in this country, and many Americans cannot afford health insurance. According to Dan Crippen, director of the Congressional Budget Office, there were approximately 43 million Americans under the age of 65 that lacked health insurance coverage in 1997. As health care costs continue to rise, who do you think is going to pay for the increased cost? Well, I am fairly certain it will not be the insurance companies or the health care providers. Rather, increased costs will be passed on to the consumers through higher premiums and reduced benefits. That means the consumer will have to bear the cost by paying higher premiums for their health plans and receiving less benefits. Higher premiums for consumers  mean even more Americans will be unable to afford health insurance coverage. 
   Mr. President, I believe the United States Congress should pass a Patients' Bill of Rights that provides consumer protections and does not result in people losing access to the health care system. The ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' does not achieve these objectives. 
   The Congressional Budget Office has conducted a cost estimate of the ``Patients' Bill of Rights.'' The original cost estimate of this bill was that it would increase premiums 6.1%. It is not difficult to understand that higher premiums are likely to result in some loss of health insurance coverage. If you increase costs, some people will not be able to afford health insurance. Americans should not have to choose between the basic necessities of life like food and shelter and health insurance. Mr. President, given the number of uninsured Americans and the prospect of increasing health care costs, the ``Patients' Bill of Rights,'' by increasing premiums by 6.1%, is simply irresponsible. 
   Predicting the exact number of Americans that will be uninsured if the ``Patients' Bill of Rights'' becomes law is difficult. However, the numbers the experts keep telling me are that this bill will result in over 1 million Americans losing their health insurance coverage. Of this over 1 million Americans, an economic consulting firm estimates that this bill will cause over 34,700 Virginians to lose their health insurance. Let me reiterate this point Mr. President. The experts have been telling me that due to the 6.1% premium increase in the ``Patients' Bill of Rights,'' over 1 million Americans and approximately 34,000 Virginians are likely to lose their health insurance. This, Mr. President, I cannot accept. 
   Mr. President, legislation that will cause so many Americans and so many Virginians to lose health insurance coverage is not a true Patients' Bill of Rights; therefore, I am unable to support the inappropriately titled, ``Patients' Bill of Rights.'' On the other hand, the Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act is a true Patients' Bill of Rights. The Patients' Bill of Rights Plus Act increases access to the health care system and provides key consumer protections. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation, and I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this true patient protection piece of legislation.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have offered an amendment to the Treasury, Postal and General Government Appropriations bill to ensure that federal managers and law enforcement officials in all federal departments and agencies receive the same benefits concerning professional liability insurance. Today, several federal departments contribute to the costs of professional liability insurance for federal managers and law enforcement officials. Other large federal departments do not contribute to assisting federal managers obtain this insurance. 
   This professional liability insurance is essential as many federal managers are personally absorbing the significant costs of obtaining legal representation in cases where complaints have been brought against. Often, allegations have been made by citizens, against whom federal officials were enforcing the law and by employees who had performance or conduct problems. 
   I have been working with Chairman COCHRAN of the Government Affairs Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation and Federal Services to address this important issue and I welcome his views on this matter.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of my amendment creating the Federal Employees Equity Act of 1999.
   My legislation expands a provision included in the Omnibus Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 1997 (P.L. 104-208) to allow Federal agencies to contribute to the costs of professional liability insurance for their senior executives, managers and law enforcement officials. While this important benefit contained in the Omnibus Appropriation bill was indeed enacted, it has not been made available on as wide a basis to Federal employees as we had hoped.
   The Federal Employees Equity Act would ensure that Federal agencies reimburse one-half the premiums for Professional Liability Insurance for employees covered by this bill. Federal managers, supervisors and law enforcement officials should not have to fear the excessive costs of legal representation when unwarranted allegations are made against them and investigations of these allegations are conducted.
   I was a strong supporter of the provision in 1996 because Federal officials often found themselves to be the target of unfounded allegations of wrongdoing. Sometimes allegations were made by citizens, against whom Federal officials were enforcing the law and by employees who had performance or conduct problems. Although many allegations have proven to be specious, these Federal officials were often subject to lengthy investigations and had to pay for their own legal representation when their agencies could not provide it.
   The affected Federal managers, supervisors and law enforcement officials are generally prohibited from being represented by unions. For employees who are in bargaining units represented by unions, Congress allows Federal agencies to subsidize the time and expenses of union representatives when they are needed by such employees, whether or not they are dues paying members of the union.
   Because these Federal officials are denied union representation, they have found it necessary to purchase Professional Liability Insurance in order to protect themselves when allegations are made against them to the Inspector General of their agency, to the Office of Special Counsel, or to the EEO office. The insurance provides coverage for legal representation for the employees when they are accused, and will pay judgments against the employee up to a maximum dollar amount if the employee is found to have made a mistake while carrying out his official duties. Currently, these managers must hire their own lawyers in order to defend their reputation and careers when they are the subject of a grievance, regardless of whether the complaint has merit.
   The current law has had some success and has been implemented by several Federal departments including: Departments of Agriculture, Education, Interior, Labor, and such agencies as the Social Security Administration, Small Business Administration, General Services Administration, Securities and Exchange Commission, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the National Science Foundation, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Office of the Inspector General at the Office of Public Health and Science, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration at Department of Health and Human Services.
   Regrettably, other departments such as Treasury, Justice, Defense, Commerce, Transportation, Veterans Affairs, and agencies such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the Office of Personnel Management have not seen fit to do so.
   The professional associations of these officials (the Senior Executives Association, the Professional Managers Association, the FBI Agents Association, the Federal Criminal Investigators Association, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the National Association of Assistant U.S. Attorneys, and the Nation Treasury Employees Union) have endorsed the concept for legislation to require Federal agencies to reimburse half the cost of premiums for Professional Liability Insurance.
   The intent of this measure is simply to ``level the playing field'' so that supervisors and managers are treated equally by various Federal agencies and have access to protections similar to those which are already provided for rank and file Federal employees.
   I request your support for these Federal officials and for this legislation.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a truly distinguished officer, gentleman, and patriot: General Charles C. Krulak, Commandant, United States Marine Corps. I do so, with humility and respect, on behalf of the six members of the Senate who served in the Marine Corps. Although today marks the end of his remarkable uniformed career, his legacy will live on throughout the Corps' history as a ``guide-on'' for future marines. 
   Today also marks the first time in 70 years that a Krulak will not be privileged to be in the ranks of the United States Marine Corps. General Krulak's father, General V.H. ``Brute'' Krulak, himself a legendary officer, served with distinction in three wars ultimately achieving the rank of Lieutenant General. All three of General ``Brute'' Krulak's sons graduated from the United States Naval Academy, but it was his son Charles, or Chuck, that followed very closely in his father's foot steps. 
   Mr. President, during the past four years, I have had the distinct honor and pleasure of working very closely with General Chuck Krulak. I first met General Krulak during an inspection tour in Vietnam where, as a young Captain, he had been wounded and was being evacuated. We later reminisced about that moment, which bonded us together forever, during his first courtesy call to me as the new Commandant of the Marine Corps. Today at the Change of Command, fittingly held on the historic grounds of the 8th and I Marine Corps Barracks, General Krulak, during his final address, recognized Congress, as did his father, that it was the Congress that created the Marine Corps and then saved the Marine Corps when its very existence was threatened by a former President, so many years ago. He then proclaimed that Congress will always preserve the Corps. He is correct! 
   I believe General Krulak embodies the very core values that reflect the Marine Corps' deepest convictions: Honor, Courage, and Commitment. After 35 years of service, he remains passionate about his Marine Corps and his marines. In a farewell address to the Corps, General Krulak articulated his respect and understanding of the selflessness and pride of the many Marines he had known throughout his life. He spoke of the ethos of the corps and Touchstones of Valor and Values. Mr. President, I submit General Krulak's farewell address to the Corps in the record of the proceedings of the Senate as part of my tribute today. 
   I urge my colleagues to read his address and think about the young men and women Marines who so honorably serve everyday, everywhere around the world to protect this great nation. 
   General, as a former Marine myself, I salute you for a job exceedingly well done! You are a true patriot and the world is a better place because of your dedication to and belief in.......Honor, Courage, and Commitment. Semper Fi.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in light of recent events in Kosovo and the continuing struggles of the many still displaced families, I would like to offer an excerpt from a piece written by a very well-respected spiritual leader from the Commonwealth of Virginia, Rabbi Israel Zoberman. 
   He writes:  
   We take pride in our American servicemen and women--many from our own Hampton Roads--representing the world's sole superpower, who leading the NATO alliance are braving the dangers of war, determined to restore civilized life to all of a continent poised to reverse its long history of conflict and bloodshed through the promise of unity. The presence of the State of Israel among the nations offering critical humanitarian support to a sea of refugees displaying so much dignity, and extending its home to some of them, is inspiring testimony to its acting upon the Jewish people's vast legacy of suffering.  
   I thank Rabbi Zoberman for these somber yet hopeful words and am once again reminded that the tragedy of Kosovo touches the lives of many and in many different ways. Rabbi Zoberman was born to Polish Holocaust survivors and spent his early childhood in a Displaced Persons Camp in Frankfurt, Germany. Rabbi Zoberman, shalom and thank you.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal Employees Equity Act of 1999. 
   My legislation expands a provision included in the omnibus appropriations bill for fiscal year 1997 (P.L. 104-208) to allow federal agencies to contribute to the costs of professional liability insurance for their senior executives, managers and law enforcement officials. While this important benefit contained in the Omnibus Appropriation bill was indeed enacted, it has not been made available on as wide a basis to federal employees as we had hoped. 
   The Federal Employees Equity Act would ensure that federal agencies reimburse one-half the premiums for Professional Liability Insurance for employees covered by this bill. Federal managers, supervisors, and law enforcement officials should not have to fear the excessive costs of legal representation when unwarranted allegations are made against them for investigations of these allegations are conducted. 
   I was a strong supporter of the provision in 1996 because federal officials often found themselves to be the target of unfounded allegations of wrongdoing. Sometimes allegations were  made by citizens, against whom federal officials were enforcing the law and by employees who had performance or conduct problems. Although many allegations have proven to be specious, these federal officials were often subject to lengthy investigations and had to pay for their own legal representation when their agencies could not provide it. 
   The affected federal managers, supervisors, and law enforcement officials are generally prohibited from being represented by unions. For employees who are in bargaining units represented by unions, Congress allows federal agencies to subsidize the time and expenses of union representatives when they are needed by such employees, whether or not they are dues paying members of the union. 
   Because these federal officials are denied union 
   representation, they have found it necessary to purchase professional liability insurance in order to protect themselves when allegations are made against them to the inspector general of their agency, to the Office of Special Counsel, or to the EEO office. The insurance provides coverage for legal representation for the employees when they are accused, and will pay judgements against the employee up to a maximum dollar amount if the employee is found to have made a mistake while carrying out his official duties. Currently, these managers must hire their own lawyers in order to defend their reputation and careers when they are the subject of a grievance, regardless of whether the complaint has merit. 
   The current law has had some success and has been implemented by several federal departments including: Departments of Agriculture, Education, Interior, Labor, and such agencies as the Social Security Administration, Small Business Administration, General Services Administration, Securities and Exchange Commission, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the National Science Foundation, the Merit Systems Protections Board, the Office of the Inspector General at the Office of Public Health and Science, and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration at Department of Health and Human Services. 
   Regrettably, other departments such as Treasury, Justice, Defense, Commerce, Transportation, Veterans Affairs, and agencies such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the Office of Personnel Management have not seen fit to do so. 
   The professional associations of these officials (the Senior Executives Association, the Professional Managers Association, the FBI Agents Association, the Federal Criminal Investigators Association, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the National Association of Assistance U.S. Attorneys, and the National Treasury Employees Union) have endorsed the concept for legislation to require federal agencies to reimburse half the cost of premiums for professional liability insurance. 
   The intent of this measure is simply to ``level the playing field'' so that supervisors and managers are treated equally by various federal agencies and have access to protections similar to those which are already provided for rank and file federal employees. 
   I request your support for these federal officials and for this legislation.

   Mr. WARNER. As the original Senate sponsor of legislation designated to remove unintended Superfund hindrances to recycling, which I proposed for correction in the 103rd Congress, I applaud the majority and minority leaders for their continuing joint efforts. There is no more telling statement of need than to see partisan politics put aside in the greater public interest. Both Senators LOTT and DASCHLE have demonstrated outstanding leadership in helping to assure increased recycling that will occur when the Superfund burden, so inappropriately assessed, will finally be removed.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to recognize and say farewell to an outstanding military officer, Chaplain Donald W. Shea, upon his retirement from the Army after more than 33 years of dedicated service. Throughout his career, Chaplain Shea has served with distinction, and it is my privilege to recognize his many accomplishments and to commend him for the superb service he has provided the United States Army and our nation. 
   Chaplain Shea's retirement on 30 June 1999 will bring to a close over three decades of dedicated service to the United States Army. Born and raised in Butte, Montana, Chaplain Shea attended Carroll College in Helena, Montana and graduated from The Saint Paul Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota. He was ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1962 for the Diocese of Helena and commissioned as a U.S. Army chaplain and entered active duty in August 1966. 
   During his career Chaplain Shea has contributed to every available facet of religious ministry in our armed forces. Entering active duty during a very difficult period for our military and Nation, he provided the leadership and ministering that was invaluable to our forces in the Vietnam conflict. Following this conflict, during which he distinguished himself to seniors and peers alike, Chaplain Shea went on to serve in a variety of positions through his career. He was nominated on May 20, 1994 by President Clinton for promotion to Major General and following his Senate confirmation was appointed Chief of Army Chaplains on September 1, 1994. 
   As Chief of Chaplains he held the Army staff responsible for the religious, moral, and spiritual welfare for the total Army. He focused and advised the Army leadership in dealing with and resolving a number of difficult issues facing today's force. Of note was his establishment of a Chaplain Recruiting Program within the US Army Recruiting Command to aggressively recruit the best-qualified candidates from all denominations, the successful relocation of the Army Chaplain Center and School from Fort Monmouth, NJ to Fort Jackson, SC and as President of the Armed Forces Chaplain Board, he shaped joint methodologies by which Service Chiefs of Chaplain and their staffs approached common issues. 
   Chaplain Shea has been awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, Defense Superior Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star with ``V'' device and two Oak Leaf Clusters, Meritorious Service Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters, Army Commendation Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters, Purple Heart, Vietnam Service Medal with six Campaign Stars, Vietnam Civil Actions Medal (First Class), Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Campaign Medal, Army Service Ribbon, Army Overseas Medal (with ``3'' device), Senior Parachute Badge, Special Forces Tab, Bundeswehr Parachute Badge, and the Vietnamese Parachute Badge.  
   Chaplain Shea will retire from the Department of the Army June 30, 1999, after thirty-three years of dedicated service. On behalf of my colleagues I wish Chaplain Shea fair winds and following seas. Congratulations on an outstanding career.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senate Armed Services Committee reviewed the qualifications of General Shinseki. It was a memorable day. One of our most distinguished and revered colleagues, the senior Senator from Hawaii, introduced General Shinseki. I have said previously that it was one of the most moving statements I have ever heard by a Senator in my 21 years. I placed the statement of Senator INOUYE in the RECORD of Wednesday, June 9, 1999, at Page S6813, and I urge all Senators to look at that. It was, indeed, one of the most extraordinary statements on behalf of another individual that I have ever witnessed. 
   Basically, Senator INOUYE referred back to 1942, the year in which General Shinseki was born. At that time, Senator INOUYE was volunteering to serve in the U.S. Army. It was a very personal and moving statement, and I urge all Senators to look at it. 
   As chairman, I asked Senator CLELAND to note his signature on the nomination of the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army, given his most distinguished career as a soldier serving this Nation in the cause of freedom.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I had the privilege of introducing on the same day General Jones to become the next Commandant of the Marine Corps, succeeding General Krulak who discharged the responsibilities of the Office of Commandant with great credit to the Nation and to himself. He is a most distinguished officer. His father served in World War II in the Marine Corps. His father served in the Pacific as a senior three-star Marine officer just before I became Under Secretary of the Navy. The Krulak family is a proud family, and they have done much for our Nation and, indeed, for the Marine Corps. 
   General Jones served in the Senate in the Marine Corps liaison office. Thereafter, he continued a most distinguished career. His last post as a lieutenant general was the principal military adviser--of course, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs is the principal military adviser--but General Jones on the immediate staff of the Secretary of Defense, our former colleague, Mr. Cohen, was the principal adviser on his personal staff. 
   This is recognition, again, of a distinguished marine who likewise had a family member, an uncle, who was a highly decorated marine in World War II. It is continuity in the Corps for those like myself, I say with great humility, who had the opportunity to serve at one time in the Marine Corps. It is a proud day today for the U.S. Marine Corps, for the soon retirement of the most distinguished Commandant and succession of General Jones whose potential equals any Commandant who ever served in that office in the history of this country. 
   I asked that Senator ROBERTS pen his signature on the nomination of General Jones to be Commandant. Again, Senator ROBERTS is a former marine.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, with a deep sense of humility, I believe the Senate should close its proceedings today by paying our profound and deepest respect to the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States of America and their comrades in arms from 18 other nations, NATO, for having taken an enormous risk in performing with a degree of excellence that by any standard can be judged by all who understand military operations as in keeping with the finest traditions of our military and the military of other nations of the world. 
   Their actions to bring about what appears to be a cessation of hostilities, certainly in the air, at this time receives our profound gratitude and our prayers for their safety. 
   I, moments ago, spoke with the Secretary of Defense to pass on to our old colleague from the Senate a ``well done.'' I had the opportunity, as did many here in the Senate, to work with him on a regular basis throughout this crisis period in Kosovo, and I commend him for maintaining a very strong hand on this situation, particularly at times when it became very difficult. 
   We have discussed the command from the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, chiefs of services, down through the CINCs, to the privates, whether they be in the air, on the sea, on the land. Again, they performed their job with great professional skill and dedication. It was not an easy job, because there was a good deal of uncertainty, and that uncertainty still remains as to exactly how this mission was carried out and whether it could have been done differently. But nevertheless, some 3,000-plus sorties were flown by the men and women in the aircraft of eight nations, supported by ground personnel at bases throughout that region, 17 bases alone in Italy. 
   I had the privilege last week, as a matter of fact a week ago today I was in Albania with General Jackson, who will be heading the ARRC force and who broke the news of the agreement between the military side with the representatives from Yugoslavia, General Clark and Admiral Ellis. I wish to say to these commanders that, again, it was their leadership which instilled a sense of confidence and conviction in their subordinates that this job had to be done, that we had to stay the course, and the professionalism we have witnessed now in the air operation. 
   I was asked momentarily, does this represent a victory or how would you characterize it? I simply said to the press early today, and to my colleagues I say now, it is far too early to try to make those judgments. The Senate Armed Services Committee, which I am privileged to chair, will hold a series of hearings on what went right and what went wrong and what, most particularly, will be the strategy of our forces for the future if faced with another situation of the seriousness and the complexity of this one in Kosovo. 
   I visited this region last September. As I stood there in Albania and Macedonia and observed the terrain, which is identical in many ways to that in Kosovo, I thought back to the refugees at that time huddling in the hills. I said on the floor of the Senate there would be a need then, as there is now, for a ground military force to stabilize the situation, stabilize it so while the ground forces of NATO will go in, eventually other nongovernmental organizations from all over the world will come to help these people who were tragically driven from their homes and villages by a very brutal military force 
   under the direction of President Milosevic, a man who has conducted himself with complete disregard of all international law and human rights. 
   Again, I return to the troops. While the air operation, hopefully, will be secured, if not already, within hours, we have remaining before us the challenge on the ground, and the ground forces will now take up their professional responsibilities. May the hand of God rest upon their shoulders, because they will be faced with land mines and booby traps, all types of uncertainty. They will have to perform tasks not unlike those of a mayor of a village, to the extremes of how to deal with this hidden weaponry and a tragic situation of returning people to a devastated homeland. 
   The KLA will present challenges. In some instances, they fought with great courage. But now they must reconcile themselves to the fact that this international force, indeed NATO and the United Nations, must resolve the situation in a peaceable manner. 
   So while victory cannot be pronounced now, not until the ground forces go in and perform their challenging tasks, I say clearly that NATO has taken another major, significant step in the international community toward reaching its five basic goals. Those goals have been stated on this floor and in the press many times. 
   I salute all. In my discussions with Secretary Cohen, we made reference to the President. The President is Commander in Chief. The words that Secretary Cohen used--and I have a great respect for Bill Cohen, having served with him here some 18 years in the Senate--were that the President was steady. He stayed steady at every turn in these events, stayed focused and gave it his attention. In every way, I think the comments of the Secretary of Defense were very respectful. Clearly, in the minds of all of us, we have to credit the President with holding together the 19 nations. 
   It was essential that that coalition under the NATO charter remain together throughout this first phase--that is, the air phase--and now they must remain together throughout an equally difficult and challenging phase, that of securing the ground.  
   As I said, when I was there one week ago with General Jackson, General Clark, Admiral Ellis, and other military commanders, it is clear that the magnitude of the uncertainty relating to the landmines and booby traps, and indeed the problems associated with moving the Serb forces out, pose a challenge that, in many respects, has never been faced by a U.S. military force. But I have confidence in those commanders and in the men and women who will boldly undertake this task. 
   So I wish to just pay my humble respects, and I will follow this operation very clearly, in terms of our duties in the Senate and on the Armed Services Committee and, most assuredly, in our prayers for their safety and for the safety of those Kosovars who were driven from their homes and now have hope to once again return.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WARNER. I appreciate that, but it is a subject that I think is pretty well known. The Senator has raised it very conscientiously through the years. We have the necessity to get this bill completed by early afternoon. If the Senator could grant us 20 minutes on the first amendment, say 10 minutes on the second amendment, then I ask for only 5 minutes on each amendment on this side. 
   Excuse me, I am told on the first amendment the Senator from Wisconsin would have 20 minutes; on this side, we would have 15 minutes; is that agreeable?

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-warner-va-19-19990527</DOCNO>

   Mr. WARNER. We will proceed as follows: 5 minutes allocated to the Senator from Minnesota to address the Senate; followed by the Senator from Massachusetts, with 10 minutes under his control; 5 minutes under the control of the Senator from Virginia, if necessary. That will require a record vote, and it will be stacked. We will then proceed to the Feingold amendments, the first one with 20 minutes under the control of the Senator from Wisconsin, 15 under the control of the Senator from Virginia; then to the second Feingold amendment, 15 minutes under the control of the Senator from Wisconsin and 10 minutes under the control of the Senator from Virginia. That will be two record votes. 
   So we will have three record votes in approximately about an hour's time. We will add no amendments in order to any of the three amendments that we just recited.

   We are now hoping to start the first vote at about 11:50. That vote would be in the normal sequencing of time, and we hope thereafter to have the two following votes at 10 minutes each. I will not propound that at this moment. 
   I wish to alert the Senate and those debating so when I object to any extension of time for this debate to accommodate a number of Senators on the vote schedule, they will understand. I do not propose a UC at this time.

   We have had a number of Senators patiently waiting. The Senator from Florida is willing to accommodate the chairman in his request that a period of 30 minutes, under the control of the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from New Mexico, be allocated for an amendment which they will lay down within that period of time, and at the conclusion of the 30-minute period, that amendment will be laid aside for the purpose of an amendment to be laid down by the Senator from Florida, which amendment will require 30 minutes of debate, 15 minutes under the control of the Senator from Florida, 15 minutes under the control of the Senator from Alabama, Mr. SHELBY, and that 15 minutes will be shared between  Mr. SHELBY and Mr. KERREY, the ranking member of the Intelligence Committee.

This procedure, in my judgment, enables the Senate to get an assessment of the probability of the resolution of this amendment.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment. I view it as an augmentation of what we have in the defense bill. I understand my colleague from New Mexico addressed the defense bill. I ask the question of my colleague from Alaska. The provision in the defense bill is a direct product of the working group assembled by the majority leader, Senator LOTT. I am not entirely sure what Senator DOMENICI said about the provisions of the defense bill. But the Senator from Alaska incorporated a portion of that in his bill. So there is some redundancy. But I look upon the two as joining forces and, indeed, putting forth what is essential at this point in time.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, once again, a number of these amendments we are now sending to the desk, the two managers, pursuant to the unanimous consent request, are ones which we are in the process of clearing--not all of them but some. I urge my colleagues, once again, there is no assurance that an amendment that was sent to the staff in the last 72 hours is included in the unanimous consent request automatically. It has to be resubmitted. We are being very careful and very fair about that. 
   Now, Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Missouri, Mr. BOND, I send an amendment to the desk.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend our colleague. He is a very valuable member of the committee. 
   I was privileged to be in the Pentagon when Secretary Melvin Laird devised the total force concept, which means the United States of America looks to its national security in terms of not only the Active Forces but the Reserve and the Guard. That was the turning point, a recognition for those men and women who so proudly and in a great deal of sacrifice in terms of their private lives--because they have to balance a full-time job in most instances together with Reserve and Guard commitments requiring them very often to forgo their vacations--contribute that time to their desired slots in the Reserve and the Guard. 
   Therefore, I strongly support this amendment. 
   I want to clarify one thing. This does not add any more numbers of general or flag officers to the total number now in the Pentagon. The numbers that will be used for these promotions are to be drawn from a number within the ranks of each of the departments of the military. 
   Am I not correct on that?

   Mr. WARNER. Just by way of quick anecdote, when I was Secretary of Navy, I felt so strongly about the Naval Reserve that I promoted the then two-star admiral to the grade of three, and he served in that grade throughout my tenure. The day after I left the Department, the third star disappeared, and it never reappeared again until this moment when we agree to this amendment. I hope it will become law. 
   I commend the Senator. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. I thank both leaders for arranging for this bill to go forward now. 
   Senators will recall, pursuant to an earlier unanimous consent, we asked Senators to send to the desk such amendments and file them, as have not been as yet cleared by the managers. We are continuing to work on those amendments, but we cannot guarantee we will be able to include all of them into the package. 
   So once we finish this debate, it is the intention of the managers to move to third reading unless Senators come down with regard to these amendments that are pending at the desk. 
   I will be on the floor, as will Senator LEVIN, continuously to try to work out as many as we possibly can. But it is essential, as the majority leader said, we try to vote this bill at 8 o'clock right now.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished majority leader for this initiative. We have had in his office a series of meetings with the chairmen, as he enumerated, and this piece of legislation has been very carefully crafted drawing from each of the committees the work they have done thus far. 
   The Senate Armed Services Committee, as the majority leader has said, has taken an active role in addressing the issues. I refer colleagues to page 462 of our report, which is on each desk. In there, we have a subtitle (D) related to this subject. We are bringing this together. 
   I thought it was important--and I consulted with the majority leader this morning--to lay this down so all Senators have the opportunity to view it. Our distinguished colleague, the ranking member, has sent it out to the various Departments and agencies of the Federal Government for comment. In the course of the day, as I am sure my colleague from Michigan will agree, we will basically try to allow Senators at any time to address this particular amendment by Senator LOTT and, indeed, the provisions that we have in our bill. 
   This is an important subject. It is a timely subject. All Senators hopefully will strive to achieve bipartisanship because we recognize that this problem goes back several administrations, although I have my own personal views that this administration must account for some actions which I find very disturbing--in other words, why corrective measures were not brought about more expeditiously. But time will tell. 
   Also, I believe it is important to recognize that the United States of America in the next millennium will be faced with an ever-growing and ever-important nation, China. We as a nation must remain engaged with China, whether it is on economic, political, human rights, or security issues. China and the United States are the two dominant leaders, together with Japan and, indeed, I think South Korea, in that region to bring about the security which is desperately needed. 
   So let us hope that in due course we can, on this bill, put together a bipartisan package. We already have one amendment in there, and it passed our committee with bipartisan support.

   Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague. 
   If I may note, with a sense of humility, Senator LEVIN and I are now entering the third day on this bill. To the best of my recollection--which is 21 years that we have been working together on authorizations bills--we may have set a record 
   thus far. That record is not necessarily owing to the efforts of the ranking member and myself but all Senators in cooperating in moving this bill along; the record being we only had one quorum call, this being the third day. 
   We started on a Monday, when ordinarily things do not move as quickly; but we had one single quorum call, I think, for about 3 or 4 minutes on Monday. Yesterday, throughout, we stayed here until close to 9 o'clock last night working on amendments. So I thank the Senator, my colleague, my friend from Michigan. I thank all Senators. 
   We just had another Senator come on the floor in a timely way. He is right on the split second of when he is due to bring up his amendment. 
   So with the cooperation of other Senators, I am hopeful we can finish this bill tonight. I have discussed that with the majority leader, and he is going to give us total support. We will just drive this engine, hopefully into the early hours of the evening, and complete it. 
   But I do bring to the attention of Senators that I will place on the majority leader's desk here, as I manage the bill, three pages of amendments. There they are. We have to work our way through these today. My colleague, Mr. LEVIN, and I will be here throughout the day to assist Senators in accommodating them with their desire regarding these amendments.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on the subject of BRAC, again, the distinguished Senator from Michigan, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. MCCAIN, the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. REED, the distinguished Senator from Maine--my recollection is there was one other Senator who spoke last night in the debate on the BRAC process, so we have had a considerable amount of debate. There are 2 hours allocated. I am not certain that all 2 hours will be needed. But I urge Senators to come over as quickly  as possible when that amendment comes up on the schedule, and we can hopefully move through that debate and on to other matters. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be laid aside.

   Mr. WARNER. I didn't mean to interrupt the Senator, but I am hopeful that we can listen to the important debate. I would like to have the opportunity to respond to the Senator so that Senators following this debate can have framed in their minds where we have a difference of views, and I would like to complete this by 11:45 so we can keep on our schedule. I hope our colleague will try to accommodate as best he can. 
   This is a very important subject. I share some of the views that he has made. I think what he said is a very important reminder to Senators on this subject. It has somewhat drifted from the minds of the Senators given that, regrettably, this stalemate thus far in Russia could move to ratification. Let us proceed, hopefully, in a timely way.

   Mr. WARNER. That is correct. We want to give the Senator as much latitude as we can. We will find such time as I believe the Senator desires. I am just anxious to frame this issue, because the Senator has given a brilliant speech, as he always does. I do not say that facetiously. I enjoy listening to my good friend and colleague and fellow naval person. But I was listening, and he is making a good speech for ballistic missile defense, which is splendid. I hope that we are going to draw  on this RECORD for future debates on ballistic missile defense systems. I take note of Senator COCHRAN's bill now that has become law. 
   But the point I wish to make is that this provision, which the Senator wishes to strike, has been in five successive defensive bills. It is in there in accordance with the administration's wishes to try to show to Russia that we mean business about getting START II ratified. Were we to strike it, it is this Senator's opinion--I think it is shared by the Secretary of Defense, and others--it would weaken the efforts to get START II ratified. 
   We have here the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces. All I would ask is, if we could just have a few minutes to frame the debate into a focus of Senators following it, I think they can come to some sort of closure in their own minds on this issue.

We will take a relatively short time on our side, because it is a bill provision; the Senator is on a motion to strike. It is very clear what we are trying to do on this side, to help this administration get ratification, help America get ratification of START II. 
   That is the sole purpose for this provision. It has been in there 5 years for that purpose. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is interesting the leader brings up ``the old-fashioned way,'' because when I was Secretary of the Navy, circa 1971, 1972, 1973, I closed the Boston Naval Shipyard and the destroyer base, where Senator JACK REED and Senator CHAFEE were very much interested in that. We did it the old-fashioned way. I must say we came down here and we had hearings. I remember in the caucus room, Senators Pastore and Pell sat there and grilled me and the Chief of Naval Operations for the better part of a day. But it worked out. So there is a precedent for doing it the old-fashioned way. 
   I say to my distinguished leader, I was the coauthor of the first BRAC bill and the second BRAC bill. But the commission concept was predicated on trust and fairness. Regrettably, Mr. Leader, that was lost in the last round when, as you know, in the California and Texas situations, the sticky fingerprints of politics got in there.

   Mr. WARNER. Therefore, all the communities across the country, once a BRAC process is initiated, they go to general quarters and they hire these expensive lobbyists and all types of people to try to make sure their case, should it work its way up through the system, is treated fairly. That is all they really ask. Unless there is trust in the system, we cannot achieve a commission concept of closures. 
   Maybe we can induce the Secretary of Defense to try it the old-fashioned way and give it a shot. I commit to work fairly and objectively if you put it right on the table. I thank the leader for his strong position.

<DOCNO>106-warner-va-8-19990526</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WARNER. I say to my good friend from Massachusetts, a fellow member of the Armed Services Committee, we have in this bill--you are ranking on that committee--the removal of those submarines as sought by the President and the administration. 
   The essence of what I have to say is that Congress expressed a willingness to do that. Hopefully, this legislation will go through, become law. It seems to me, if the administration has further reductions in the arsenal, let it come before the Congress. That is the procedure that I would follow. 
   So I just say, in opposition to this amendment, the amendment would strike section 1041. Section 1041 renews and modifies the provision that has been enacted in the defense authorization bill each year for the last 5 years. 
   This is a measured, balanced, and needed provision which, in my view, all Members of the Senate should support. It simply prohibits the retirement of certain strategic delivery systems unless START II enters into force. Essentially, this provision seeks to prohibit unilateral compliance with the reduction of U.S. inventory implementation of the START II treaty and make clear to Russia that the benefits of our mutual arms control agreements can only be realized through mutual implementation of those agreements. 
   This year, the Secretary of Defense and the Navy requested we modify the limitation to permit the retirement of four of the older Trident submarines. The Secretary, however, made it very clear that the administration was not advocating any unilateral implementation of START II. The Armed Services Committee reviewed the Secretary's recommendations to reduce the Trident force from 18 to 14 submarines and agreed to authorize such reduction. Section 1041 of the pending bill does, in fact, allow retirement or conversion of these four submarines. 
   In keeping with the administration's policy not to unilaterally implement START II--and that is the policy; I assume the Senator from Nebraska agrees with that--the Secretary also made sure that the fiscal year 2000 budget request fully funded all remaining operational strategic nuclear delivery systems, including the 50 peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles deployed at the F.E. Warren Air Force Base. The Armed Services Committee supports this decision, and there is nothing in this bill that prohibits the Secretary from implementing any planned reduction to our strategic forces. 
   Section 1041, which the Kerrey amendment would strike, simply reinforces the administration's policy of remaining at START I force levels until START II enters into force. To strike this provision would send a signal that the Senate no longer supports this policy. This would be a dangerous and unnecessary signal to send, one that could undermine the integrity of the arms control process. 
   Since section 1041 does not prohibit any planned changes to U.S. strategic forces, it would appear that the supporters of this amendment are really interested in some form of unilateral arms control or some other steps that go beyond the administration's policy. At a time when our relations with Russia and China are quite uncertain, I say to my dear colleagues, now is not the time to consider unilateral reductions in our strategic forces. 
   The United States and Russia are now hopefully nearing full implementation of the START I agreement. The administration has worked very hard to get Russia to ratify START II. If the Senate votes to eliminate section 1041, this action could be interpreted as a sign that the Senate is giving up on START II. Unless my colleagues are willing to abandon the arms control process, I suggest that they not support the pending amendment. Indeed, the administration has acknowledged that section 1041 provides significant leverage over Russia to get them to ratify START II. 
   Mr. President, in closing, let me simply reiterate that section 1041 of the pending bill was crafted with the Secretary of Defense's views firmly in mind. Nothing in this provision prohibits the Secretary from undertaking any action he plans for fiscal year 2000. And, since the provision expires at the end of the fiscal year 2000, we will have an opportunity next year to review any new recommendations coming from the administration. For the time being, it  would send a very bad message to strike this important provision. I urge my colleagues to oppose the Kerrey amendment and support the bill.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say in reply that this section was crafted with the views of the Secretary of Defense firmly in mind. Nothing in this provision prohibits the Secretary from undertaking any action he plans for fiscal year 2000. And since the provision expires at the end of the fiscal year 2000, we will have the opportunity in the next year to review any new recommendations coming from the administration. 
   A year from now we will have more clarity, hopefully, of the relationship with China, of the relationship with Russia and, indeed, this Senator's concern about North Korea and its advancements in missile technology. So I think we can focus on the superpowers but this, in my judgment, talks to the entire strategic defense of the United States of America.

In order to protect all parties--Senator STEVENS may wish to speak to this --I ask unanimous consent that we have 1 hour, divided 20 minutes under the control of the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, and 40 minutes, which would include the time for Senator HARKIN, under the control of the Senator from Colorado.

   Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague from Oklahoma. 
   Mr. President, the chairman of the committee sat here and listened to the differences of views of three of his stalwarts. But as I listened, I said to myself, possibly you could work it out. We are at the point in time where I would like to go on another amendment. Senator HARKIN will return at circa 7 o'clock, and he desires to speak for about 15 or 20 minutes. We made in the unanimous consent agreement that provision. There is time within which you might consider it, because I stand very firmly with the decisions of the committee. I listened to the debate. As a matter of fact, ironically--I hate to keep dating myself--along about circa 1943, or 1944, I was associated somehow with the Civil Air Patrol, because I always wanted to join the Army Air Corps. It was called the Army Air Corps in those days. Also, it gave a young person--as I was 16--an opportunity to hop in a plane and fly. It was exciting to fly in those days. It was not a matter of routine in those days. It was a dream. So much for that trivia.  
   The point is that this is a very respected and venerable organization that has to be preserved. 
   As I listened to our colleague from Oklahoma recount the potential problems, ``60 Minutes'' is going to tune in on this pretty soon. There are just a few of us that understand the value of the Civil Air Patrol, and we could lose it. 
   For example, the junior ROTC and the junior NROTC and other programs to encourage young people to direct some portion of their life devoted to the military, I have seen those programs scaled back, funding reduced, and support reduced. It concerns me that this program, likewise, could face those situations. 
   I am going to support the Senator from Oklahoma in his position because it is a committee position. I listened to the debate and I believe some remedies have to be addressed. 
   With a little luck, maybe we can work it out.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have listened very intently to my colleague from New Hampshire, and I have studied the history of the Indianapolis. His opening statement I found persuasive to the point where I would like to go back to neutral on any question of tabling and offer to my good friend the opportunity for the Senate Armed Services Committee to have a hearing, because, as you recall yesterday--I certainly do vividly, because I spent hours in the debate--our distinguished colleague, Senator ROTH of Delaware, brought in a most significant record, and I think the Senate would likewise want a live record on this critical issue that you bring before the Senate. 
   Therefore, a hearing would avail you--and I hope you would avail yourself to chair that hearing--of the opportunity to develop a record to bring to the Senate so Senators would have the benefit of that record to make this important vote. 
   For that reason--perhaps you would like to finish your presentation tonight so it is there in the RECORD--perhaps you will consider that, and we will not proceed with the amendment further, that you will take it down.

   Mr. WARNER. I thank my good friend for his cooperation and understanding. This is an important chapter of naval history. Some of our colleagues have not had the opportunity to look at it as extensively as has the Senator, plus I think the record of some live testimony will be helpful. 
   So to inform Senators, the Senator from New Hampshire will proceed for such time as he desires to conclude his opening statement. Then following that, the Senator from New Hampshire will send to the desk an amendment relating to funding on the Kosovo operations; am I not correct on that, I ask the Senator?

I now ask unanimous consent that when Senator SMITH from New Hampshire offers an amendment regarding Kosovo, which will take place not later than the hour of 7:00, there be 60 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to a vote on or in relation to the amendment. I finally ask consent that no amendment be in order to the amendment prior to the vote.

</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-warner-va-55-19990526</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WARNER. Senator, we have had many debates on the floor of the Senate about this very divisive war. The Senator from New Hampshire, from the very beginning, has been absolutely clear as to his views, and I respect them. I differ with them, but I respect them. 
   I will not go over the entire history of what I and other Senators have said about this. These are those Members who believed that once the commitment was made by this Nation as an integral part, as a full partner, of NATO, to the other 18 nations, that was it; it was to support our troops and to do what we can. 
   What worries me about the amendment is that it would send a signal to Milosevic: Hang tough. 
   This is the man who, as just clearly stated, has divided the whole world, has divided every precedent of human rights. Would it not send a message to him to hang in there? No matter what we are able to inflict, hang in there, because on October 1 the United States pulls out of NATO and leaves it to the other 18 nations if they wish to carry on? 
   That is my first question. 
   The second question: What do we say to the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and the other nations flying missions, some eight or nine nations flying missions? What do we say to them? They are in the cockpit right now, taking risks, risking life and limb. Did the Senator think about stopping it as of tonight? That was an option I am sure the Senator considered. 
   Those are the two questions I pose to my good friend. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-warner-va-56-19990526</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WARNER. What do we say to the young men and women flying these missions? Their mission tonight, tomorrow night, and into the indefinite future is to carry out the orders of the Commander in Chief of the United States and the guiding military group in NATO. They salute, march off, get in the cockpit, fly off, and take risks. In my judgment, they are making some slow but, nevertheless, steady progress in degrading the military machine of Milosevic. When they fly home, they drop their orders, and they can at least say it was another chip away toward the end result and the five basic points that NATO has laid down to resolve this conflict. 
   If we are to pass this and they fly the mission, they will wonder: Am I going to be the last person to die on the last day of 
   this war, which would be September 30, 1999? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-warner-va-57-19990526</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. WARNER. The first part of my question was, Does this not send a signal to Milosevic to just hang tough and disrupt every effort being made, whether by the United States, Germany or, indeed, Russia, in trying to negotiate some diplomatic resolution? 
   I understand that the Russian delegation could be arriving within the next 48-72 hours. The Deputy Secretary of State, Strobe Talbott, is finishing--if he hasn't already today--some discussions in Russia relating to that mission. It seems to me that the diplomatic process would come to a standstill. 
   Milosevic will say to his people, we have stayed this long, stay the course. If the United States pulls out, I think Milosevic could go to his people and say there is little likelihood that the other nations might continue on. And, furthermore, look who is flying the missions. Over 50 percent of the tactical missions are by U.S. pilots. Over 70 percent of the support aircraft, the tanker aircraft, the intelligence aircraft, are all flown by the United States. 
   It would have the effect of disabling NATO from carrying on if it so desired.

   Mr. WARNER. As I said when we began the debate, I respect the views of my long-time friend. He comes from a distinguished military family. He served, himself, in the uniform of the United States. We have a very diverse group in the Senate with regard to their views on this conflict. 
   There is not a one of us who was not deeply concerned before we became involved in this conflict. We are in it now. I salute here tonight the professionalism that has been shown by the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States, in particular, and joined by their counterparts from some eight other nations in the air, and the other NATO nations in one way or another that have participated in this conflict. 
   We are in it because our generation cannot tolerate what we have seen Milosevic do to human beings. To do so would be to reject, indeed, what other men and women have done in previous generations to bring about freedom for others: World War II, followed by Korea, followed by Vietnam. We are there to protect freedom. We are there to protect the rights of human beings to have some basic quality of life and ability to exist. 
   I remember the peak of this event. When we got started, it was just before Easter. I went back to my constituents and, indeed, they asked me: Why should we be there? I said: Could you be at home on Easter Sunday, sharing with millions and millions of Americans the experience of your respected place of religion, sharing with your family a bountiful meal, and watch the pictures of the deprivation, the murder, the rape, the mayhem inflicted by Milosevic and his lieutenants on fellow human beings? 
   Yes, they are Kosovars; yes, they are far away; yes, they speak a different language. I was there in September. I traveled in Kosovo, in Pristina, in Macedonia. At that time, I saw these people being driven from their homes. Not distant from where we were driving--we were permitted by the Yugoslav Army to take certain roads--we could see the burning houses; we could hear the shells. The war was in full progress in other areas several miles distant from the route that we took. 
   We could not stand by, as a free people, and see in Europe a repetition of the horrors that visited Europe in World War II. So we are there. My vote tonight in opposition to my good friend is because I am pledged and committed to the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and the other nations. I am pledged and committed to the survival of NATO, not just as a political entity but for what NATO stands for, the principles for which it stands. I encourage my colleagues to do likewise. 
   We will somehow, as a collection of free nations, bring this tragic conflict to a halt. When and exactly how, none of us knows.

Senator HARKIN has 20 minutes, and we will divide, say, another 20 minutes between the distinguished ranking member and myself, should we need it. That would be a total of 40 minutes on the debate. I think maybe I will say 15 minutes between the two of us and 15 minutes to Senator ALLARD, 20 minutes for Senator HARKIN. I think that should do it. 
   We will just have to establish the time that we will vote on the Allard amendment tomorrow morning.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, last night the distinguished Senator ROTH and I had an extensive debate on this issue, and we are basically covering much of the same ground this morning. I repeat, I just got off the phone with the Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen, his predecessor, Bill Perry. 
   The Dorn report went through this whole case very carefully. 
   I recited the list of some nine tribunals, including the Congress of the United States, that reviewed this matter, and certainly did not reach any conclusion that the action to which my good friend and colleague, the Senator from Delaware, asks the Senate to do today. 
   I associate myself with the remarks of our colleague from Texas. 
   But it is interesting. This is very extensive research performed by our colleague. I took the liberty of taking the book last night and going home to read it, which is a summary of the congressional hearings. What I find interesting is that the Congress absolutely put forward some of the most distinguished Members of the House and the Senate to form the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack: Alben Barkley, Senator from Kentucky was the chairman; Jere Cooper, Representative from Tennessee, was the Vice Chairman. On the Senate side, just look at the names of the individuals. Based on my own not personal knowledge but study of their careers in the Senate, they certainly were viewed as among the giants of the Senate during that critical period in history of  World War II: Walter F. George, Senator from Georgia; Scott Lucas, Senator from Illinois; Owen Brewster, Senator from Maine; Homer Ferguson, Senator from Michigan. They were the elderly statesmen, the leaders of the Senate. 
   In their report, this is what the Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack found. I refer to page 252. It says: 
   ``Specifically, the Hawaiian commands failed'' to do the following. By ``the Hawaiian commands,'' of course, they are referring to the Naval command under Admiral Kimmel and the Army command under General Short:

   Mr. WARNER. The Clausen investigation, September 12, 1945; and, the joint congressional committee of May of 1945. 
   It is the joint congressional committee record--to now, after these many 50-plus years, go back and reverse the decisions of all of this work done by individuals, as the Senator from Texas pointed out, with the authority to render such judgments would be to say to them: All of you are in error for not having done what the Senator from Delaware requested the Senate do these 50-plus years later. 
   I just think that is a very unwise decision. I think the Senator from Delaware has put an awful lot of hard work into this. I respect him for it. But I simply cannot support the Senator, nor can the current Secretary of Defense, and, indeed, the previous Secretary of Defense, and others who have looked at this set of documents previously. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I cannot accept the basic premise on which the distinguished Senator from Delaware addresses his case; that is, that there was a disposition among good and honest men not to accord fairness, equity, and justice to these two individuals. They were the subject of repeated inquiries. As a matter of fact, the Roberts Commission was headed by a Supreme Court Justice. Throughout the whole judicial history, in the common law of England, which we incorporated in our judicial history, speedy trial is the essence of our justice. The appellate procedure has to thereafter proceed with some expedition. You cannot wait 50-some-plus years to address an issue such as this. What do you say to the congressional committee? Do you dispute the findings of this committee?

   Mr. WARNER. We gave the names of some of the most revered elder statesmen of this body who presided, such as Alben Barkley. And, indeed, President Truman had to address, in 1947, as Senator ROTH and I covered last night, the tombstone promotions, which were given to officers of this category, and deny them. Truman himself had to make that decision. So I say to my good friend, many fair-minded individuals have reviewed this case and have come up with the determination that they were not the only ones who had culpability, but certainly, as I read it, this commission of the Congress of the United States found a serious basis for holding the action and making the decision that they did.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the admirals the Senator enumerated were ones I had the pleasure of knowing, serving with several, and for whom I have a great deal of respect. But I note the absence of any similar number of Army generals coming forward on behalf of General Short. Perhaps the Senator has something in the RECORD. But I think that silence speaks to authenticate the position that this Senator and others have taken. 
   To the very strong, forceful statement of my colleague who said it is implicit that all responsibility for this tragedy is assigned to these two individuals, that is not correct. The Dorn report said it is to be shared. In fact, General Marshall stepped forward with courage and accepted publicly, at the very time this was being examined, his share of responsibility. 
   So I say others, indeed, General Marshall and others, stepped forward.

   First, we welcome the Senator's support on this. But I think he would agree with me that that letter was written at the time when the language was still being worked, and of course it predates the final language as adopted by the 50th anniversary summit. That language is the object of this, I think, very credible inquiry by Mr. ROBERTS, myself, and others.

   Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will yield, the amendment, as carefully crafted, does not have the word ``legal'' in it. It imposes any ``new commitment.'' Indeed, there are political commitments that give rise to actions from time to time. So I recognize the Senator's focus on ``legal,'' but it does not limit the certification solely to legal. It embraces any new commitment or obligation of the United States.

I went back and asked the Senator from Delaware to clarify the date, time, group, and when it was prepared and submitted to the Senate. He is doing that. 
   But I just wish to draw the attention to the Senate, as I read this document--and I have seen it before--it simply refers to those portions in the Kyl amendment that were incorporated into the final draft of the Strategic Concept. But it does not, on its face, nor do I believe it was intended to, say that it covered everything by the new Strategic Concept. 
   Indeed, I agree with the Senator from Kansas this document in no way is intended to represent that it encompasses all of the new Strategic Concept. The Senator from Kansas is quite properly pointing out there are those of us--the Senator from Kansas, myself, and others--who feel the Strategic Concept went beyond the Kyl amendment.

This represents a hearing held by a joint committee of the Senate and House of the Congress of the United States in 1946. They had before them live witnesses, all of the documents, and it is clear from this and their findings that these two officers were then and remain today accused of serious errors in judgment which contributed to perhaps the greatest disaster in this century against the people of the United States of America. 
   There are absolutely no new facts beyond those deduced in this record brought out by my distinguished good friend, the senior Senator from Delaware. For that reason, we oppose it.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, noting the presence of the Senator from Kansas, the amendment by the Senator from Kansas raises a very good point; that is, at the 50th anniversary of the NATO summit, those in attendance, the 19 nations, the heads of state and government, adopted a new Strategic Concept. 
   The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that that Concept does not go beyond the confines of the 1949 Washington Treaty and such actions that took place in 1991 when a new Strategic Concept was drawn. 
   A number of us are concerned, if we read through the language, that it opens up new vistas for NATO. If that be the case, then the Senate should have that treaty before it for consideration. This is a sense of the Senate, but despite that technicality, it is a very important amendment; it is one to which the President will respond. 
   I understand from my distinguished colleague and ranking member, in all probability, we will receive the assurance from the President that it does not go beyond the foundations and objectives sought in the 1949 Washington Treaty.

For example, first it is directing the President of the United States pursuant to the Constitution and the War Powers Resolution. I have been here 21 years. I think the Senator from Pennsylvania is just a year or two shy of that. This War Powers Resolution has never been accepted by any President, Republican or Democrat or otherwise. Am I not correct in that respect?

   Mr. WARNER. Therefore, we would not be precipitating in another one of those endless debates which would consume hours and hours of the time of this body if we are acting on the predicate that this President is now going to acknowledge that he, as President of the United States, is bound by what is law? I readily admit it is the law. But we have witnessed, over these 20-plus years that I have been here and over the years the Senator from Pennsylvania has been here, that no President will acknowledge that he is subservient to this act of Congress because he feels that it is unconstitutional; that the Constitution has said he is Commander in Chief and he has the right to make decisions with respect to the Armed Forces of the United States on a minute's notice. Really, this is what concerns me about this amendment, among other things.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, perhaps when I said hours and hours, it could be days and days. But we would come out with the same result. Presidents haven't complied with the act. They have ``complied with the spirit of the act.'' I believe that is how they have acknowledged it in the correspondence with the Congress.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, let me ask another question of my colleague. We will soon be receiving a briefing from the Secretaries of State, Defense and the National Security Adviser and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. I will absent myself during that period, and the Senator from Pennsylvania will have the opportunity to control the floor. I hope there would be no unanimous consent requests in my absence. I hope that would be agreeable with my good friend, because I have asked for this meeting.

   Mr. WARNER. That is fine. I asked for this meeting and have arranged it for the Senate. So I have to go upstairs. But I point out: Suppose we were to adopt this, and supposing that during the month of August when the Senate would be in recess the President had to make a decision with regard to ground troops. Then he would have to, practically speaking, bring the Congress back to town. Would that not be correct?

   Mr. WARNER. But the reason for introducing ground troops, whatever it may be, might require a decision of less than an hour to make on behalf of the Chief Executive, the Commander in Chief, and he would be then shackled with the necessary time of, say, maybe 48 hours in which to bring the Members of Congress back from various places throughout the United States and throughout the world. To me, that imposes on the President something that was never envisioned by the Founding Fathers. And that is why he is given the power of Commander in Chief. Our power is the power of the purse, to  which I again direct the Senator's attention in the text of the amendment. But it seems to me I find the title in 
   conflict with the text of the amendment.

Before the Senator from Pennsylvania specifically advised me he was going to assert his rights, which he has since his amendment was the pending business of the Senate following the three votes, I put in place a modest time slot for our colleague from Colorado, such that he could address the Senate on the general provisions of the underlying bill. But then we reached a subsequent time agreement to accommodate the Senator from Pennsylvania. 
   It is my request, in the course of this debate, if the Senator could, within the parameters of the two unanimous consents, work out a situation where he could have about 15 minutes and then we could return to your debate?

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on that point, we have been conducting a meeting for almost an hour in S-407, attended by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the National Security Adviser to the President, Mr. Berger, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. In the course of their presentations to some 40-plus Senators, in response to questions and in direct presentation, they reiterated that the President will formally come before the Congress and ask for any changes he deems necessary involving ground troops before he would implement or agree to implement with other NATO nations such a plan. That has just been stated on two occasions up in S-407. There was no equivocation. It was very clear in their declaration on behalf of the President. I acquainted them with the amendment which is now being debated on the floor of the Senate. 
   Earlier indications from the Secretary of Defense to me today were that should this amendment as drawn now appear in a conference report, it would be the recommendation of the Secretaries of State and Defense to veto. 
   I am pointing out to the Senate that again we revisit many, many times this whole war powers concept. We acknowledge that both Republican Presidents and Democrat Presidents have absolutely steadfastly refused to comply with the letter of the law, but they have complied with the spirit of the law. 
   In this instance, the President has indicated to the Senate in that letter--and just now in the briefings by his principal Cabinet officers--that he would formally--I use the word ``formal'' to clarify--come to the Congress and request their concurrence for any departure from his 
   preposition. That preposition was just moments ago restated by Secretaries Cohen and Albright in response to my question, which was, question No. 1, to allow me to return to the floor with regard to any nonpermissive force being put in place, which I favor, by the way, to send a signal. They said that would not be done. The President has no intention of doing it, nor do the NATO allies. And should the President decide at some later date, for whatever reason, to begin to preposition such forces, then he would come before the Congress prior thereto and get legislative approval. 
   I believe very strongly that this amendment would put this bill in severe jeopardy in terms of getting it signed, and that the President and his principal advisers have in the past and again today advised the Congress that the President is prepared to deal with the spirit of this amendment and to come before the Congress and seek its formal concurrence by legislative action should he and other NATO allies in the future make a decision to depart from the present policy. 
   I have just been handed a modification. It is one that the Senator from Pennsylvania and I have discussed. I don't know if my colleague has had an opportunity to see it. 
   If there are other Senators who wish to speak, I need time within which to consider this modification. Unless other Senators seek recognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. WARNER. This is a matter which the Armed Services Committee considered with some care and considerable debate. It is not as if we just accepted it. There was discussion, and our former chairman spoke very strongly on behalf of the other side of the issue. 
   I am just astonished that we cannot seem to convince the prison group that competition would be good. It would raise the quality. That is what concerns so many of us on the committee. It would provide incentives for the Federal Prison Industries to deliver quality goods in a timely fashion and at a reasonable price. That is what this whole country is predicated on. 
   This is interesting. The Department of the Air Force gets 2 million plus in launchers, guided-missile launchers, fiber optic cable assemblies. People think they are doing little, simple things, crafts and so forth, but there is a lot of high-tech equipment at the Department of Defense. 
   Here is the Army, another guided-missile remote control; the Army, launchers, rocket and pyrotech; the Army, fiber rope, cordage; the Army, radio and TV communications equipment; the Army, antennas, wave guides and related; the Army, fiber optic cable assemblies. 
   I mean, these are hardly simple matters. These are very complicated systems. We simply have to have quality for the Department of Defense. This is what concerns me. 
   I could go on into some of the Navy engine electrical systems, all kinds of high-tech stuff listed in here. You see the office furniture, the office supplies. Here is one for some armor. In other words, we are talking about serious business for the Department of Defense. It is very serious business. We cannot be giving the strong disadvantage in the competitive world to the prisons and have them supply inferior equipment. I strongly urge Senators to vote against this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the course of the afternoon, as I said to my good friend and colleague, some 40 Senators have received the benefit of a full debate with the Secretaries of State and Defense, and the President's National Security Adviser, Mr. Berger, and with the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Three times--twice by this Senator, one by another Senator--this very issue was posed to the national security team. They said without any equivocation whatsoever that the President would formally come to 
   the Congress and seek legislation, not unlike what is described in this amendment prior to any change. In other words, the President of the United States is presently unchanged in the course of action that he is recommending to other leaders of the NATO nations, and the matter remains and will not be changed with reference to ground troops unless the President comes up and seeks from the Congress of the United States formal legislative action. 
   I say to my good friend that I think we have achieved, in essence, what he seeks. As I pointed out in my first comments this morning and, indeed, in the title to the first amendment prior to the amending by the Senator from Pennsylvania, he referred to the War Powers Act, this is precisely what this debate is--a debate over the War Powers Act. That debate has not in my 21 years in this body ever been resolved, and I doubt it is going to be resolved on this vote. 
   I yield the floor and yield back the time.

   Mr. WARNER. That is the problem that troubles the Senator from Virginia the most--the California and Texas experiences. 
   As I listened to my good friend from Arizona, he made rational positions and I agree with him; the Senator from New Jersey made rational positions. 
   However, the practical thing that will happen if the Congress of the United States were to enact a base closure bill--this bill--the day after the signature is affixed by the President, the work begins in the Department of Defense down at the level of the services to work up the list of communities which, in the judgment of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force and certain DOD facilities is to be boarded up, and eventually it 
   goes to the BRAC Commission. 
   True, the next President would appoint that BRAC Commission. But the staff work would have been done. 
   The communities all across America, as my good friend from Arizona pointed out in repeating my statement, become suddenly on full alert that it could be their base. They have a long tradition in this country of embracing that base. It is not just because of economic reasons and jobs. It is also, as the Senator well knows, because of the tradition in the community. 
   Does the Senator realize I was the Secretary of the Navy who closed the largest naval base and destroyer base in your State? Your predecessor, Senator Pastore, brought this humble public servant, the Secretary of the Navy, down to the caucus room of the Senate of the Russell Building before more cameras than I have ever seen and grilled me for hour after hour after hour, together with the Chief of Naval Operations. That convinced me that we had to have a process called BRAC. 
   I say with humility I was the coauthor of the first BRAC statute, coauthor of the second BRAC statute. Then I lost confidence in BRAC because of what the Senator just said--the politicization of the process as it related to decisions in California and Texas. If we were to pass this all over America, these communities would suddenly begin to wonder: Will politics play as the bureaucrats in the Department of Defense begin their assigned task to work up those lists that slowly go to the top and eventually to the BRAC Commission? 
   Mr. President, that is the problem. That is a problem shared by so many of our colleagues. That was the problem that was shared by the majority of our committee, the Armed Services Committee, on which we all serve with great pride. In two instances, that committee turned down the proposal which the Senators bring before the Senate tonight. That is the process.

   Mr. WARNER. Yes, the solution, regrettably, I say to my good friend, is that we have to wait until the next President determines whether or not in his judgment we should have a BRAC Commission and he comes before the Congress and he requests it. 
   I will commit right now, no matter who wins the office of the Presidency, including, if I may say with great respect, yourself, I would be the first to sponsor a BRAC Commission under the McCain administration and I will work relentlessly to get it through the Senate. 
   But that would be the moment that the bureaucracy begins to work up the list of the communities.

The work begins literally down in the bowels of that building, in which I was privileged to remain for 5 1/2 years, down at the low level of the staff beginning to work up those lists. And that political problem that arose in California and Texas could begin to creep into those basement and lower areas in the Pentagon, begin to influence those decisions which would gravitate to the top.

   Because the moment the ink is dry and this becomes law--would the Senator not agree with me that the staff work begins on this the day it becomes law? The decisions begin to be made. The communities all across America go on full alert. The communities begin to hire expensive consultants to help them in the process, to prepare their case so that community is not struck. Am I not correct? Does any one of the three wish to dispute that the work begins at the bureaucratic level, by honest, conscientious individuals----

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today the Senate begins consideration of S. 1059, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000. 
   It is my distinct privilege as chairman to make the initial statement regarding this bill. I acknowledge the presence on the floor of my senior and most respected member, Mr. THURMOND, the former chairman of the Armed Services Committee. He will be speaking to the Senate just after the statements by the chairman and the ranking member. I thank Senator LEVIN, the ranking member. We came to the Senate together. I think this is our 21st year. We have collaborated on many, many special assignments given to us by previous chairmen and/or ranking members through the years. I value our professional relationship and, indeed, our friendship. 
   I also wish to pay special acknowledgment to the subcommittee chairmen of the Armed Services Committee. Prior to this year, for some 20 years, I was a subcommittee chairman. I understand the role of a subcommittee chairman on our committee. But I must say, with great humility, I think each of the subcommittee chairmen this year exceeded beyond any current precedent their leadership, their hard work, together with their ranking member, in  preparing the respective parts of this bill over which their subcommittees have jurisdiction. 
   We have on our committee today marvelous participation by all members of the committee, on both sides of the aisle. I think our committee has historically operated and tried in every way to be nonpartisan on matters of defense, and we have succeeded. 
   We are supported by just an extraordinary professional staff, and indeed other Members have their various personal staff members who work with the professional staff, and it is all a team together working to produce not only the bill but throughout the year to be responsive to each and every Member of the Senate with regard to their requests, or whatever the case may be, as they relate to the jurisdiction of our committee. So I thank them all at this time, as we begin this very important presentation to the Senate for the year 2000. 
   I am extremely pleased to observe that this is the first time in nearly 15 years--15 consecutive years--that the defense budget before the Senate represents an increase in real terms, real dollars in our defense spending. This is a much-needed change, one that recognizes the problems brought on by 14 years of decline in defense spending. This overlaps, as the Chair will quickly recognize, both Republican and Democrat administrations. So this is not a political statement, although I do believe that the cuts under President Clinton have been too long and too deep. It was this year that the President, largely at the urging of a very courageous and fine Secretary of Defense, our former colleague, Secretary Cohen, and, indeed, members of the Joint Chiefs, gave his support to raising defense spending levels. 
   Today, particularly under President Clinton, who has sent forward our troops into harm's way more times on more different specific missions than any other President in the history of this country, we are asking every day, every month, every year, more and more of the men and women of the armed services at a time when we have this very, very low level of manning of all branches of our services. 
   At the same period, this world remains a place of ever increasing violence and uncertainty. As U.S. national interests are challenged throughout the globe, it is incumbent upon our military to be prepared to act when necessary, and act they have, with extraordinary commitment and professionalism. 
   Our military forces are currently strained by ongoing day-to-day operations. The contingency operations in Bosnia, Iraq, and throughout the Balkan regions are putting a very severe strain on our overall manning and commitments, and the families --may I underline ``the families''--of these service members. In order for the military to respond effectively, it must receive the resources necessary to equip, train, and operate. 
   Unfortunately, after years of declining budgets and continually increasing deployments overseas, the military services are showing the beginning signs of this overburdening. Recruiting and retention problems are leading to shortfalls in key skills. Insufficient procurement budgets have left our forces with equipment that is somewhat unreliable because of age and, indeed, more costly every day to maintain. Inadequate infrastructure funding has resulted in the degradation of the facilities in which our military personnel work and live. 
   We must provide additional resources if we are to preserve this Nation's security and the readiness of its Armed Forces. That is why this bill before the Senate authorizes $288.8 billion in budget authority for fiscal year 2000--$8.3 billion above the President's request. 
   I commend the majority leader of the Senate, Senator LOTT, for his support and his leadership. It doesn't just go back a few weeks; it goes back well into last year. When consulting with him and, indeed, our distinguished chairman at that time, Senator THURMOND, the three of us recognized, together with other leaders in the Senate, such as Senator STEVENS and Senator DOMENICI, that we have to bring about a reversal in this decline of defense spending. Those are the origins of the change of this curve. 
   I want to note the extraordinary relationship that exists today between our committee and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. I particularly thank Senator STEVENS and his staff director, Steve Cortese, for their cooperation and support throughout the process of putting this bill together. Hopefully, Senator STEVENS will follow soon behind with his bill so that the Senate can have both to consider. 
   At this point I wish to take a moment to give credit to the Joint Chiefs of Staff for helping to secure the additional funding for defense. I think this is the first year in my 21 years that they have stepped forward with such absolute determination, vigor, and professional honesty and integrity and told the Senate--in effect, told the American people--of the concerns they have not only for their personnel but for the lack of funding needed to train the personnel, the research and development needed for the future, and the procurement decline we have experienced through these years. They came before the Senate committee last September and again in January, and they were very forthright. I don't doubt for a minute that their determination was the primary reason the President and the Secretary of Defense stepped up and began to support additional funding. 
   The Secretary of Defense, of course, all along had been counseling the President, but I want to pay special respect to the Joint Chiefs. 
   It is by necessity that I address this question of the shortfall in defense spending and lay it out historically over these 15 years. 
   But let no one, let no nation, let no leader, let no rogue or terrorist think for a moment that the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States, together with their equipment and their readiness and training, aren't prepared to turn back any threat posed against this Nation, or this Nation together with its allies. 
   In numerous committee hearings this year, the frightening magnitude of some of these problems was revealed. General Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff stated, ``Anecdotal and now measurable evidence indicates that our current readiness is fraying and that the long-term health of the Total Force is in jeopardy.'' General Shelton further informed the committee that our ability to execute our national military strategy has declined so severely that it would ``*.*.* take us more time, and that time to victory would mean that we would lose terrain that we subsequently would have to regain. It means that the casualties to the U.S. would be higher.'' Furthermore, according to the latest Quarterly Readiness Report: ``*.*.* there are currently 118 CINC-identified readiness related deficiencies, of which 32 are designated category 1 deficiencies--ones which entail significant war fighting risk to execution of the National Military Strategy and are key risk drivers for the MTW, Major Theater War, scenarios.'' 
   During the committee's hearings on September 29, 1998 and January 5, 1999, the Service Chiefs outlined the essential funding requirements necessary to maintain the readiness of the armed forces. General Shelton and the Chiefs identified a series of readiness and modernization problems that, without additional funding of approximately $17.5 billion per year--I 
   repeat, Mr. President--$17.5 billion per year--would continue to degrade our military capability. 
   This figure does not include the additional funding necessary for contingency operations such as those we are facing in Kosovo today and in Bosnia and Iraq. It does not include additional funding for these contingency operations and increased pay and retirement benefits necessary to address the serious problems in recruiting and retention. This would cause additional requirements to exceed $20 billion per year. 
   While the committee acknowledges that the administration's budget request contained additional money for defense--primarily because of the Joint Chiefs and Secretary Cohen's direct pleas to the President, the proposed budget request for fiscal year 2000 still falls short of meeting the Service Chief's minimum requirements. 
   One of the noteworthy shortfalls within the budget request is the Administration's request to incrementally fund military construction. Such incremental funding would actually result in increased costs and delays in  the construction of critical facilities. In addition, although the administration's fiscal year 2000 request represents an increase of approximately $500.0 million over the fiscal year 1999 budget request, it does not adequately fund the quality of life needs of the military departments. Therefore, the bill before the Senate allocates an additional $3.3 billion to MILCON to fully fund the fiscal year 2000 military construction and family housing programs requested by the Administration, and to fund additional quality of life programs--those determined by the members of our committee to have that high priority. 
   A focus of the committee's action this year has been to address the serious problems we are having with recruiting and retaining a quality force. In January, the committee moved quickly to report out--and the Senate subsequently passed--S. 4, The Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. 
   The act authorized a 4.8-percent pay raise, reformed the military pay tables, and improved the military retirement system. 
   The National Defense Authorization Act for 2000--this bill--includes pay and compensation elements of S. 4, as well as other innovative proposals to offer incentives to potential recruits and active-duty personnel. 
   We believe the policies recommended in this bill will enable the military services to recruit and retain the number of quality personnel required to meet our national military strategy. 
   That is the heart and soul of this bill. 
   Again, I wish to commend Senator LOTT and others who let this committee move out and have this as the first bill in the Senate 
   to send the strongest message to the men and women in the Armed Forces all across the world that the Congress of the United States--certainly the Senate--stands beside them to see they are properly compensated and that their families receive a fair return for their services and the risks they take. 
   There it is. It is in here. I hope it receives the strongest support of the Senate. 
   The funding level of $288.8 billion for defense contained in the bill before the Senate represents a real increase of 2.2 percent over the fiscal year 1999 level. With the additional $8.3 billion over the budget request, the committee has done the following: 
   Added more than $1.2 billion to primary readiness accounts, including ammunition, training funds, base operations, and real property maintenance. 
   Two, authorized net increases of $509.3 million for ballistic missile defense programs; $218 million for military space programs and technologies; $111.6 million for strategic nuclear delivery vehicle modernization; and $55 million and a fraction for military intelligence programs; authorized $12.2 billion for atomic energy defense activities under the Department of Energy, an $187 million increase over the 1999 funding levels. That is an area in which the Presiding Officer has taken a great deal of interest through the years. 
   Recommended a comprehensive set of provisions to enhance safeguards, security and counterintelligence at DOE facilities in response to recent and very, very grave and serious allegations regarding lack of security at DOE laboratories. 
   We are learning every day about this breakdown in our counterintelligence. Members are participating in this analyzation. It is very serious and requires the closest attention by every single Member of the Senate. 
   The committee has spent a good deal of time examining the allegations of Chinese espionage at the DOE facilities. The initiatives contained in this bill, I believe, will go a long way toward fixing the problems that Congress continues to discover. I say ``continues,'' because more and more comes out every day. 
   In addition to the other items contained in this package, we have put into statute many of the items contained in the Presidential Decision Directive 61. The Secretary of Energy has indicated his support for our legislation. That is in this bill. We passed these provisions with strong bipartisan support in the committee. 
   We also authorized a $855 million increase to the procurement budget request and a $213 million increase to research, development, test, and evaluation for the Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force seapower and strategic lift programs. In addition, the committee authorized the budget requests for construction of six new ships and robust research and development in the future ships DD-21, CVN(X), the Virginia class submarines, and CVN-77. 
   We added nearly $1.9 billion to procure a range of critical, unfunded requirements, and over $280 million of vital research and development activities for both air and land forces. 
   We establish 17 new National Guard Rapid Assessment and Initial Detection Teams for domestic response to terrorist attacks involving weapons of mass destruction. 
   This is a problem that this Senator considers the most 
   serious facing the United States of America. That is, terrorism, which no longer is beyond our shores but which could be brought to our shores by any of the people crossing through the ports and the airports of this great nation of ours. Regrettably, even someone of deranged mind here at home could bring about the use of weapons of mass destruction. 
   Therefore, this Senator, and indeed this committee, is giving its strongest support to prepare ourselves, hopefully, to deter any such attacks. If they occur, then the resources of the Department of Defense stand well trained to assist other departments and agencies of this Government in bringing about what solutions we would be faced with in such a horrible situation. 
   I established a new subcommittee this year called Merging Threats under the very capable leadership of the Senator from Kansas, Senator ROBERTS. He will have more to say today about the very valuable work of this subcommittee and its ranking member and other Members toward what I have described in meeting this particular threat here at home. 
   These particular teams, each comprised of 22 full-time National Guard personnel specifically trained and equipped to deploy and assess suspected nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological events in support of local first responders--that is, the local police, the local rescue, hospitals, volunteers all across our country; that is a local responding--would provide greater team coverage nationwide and greatly increase our ability to respond quickly to terrorist attack in the United States of America. 
   Now, I note that the National Guard is involved. Throughout this bill, throughout current military history, there is an ever and ever increasing role for the Guard and Reserve forces. They comprise the total force, when you calculate the military capabilities of this country, and as each year goes by, more and more responsibility must be shared by the Active Forces with the Guard and the Reserve. They have performed brilliantly. 
   Further, we establish a Department of Defense central transfer account for all funds to combat terrorism both at home and abroad, establish an information assurance initiative to strengthen DOD's information assurance program, and add an additional $120 million to the administration's request for information assurance programs, projects, and activities. 
   The committee also considered additional base closings. This is a very serious subject, and my colleague, Mr. LEVIN, will have more to say about this, as will Senator MCCAIN. During markup, the committee addressed two amendments submitted by these Senators. Both were not voted favorably by the committee. 
   Speaking for myself, I have historically supported BRAC as a means of reducing excess military infrastructure. As Secretary of the Navy, I remember vividly having closed the Boston Naval Shipyard, one of the most significant base closings since World War II. I know how difficult it is on the local community and the State to see one of these facilities close. It is not just a matter of economics, although that is very serious; it is a matter of pride; it is a matter of patriotism; it is a matter of generations of association of the men and women of the military forces who were trained at and operated these bases. It goes back into the sinews of our history. 
   Today, it is quite clear that the infrastructure and our inventory exceeds that which is needed by the current levels of the Armed Forces. Much of our war-fighting capability has  changed dramatically. I remember the first BRAC. I was coauthor of that legislation. We closed a number of the old cavalry outposts that were built for the sole reason of protecting the territories when Americans were settling the West. 
   By the time we got around, I think, 10, 12 or 15 years ago, to closing these bases, they had long since outlasted their military contribution to the overall security of our Nation. Historically, the country has always been behind. 
   Again, I was the coauthor of the last BRAC bill. However, this time I declined and voted against the BRAC legislation for reasons that I will state more succinctly and fully at the time the amendment is brought to the floor today. 
   I believe the bill before the Senate is a vital first step in enhancing military readiness, modernizing our forces, and improving the quality of life of our service members and their families. 
   I urge my colleagues to send a strong signal of support, a strong signal of support to the men and women of the Armed Forces bravely performing their responsibilities as their forefathers have done throughout the history of this great Nation, formed 209-plus years ago. I anticipate with this bill and the bills that will follow we will always keep America strong, a beacon of hope and freedom and security to the whole world. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. I commend the Senator. We have been working on parallel tracks on this issue for some months now. I cannot think of a more important amendment that will be added to this bill than the one of which my distinguished colleague from Kansas is the principal sponsor. At this very moment, well over half of the tactical aircraft are being operated by U.S. air men and women; well over 70 percent of the support aircraft, the tankers, the intelligence aircraft and all of those, the spotters and the like, are being operated by U.S. airpersons. 
   It is the Strategic Airlift Command which is heroically--together with the Air Guard, I add, which, of course, is part of that command--carrying out the vast preponderance of the missions associated with airlift in this operation in Kosovo. 
   If there is one thing this operation tells us, it is that future conflicts are becoming more and more dependent on modern technology. The weapons being employed in this air-only campaign are guided missiles, again predominantly provided by the United States. 
   The other nations of NATO, for whatever reasons, simply have not equipped themselves or trained their personnel in sufficient numbers to conduct an operation of this magnitude. That is not in any way to detract from their courage in flying their missions, and approximately eight other nations are joining in this air operation. Whether they are single aircraft, or two aircraft or one mission a day--whatever it is--they are an integral part. I salute them, and I respect them, but statistically, it is the taxpayers of the United States and it is the young men and women wearing the uniform of the United States who are carrying the brunt of this operation. 
   The Senator brings to the attention of the Senate that at this 50th anniversary summit conference, this document, to which he has referred several times, was adopted. In any reading of this document by this Senator, and I think any other Senator, it will clearly show that it is the intention of the summit to push beyond the horizon of the original NATO of 1949, to push beyond the horizon of the 1991 Strategic Concept the potential missions of this historic organization. 
   It is the absolute fundamental right of the Senate, under the treaty clause of the Constitution, to review in detail, and 
   I say carefully, what is proposed--I repeat, proposed--by the 50th anniversary summit. 
   The Senate Armed Services Committee will conduct a series of hearings once the hostilities and the risk of NATO forces is in one way or another--I hesitate to use the word ``terminated'' because I am not certain if that word is applicable to this situation which in itself is so filled with uncertainty, but whenever the hostilities are contained to the point where the Armed Services Committee can begin to look at what went right and what went wrong in the conduct of the military operations and, most particularly--most particularly--this consensus by the 19-nation doctrine by which this operation has been, is, and will be conducted for an indefinite period of time. 
   I first became concerned about this new doctrine early this spring. I wrote to the President on April 7 urging him not to allow the summit to ``finalize''--that is the word I used--or write in stone, I said at that time, a new Strategic Concept. Why not just wait until the Kosovo operation gets to that point where hopefully hostilities have subsided and you sit down and study that operation, and from that study you would be better able to devise what NATO should do in the future regarding comparable operations. 
   I said:  
   The intent of this letter is to give you my personal view that a final decision by NATO on the Strategic Concept should not be taken--risked--against the uncertainties emanating from the Kosovo situation. The United States and our allies will have many lessons learned to assess as a pivotal part of the future Strategic Concept. Bosnia and Kosovo have been NATO's first forays into aggressive military operations. As of this writing----  
   That is April 7--  
   the Kosovo situation is having a destabilizing effect on the few gains made to date in Bosnia. This combined situation must be carefully assessed and evaluated before the United States and our allies sign on to a new Strategic Concept for the next decade of NATO.  
   Unfortunately, the President disagreed with my assessment, and on April 24, NATO went on to finalize a new Strategic Concept, and that document has been discussed in length by my colleague. 
   The main difference in the security tasks identified in the 1991--Mr. President, about every decade, NATO seems to get down to revising its future missions, and the 1991 document was clearly out of date. It still referred to the threat from the Soviet Union. So time had come, of course, to revise it. All I said is let's just wait a reasonable period of time and assess the lessons learned and let the American people give direction to the President and give direction to the Congress if, in fact, they want to be part of a military alliance where certainly in this operation well over half of it is being conducted by their own sons and daughters, and the price to be paid is still unknown. It will be heavy and it will be paid by the American taxpayers. 
   I recently had a very distinguished former Secretary of Defense write and tell me: Assess the costs being borne by the United States and the other NATO nations and that will be, I say to my former friend, the Secretary of Defense many years ago, that will be a central focal point of the hearings by this committee in the future. 
   But those costs are going to be enormous to the American taxpayers. We first have the risk to the men and women of our 
   country, the disproportionate contribution by our military assets, and the costs that will be allocated to the American taxpayer. 
   Back to my letter to the President. I said that we can wait another 2 or 3 months. We have waited since 1991. Why do we have to rush into another one? But the President, in his letter, declined to do it. 
   The main difference in the security tasks identified in the 1991 Strategic Concept and the document adopted this April is the addition of a ``crisis management'' task, and an emphasis on non-article 5 crisis operations. Non-article 5 operations were not even mentioned in the 1991 Strategic Concept. 
   I say to my colleague from Kansas, they were not even mentioned, but they are written throughout this new one which was promulgated this April. I will read one paragraph:   
   The security of all allies is indivisible. An attack on one is an attack on all. With respect to collective defense under article 5 of the Washington Treaty--  
   Of course, that is the 1949 treaty--  
   the combined military forces of the alliance must be capable of deterring any potential aggression against it, of stopping an aggressor's advance as far forward as possible should an attack nevertheless occur and assuring the political independence and territorial integrity of its member states.  
   Here is the key sentence:  
   They must also be prepared to contribute to conflict prevention and to conduct a non-article 5 crisis response operation.  
   That means going beyond the territorial boundary of the 19 nations. 
   The vote of the American people through its elected Members of the Senate is absolutely essential before we sign on to such a mission. I commend my colleague for bringing that to the attention of the Senate in the form of this amendment. 
   According to the new Strategic Concept, the alliance is tasked ``to stand ready, case-by-case by consensus ..... to contribute to effective conflict prevention, and to engage actively in crisis management, including crisis response operations. 
   Kosovo is an example of a non-article 5 crisis response operation.

   Mr. WARNER. I assure the Senate that we will deliberate this amendment tomorrow again, I say to the Senator. We are not able to complete it today due to the absence of several colleagues and the fact that right now the Nation's capital is engulfed in a series of storms preventing a number of our Members from returning. Also, I think it is important that every Member of the Senate hear the words of the Senator from Kansas and others about this very important amendment.

   Mr. WARNER. I say to my colleague, you are right on. 
   Indeed, go back before Kosovo to Bosnia. How many debates took place on this floor where the central question was: Was it in the vital U.S. interest to make our commitments there? Time and time again, the administration dropped the word ``vital,'' and then talked about how it was in our interest. 
   But when we put life and limb of the American person on the line, whether it is in the cockpits or on the ground or on the sea, I really believe it should be in the vital interest of the United States of America for our families to be asked to make those commitments of life and limb. That is central to this question, as you pointed out, I think very carefully. 
   If I might, because I think it bears worth repeating: ``The NATO charter requires the use of force in only one instance''--now this is the 1949 treaty, under article 5--``to respond to an armed attack against one or more of the member nations.'' Strike one, strike all. There is nothing in that charter that calls for the use of force to protect common interests. 
   This is being created out of whole cloth, this non-article 5 combat. It is as if we are writing a new article to the original treaty. It is for that reason that we should bring this before the Senate. Because through the guise of calling it a strategic concept through the panoply of the 50th anniversary, what they have done here, in my judgment, is create a new article to the fundamental treaty of 1949, and that they cannot do without the advice and consent of the Senate.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I say to my good friend, in my judgment, predicated on a lot of study in the lifetime of this Senator of the NATO treaty, the doctrine of consensus was predicated on keeping the operations within the borders. 
   And now, under this proposed 1999 Strategic Concept, to take it beyond the borders, I question whether or not the doctrine of consensus will work. 
   What a tragedy it would be if we took this magnificent NATO organization,  which fulfilled beyond the dreams of all its mission, as laid down in 1949, which kept the peace in Europe for that half century, and allow it to be pulled apart by a doctrine such as this new Strategic Concept. I think the Senator is quite right. We are in this conflict, in all probability, not because of our national vital security interests but because of NATO. It is because of NATO that we cannot allow our military commanders to promulgate the actions which are necessary to go ahead and win it. 
   I often think, I say to my good friend, as over 50 percent of the airmen are flying tactical missions and over 70 percent of the support missions and the airlift, are we unfairly asking those young aviators to bear the brunt of war disproportionately because NATO did not devise and put in place, concurrently with the air operations, starting a ground operation? Because a ground operation would have transformed this conflict considerably. It might well, in my judgment, have brought about a far earlier conclusion of this conflict and saved the prolonged risk to airmen which is going on today and tomorrow and for the indefinite future, given the absence of bringing together all the force capable of the 19 nations to bear. 
   Indeed, the other nations that do not have the air power, as we have it, could have been the primary components of the ground action, leaving to the American airmen the operations in the sky but they undertake the operations on the ground. It would have forced Milosevic to put in place, making in all probability his ground assets a better target than they are today, widely dispersed and hidden in the villages and towns throughout Kosovo and elsewhere. 
   I think the whole dynamics of this conflict would have been changed had we not limited solely to air but done a ground-air combination, for which our forces have trained these 50 years in NATO, as well as the other NATO nations, for a ground-air coordinated defense. 
   I point out, NATO was always to be a defense treaty.

   Mr. WARNER. Let me just bring up a final concluding point to my good friend here. I know others want to speak to this. Then we will have to lay it aside. 
   I point out that during the 1994 debate on modifications to the ABM Treaty, the Armed Services Committee included a provision, and I was a cosponsor of that effort in the 1995 DOD authorization act--I ask my colleague to listen carefully--which required the President to submit to the Senate for advice and consent any international agreement which would ``substantially modify the ABM Treaty.'' 
   I think that is a direct parallel and an exact precedent for what the Roberts-Warner amendment seeks. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. I want to engage in a few more minutes of colloquy. Other Senators are waiting and we have momentum under this bill. One Senator desires to lay down some additional amendments. I cannot let this opportunity go by. 
   Article 5 of the 1949 treaty laid out in very clear language exactly the reasons for which NATO was established. It could be understood by anyone, whether he or she wears four stars or is a private. It simply says:  
   The parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all.  
   The word ``attack'' goes all the way through article 5.  
   We will assist the parties so attacked. 
   It was a defensive treaty, whether it was armed aggression across the border against a member nation. That is the only reason that NATO was founded.  
   Now in the Bosnia and Kosovo operation, there wasn't any attack on a member nation but it was unsettling to the security of Europe. There was no attack. 
   They decided it was a non-article 5 military operation. There is no non-article 5 in here. You have to go to a preamble. You have to work a strain for the basis on which we are in Bosnia and in Kosovo. 
   We are there; we are committed as a nation. If in the next decade we want to do something beyond article 5, then let's put it down as a new article. Let's write it as a new article, article 15, and put it down in very clear language so that everybody can understand what it is we want to do, rather than going back and getting a strange interpretation of a preamble to begin to justify putting men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States in harm's way. 
   The burdensharing concept: The financial relationship between the United States, which pays 25 percent of the costs of NATO--eventually our committee will get all those costs and spread them out. I think we ought to, plain and simple, start a new article if we want to do something different than article 5 and not go back within the confines of this magnificent document and try to get some strained, whatever it is, to justify military action beyond the borders.

You share that with another distinguished colleague in the next-door State of Massachusetts, Senator KENNEDY, who is the ranking member. We are well represented on this committee. 
   I commend you for your report and bring to the attention of the Senate and the American people the underlying theme of our pay bill, how many times our men and women of the Armed Forces are required now in missions beyond our shores. That is very important. Of course, as to the 300-ship Navy--a famous figure--I hope that you and I and others can hold the line, because we are a maritime Nation. Our entire economic strategy is dependent on the security of our overseas markets and the ability to get our products out. Our entire defense strategy is dependent on what we call forward deployment. The ships of the Navy are a lifeline protection for both our economic as well as our national security responsibilities in this country. I commend the Senator.

   It says: ``NATO should not accept any diplomatic resolution to the conflict in Kosovo that would bar''--and then, my first question is, Is it conceivable that the United Nations should likewise not accept any? I mean in the final analysis, it is difficult to predict now. Certainly NATO will have a voice in the matter. But it could be that this thing would be involved before the United Nations. Is the spirit of this to include the United Nations, so to speak?

   Mr. WARNER. Let me proceed to another item. 
   The Senator used the key phrase, she doesn't want any amnesty or anything to prohibit the prosecution, and I think the Senator said ``of those who are guilty.'' But who has to establish guilt in terms of who is and who is not guilty? It seems to me if this were to read that it would ``bar the indictment, apprehension, or prosecution of persons alleged to have committed,'' because the Senator said ``war criminals,'' that could be interpreted as saying somebody is already designated one, two, three, and four as a war criminal and, therefore, you cannot give them amnesty, but there are some, I would presume, in this conflict who have not been designated ``war criminals'' but there are allegations to that effect, and they would have to proceed through the indictment process. But as this is written, the date of the agreement might cut off a class of individuals who are guilty but have not been as yet designated ``war criminals.'' 
   Do I make myself clear?

   Supposing that this frightful conflict drags on and the only basis on which anyone can reach any resolution is the question of amnesty, do I understand the Senator's position to be that under no circumstances should the sole remaining provision to stop this conflict be waived by those negotiating and those who eventually have to accept the resolution?

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, with great reluctance, I oppose this amendment. I do so based on some independent study that I have made, and indeed, I guess, throughout my lifetime. I had a very, very modest period of active service at the end of World War II in 1945 for a period of about 15 or 18 months. I can't remember now. 
   Anyway, I lived my lifetime through this period of history. Therefore, all of my active service in that period was here in the United States, preparing to join others of my generation for the invasion of Japan, which I thank the Dear Lord did not take place. 
   I have gone through enough of this material to satisfy me that what we are faced with here is one generation trying to provide revisionist history upon another. That is, in my judgment, unwise, and it could well promote many other meritorious cases during that period of history--and who knows, going way back in history--to be brought to this Congress for similar rectification or whatever the petition may say. 
   The records show that the request by my two distinguished esteemed colleagues initiated correspondence beginning in 1994--that is roughly 5 years ago. Secretary Perry on 7, September, 1994; again on 22 November, 1994; President Reagan, 1, December, 1994; Deputy Secretary John Deutch, 10, December, 1994; Perry, 5 March, 1995; Deutch, 24 March of 1995; the Dorn Report on 6, October, 1995; Deputy Secretary Defense John White, December of 1995; Secretary Cohen here in 18, November, 1997; and P&R de Leon, on 20, July, 1998. 
   In other words, for 5 years the Department of Defense has devoted a good deal of time and effort to try--I presume and I certainly assume--to make an objective analysis of all of these letters, and have turned down the various requests from my two senior colleagues. 
   First, I ask my distinguished colleague from Delaware, because I look at this very imposing collection of documents and I reflect on the number of inquiries that have been held throughout history, these are the inquiries that have been held regarding these two officers and their association with the tragic losses of men, women, and assets of the United States on December 7, 1941. 
   We start with the Knox Investigation, December 9 through 14, in 1941. That was followed by the Roberts Commission, December 18 through January 23, 1942; the Hart Investigation, February 12 through June 15 of 1944; the Army Pearl Harbor Board, July 20 through October 20, 1944; Navy Court of Inquiry, July 24 through October 19, 1944; the Clark Investigation, August 4 through September 20, 1944; the Hewitt Inquiry, May 14 through July 11, 1945; the Clausen Investigation, January 24 through September 12, 1945; the Joint Congressional Committee, November 15 through May 23, 1945. 
   Based on the results of all those investigations, Secretary of Defense Cohen wrote to Senator THURMOND and presumably Senator ROTH. He said:

   There could have been other officers who possibly were not advanced in rank. You cite they should be treated equally. How do I know there are not other officers, Army and Navy, who were not advanced in rank because they bore part of the responsibility for this tragedy? So, when you ask for equality, it would seem to me you would have to come forth with all the cases of all those who bore part of the responsibility and show that they were treated differently than Kimmel and Short.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am primarily concerned with the junior officers in the command of the Army in Hawaii, the command of the Navy in Hawaii. There may have been a number of officers and, indeed, enlisted men--say an intelligence officer. There was a good deal of intelligence out there that the situation was getting very serious, and I will refer to that momentarily. But how do I know their careers were not impeded? They may not have been general officers or flag officers of the U.S. Navy. But whether they were lieutenants or commanders, their careers may well have been blocked. There may be relatives out here and descendants of those officers who feel just as strongly as to the punishment that was meted out to their grandparents or whatever the case may be. 
   If you are going to open up a case like this, it seems to me it is in the nature of a class action: Let everybody come forward.

What new evidence do you bring in support of your petition?

   Mr. WARNER. Look at the Dorn report. I would like to refer to that at some point here. Let's just go over the Dorn report. This is a very comprehensive analysis by the Department of Defense over a considerable period of months. I would like to refer to some of their findings. 
   First, that these officers did receive warning messages on November 27, stating that Japan might take hostile action at any moment. Kimmel and Short concluded the attack would occur in the western Pacific and not Hawaii. 
   That was apparently their independent judgment. 
   The Army and Navy were separate departments reporting directly to the President. There is a question about the collaboration of these two senior officers on the islands of Hawaii. 
   Lack of mission discussion between Kimmel and Short on defense plans for Hawaii and long-range air patrols--in other words, they had not collaborated to coordinate the assets of the United States as a deterrent, or indeed a defense against any attack on which they had warning on November 27. Kimmel and Short did not share their internal intelligence with each other. That, to me, is a very troubling fact. 
   Just to say, as this report does, that responsibility is broadly shared does not absolve Kimmel and Short of accountability for this action to some degree. For example, the commander has plenary, that is, full, complete, and absolute, responsibility for the welfare of the people under his command and is directly accountable for everything the unit does or fails to do. That is legendary in military history. 
   Even in the Navy, there are cases where the captain was in his quarters, properly, perhaps, taking a rest and arose with the ship, and there are hundreds of cases where he is held accountable, even though he was not on the bridge at the time. 
   Three- and four-star positions are listed as positions of importance and responsibility. Both commanders made errors in judgment. The most serious ones were failure to establish a state of readiness in light of warnings received and to liaison between the two commands, i.e., Army and Navy, and to coordinate defensive measures and to maintain effective reconnaissance. Intelligence available to Kimmel and Short was sufficient to justify a higher level of vigilance than was maintained. An officer may be relieved of command if a superior decides the officer has failed to exercise sound judgment. And that is precisely what was done in this case. 
   The Senator points out that history does show, facts and mitigation, that responsibility was shared in Washington for failure to communicate on a timely basis some intelligence, but it does not absolve them from taking prudent actions as field commanders at a time of very high tension. That is the point I make. Indeed, those facts may have been the mitigating facts that these men were not actually court-martialed and incarcerated for this tragedy. This was an absolute, at the time, frightful blow against the United States of America. All of us have seen the pictures, and we know the history well. That is why it concerns me to try this revisionist action at this late date. 
   Relief does not require a finding of misconduct or unsatisfactory performance, merely a loss of confidence with regard to the specific command in question. There is a vast difference between a degree of fault which warrants court-martial action and a level of performance which warrants removal of command. 
   Promotion is based on potential and not past performance. That is, promotion is based on expectation of performance to the level at which the individual is being considered for promotion. Posthumous advancement in rank would be based on the judgment that, at a minimum, they had served satisfactorily at the three- and four-star level. Their superiors at the time decided they had not, and there is no compelling basis to contradict this earlier decision, made at a time when there were live witnesses and clarity of memory in the minds of many. 
   There may be a debate as to fairness and justice, but there can be no argument about the legitimacy of those who exercised their power for relief in retirement. The official treatment--this report goes on--of Kimmel and Short was subsequently temperate and procedurally proper; mention of court-martial but no charges brought; some allegations that there was no court-martial because the Government feared bringing charges would implicate other senior military and civilian leaders; could also be there were sufficient grounds for successful court-martial prosecution. 
   Mr. President, there is no new evidence before the Senate tonight. I would like to go on. I am going to put this in the RECORD. Is there some other point the Senator wishes to make? If I understand--you have been very forthright--there has been no new evidence. So what we are really doing is trying to exercise fair and impartial judgment by giving our own independent assessment of facts that were deduced in a timely manner in the period of 1941 to, say, 1946. That is the 
   conclusion of this congressional review. 
   Now we are determining from those facts which were deduced at the time of clarity of memory and presumably many witnesses who testified before the Congress. We are now asked to make this important decision which is tantamount, in the minds of many Americans, to exonerating totally these two officers from any misconduct or dereliction of duty at the time of Pearl Harbor. I just simply cannot go along with that, I say to the Senator. 
   First, again, there are no new facts. We are agreed on that.

   Mr. WARNER. May I ask, is that fact not borne out in many of these hearings that were held in the period of 1941 to 1946? My recollection is that that was always presented at that time, or at least certainly in the congressional one when the war was over.

   Mr. WARNER. I am not so sure, but you are nice to say it. It was a challenge. I was privileged and humbled to do so. 
   But my point is, a naval court of inquiry, that is usually about 9 or 10 officers certainly for a matter of this importance. All of these investigations involved, I think, at a minimum 10 or 12 people, not to mention all the staffs on both sides. I am sure they had the opportunity for these two officers to make known their own views and to turn over all of the investigations and say that they did not act fairly towards these two men. 
   Here we are, here in May of 1999, with no new evidence. I do not have the records of all these boards. I suppose somebody has gone through them. And Mr. Brzezinski maybe has. 
   Could I ask, have you got an estimate of how many persons were involved in all these boards which rendered a judgment that these two men must be held accountable for this tragedy at Pearl Harbor? Does anyone have an estimate of how many Members of Congress?

   Mr. WARNER. If I could again refer to the Dorn Report:  
   The failure of Kimmel and Short to make adequate preparations in light of the information they did have.  
   That was a major finding.  
   They knew their primary mission, arguable their only mission, was to prepare for war. 
   They knew that war with Japan was highly likely. 
   They knew that a surprise attack probably would precede a declaration of war. 
   They knew Japan, not the US, would strike the first blow. 
   They knew the initial Japanese attack would fall on Pearl Harbor. 
   They knew that an attack on Pearl Harbor could come from aircraft carriers. 
   They knew from their own staffs of the danger of a surprise air attack. 
   They knew from recent events that the idea of a carrier air attack on Pearl Harbor was not new. 
   They made statements prior to December 7 that acknowledged the possibility of an air attack on their forces.  
   Now, that was the finding of the Dorn group here just in 1995. I have it here, some numerous pages of this report.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have just located, I think, a document that interests me a great deal. It is entitled, ``Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack: Report of the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack,'' pursuant to a resolution of Congress, S. Res. 27. And it was reported on July 5, 1946. 
   Just listen to those Senators who were on this commission: Alben Barkley, you remember him. What an extraordinary man; Walter George, George was considered one of the great, great internationalists; Scott Lucas of Illinois, one of the most senior Senators from the State of Illinois, the Presiding Officer's State; Owen Brewster from Maine; Homer Ferguson from Michigan. 
   I say to my good friend, those names still reverberate with absolute distinction and credibility in this Chamber today. They made the findings which left history intact. And we here, just the two of us, really, on the floor tonight, are to urge our colleagues tomorrow to reverse that history? 
   With all due respect, there is not the foundation, in my judgment, for the Senate to so act and overrule the findings of these men.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there is no one in this body for whom I have greater respect than my dear friend and colleague, Senator ROTH. He has put a lot of work, together with his able staff, into this case. But it seems to me that we stand in a momentous hour in the history of this country. We are asking our colleagues to trust in our own judgments and our findings as to whether or not one of the most remarkable and tragic chapters in the history of this Nation, in effect, should have this significant reversal these many years hence, based on no new evidence, based on the fervent plea of my colleagues, 
   Senator ROTH and Senator THURMOND. 
   I shall take the floor tomorrow and most vigorously oppose this. I think for the night we have pretty well concluded this debate. I have to tell the Senator, it is an interesting one for me and not altogether without some implications in my own life, thinking back in that period of history. I will never forget Pearl Harbor. 
   If I could just reminisce for a moment, it is hard to believe that shortly thereafter this city, the Nation's Capital, endured periods of blackout. I remember it very well, as a small--well, I wasn't so small. I remember my father was a physician and he was able to drive at night only with a slit on the headlights to get to the hospital. I remember very well our home was equipped with blackout curtains. All the streetlights went out. We were fearful of an attack here in Washington, DC, and, indeed, other east coast cities. There were Nazi submarines patrolling off the east coast of the United States, sinking ships. 
   How well I recall on the beaches of Virginia there was washed up debris from sunken ships. The people on the west coast lived in constant fear that there would be an invasion. These were serious and strenuous times, calling on the men and women of the Armed Forces for a duty and a commitment and an assumption of risk without parallel, because this Nation in many respects was unprepared. How well we recall the pictures of the Army practicing maneuvers with broomsticks rather than rifles. 
   When I think of the tragic death, loss of life and property, indeed, if we were to follow your logic--President Roosevelt had that intelligence--we could go back and judge the record of many others. It seems to me that what is before the Senate tonight is clear facts that men and women of clear conscience, with the ability to assess fresh information, have painstakingly gone through it, reached their conclusion year after year, and then a President, Harry Truman, is my recollection, am I correct, made the decision that he did with respect to these two officers. 
   I just do not believe that the Senate at this time should reverse that history.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I introduce the Constitutional and Effective Reform of Campaigns Act, or ``CERCA'', which I first introduced during the 105th Congress. This legislation is the product of two years of hearings during my Chairmanship of the Rules Committee, discussions with numerous experts, party officials, and candidates, and nearly two decades of participating in campaigns and campaign finance debates in the Senate. Many of the proposals in this bill have been made in some form by several of my Senate colleagues and by Members of the House, and I readily acknowledge drawing on their expertise. The important discussions last Congress during the meetings of a task force headed by Senator NICKLES, at the request of Majority Leader LOTT, were invaluable. 
   This legislation offers an opportunity for bipartisan support. It is a good faith effort to strike middle ground between those who believe public financing of campaigns is the solution, and those who believe the solution is to remove current regulations. It offers a package of proposals which realistically can be achieved with bipartisan support and meet the desire of the majority of Americans who believe that our present system can be reformed. In my judgment, we will not succeed with any measure of campaign reform in this complicated field without a bipartisan consensus. 
   In drafting this legislation, I began with four premises. First, all provisions had to be consistent with the First Amendment: Congress would be acting in bad faith to adopt provisions which have a likelihood of being struck down by the federal courts. Second, I oppose public financing and mandating ``free'' or reduced-cost media time which in my mind is neither free nor a good policy idea. Why should seekers of federal office get free time, while candidates for state office or local office--from governors to local sheriffs--do not receive comparable free benefits? Such an inequity and imbalance will breed friction between federal and state office seekers. Third, I believe we should try to increase the role of citizens and the political parties. Fourth, any framework of campaign reform legislation must respect and protect the constitutional right of individuals, groups, and organizations to participate in advocacy concerning political issues. 
   This bill is designed to be a ``bilateral disarmament'' on the tough issues of soft money and union dues: each side must give up equivalent ground. The Republicans should give ground by placing a cap on soft money which has tended to favor our side. And Democrats should give ground by allowing union members to decide voluntarily for themselves whether to contribute the portion of dues which goes to political contributions or activities. 
   Specifically, on the issue of soft money, no reform can be considered true reform without placing limits on the corporate and union donations to the national political parties. This bill places a $100,000 cap on such donations. While this provision addresses the public's legitimate concern over the propriety of these large donations, it allows the political parties sufficient funds to maintain their headquarters and conduct their grassroots efforts. In addition, the current limits on ``hard'' contributions must be updated. The ability of citizens to contribute voluntarily to a wide range of candidates and to their parties is fundamental. 
   At the same time, the practice of mandatory union dues going to partisan politics without union members' consent must end: it is counter to all the political freedoms that make America a true democracy. The concept of ``paycheck protection'' must be included in any campaign finance reform, so that these deductions are voluntary, whether these dues fund direct contributions to candidates or parties, or pay for undisclosed spending on phone banks, get-out-the-vote efforts, literature, and television ads. 
   Under this legislation, unions would be required to obtain advance, written consent before deducting money for political activities from union members' paychecks. The present state of the law requires most union workers to give up their rights to participate in the union if they seek refunds of that portion of dues going to politics. In addition, this section would strengthen the reporting requirements for unions engaged in political activities and enhance an aggrieved union member's right to challenge a union's determination of the portion of dues going to political activities. 
   In the Senate debates thus far, there has been much discussion about whether corporations should be required to obtain shareholder approval to make political contributions. This is an issue which warrants consideration. My proposal not only limits these corporate and union contributions to $100,000, it also includes a requirement that companies disclose their donations to federal political parties in their annual reports. And under current policies of the Securities and Exchange Commission, shareholders have the same rights to make recommendations to boards of directors on the propriety of political donations as they do on any business issue related to the company. 
   In addition, the SEC is in the process of making it easier for shareholders to raise questions related to social policy matters at annual meetings. I am monitoring how these changes are implemented: if they are insufficient to guarantee adequate rights to shareholders, I will consider amending my bill to protect these rights. 
   As an aside, I reject the notion that the status of union members is similar to those who belong to groups such as the National Rifle Association or the Sierra Club. Nobody is compelled to join these types of organizations, and  those that do, know or should know that their dues are going in part to political causes. 
   Furthermore, I considered including in this bill a narrowly-tailored disclosure requirement for individuals and groups spending large sums on public advertising affecting the public image of candidates during election seasons. However, in keeping with my first basic premise that reforms must pass the federal court test of constitutionality, I concluded that such a provision, in view of a long line of Supreme Court cases, likely would be declared unconstitutional, and thus I did not include the provision. 
   The McCain-FEINGOLD bill was thoroughly debated in the Senate, and any objective observer of 
   the Senate would agree that we are genuinely deadlocked. This body needs to move beyond the debate of McCain-Feingold. I hope that all Members will review my bill as an objective and pragmatic approach to current problems with our campaign system. I encourage other Members to come forward, as I have, with proposals which objectively represent pragmatic approaches to what can be achieved. I do not claim to have the only solution: those with other ideas should come forward. 
   In addition to the issues of soft money and union dues discussed above, nine other fundamental problems--all of which can be solved in a constitutional manner--are the most pressing. Here are these problems, in no particular order, and my proposed solutions: 
   Problem 1: Politicians spend too much time fundraising, at the expense of their legislative duties for incumbents, and, for both incumbents and challengers, at the expense of debating the issues with voters. 
   Solution: The current individual contribution limit of $1,000 has not been raised, or even indexed for inflation, for over 20 years. This fact requires that candidates must spend more and more time seeking more and more donors. The limit should be doubled, as well as indexed for inflation. 
   Problem 2: The influence of voters on campaigns has been diminished by the activities of political action committees and interest groups. 
   Solutions: I propose a $100 tax credit for contributions made by citizens, with incomes under specified levels, to Senate and House candidates in their states: this credit should spark an influx of small dollar contributions to balance the greater ability of citizens with higher incomes to participate. 
   In addition, the increased individual contribution limit should balance the activities of political action committees. 
   Problem 3: The influence of voters on campaigns has been diminished by contributions from those not eligible to vote. 
   Solution: If you are not eligible to vote, you should not contribute to campaigns. My bill would prohibit contributions by those ineligible to vote, including non-citizens, children, and persons under felony convictions. It also codifies current regulations concerning political donations by domestic subsidiaries of foreign companies. 
   Problem 4: Compared to incumbents, challengers face greater difficulties raising funds and communicating with voters, particularly at the outset of a campaign. 
   Solutions: This legislation will allow candidates to receive ``seed money'' contributions of up to $10,000 from individuals and political action committees. This provision should help get candidacies off the ground. The total amount of these ``seed money'' contributions could not exceed $100,000 for House candidates or $300,000 for Senate candidates. To meet the constitutional test, this provision would apply to both challengers and incumbents alike, but in the case of an incumbent with money carried over from a prior cycle, those funds would count against the seed money limit. 
   Second, Senate incumbents would be barred from using the franking privilege to send out mass mailings during the election year, rather than the sixty day ban in current law. 
   Problem 5: Candidates with personal wealth have a distinct advantage through their constitutional right to spend their own funds. 
   Solution: If a candidate spends more than $25,000 of his or her own money, the individual contribution limits would be raised to $10,000 so that candidates could raise money to counter that personal spending. Again, to meet constitutional review, this provision would apply to all candidates. 
   Problem 6: Current laws prohibiting fundraising activities on federal property are weak and insufficient. 
   Solution: The current ban on fundraising on federal property was written before the law created such terms as ``hard'' and ``soft'' money. This bill updates this law to require that no fundraising take place on federal property. 
   Problem 7: Reporting requirements and public access to disclosure statements are weak and inadequate. 
   Solutions: Under this proposal, the FEC would be required to post reports on the Internet for all to see, and to require that candidates, and groups making independent expenditures, make faster and more complete reports. In addition, registered lobbyists would be required to report their campaign contributions and those of their employer on their lobbyist disclosure reports. 
   Problem 8: The Federal Election Commission is in need of procedural and substantive reform. 
   Solutions: This legislation contains a number of procedural and substantive reforms of the FEC, including term limits for commissioners, and increases in penalties for serious violations. 
   Problem 9: The safeguards designed to protect the integrity of our elections are compromised by weak aspects of federal laws regulating voter registration and voting. 
   Solutions: The investigations of contested elections in Louisiana and California have shown significant weaknesses in federal laws designed to safeguard the registration and voting processes. The requirement that states allow registration by mail has undermined confidence that only qualified voters are registering to vote and only registering once: states should be allowed to decide whether to allow mail-in registrations. In addition, states should be allowed to require proof of citizenship when registering and proof of identification when voting: we require a photo ID to buy beer or cigarettes and can certainly allow states to protect the voting process by requiring a photo ID. 
   Lastly, this bill would allow states to purge inactive voters and to allow state law to govern whether voters who move without reregistering should be allowed to vote. 
   These are the problems which I believe can be solved in a bipartisan fashion. Attached to this statement is a section by section review of the legislation. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact meaningful campaign reform, by looking at reform beyond the usual sound bites and addressing the real problems with our present campaign system.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of this conference report. I say to my good friend from North Dakota, I had oriented myself to one set of remarks, but I listened carefully to his, as I frequently do. He certainly speaks from the heart about his people. I remember the floods that his State experienced years ago. I feel as if I am on the farm, the family farm, with him. And you talked about that family. 
   So while we may be at odds on this bill, I want to take the same theme and talk about a family. I want to talk about a military family. This bill has in it provisions for a military family. 
   I want to talk about that wife here in the United States, or in other places of the world, with their children, whose husband is flying an aircraft right at this minute in harm's way. It could be the reverse, because women are flying aircraft in harm's way in this conflict over the Balkan region, over Iraq. 
   Mr. President, this country is at war. And for that wife at home, war is hell. For that individual in the cockpit, war is hell. 
   The purpose of this emergency legislation is to provide the dollars necessary to alleviate to some extent the strain on the families and those in the cockpits. 
   Every Member of the Senate has young men and women involved in the conflict in Kosovo or over the general Balkan region or over Iraq or standing guard, as they are, in other far, remote areas of the world to protect freedom. That is what this bill is all about. 
   Let me add one other feature, and then I will yield the floor, because many are anxious to speak. 
   Each year, the Department of Defense plans for the next year and the year following as to how many aviators, for example, they will train to keep the cockpits filled. Last year, the number of pilots we had to keep to maintain the flying status of sufficient men and women fell by 1,641. That number of young men and women trained as aviators decided they no longer could remain on active duty and would return to civilian opportunities. Many of those decisions were dictated by their concern for their families. But stop to think of what it costs every American taxpayer to replace that individual in that airplane, to train the number of new recruits to be pilots or navigators or to take to sea in those combat airplanes. 
   I ran that calculation. It costs roughly between $2 million to $6 million, depending on the type of aircraft, to train a man or a woman to become an aviator, $2 million to $6 million. If you multiply the average of that times 1,641, it is $9 billion just to replace the aviators. That same drain on trained manpower, womanpower in the military occurs in other branches of the service where perhaps their training is not as costly to the taxpayer but $9 billion just to close the gap for those flying aircraft. 
   Let us think about the families, as my good friend from North Dakota described, the farm community. Let us talk about the military, what those wives and their children, what those aviators are doing in harm's way today. They are carrying out the orders of the President of the United States, as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. This Nation is but one of 19 nations locked together in the first combat operation in the 50-year history of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
   This is a critical moment for families, be they farm families or military families. 
   Mr. President, as I said, support the emergency supplemental appropriations bill now before the Senate. As chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, I join with my colleague and close working partner on defense matters, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, to urge all our colleagues to support our military forces by voting for this bill. 
   I support this bill for one simple reason--we are at war. As we speak, we have military forces engaged in combat--going in harm's way--in the skies over the Balkans and Iraq. Whether or not there is agreement on how these risk-taking operations are being prosecuted is not now the question. We must support our military forces who are risking their lives daily to carry out the missions they have been assigned. 
   Mr. President, the conflict in Kosovo has been ongoing since March 24, when the NATO use of force began. Since that time our pilots and the pilots of our allies have flown thousands of combat missions against Milosevic's military machine. We have already spent billions of dollars--on both aircraft operations and munitions--in support of Operation Allied Force. These funds are now coming out of the readiness accounts of our military services. Without this supplemental, there would be further and unacceptable degradation of the readiness of our forces. 
   The conference agreement provides $10.9 billion for defense, including $2.2 billion above the President's request for aircraft flying hours, spare parts, depot maintenance and munitions, including sophisticated precision-guided missiles and bombs, which allow our pilots to be more effective at reduced risk--both to them and to innocent civilians on the ground. 
   Mr. President, I know that some of my colleagues have expressed concern regarding the funds provided in this bill for pay raises, pay table reform and retirement reform. I firmly believe that all my colleagues would agree that we have very serious problems of recruiting and retention in our military services. I believe the problems are of such magnitude--indeed, we have a hemorrhaging of skilled personnel leaving our military--that this situation qualifies as an emergency. As an example, both the Army and the Navy failed to meet their 1998 recruiting goals and the Army, Navy, and the Air Force project that they will not meet their recruiting goals for 1999. 
   Last year, 1641 more pilots left the service than the Department of Defense projected. It costs about $6 million to train a single pilot. The cost to replace these 1641 pilots is more than $9 billion. We must act to stop this hemmorhage of pilots and other skilled military personnel. We must send a signal now that we in the Congress intend to take care of our military personnel and their families. 
   I know that there are Senators who are concerned about this process, and there are Senators who disagree with some of the items in this emergency supplemental. I share some of these concerns. But, Mr. President, as I stated earlier, our Nation is at war. We can argue the process and our other concerns at another time. 
   I believe that now is the time for the Senate to show its support for our men and women in uniform who are, as we speak, carrying out their assigned missions under difficult and dangerous conditions. I will vote for this bill, and I strongly urge my colleagues to do likewise. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to join our colleagues in the Senate to provide this record of our recollections of this great American who, in service to the Senate and in partnership with the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, left his mark. I feel very humble about it because I was fascinated in some research that I did on the U.S.S. North Carolina, the battleship on which he served.

   Mr. WARNER. In that period of time I was but a mere radioman third class. Aboard a battleship, about the only thing lower than a radioman third class is a bull ensign out of Annapolis. If the Admiral were here, he would recall those days. Ensigns on battleships were almost down in the bilge area. Nevertheless, he was privileged to serve with that distinguished ship in a series of engagements. 
   I have also found a record of his second Distinguished Service Medal. It is interesting. I am searching for the first because it is likely that was in my period of tenure when a radioman third class had become Secretary of the Navy, because this one covers the period of June 1975 through December of 1978. 
   I want to read these remarks, signed by the then Secretary of the Navy:  
   For exceptionally meritorious service to the Government of the United States--  
   Rear Adm. James W. Nance, U.S. Navy--  
   while serving as the Assistant Vice Chief of Naval Operations/Director of Naval Administration from June 1975 through December 1978. 
   In directing the efforts of the vast human and physical resources of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations, Rear Admiral Nance displayed the highest order of leadership, superb managerial acumen, and unexcelled initiative.  
   The same qualities, Mr. President, I say to the chairman of the committee, that he exhibited on the Foreign Relations Committee. Isn't it interesting, these many years prior thereto, he was recognized for those qualities?  
   His keen foresight and perception coupled with an extensive knowledge of Navy organization were significantly instrumental in successfully guiding the reorganization of several major realignment programs.  
   Did he not do some reorganization for you, Mr. Chairman?  
   Utilizing dynamic leadership, keen administrative ability, and steadfast perseverance, Rear Admiral Nance managed the Navy's massive organizational network in a noteworthy manner, thereby enhancing the shore establishment's support to the fleet. Additionally, he personally initiated and implemented important improvements in both procedural and institutional aspects of the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations and, by personal attention, example, and vigorous advocacy, he provided positive leadership in the area of Equal Employment Opportunity. 
   Rear Admiral Nance's distinctive accomplishments, unparalleled effectiveness, managerial expertise, and tenacious devotion to duty reflected great credit upon himself and were in keeping with the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

   Mr. WARNER. But the interesting thing is the direct parallels between, Mr. Chairman, what he performed in the Navy in 1974 and what he performed in the Senate in 1994. When I spoke of him as ensign, I heard on the floor of the Senate a little chuckle from a former ensign who is over there now preparing to address the Senate. I am sure he might expand a little bit on the relationship between an ensign and the higher officers. I see him busily going over his notes over there. 
   But I say to my distinguished colleague from Massachusetts, we should conclude these remarks by saying: An officer and a gentleman--a phrase known in the U.S. Navy. My distinguished colleague from Massachusetts earned that title, as did Admiral Nance. 
   I thank the Chair and thank my distinguished colleagues.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and say farewell to an outstanding Naval Officer, Captain Robert B. Shields, Jr., as he prepares to retire upon completion of twenty-seven years of distinguished service. It is a privilege for me to honor his many outstanding achievements and commend him for his devotion to the Navy and our great Nation. 
   A native of Providence, Rhode Island, Captain Shields is a graduate of the United States Naval Academy. Upon graduation in 1972, his first sea tour was aboard the USS Aylwin (FF-1081) where he served as First Lieutenant and Anti-Submarine Warfare Officer. His second and third shipboard tours were served aboard USS Nicholson (DD-982) and USS Richmond K. Turner (CG-20). Captain Shields continued to demonstrate outstanding leadership abilities as the Executive Officer of USS Sterett (CG-31) and was rewarded with command of the destroyer USS O'Bannon (DD-987). 
   His most recent sea tour was as Commanding Officer of the cruiser USS Vicksburg (CG-69). During Captain Shield's tenure, his ship earned the Battle Efficiency ``E'' Award, the Ney award, and the Best Ship's Store Sales and Service Award. Vicksburg distinguished herself as Air Warfare Commander for the John F. Kennedy Battlegroup while deployed to the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf. 
   Captain Shields completed shore assignments at the Navy Postgraduate School where he earned a Masters of Science Degree in Engineering Acoustics; the Royal Navy Staff College in Greenwich, England; and in a variety of assignments in Washington, D.C. In Washington, he was assigned to the staff of the Chief of Naval Operations in the Research, Development and Acquisition Directorate and then completed a year as a Federal Executive Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Captain Shields first came in contact with our nation's lawmakers when he served as a Congressional Liaison Officer for surface ship programs in the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs. With many successful at-sea and shore tours behind him, Captain Shields' was then handpicked to serve as Deputy Legislative Assistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. His current, and last, assignment has been with the Navy's Office of Legislative Affairs where he is Deputy Chief. 
   Captain Shields is a dynamic and resourceful naval officer who throughout his tenure has proven to be an indispensable asset. He is a passionate advocate of the Sea Services and has been tireless in supporting the needs of the Sailors in the Fleet and their families. He understands better than anyone that they are truly the backbone of our national defense. His superior contributions and distinguished service will have long-term benefits for both the Navy and the country he so proudly served. As Captain Shields enters into his new profession, we will certainly miss him. I am proud to thank him for his service and wish him ``fair winds and following seas'' as he concludes his distinguished Naval career.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to reestablish the third Monday in February as a national holiday called ``Washington's Birthday.'' 
   Current law provides that the third Monday in February is a legal public holiday designated as ``Washington's Birthday.'' Nonetheless, there is an inaccurate misconception that this federal holiday is called ``President's Day.'' Not only does the use of the phrase ``President's Day'' in reference to the third Monday in February have no force in federal law, the misnomer obscures the true meaning of the holiday. 
   Simply put, the true meaning of the federal holiday known as ``Washington's Birthday'' is to celebrate the birthday of the father of our country. Washington's role in achieving our Nation's independence, in helping to create our Constitution, and as the first President of the United States of America cannot be overestimated. 
   As one of Virginia's delegates to the Second Continental Congress assembled in Philadelphia in May 1775, Washington was elected Commander in Chief of the Continental Army. As Commander in Chief of the Army, Washington helped ensure the independence of our Nation when he, with the help of French allies, forced the surrender of British forces at Yorktown. After the war, Washington soon realized the problems associated with the Articles of Confederation, and he became a prime mover in the steps leading to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787. Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention and ultimately yielded to the cries that he serve as our country's first President. After the Constitution was ultimately ratified, the electoral college twice unanimously elected Washington to serve as President of the United States. 
   As the father of our country, President Washington deserves to be distinguished from other Presidents. Federal law recognizes this deserved distinction in that President Washington's birthday is the only President's birthday recognized as a federal holiday. However, because this holiday is all too often misconceived as ``President's Day,'' this legislation is necessary to reestablish that the federal holiday is in fact ``Washington's Birthday.'' 
   This legislation would achieve this objective by simply requiring all entities and officials of the United States Government, as well as federally funded publications, to refer to this day as ``Washington's Birthday.'' This bill in no way infringes on the right of any State or local government to recognize a ``President's Day'' or any other holiday. In fact, ``President's Day'' is a State holiday in a number of states. 
   President Buchanan emphasized the importance of Washington's birthday when he stated, ``when the birthday of Washington shall be forgotten, liberty will have perished from the earth.'' I urge my colleagues to support this bill to ensure that President Washington receive the distinction he deserves.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which will preserve a site of great historical importance. The legacy of Civil War battlefields must be perpetuated, not only to commemorate those who lost their lives in this tragic epoch, but also to consecrate land upon which some our country's finest strategic maneuvers occurred. On the hallowed land of Wilderness, Virginia occurred one of the greatest tactical stratagems in military history. Snatching the initiative to turn the tide of battle, Lt. General James A. Longstreet, under the command of General Robert E. Lee, forced back Union forces directed by General Ulysses S. Grant, in an advance known as ``Longstreet's Flank Attack''. 
   Mr. President, this legislation will allow the Park Service to acquire this stretch of land, which will serve to ``complete'' Wilderness Battlefield. The legacy of the Civil War is far-reaching. A war which wrought such destruction has been the source of much fascination for scholars and amateur historians. The Battle of Wilderness is legendary for the tactical skills employed and the caliber of the soldiers who fought. There, among the tangled forests and twisted undergrowth, the Union Army, numerically superior and well supplied, were forced into confrontation with General Lee's hard scrabble Confederate troops. It would be one of the last battles in which Lee's incomparable martial machine would force Grant's Army of the Potomac to withdraw. It is also the site of the wounding of Gen. Longstreet, who, like General Stonewall Jackson, was wounded by friendly fire. Though Longstreet's injury was not mortal, the genius of the cadre of officers under the command of Lee dwindled. Thus would begin the twilight of the Confederacy. 
   Legislation passed in the 102nd Congress would have allowed the Park  Service to acquire this land by donation. Despite numerous efforts, the Park Service has been unable to accomplish this. The legislation at hand would amend Public Law 102-541 to allow the Park Service to procure the land by purchase or exchange as well as donation. The heritage and history which dwell amongst the interlaced undergrowth of this land deserve our recognition. I look forward to the swift passage of this bill.

   Mr. WARNER. I thank my friend. Before he leaves the floor, I think a colloquy here--and I am very much interested in following the one you and Senator BIDEN had--might be helpful. This Senator intends to vote to table. I do so with a heavy conscience, because I have no better friend, nor a man I respect more, than my good friend, the Senator from Arizona. We sort of served in the Navy together. He had more rank than I did; at one point I had a little more authority than he did. And my good friend from Delaware, you do recall who was your cosponsor. It was Biden-Warner. So I think that points out there are differences of conscience, clear conscience now and then, where we differ. 
   I want to ask both of you, on the condition you answer on your time, on such time you have, a very simple question: What does this resolution give the President of the United States that the Constitution has not clearly reposed in this President and in every other President since the beginning of this great Republic? 
   I ask that question because to vote otherwise would possibly, if this were to carry, in my judgment, send a hollow message not only to the United States but across the world. He has the authority under the Constitution to do precisely what you state in here. 
   I ask simply: What does this confer on the President that the Constitution has not already conferred?

   Mr. WARNER. I simply say, with great respect to both you and Senator MCCAIN, this does not grant the President of the United States one single bit of authority that he does not possess at this moment and that every President of the United States has possessed from  the beginning of this great Republic. And, therefore, I fear that this could be a hollow message. It could be misunderstood, not only in the United States, but in the other 18 nations that are allied with us; my point being, the success thus far has been the ability--and, indeed, this President has been active, as have other heads of state--in keeping 19 nations solidly together to pursue this military action. 
   And my concern is, if the Senate were to take a resolution like this, does that not say to the other nations, the 18, ``Well, go to your legislatures. And similarly, don't you have a responsibility comparable to what we have in the United States of America?'' 
   And, Senator, I say this respectfully to my colleague form Delaware, that other nations of that 18 group, their legislatures might well not act favorably on such a piece of legislation, and begin to start a fracturing of the solidarity of the NATO group. 
   That is my great concern, Mr. President. Therefore, I feel that it is just most unwise. And I shall vote against it. I really salute the Senator from Arizona, as well as my colleague from Delaware, because I believe their steadfast stance on this gave backbone to NATO to begin to at least dust off the plans to look at the introduction of ground forces, both under a permissive and nonpermissive situation.

   Mr. WARNER. I am likewise concerned about consultation. The Senate and the House--the Congress--work very hard with this President, as they have with other Presidents, to get consultation on these key questions of our national security and foreign policy. 
   Were we to pass this, coupled with what I predict will be a strong vote for the emergency supplemental, indeed, the President's advisers might say, ``We've got whatever we need now. Let's go about this. And we need not have the consultation.'' 
   We have had extensive consultation in the course of this very difficult military action, and that consultation has enabled this Senator--sometimes there were 30 other Members of Congress up with the President working in consultation for not just 15 or 20 minutes or a half-hour but hours on end. 
   I commend the President for sitting there very patiently and entering into a strong colloquy and exchange of views throughout that consultation. 
   We might well lose consultation. We will send out a message that could be misinterpreted. And, indeed, we could cast an affirmative responsibility on other legislatures which could cause a fracture and a breakdown of the 19 NATO nations standing together. 
   So, Mr. President, I commend my two colleagues. This has been a good debate. It is going to go on for a while. We owe a great deal to both of you and others who wanted to have this debate. I think it has been a good one. I am pleased to have been a part of it.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today as chief co-sponsor of the Cuban Food and Medicine Security Act of 1999. I am pleased to join my good friend and colleague Senator DODD and many of our colleagues in introducing this important legislation. 
   The goal of this bill is simple--alleviate the suffering of the Cuban people created by the inadequate supplies of food, medicine and medical supplies on that island nation less than 100 miles from our shore. If enacted, this legislation would authorize the President to permit the sale of food, medicine and medical equipment to the Cuban people. 
   The Cuban Food and Medicine Security Act of 1999 also mandates that a study be carried out on how to promote the consumption of U.S. agricultural commodities in Cuba through existing U.S. agricultural export promotion and credit programs and requires a report to Congress assessing the impact of the bill six months after its enactment. 
   Yesterday, President Clinton announced an important change in U.S. economic sanctions policy which will enable U.S. firms to sell food and medicine to Iran, Sudan and Libya. In making the announcement, Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat stated ``Sales of food, medicine and other human necessities do not generally enhance a nation's military capabilities or support terrorism. On the contrary, funds spent on agricultural commodities and products are not available for other, less desirable uses. Our purpose in applying sanctions is to influence the behavior of regimes, not to deny people their basic humanitarian needs.'' 
   This major change in the Administration's sanctions policy, however, will not affect Cuba because restrictions on the sale of food and medicine to that country are statutory. The legislation we are introducing today, however, would remove those restrictions on the sale of food and other agricultural products, medicine and medical supplies with regards to Cuba. 
   The time has come to stop using food and medicine as a foreign policy tool. I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting this important and timely legislation.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ms. Ruby B. McMillen, a native of Virginia's Albemarle County, who is retiring from the Defense Logistics Agency, Fort Belvoir, Virginia, this month after a distinguished civilian career spanning more than thirty-six years. Ms. McMillen, who currently directs the Agency's business management office, has devoted her professional life to supporting the logistics needs of military men and women assigned around the world in defense of our freedom. Her accomplishments are many and her reputation for innovative, visionary leadership is unparalleled. Her contributions to the National Defense will be missed, so as she transitions to new opportunities, I want to say thanks to her on behalf of a grateful nation. 
   Ms. McMillen's career is noteworthy for many reasons, but her remarkable rise through the civil service ranks speaks to the real value of the work she has done for our warfighters over the years. Starting as a GS-3 clerk in Richmond's Defense General Supply Center, she soon transitioned into professional and leadership positions, but never lost her appreciation of the unique challenges faced by junior-level employees. With each assignment came additional responsibilities and a reputation for cutting through business-as-usual obstacles. Over the years her abilities developed, her contributions grew, and she rose to the top of her career field. For all the challenges she successfully met, Ms. McMillen's enduring contribution will be all those employees to whom she served as an active mentor. The next generation of DLA's professional logisticians has countless members who would not be making tremendous contributions to the Agency if not for her help, encouragement, and motivation along the way. 
   Mr. President, I am proud and honored to ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Ms. Ruby McMillen on her retirement from the Federal Civil Service.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, as we approach the 50th anniversary Summit  of NATO this weekend, I rise today to share with my colleagues my concerns about a key document that will be considered at this summit. It is entitled ``Strategic Concept for NATO.'' 
   Mr. President, I have been privileged to be in the Senate 21 years. Throughout those years of time, there has often been a need to speak on behalf of NATO in this Senate. I say humbly and most respectfully that I have been at the forefront of Senate support for NATO. I can remember the early years of my time in the Senate. There was Member after Member that assaulted the need for the United States to remain in NATO. ``Let's cut back. Let's save the money. Let's bring our men and women home. We have done our job.'' I was among that group that had the long-range vision for NATO. It must remain. It must be strong, and U.S. leadership in NATO is absolutely essential. 
   So the remarks that I contribute today, here on the floor, are the result of a series of consultations I have had with the administration, and I hope will be taken in a constructive light and not as an expression in any way of criticism of this great organization, NATO. 
   With that in mind, I wrote to the President of the United States on April 7 to urge him to initiate, among the other 18 nations and the heads of state and government of NATO, the thought that at this 50th summit we should not try and write the final draft of the ``Strategic Concept.'' I repeat, ``the final draft.'' Certainly at this important gathering, a draft should be considered. Maybe several drafts should be considered, but we should not etch in stone the final draft of the ``Strategic Concept.'' That document spells out the future strategy and mission of the alliance. It states the parameters by which the alliance decides whether it should or should not send forward military units to engage in operations, possibly combat operations. 
   Why do I take this position? Because the old ``Strategic Concept,'' enacted in 1991, was largely oriented towards the Soviet Union and the threats from the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact. So obviously it is time to change it. But it can remain in effect for an additional, brief period of perhaps 6 months so that we can evaluate the lessons learned from the Kosovo operation. 
   Periodically in the 50-year history of NATO, NATO has changed its mission statement, or ``Strategic Concept.'' But that can remain in effect for 8, 9 sometimes 10 years. 
   So this document to be revised at this summit could well control NATO operations for the next decade. 
   I do not see the urgency to put it, as I say, in stone at this time. The urgency is to consider it, to put out a draft, and let the nations of NATO and their respective legislators and the Congress of the United States consider those drafts and consider them--this is the key reason that I rise--``consider'' them in the light of the lessons learned in Kosovo. 
   This 50th anniversary Summit is taking place against the background of perhaps the most serious conflict we have seen on the European continent--indeed, the most serious, in my judgment, since the conclusion of World War II. It is the first actual combat of a great magnitude in which NATO has been involved. 
   We are operating on what is known as the ``consensus'' of the 19 nations--any one of which has a veto power--directing the military operations, which are under the command of General Clark, the Supreme Allied Commander. 
   I am not here to in any way criticize these operations. But I will simply say, Mr. President, that there will be many, many lessons learned at such time as this operation--and the sooner the better--is concluded with NATO having succeeded in reaching the objectives that have been made very clear by the NATO alliance and addressed many times by our President, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, the Chancellor of Germany, and others. 
   Mr. President, the alliance must have time to evaluate the lessons learned from the Kosovo operations before, again I say, setting in stone for possibly the next decade documents which will guide future NATO military operations. 
   While everyone recognizes the ``Strategic Concept'' of 1991 must be updated, it has not impeded the current Kosovo operation. Indeed, this operation is going forward with that ``Strategic Concept'' still in place. So it could stay in place another 6 months. 
   That is the only period of time I am asking for--an additional 6 months before the ``Strategic Concept'' is finalized. A short delay has advantages, if for no other reason than to show respect for the Congress of the United States and the people of this country will have their own evaluation of how well the Kosovo operation went, what was done right and what could have been improved. 
   The Secretary of Defense, when he was before the Armed Services Committee last week, said in response to questioning, ``We are guided by the consensus of the alliance.'' We need all 19 voices to say yes. And then he made a very important addition, ``Had we been there alone or with a coalition similar to what we had in 1991 in the Persian Gulf we might have done it another way.'' 
   This is a lesson learned. We should not be allowed to deny to the Congress and to other legislatures the opportunity to study lessons learned and to make our contribution as a member nation to the future ``Strategic Concept for NATO.'' 
   As I speak today, the draft of the ``Strategic Concept'' continues to be reworked, during this very hour, by the staffs of the 19 nations before it will be submitted to the NATO heads of state this weekend at the summit. There are press reports today that key elements of the ``Strategic Concept'' might not be completed by the summit--due to be continued--because of disagreement among the allies. The key element there is the relationship between NATO and the United Nations--a very, very important relationship. At no time should the United Nations have a veto over a decision by the NATO powers to use force. That is this Senator's view. 
   My main concern is, to what extent does the draft ``Strategic Concept'' reflect the views expressed in a May 15, 1998, speech in Berlin that President Clinton made? I am addressing the draft being reworked against a background of a statement by the President of the United States a year ago. President Clinton stated:  
   Yesterday's NATO guarded our borders against direct military invasion. Tomorrow's Alliance must continue to defend enlarged borders and defend against the threats to our security from beyond them [meaning borders]--the spread of weapons of mass destruction, ethnic violence, regional conflict.  
   That thought expresses a desire to broaden and go beyond the 1991 concept. Is that being worked in this final draft? I know not; collectively, we in this Chamber do not know. 
   Other administration officials, most notably the Secretary of State, Ms. Albright, have been outspoken in the belief that the revised ``Strategic Concept'' should place increased emphasis on NATO's future role in non-Article 5--she said ``out of area''--threats to our ``common interests,'' threats such as Kosovo. The definition of these common interests and the various military missions NATO is prepared to undertake in defense of these interests will establish the foundation for NATO military operations, possibly for the next decade. 
   Against the backdrop of the uncertainties in Kosovo, NATO should pause, in this Senator's judgment--I repeat, take a breath, a long deep breath and pause--before rendering judgment on these important issues. Let us review, over the next 6 months, the lessons learned as a consequence of the Kosovo operation. 
   Unfortunately, the NATO summit will take place against the background of continuing, unfolding events relating to Kosovo which we cannot predict at this moment. The United States and our allies may have many lessons to be learned from Kosovo to assess as we look to NATO's future for the next decade and its military missions. That assessment must be a pivotal part of any new strategic concept. NATO is simply too important to the United States, to our allies in Europe, and indeed to those nations who seek admission to NATO. NATO is essential for the future of the European continent and our relationships with that continent. 
   We are just beginning to learn important lessons now in the Kosovo situation. For example, it is obvious to all that the U.S. 
   military is the primary source of attack aircraft. We are flying 60 percent of the missions of the high-  performance aircraft. Most of the ordnance being used is high-tech, precision-guided ordnance, an arsenal of which the United States possesses in far greater numbers than the other nations of NATO. They simply do not have in their military inventories this equipment. 
   I add to that, the airlift; that is, the cargo planes that must put in place the necessary resupply, the necessary equipment; for example, the helicopters, the Apaches which are moving in at this very moment, to be positioned in Albania for future use in the Kosovo operation. The other nations simply do not have that airlift. They do not have the tanker aircraft. Airplanes going into Kosovo now take off from Italy or other places. They move in, they have to get refueled in most instances before the strikes, they are refueled coming out of the strikes, and indeed refueled over the area so they can remain over the target area. It is the U.S. tanker aircraft that are carrying on the greater proportion of that essential part of this mission. The other nations of NATO do not have in their inventories that equipment. 
   Until other nations do acquire or at least have in place firm contractual commitments to acquire such equipment, the United States will likely be the only source of that equipment for any future operation other than Kosovo. It is our taxpayers, it is our men and women of the Armed Forces, who support and maintain this equipment. As we write the future concept for operations in NATO, we have to recognize that much of the equipment for modern warfare is possessed by the United States. Are we ready to sign that in stone now, recognizing particularly that the new nations do not have that equipment? A lesson to be learned, a lesson to be thought through very carefully. 
   The American people will soon be asked to support an emergency supplemental budget request to pay for the costs of the Kosovo operation. Are Americans ready to sign up to a new strategic concept that could well commit the U.S. military to other such operations requiring the same type of weaponry? 
   There are other lessons to be learned. It is now becoming apparent that our military planners are being subjected to many levels of review--this is a consensus military operation by 19 nations--for it is a fact that NATO can only operate by consensus; 19 nations must agree before a military action can be taken. A single nation can stop the planners--indeed, even stop the operation. 
   The result can be a military planning operation of the ``lowest common denominator.'' Are we now making military decisions not on the basis of the professional military judgment or on the basis of what will be most effectively done to achieve our objectives on the battlefield but, rather, on what agreement we can get among the 19 nations to carry out the recommendations of the professional military? These are issues which are to be examined as lessons learned in the future of Kosovo. 
   On April 7 I wrote the President a letter expressing the various concerns that I have related here on the floor. The President responded to my letter, on April 14, indicating his position that, ``the right course is to proceed with a revised `Strategic Concept' '' at this conference, and sign it into stone. 
   Therefore, I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD the exchange of letters; my letter sent to the President and his response.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I address the Senate today because I have done my very best as one Senator to bring this to the attention of our President, and hopefully, through this floor speech, to the attention of the other heads of state and government who will come to Washington. Again, I continue to urge my plea not to put this ``Strategic Concept'' in final form in this forthcoming Summit. I encourage my colleagues who may share my views on this critical issue to likewise speak out before it is too late, in an effort to prevent a rush to judgment on NATO's future. NATO is simply too important to our national security to do any less. 
   On a related issue, I am distressed to hear statements by my colleagues, and some in the administration, which tie NATO's future to a successful--I repeat successful--outcome in Kosovo. I personally support the objectives that have been stated time and time again by the NATO ministers, and indeed our President, our Secretaries of State and Defense. We all know we have to create a situation so the refugees can be returned. We know we have to have in place a military force, the composition of which I think should be flexible. It does not have to be all United States--absolutely not. Maybe other nations not in NATO will join. We need flexibility there to allow these people to return in a secure environment and to have a measure of self-government, of autonomy. They deserve no less. Those are the basics. 
   But to say unless everything we lay down today has succeeded, we have success and we have victory, and if we do not achieve it, it is the end of NATO--I urge my colleagues not to make such a statement. NATO must go on. NATO must go on and survive the Kosovo operation. It is the responsibility of those of us here in the Senate, of the President of the United States, and the other heads of state and government to make certain that is achieved, because we know not at this moment what the outcome will be in Kosovo. Yes, we have to achieve the basic goals, but in my humble judgment, diplomacy will reenter at some point. So I suggest we pledge ourselves to the future of NATO and be more cautious in our statements. 
   Kosovo-like operations are not NATO's reason for being. They are ``out-of-area'' operations that NATO does if it can. We should not be making pronouncements on NATO's future based on the outcome of these ``out-of-area'' operations. 
   This alliance has withstood the test of time for 50 years. It has exceeded the expectations of those minds that gathered 50 years ago to conceive it. It is the most significant military alliance in the history of mankind, and it has to continue to be for the future. 
   Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their patience in allowing me to deliver these remarks, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, our nation has lost a truly great American in the recent passing of Admiral Roy Lee Johnson, USN (Ret.), who died March 20th in Virginia Beach, Virginia at the age of 93. My Senate colleagues should know that he was the father of Jo-Anne Coe, long-time top aide to Senator Bob Dole. We all join in sending our deepest sympathy to Jo-Anne and her family. 
   Admiral Johnson had a distinguished Naval career of over 38 years, culminating in his appointment as Commander in Chief of U.S. Naval forces in the Pacific (CINCPACFLT) from 1965-67 at the height of the Vietnam conflict. Prior to this, he was Commander, U.S. Seventh Fleet. In his capacity, he gave  the order to the USS Maddox and USS Turner Joy to fire back at Viet Cong gunboats in the Tonkin Gulf incident. 
   Admiral Johnson graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1929. A pioneer of naval aviation, he received his wings in 1932, and served as a flight instructor at the U.S. Navy flight school at Pensacola, Florida, in the biplane era in the early 1930's and again in the 1950's. After retirement, he served a term as president of the Early and Pioneer Naval Aviators Association, nicknamed ``The Golden Eagles'', and from 1980-81 was President of the Naval Academy Alumni Association. 
   During World War Two he served on the USS Hornet, which won a Presidential Unit Citation. He was awarded the Bronze Star, the Air Medal, and the Legion of Merit with gold star for his service in action which included campaigns against Japanese forces in the Philippines, Wake and Truk Islands, Iwo Jima and Okinawa. He also saw action during the Korean War, as Commanding Officer of the escort carrier USS Badoeng Strait. 
   In 1955 he became the first Commanding officer of the USS Forrestal (CVA 59), the first of the ``supercarriers'', receiving this coveted appointment after developing operational procedures for this new class of carrier which were still in use at least 15 years later. In this role he was promoted to Rear Admiral and later assumed command of Carrier Division Four, with the Forrestal as his flagship. 
   In January 1960, he was named Assistant Chief of Naval Operations for Plans and Policy. Two years later he was promoted to Vice Admiral and became the Navy's senior representative in determining U.S. air strike priorities during the Cuban Missile Crisis. 
   In July 1963, he became Deputy Commander in Chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet and a year later was appointed Commander of the U.S. Seventh Fleet. For his service in these assignments he was awarded a second Distinguished Service Medal. In 1965, he was promoted to full Admiral and became CINCPACFLT. He was the last U.S. Military Governor of the Bonin Islands, which include Iwo Jima. 
   Admiral Johnson's exceptionally distinguished military career and achievements as a private citizen stand out as an example of the selfless devotion to our country that only a few Americans have exemplified. Hopefully, his achievements will serve as the standard for our naval officers and citizens to strive to achieve. His lasting contributions to ensuring the freedoms and greatness of our nation are his legacy. Admiral Johnson will be profoundly missed and fondly remembered by all who knew him and by others who only know of his exceptional service to our country.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join as an original cosponsor  of this important legislation offered by Senator JAMES JEFFORDS, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. Through this proposal, we seek to significantly expand post-secondary educational opportunities for high school graduates residing in the District of Columbia through the provision of financial aid to compensate for non-resident tuition rates at colleges and universities in Maryland and the Commonwealth of Virginia. 
   This legislation is comparable in many ways to the highly innovative bill put forth in the House of Representatives by Congressman TOM DAVIS of the 11th Congressional District of Virginia. Mr. DAVIS' bill, H.R. 974, is different in scope, with national rather than regional college access, but our intent is the same. District of Columbia high school students need a broader horizon of more affordable public colleges and universities. 
   We would assist those students who have been admitted on the basis of their own academic achievement, and once admitted, as an example, to George Mason University or James Madison University, the U.S. Department of Education would make funding available so that the student's net cost would be the same as that of an in-state resident. I want to stress that these students would not receive preference in anyway in the admissions procedure. 
   I believe this is an exciting concept for the youth of the nation's capital, and one which has already been embraced by a number of important local community figures who wish to further strengthen the program with private donations. 
   Mr. DAVIS' legislation is on a fast track in the House Government Reform Committee, and I understand that our bill will be referred to the Senate Committee on Government Affairs. I look forward to working with our Senate Chairman FRED THOMPSON, our D.C. Subcommittee Chairman GEORGE VOINOVICH, as well as D.C. Appropriations Chairman KAY BAILEY HUTCHISON as we work our way through the legislative process. 
   I believe if we can all keep our focus on the common goal of improving college access for D.C. students, our local youth will turn up winners. I commend Senator JEFFORDS and Congressman DAVIS for their leadership in this endeavor, and I look forward to a healthy and productive debate as we hammer out the final form of the legislation.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Service Chiefs testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on September 29, 1998, and again on January 5, 1999, that they require an additional  $20.0 billion in fiscal year 2000 for defense--over and above the amounts contained in the Balanced Budget Agreement--to reverse the serious problems they are witnessing in military readiness. During the Posture Hearings held by the Armed Services Committee in February and March, the Service Secretaries and Service Chiefs confirmed that significant funding shortfalls remain--despite the increases contained in the budget request. Each service submitted a significant list of remaining ``unfunded requirements.'' 
   While I appreciate the efforts of the Budget Committee to address these funding shortfalls with an increase of $14.6 billion in budget authority for defense, I am concerned with the serious shortfall in outlays. The outlay funding level of $274.6 billion contained in the Budget Resolution is insufficient to fund the projected levels of budget authority in either the defense budget request or the budget resolution. At least $287.3 billion in outlays is needed to fund the budget authority levels contained in the Budget Resolution. This is an increase of $12.7 billion over the caps listed in the Resolution.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before my colleague departs the floor, I wish to commend him for his final set of remarks. I listened very carefully. Those precise steps of reasoning were discussed in great detail beginning at 9:30 this morning up through 11:30 with the President and the Senate and House leadership. The very points that our colleague makes were reviewed and responded to by the President. 
   Time and time again--and I am sure you share this with me --I want to accord the highest credit to our colleague from Texas, Senator HUTCHISON, and our colleague from New Hampshire, BOB SMITH, and others, who have repeatedly over the past week or 10 days, through filing amendments and otherwise, brought to the attention of the Senate the urgency of this situation and the need to address it. 
   Today's meeting with the President was the second one, the previous one being last Friday of similar duration. Senator LOTT has tried his best to reconcile a rather complicated procedural situation together with Senator DASCHLE, and they are still conferring. We are going to address that in our respective caucuses here starting momentarily. I see--and I am speaking for myself now--a clear movement within the Senate to address this within the framework of a resolution. There are several working now whereby the American public can follow with much greater clarity exactly what is the issue before the Congress and how this body will respond to the challenge. It is an extraordinary one. The case--as you laid out--of inaction is just unacceptable to the world. We are about to witness a continuation, taking place at the moment, of ethnic cleansing of a proportion reaching those that we experienced in Bosnia. 
   A very courageous diplomat, Mr. Holbrooke, has made several excursions--I think the most recent completed within the hour --and all indications are that the situation, diplomatically, as much as it was, say, 72 hours ago, despite the best efforts of the United States, Mr. Holbrooke representing this country, but indeed he spoke for 18 other nations--the important consideration here is that there are 19 nations--16 in NATO and several others--who are locked with the determination not to let this tragedy continue. As the Senator said, the consequences of no action are far more understandable than the consequences of action. Now, the military action proposed is largely, I say largely, but almost exclusively, an air type of operation. Those pilots are taking tremendous risks. 
   The Senate Armed Services Committee, last Thursday, had all the Chiefs present. As the first indications of the concern in the Senate were beginning to grow through questioning by myself and other members of the committee, we had each Chief give their appraisal of the risk, and General Ryan, speaking for the air arms of our country, was unequivocal in saying this is dangerous, that these air defenses are far superior to what we encountered in Bosnia and what we are today encountering in Iraq, and this country runs the risk of casualties. What more could he say? He was joined by General Krulak, Chief of Staff 
   of the Army, and the Chief of Naval Operations. All of them very clearly outlined the risks that their respective personnel would take--that, together with our allies. 
   Numerically speaking, about 58 percent of the aircraft involved will be U.S. Why? It is very simple. Fortunately, through the support of the Congress and the American people, we have put in place a military that can handle a complication such as this. I say ``complication'' because going in at high altitudes and trying to suppress ground-to-air munitions is difficult. It requires precision-bombing types of instruments, precision missiles, and many of the other nations simply do not have that equipment. But it is interesting, if we get a peace accord--and I have long supported the United States being an element of a ground force under the prior scenario where we had reason to believe that there would be a peace accord--and maybe there is a flicker of hope that it can be reached before force is used in this instance--but there the European allies would have about 80 percent of the responsibility, and the United States, I think by necessity, as leader of NATO, should have an element.  
   So another message that we have to tell the people is that the countries of the world--indeed NATO--are united. It is just not to be perceived as a U.S. operation. It is a consolidated operation by 19 nations. Milosevic should be getting the message now, if he hasn't already, that this is not just a U.S. operation. It is a combined operation of 19 nations. 
   Now, the proposed air operation is the best that our Joint Chiefs, in consultation with the North Atlantic Council and the respective chiefs of the NATO, can devise given that air assets are to be used. It is spelled out, I think, in a convincing way. 
   The President, again, went over this very carefully with the Secretaries of State and Defense, the National Security Adviser, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs present this morning. This operation, in stages, unequivocally I think, will bring severe damage to, first, the ground-to-air capabilities; and then if Milosevic doesn't recognize the sincerity of these 19 nations, then there will be successive air operations on other targets designed to degrade substantially his military capability to wage the war of genocide and ethnic cleansing taking place at this very minute throughout Kosovo. 
   In addition, as I am sure the Senator is aware, there are many collateral ramifications to this situation, which leads this Senator to think it is in our national security interest to propose action. I shall be supporting as a cosponsor the joint resolution as it comes to the floor this afternoon. 
   Right on the line I will sign and take that responsibility. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be extended for about 5 minutes.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is very important that this air operation degrade his capability to do further damage in Kosovo. But the instability in the region, as stated by the President this morning, in many ways parallels Bosnia, but could be considered more serious because of Greece, Turkey, and the spillover of the refugees into Macedonia and Montenegro. It is just not an isolated situation of repression and oppression by Milosevic against Kosovo civilians. They are now flowing in and causing great problems in these nations who are trying to do the best they can from a humanitarian standpoint to accept them. 
   So I always come back to the fact that this Congress went along with the President as it related to Bosnia. History will show that we were misled in certain instances by the President hoping we could be out by yearend. It had not been the case. But we are there, and the killing has stopped. How soon the economic stability of that country can create the jobs to give it some permanence we know not. But we could lose an investment of up to $8 billion or $9 billion that this Congress has authorized and appropriated through the years to bring about the degree of achievement of the cessation of hostilities in Bosnia if Kosovo erupts and spills over the borders in such a way as to undo what has been done over these years since basically 1991. 
   So there are many ramifications. It is difficult for the American people to understand all the complexities about the credibility of NATO and the credibility of the United States as a working partner, not in just this opposition, but future operations with our European nations. But they do understand quite clearly that genocide and ethnic cleansing, murdering, rape, and pillaging cannot go on. And we have in place uniquely in this geographic area the political organization in NATO, together with such military assets as are necessary to address this situation. 
   So it is my hope that the leaders will be able to resolve a very complex situation as it relates to the procedural matter before the desk and that we can have before the Senate this afternoon a resolution with clarity of purpose and clarity of how each Senator decides for themselves and speaking for the constituents about what the country should do. 
   I am convinced that the President has to go forward within 24 or 48 hours with the other NATO nations. 
   So I sort of put myself in the cockpit with those brave aviators, where you have been in a combat situation, Senator, many times, and you know that situation better than most of us. And you know how it is important to that soldier, sailor, or airman that has the feeling--or she in some cases--that this country is behind them and stands with them as they and their families take these risks. 
   I thank the Senator for the opportunity to have a colloquy with him on this important question. I commend him for his leadership on this and many other issues. 
   I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. WARNER. I have, since that time, worked with Senator LOTT and we pretty well, I think, have this thing ready to be presented to the Senate. As you mentioned, our distinguished colleague from Alaska has possibly some thoughts on it that have not been completed yet--that are to be incorporated--but I want to be sure nothing has been agreed to. It is just a recommendation to the leadership. Our group did, I think, a very fine job in consolidating the thoughts of a number of us who have been working on this for several days. I am hopeful we can bring it up very shortly. 
   I know the Senator is looking for one Senator who was a part of that group to give his blessing to certain phraseology.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
   It is my hope to engage, through some questioning, my colleagues. The distinguished Senator from Kentucky left. I did not want an impression left with the Senate that nothing has been done on the complicated issues of Kosovo as related to Bosnia, as related to the region. 
   The Armed Services Committee has had a series of hearings, a series of briefings. The distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee knows of an amendment that the bill contained last year by Senator ROBERTS which outlined considerable work in this area. So I believe the Senate has addressed this issue off and on for some time. 
   The Armed Services Committee last week, when we had all four of the Service Chiefs up, we asked each one specifically, regarding the risk of this operation, what opposition they were going to meet in terms of air defense alone, and they replied it was significant, it was multiples of two or three of what had been experienced in Bosnia, which is being experienced almost every day in Iraq. We have had a considerable deliberation, I think, in various areas of the Senate. This is, of course, the first action. 
   It is my hope that very shortly, with the concurrence of the two leaders, Mr. LOTT and Mr. DASCHLE, we can send to the desk a relatively short resolution which will provide Senators with a clear up-or-down vote. I will just read a draft. It as yet has not been finally approved. It is submitted by Mr. BIDEN, myself, Mr. WARNER, Mr. LEVIN, Mr. BYRD, and Mr. MCCONNELL. Those are the sponsors to date. 
   It reads:  
   Concurrent resolution--Authorizing the President of the United States to conduct military air operations and missile strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). 
   Resolved by the Senate ..... 
   That the President of the United States is authorized to conduct military air operations and missile strikes in cooperation with our NATO allies against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro).  
   That clarity was achieved by a group of six of us. The distinguished majority whip, Mr. NICKLES, sort of had the unofficial job of presiding over the group. He made it clear from the beginning his opposition to this, but, nevertheless, I think we succeeded in devising what the Senate desired, and hope 
   will be concurred in, in terms of bringing it up for further debate of this resolution. 
   I yield the floor.

I followed Senator BYRD and repeated the question. And he said orally: ``Yes, I do want the support of the Senate, indeed, the Congress.'' And he has now sent a letter to the leadership of the Congress.

   Mr. WARNER. If I could reply, nothing in the remarks by the Senator from Virginia in this moment or earlier today from this period infer that a Senator voting against this proposed resolution in its draft form in any way does not support the men and women of the Armed Forces. 
   I simply say at this hour when we are trying to debate this, it would seem to me that those who can come and support this resolution--it is clearly in support of what they are about to do; they are likely to go. 
   I am convinced that the President has a resolve with the other leaders of NATO to go forth with this military mission. It is important that debate here in the Senate take place. Every Senator will vote his or her conscience, and I know that there will be 100 votes in support of the troops if they are called upon to take on this high risk together with their families.

   There is an important provision we have incorporated in the draft resolution which Senator BIDEN and I have circulated among our colleagues. I think it is important, since it is not at the desk, that I just read it so that it can be reviewed by Senators. 
   Section 1 remains as I read it. 
   Section 2, which is a derivative of, again, work by the Senator from Alaska and, indeed, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia--the original concept of this was in drafts prepared by Senator BYRD earlier today. And I shall read it.  
   None of the funds available to the Department of Defense (including funds appropriated for fiscal year 1999 or prior years) may be used for the introduction of ground forces of the Armed Forces of the United States into the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) in a non-permissive environment, with the exception of (1) any intelligence or intelligence-related activities or surveillance or the provision of logistical support or (2) any measures necessary to defend the Armed Forces of the United States or NATO allies against an immediate threat or to defend United States citizens in the area described in this resolution.

   Mr. WARNER. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I thank my distinguished colleague from Delaware. We have joined together many times in our two decades-plus here to work on what we felt was absolutely essential in the best interests of the country. I respect every colleague and their votes, whichever way it goes. There has been, I think, a substantial debate--perhaps not as long as I hoped. But, nevertheless, we had the debate. And this is essential now. We could not have done it had it not been for the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. SMITH, the Senator from Texas, Mrs. HUTCHISON, and the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. BYRD, and others who joined in to make this possible--and my good friend from Michigan, Mr. LEVIN. We made it happen. 
   But this started with this Senator last September when I made my second visit to Kosovo. Having come out of Bosnia and seeing that situation at that time, I have tirelessly worked on this issue ever since that period. And now I join my colleague from Delaware to make it happen. 
   But, Mr. President, my main concern has always been the investment of the American people through this Congress in Bosnia--8-plus years, $9-plus billion, which could be severely at risk if this area of the Balkans known as Kosovo and the environs thereto were to erupt and begin to take down what little progress we have achieved in Bosnia, and display before the world a magnitude of human suffering and ethnic cleansing and crimes of horrific nature. 
   So I know it has been a painful subject for many. But I honestly believe that by supporting this vote we are doing what is in the best interests of mankind. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Again, we all draw on our experiences in life. I served overseas in Korea with an air unit, as a combat officer, I might say. Right now, I am trying to put myself--and I hope my colleagues put themselves--into a cockpit and we are strapped in, as these young Americans are right now, strapped in waiting for an order, which could come in the next hour. 
   Having met with the President the other day with my two colleagues here on the floor, I am convinced that he is going to join other NATO leaders and give that order at an appropriate time if the current mission of diplomacy by another courageous man, Mr. Holbrooke, is not successful. 
   I hope we can start to focus pretty quickly, not so much on all the historical parts of this important issue, like sovereignty and constitutionality, but on what we are going to do to support our military. It seems to me that this body at this time has to look itself in the eye and say these men and women are about to fly, about to take risks with our allies, and I think it is essential that the Congress of the United States be on record as supporting them. I will address that in such opportunity as I may have following my distinguished colleague's speech.

   Mr. WARNER. If the Senator would allow me to make one clarification to your statement. I want to make it clear I said I served with others who were in combat. I was a ground officer who helped strap them in, who checked their radios and their communications. Occasionally, I did get to ride along with them in a back seat, but I never put myself in the combat category with those brave men who, day after day, were strapped in to fly combat. But I lived with them, slept there in the same tents, ate in the same mess, used to go up and observe what they had to do. 
   But let me tell you, I think we have to put ourselves in that cockpit right now as if we were qualified to be in combat and show that the Congress of the United States wants to support them. I think that is absolutely essential.

But I do believe it is essential to this Senate to pass on the Smith amendment, if that is what is before us at this time; and then it seems to me that someone could possibly come on with a resolution like, as I understand, the Senator from Delaware, which clearly focuses on the issue: Do we or do we not support the use of force by the U.S. military together with our allies in this frightful situation in Kosovo?

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend the majority leader and Senators HUTCHISON and SMITH for bringing this matter to the Senate floor today. With fighting escalating in Kosovo, with the Serbs refusing to sign a peace agreement, and with U.S. military air units, together with those of our allies, poised to strike, it is important, if there is time, for the Senate to address this situation. 
   Under most contingencies, the U.S. military should not be sent into harm's way without the support of the American people and the Congress. Our nation has learned, from recent contingencies that, without such support,  when casualties occur, a clamor could begin to ``bring our troops home.'' We witnessed that in Somalia; we could see that again in Kosovo. Our military deserves our support. I say to my fellow Senators, if you were sitting in a cockpit, ordered to carry out strikes against the Serbian military, you would like to know that the Congress, the elected representatives of the people, is with you, supporting your mission and concerned for the risks you are taking. 
   I first visited Kosovo in August of 1990 on a delegation headed by Senator Robert Dole. I commend this brave veteran for his mission to the Balkan region in the past few weeks in the cause of peace. His efforts contributed to the securing of signatures by the Kosovar Albanian delegation on a peace agreement. 
   During my visit to Kosovo in 1990, I saw first-hand the oppression of the Kosovar Albanians by the Serb authorities. I returned to the region most recently in September of 1998, traveling through Kosovo with Ambassador Christopher Hill and elements of a courageous international observer group called KDOM. 
   Since last March we have all closely followed developments--indeed the humanitarian tragedy--in this troubled region. And since last September, when NATO first threatened the use of force against Milosevic, NATO credibility has been on the line. We are now at a defining moment in this crisis. 
   Since September, I have been outspoken in my support for the use of U.S. ground troops as part of a NATO-led force to implement a peace agreement that is in place relative to Kosovo. In my view, such a military force is necessary--once a peace agreement is reached--if the parties to the agreement are to have the confidence necessary to be bound by the provisions of such a peace agreement. And I believe U.S. participation in such a force is necessary if we are to maintain our status as the leader of the NATO Alliance. 
   My greatest concern has been and continues to be that a deterioration of the situation in Kosovo could undermine the modest gains we have achieved in Bosnia--at a cost of over $8 billion to date to the American taxpayer; and could lead to problems in neighboring Macedonia, Montenegro, Albania, and perhaps Greece and Turkey. 
   In addition, I share with all Americans concern for the humanitarian tragedy we have witnessed--are now witnessing--in that troubled land. 
   But what happens if a peace agreement remains elusive, which is now the situation with which we are faced. It is one thing to deploy troops into a permissive environment for the purpose of overseeing the implementation of a peace agreement. It is quite another to use military power--air--to compel a sovereign nation to sign an agreement to end what is essentially an internal civil war. 
   There are many questions that must be addressed. The most important question is, what happens if bombing does not succeed? There are very few operations, historic examples, where air power alone has succeeded 
   in meeting our military objectives. Some have made the argument here today that air strikes were the key to bringing the Bosnian Serbs to the peace table in Dayton. I had the opportunity to visit with two people last week who were intimately involved in the Bosnia crisis--former British Defence Secretary Michael Portillo and former U.N. High Representative in Bosnia, Carl Bildt. Both of these men told me that air strikes were an important part, but not the decisive factor in ending the fighting in Bosnia. History records that the Croatian offensive against the Serbs, and the fact that the parties were all exhausted from fighting were of equal significance to the important air campaign by the United States and our allies. Today, that is not the case in Kosovo--the parties there are, regrettably, ready to fight. 
   My point is,--there is risk in relying on air strikes, alone, to stop the fighting in this crisis. We must know what our next steps will be and how far we are ready to go with other initiatives to stop the fighting in Kosovo. If this first military action is taken--which in my view this contingency is tantamount to an act of war--what comes next and how far we are willing to go? We must have in mind not simply our first step, but our second, third or fourth steps before we commit U.S. troops. 
   While one of my main concerns in this is the credibility of NATO now that we have threatened military action for many months, we must ask ourselves what happens to NATO credibility if the air strikes fail to accomplish their objectives? That would be a devastating blow to the Alliance if we take the drastic step of attacking a sovereign nation, and are not successful in the ultimate objective. 
   What of the credibility of the United States and our leadership on the continent of Europe, in military as well as economic or diplomatic partnerships? What of the credibility of the U.S. military as a partner in other actions? There are important issues that can be debated in the context of the pending amendment. 
   The Smith amendment provides that the Congress must be on record as supporting this operation before we commit the U.S. military to the crisis in Kosovo. I agree. We owe it to the men and women of the Armed Forces to act on this issue. For that reason, I will support the Smith amendment and vote for cloture on this amendment.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the Government and the people of Tunisia on the occasion of their annual National Day celebration, March 20, which this year marks the 43rd anniversary of their independence from France. While the Republic of Tunisia is only 43 years old, the Tunisian nation has a long rich history, dating back to ancient Carthage. 
   Accompanied by the senior U.S.-N.A.T.O. military commander responsible for the region, I was privileged to visit Tunisia last April. At the request of Admiral Lopez, I met with top government and military officials in the company of U.S. Embassy officials in hopes of integrating U.S. and Tunisian actions and efforts in Europe. 
   The United States and Tunisia go back a long way. In 1797, our two nations signed a treaty of peace and friendship. Among other things, this treaty called for ``perpetual and constant peace.'' Indeed, for the past 200 years, our two nations have enjoyed such a relationship. During World War II, Tunisia's nationalist leaders suspended their struggle against France in order to support the Allied cause: they knew which side in that war was fighting for the values they held dear. During the tense cold war years, Tunisia was one of America's most reliable allies in the Mediterranean, and Tunisia's friendship proved of tremendous benefit to the Sixth Fleet. 
   Since the end of the cold war, Tunisia has continued to be a friend and ally of the United States. Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali has been very active in supporting the Middle East peace process. He has also sought to open his country's economy to greater US investment, a goal that has gotten a recent boost from our own State Department, which has proposed a new trade partnership with the countries of North Africa, including Tunisia. Our military ties with Tunisia also remain strong. Just last month Defense Secretary William Cohen visited Tunisia and discussed a number of issues of mutual interest, including the Iraqi situation, the Middle East peace process and the Lockerbie bombing. 
   I think it is safe to say that few of our nation's bilateral relationships have been broadly and consistently positive for so long. I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating Tunisia on its National Day and in honoring this great friend of the United States.

    Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to take this opportunity to recognize and say farewell to an outstanding civil servant, Mrs. Jeanie Kirk, upon her retirement from the Department of the Navy after more than 38 years of dedicated service. Throughout her career, Mrs. Kirk has served with distinction, and it is my privilege to recognize her many accomplishments and to commend her for the superb service she has provided the United States Navy and our nation. 
   Mrs. Kirk's retirement on 3 May 1999 will bring to a close almost four decades of dedicated service to the United States Navy. From 1960 to 1966, Mrs. Kirk was assigned to the Navy's Personal Affairs Division. From 1966-1968, she was assigned to the Navy's Casualty Branch. For the next 31 years of her service, Mrs. Kirk was a member of the Navy Awards Branch, starting as the Assistant Branch Head in 1968 and becoming the Branch Head in 1978. Throughout her tenure, she has become a well-known and beloved figure among the fleet, from seamen to admirals, among veteran organizations, such as the Congressional Medal of Honor Society, and individuals, such as survivors of the Pearl Harbor attack. She has assisted countless individuals in tracking, reinstating or garnering appropriate awards and recognition for their service to their country, during wartime and during peace. The letters of gratitude and appreciation she has received over the years for her tireless and dogged research on behalf of thousands of sailors and their families and friends would fill many cabinet drawers. Congressmen and women have benefitted from her briefings on the specific details of awards for their constituents and heeded her advice. Her opinion on Navy awards is honored as golden--decisive and accurate--in the halls of Congress as well as the Pentagon. 
   She is a recognized authority on the topic of Navy awards from the first Congressional Medal of Honor to the most recent new awards, such as the NATO medal, which honors the service of more than 45,000 personnel as peacekeepers in Bosnia. As the Executive Agent for the Department of Defense, she was responsible for inaugurating the Pearl Harbor Commemorative Medal to recognize the 50th Anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
   Mrs. Kirk has been awarded the Superior Civilian Service and Distinguished Civilian Service Awards. She is a native of Rectortown, Virginia, and currently resides in Middleburg, Virginia. 
   Mrs. Kirk will retire from the Department of the Navy on May 3, 1999, after thirty-eight years of dedicated service. On behalf of my colleagues, I wish Mrs. Kirk fair winds and following seas. Congratulations on an outstanding career.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise with many in this Chamber who have risen and will rise to commend our distinguished colleague from Mississippi for his untiring leadership on this issue. It has been my privilege to work with him over these past months and to work with my distinguished colleague from Michigan, Mr. LEVIN, in having our committee address these issues and reporting the bill to the floor. 
   Mr. President, I wish to convey to the Senate my strong support for S. 257, which was introduced again by Senators COCHRAN and INOUYE. This is a very important and timely bill which deserves overwhelming support in the U.S. Senate. S. 257 was referred to the Senate Armed Services Committee early this year, and after consideration, the bill was reported out of committee favorably on a bipartisan basis. 
   Mr. President, even once S. 257 is enacted, the 
   administration and Congress will decide, on an annual basis, how much to spend on NMD, pursuant to the normal authorization and appropriations process. Such spending decisions will be informed by the best information available each year regarding technical progress in the program and the status of the threat. 
   I also heard that S. 257 would make no contribution to the development or deployment of an NMD system. I do not agree, most respectfully. Commitment to the deployment of an NMD system will have two crucial impacts on the security of the United States. 
   First, it will signal to the nations that aspire to possess ballistic missiles with which to coerce or attack the United States that to pursue such capability is a waste of both time and resources of that nation. In this sense, commitment to an NMD system would have a deterrent effect on proliferation. 
   Second, if some aspiring states are not deterred and commit to deploy an NMD system, it would ensure that American citizens and their property are protected from limited missile attack, to the best of our capability. I use the word ``ensure'' the American citizens. We can only offer our best technical protection. I am not sure any ensurance absolutely can be devised. 
   In addition to convincing the rest of the world that we are serious about defending the U.S. against rogue missile threats, S. 257 will make it clear to the American people that we are truly serious about this undertaking. This is important, in particular, for those in Government and industry who are now working so hard to make an NMD system a reality. Nothing could be more important to them than a clear signal that we are seriously behind them and that this is not just another false start. 
   On August 31, 1998, North Korea tested the Taepo Dong 1 missile over Japan and demonstrated the capability to deliver a small payload to U.S. territory. Technically, that is feasible. This event demonstrated that the proliferation of technology expertise and hardware with which to build a long-range ballistic missile is accelerating rapidly. 
   As the Rumsfeld Commission reported:  
   The threat to the U.S. posed by these emerging capabilities is broader, more mature and evolving more rapidly than has been reported in estimates and reports by the [greater] Intelligence Community [of our country].  
   To its credit, the administration has now acknowledged the existence of this threat and has taken significant steps to address it. I commend Secretary of Defense Cohen for his decision to increase funding for NMD by $6.6 billion over the Future Years Defense Program. 
   In my view, however, these developments fundamentally change the rationale supporting the ``3+3'' policy. This policy has been based on a perceived need to gather more information on the ballistic missile threat, on NMD program affordability, and on technology maturity, before making a deployment decision. The administration has now indicated that the threat is all but here. 
   It has also budgeted funds needed to implement the deployment decision, implicitly confirming that the program is affordable. The administration's only remaining decision criteria for which additional information is needed relates to technology development. S. 257 makes clear that the deployment would only proceed once the technology is mature. There is no apparent reason to further delay a deployment decision. 
   Although the United States must engage Russia with caution and respect--and I underline ``with caution and respect''--I do not believe that postponing an NMD deployment decision will facilitate negotiations to change the ABM Treaty. Delay only perpetuates uncertainty about our position and creates the potential for misunderstanding. If Russia does not believe that we are serious about an NMD deployment, it will have no incentive to cooperate, in my judgment, in these talks. Once a firm commitment to NMD deployment has been announced, only then will Russia seriously engage in negotiations to modify the ABM Treaty. 
   We must never forget that treaty was between the United States and the then-Soviet Union, the only superpowers that had intercontinental ballistic missile technology. And it is against that background that we must review the revisions of this treaty. It is in the national interest of the United States of America. There are many places today in the world where other capabilities to develop these missiles are rapidly progressing. It is in our national interest to modify that treaty at this time. I do not say abolish it. I say carefully modify it. 
   The United States must make it clear that the decision to deploy an NMD decision is based on a threat not envisioned at the time the ABM Treaty was negotiated. I was then Secretary of the U.S. Navy, and I was in Moscow when the ABM Treaty was signed. I have a vivid recollection of that backdrop. 
   The United States, however, must make it equally clear that it will proceed with deployment of an NMD system whether or not Russia agrees to modify the ABM Treaty. The only way to clearly send such a signal is by a change in U.S. policy. In my view, the best way to send that signal is by enacting S. 257. 
   Mr. President, in summary, I believe the need for the deployment of NMD is compelling. I believe it is equally clear that we must modify our policies so everyone knows where we stand on NMD deployment. We must send this signal to our potential enemies, to Russia, and, indeed, to ourselves. And I do not put Russia in the context of a potential enemy; other nations I was referring to in that statement. The threat exists, and continues to grow. S. 257, which clearly indicates the commitment to deploy NMD, will ensure the United States is prepared to meet that threat. 
   Mr. President, I am going to pose a question or two to my good friend and distinguished colleague from Michigan, Mr. LEVIN, who is the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee on which we serve together. But over our 21 years in the Senate, it is interesting that Senator LEVIN, Senator COCHRAN, and I all came to the Senate at the sametime. Senator COCHRAN, however, is senior to me. I will always respect him for that, and he reminds me on a daily basis. But nevertheless, we came together. We have many, many times in those 21 years debated on this glorious floor of the U.S. Senate the issues relating to arms control. All too often, regrettably, Senator COCHRAN and I are on one side and Senator LEVIN on the other. 
   But I remember not so long ago in the context of the expansion of NATO that I tried as forcefully as I could to resist that expansion. That is history now. The decision was made by this body to go forward and accept three new nations. I stated from this very chair that I would support that. So the  debate is over. But it is interesting to go back and look at some of the statements made in the context of NATO expansion and see how they relate to this very debate that we are having today. 
   Many of those who stood on this floor defending expansion--my good friend from Michigan was among them--now argue that we must not declare our policy to deploy a national missile defense system. I ask the question, Should the Senate be more concerned about Russia's opposition to NMD than we were to Russia's opposition to NATO expansion? It is a fair question. 
   I am reminded of the statements by Secretary of State Albright to the Foreign Relations Committee. And I happened to have been in the room at the time she made it. I quote:  
   Russian opposition to NATO enlargement is real. But we should see it for what it is:  
   A very interesting statement, ``But we should see it for what it is.''  
   a product of old misperceptions about NATO, and old ways of thinking. ..... Instead of changing our policies to accommodate Russia's outdated fears, we need to encourage Russia's more modern aspirations.  
   If we simply deleted Secretary Albright's reference to ``NATO enlargement,'' and substitute the term ``NMD,'' I think we would have an interesting quote. If I may, I respectfully revise the statement of my good friend, the Secretary of State, to read: ``Russian opposition to NMD is real. But we should see it for what it is: a product of old misconceptions about NMD and old ways of thinking. ..... Instead of changing our policies to accommodate Russia's outdated fears, we need to encourage Russia's more modern aspirations.'' 
   Secretary Albright also indicated to the Foreign Relations Committee that NATO enlargement would in no way jeopardize START II, as some of my colleagues have argued the National Missile Defense Act would do. Once again, if we substitute the term ``NMD'' for the term ``NATO enlargement,'' I think it would be about right. I quote:  
   While I think this prospect [Duma ratification to START II] is by no means certain, it would be far less so if we gave the Duma any reason to think it would hold up [NMD] by holding up START II.  
   I just hope that at some point my good friend from Michigan might reply to the observations of his good friend, the Senator from Virginia. 
   I say with respect to the President, Secretary of State, and others that this is an example of the difficulty that we are having with continuing confrontations between this administration and the Congress of the United States, most particularly the Senate, on very, very serious foreign policy concerns. 
   Mr. President, today we are facing tremendous uncertainties in Kosovo, and trying to address major decisions as to whether to use force should the talks not be successful in Paris. The outcome of that situation could definitely relate to the future of our work and our commitment of over $9 billion in Bosnia. 
   We have a serious problem with China today as to the degree that we continue or not continue our relations with China given this tragic case of espionage, the allegations of which are being studied by this body with great care, and, indeed, by the committee over which I am privileged to be Chair. 
   I can count other serious foreign policy considerations. Here we are debating this missile defense legislation, and we are now seeing under the leadership of Senator COCHRAN, and, indeed, greater and greater bipartisanship which is evolving on the other side of the aisle, a consensus coming about to pass this critical piece of legislation. 
   I say to the administration that they have to select more carefully the battles they wish to wage with the Congress for fear of losing them all. This is a battle which should have been recognized by the administration months ago as one not to be waged with the intensity that this one has experienced. That same fervor and intensity should be applied to the other major issues before us, whether it is Kosovo, Bosnia, or China, and not have the attention of the U.S. Senate so reflected to resolve this. 
   But, nevertheless, I thank, again, the distinguished leader from Mississippi for his tireless work. I think that this bill will emerge with the strongest bipartisan support. To some extent I think the amendments have helped. But I have studied both of them carefully. Both of the votes were 99 to 0. 
   I think that that tells a story in and of itself, but nevertheless I wish our managers well. 
   I see my distinguished colleague from Michigan about to seek recognition. I just wonder if the Senator has a comment about my NATO observations, I say to my good friend from Michigan.

Mr. President, I wish to remind my colleague that we had, in the course of that debate on expansion in the same time period, led the way for Russia to begin to work with NATO, and while it wasn't a formalized treaty as such, it was a very interesting and unique arrangement between Russia and NATO whereby Russia would have a forum in which it could express its concerns and hopefully work cooperatively.

This is another example where I think the Senate needs to assert itself more strongly in areas of foreign policy, and this is one of those areas which is very clearly in need of a show of strength by the Congress, through the Senate, to assert its really coequal right under the Constitution to deal with issues of foreign policy. And that is why I so strongly support the legislation.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I readily concede that misconceptions can arise. But Russia today, while President Yeltsin still holds, let's say, the trappings of office, is largely guided by Mr. Primakov. I have had the opportunity to deal with him through the years, as has, I think, my good colleague from Massachusetts, likewise. 
   Let me tell you, Mr. Primakov is not a man who doesn't fully understand exactly the nature of this debate and the need for the United States of America to prepare for its defense, not necessarily against Russia, but against other nations emerging with this threat. I do not think, in the context of this debate on this amendment, a misconception could arise, given Mr. Primakov's extensive experience. He will soon be visiting the Nation's Capital as a guest of our President. I am hopeful that I, and 
   perhaps the Senator from Massachusetts and others, can  have an opportunity to engage him, as we have in years past, in a colloquy on a wide range of issues. He is a very well informed and a very astute individual. 
   So in this particular instance, I do not believe that is a serious problem, I say to the Senator.

   It is the policy of the United States to deploy as soon as is technologically possible an effective National Missile Defense system capable of defending the territory of the United States against limited ballistic missile attack (whether accidental, unauthorized, or deliberate).  
   It is simply a system constrained to those particular threats. I think the Senator said those same threats face other nations, notably Russia and China. It seems to me in the common interest that this go forward.

   Mr. President, Senator MCCAIN and I met with the majority leader, Senator LOTT, in the past day or so to discuss the bills relating to the Nation's airports. I specifically in each of these meetings raised those pieces of legislation that pertain specifically to National and Dulles Airports. The Senator and I have worked together for decades. We are old shipmates in some respects; slight difference in time, but, nevertheless, shipmates. We have our differences. 
   The purpose of this legislation today is to enable, at the request of the majority leader, a short-term, 60-day measure to go forth to extend existing legislation. But I have filed two bills with the Senate. I am going to ask now that the second bill be made a part of this extension of 60 days. 
   There are approximately some $200 million currently in escrow for the combined reconstruction programs at National and Dulles Airports. That sum is yet to be disbursed. I am working to get it disbursed. 
   So, for the moment, Senator MCCAIN and I have agreed, together with Senator LOTT, that $30 million of that fund can now be released subject to adoption by the Senate of this legislation, and, of course, with the concurrence in the House; but can be released to begin some very needed projects at these airports. 
   Mr. President, I am going to depart the floor. I have to go to the Senate Intelligence Committee. Senator MCCAIN will put this amendment in on my behalf. I think he is going to be a cosponsor on it. But essentially we are making some progress towards the release of these funds.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today, along with my colleague, Senator ROBB, legislation to give our States and local governments authority to ensure that they can effectively manage the disposal of municipal waste within their borders. 
   For several years, the Committee on Environment and Public Works, on which I serve, has considered many legislative proposals to convey authorities to States and localities to begin to address this serious problem. Unfortunately, no legislation has been enacted since this serious problem first surfaced in the early 1990s. 
   Mr. President, in past years, Senator ROBB and I have introduced legislation individually to allow localities to have the ability to decide when and under what circumstances waste generated from out-of-state sources came into their communities for disposal. Today, I am pleased that we are renewing our commitment to solving this serious problem by working together to introduce this legislation. 
   Today, large volumes of waste are traveling from Northeastern states to Mid-west and Mid-Atlantic states. Over the past few years, the amount of waste traveling across state lines has greatly increased and projections are that interstate waste shipments from certain states will continue to grow.  
   Most States and localities are responsible in ensuring that adequate capacity exists to accommodate municipal waste generated within each community. I regret, however, that the evidence available today shows that there are specific situations where State and local governments are neglecting responsible environmental stewardship. 
   The result of this neglect is that other States are bearing the burden of disposing of their waste. These State and local governments currently have no authority to refuse this waste or even to control the amount of waste that is sent for disposal on a daily basis. 
   Our legislation recognizes that in the normal course of business is it necessary for some amount of waste to travel across State lines, particularly in circumstances where there are large urban areas located at state borders. Our legislation will not close down State borders or prevent any waste shipments. 
   States will have, however, for the first time, the ability to effectively manage and plan for the disposal out-of-State waste along with waste generated within their borders. 
   Specifically, our legislation will allow States who are today receiving 1 million tons of waste or more to control the growth of these waste shipments. 
   These States would be permitted to freeze at current levels the amount of waste they are receiving or, if they decided, they could determine the amount of out-of-State waste they can safely handle. Today, they have no voice, but this legislation will give all citizens the right to participate in these important waste disposal decisions. 
   For all States and localities, protections would be provided to ensure that all interstate waste must be handled pursuant to a host community agreement. These voluntary agreements between the local community receiving the waste and the industry disposing of the waste have allowed some local governments to determine waste disposal activities within their borders. 
   Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleagues to develop a fair and equitable resolution to this problem. 
   I encourage my colleagues to carefully review our legislation and I welcome their comments.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation, along with Senator ROBB, to give Reagan National and Dulles International Airports equitable treatment under Federal law that is enjoyed today by all of the major commercial airports. 
   When the Congress enacted legislation in 1986 to transfer ownership of Reagan National and Dulles Airports to a regional authority--and I may say, Mr. President, I was a part of that airport commission. It was chaired by the former Governor of Virginia, Linwood Holton; Senator SARBANES joined me on that. From that, I drew up this very legislation that did the transfer. We included in that legislation that I drafted a provision to create a congressional board of review. 
   Immediately upon passage of the 1986 Transfer Act, local community groups filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the board of review. The Supreme Court upheld the lawsuit and concurred that the Congressional Board of Review as structured was unconstitutional because it gave Members of Congress veto authority over the airport decisions. The Court ruled that the functions of the board of review was a violation of the separation of powers doctrine. 
   During the 1991 House-Senate conference on the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, I offered an amendment, which was adopted, to attempt to revise the Board of Review to meet the constitutional requirements. 
   Those provisions were also challenged and again were ruled unconstitutional. 
   In 1996, in another attempt to address the situation, the Congress enacted legislation to repeal the Board of Review since it no longer served any function due to several federal court rulings. In its place, Congress increased the number of federal appointees to the MWAA Board of Directors from 1 to 3 members. 
   In addition to the requirement that the Senate confirm the appointees, the statute contains a punitive provision which denies all federal Airport Improvement Program entitlement grants and passenger facility charges to Dulles International and Reagan National if the appointees were not confirmed by October 1, 1997. 
   Mr. President, the Senate has not confirmed the three Federal appointees, Since October, 1997, Dulles International and Reagan National, and its customers, have been waiting for the Senate to take action. Finally in 1998, the Senate Commerce Committee favorably reported the three pending nominations to the Senate for consideration, but unfortunately no further action occurred because these nominees were held hostage for other unrelated issues. Many speculate that these nominees have not been confirmed because of the ongoing delay in enacting a long-term FAA reauthorization bill. 
   Mr. President, I am not here today to join in that speculation. I do want, however, to call to the attention of my colleagues the severe financial, safety and consumer service constraints this inaction is having on both Dulles and Reagan National. 
   As the current law forbids the FAA from approving any AIP entitlement grants for construction at the two airports and from approving any Passenger Facility Charge (PFC) applications, these airports have been denied access to over $200 million. 
   These are funds that every other airport in the country receives annually and are critical to maintaining a quality level of service and safety at our Nation's airports. Unlike any other airport in the country, federal funds have been withheld from Dulles and Reagan National for over 18 months. 
   These critically needed funds have halted important construction projects at both airports. Of the over $200 million that is due, approximately $161 million will fund long-awaited construction projects and $40 million is needed to fund associated financing costs. 
   I respect the right of the Senate to exercise its constitutional duties to confirm the President's nominees to important federal positions. I do not, however, believe that it is appropriate to link the Senate's confirmation process to vitally needed federal dollars to operate airports. 
   Also, I must say that I can find no justification for the Senate's delay in considering the qualifications of these nominees to serve on the MWAA Board. To my knowledge, no one has raised concerns about the qualifications of the nominees. We are neglecting our duties. 
   For this reason, I am introducing legislation today--the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Improvement Act--to repeal the 
   punitive prohibition on releasing Federal funds to the airports until the Federal nominees have been confirmed. 
   Airports are increasingly competitive. Those that cannot keep up with the growing demand see the services go to other airports. This is particularly true with respect to international services, and low-fare services, both of which are essential.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to share with my colleagues my strong opposition and serious concerns about safety and service impacts resulting from S. 82, the Air Transportation Improvement Act. This legislation has been reported from the Commerce Committee and reauthorizes the activities of the Federal Aviation Administration. 
   My remarks today will focus on the unwise provisions included in this bill which tear apart the Perimeter and High Density rules at Reagan National Airport. These rules have been in effect--either in regulation or in statute--for nearly 30 years. Since 1986, these rules have been a critical ingredient in providing for significant capital investments and a balance in service among this region's three airports--Dulles International, Reagan National, and Baltimore-Washington International. 
   First and foremost, I believe these existing rules have greatly benefitted the traveling public--the consumer. The provisions in the Committee bill will severely reduce the level of service that Reagan National now provides and, as a result, consumer convenience in air travel will suffer greatly. 
   The provisions in S. 82 differ dramatically from the provisions included in the legislation the Senate passed last year by a vote of 92 to 1. Of the four slot-controlled airports in the country--Reagan National, O'Hare International in Chicago, and Kennedy and LaGuardia in New York--only Reagan National received a significant increase in take-off and landing slots from last year's bill--24 per day to 48 per day. 
   This increase is unjustified and not supported by any evidence that it is needed. Today, Reagan National handles approximately 800 take-off and landing operations per day, Chicago's O'Hare handles approximately 2,000 take-off and landing operations per day. Yet, in the Committee-reported bill Reagan National would receive another 48 slots while O'Hare would receive only another 30 slots per day. This is a disproportionate increase especially when one compares the size and daily operations of the airports. Again, at New York's Kennedy and LaGuardia, there are no changes in this year's bill from the provisions included in the bill passed by the Senate last year. 
   Mr. President, to gain a full understanding of the severe impact that these changes will have on our regional airports, one must examine the recent history of these three airports. Prior to 1986, Dulles and Reagan National were federally-owned and managed by the FAA. The level of service provided at these airports was deplorable. At National, consumers were routinely subject to traffic gridlock, insufficient parking, and routine flight cancellations and delays. Dulles was an isolated, underutilized airport. 
   For years, the debate raged within the FAA and the surrounding communities about the future of Reagan National. Should it be improved, expanded or closed? This ongoing uncertainly produced an atmosphere where no investments were made in National and Dulles and service continued to deteriorate. 
   A national commission, now known as the Holton Commission, was created in 1984 and led by former Virginia Governor Linwood Holton and former Secretary of Transportation Elizabeth Dole to resolve these long-standing controversies which plagued both airports. The result was a recommendation to transfer Federal ownership of the airports so that sorely needed capital investments to improve safety and service could be made. 
   I was pleased to have participated in the development of the 1986 legislation to transfer operations of these airports to a regional authority. It was a fair compromise of the many issues which had stalled any improvements at both airports over the years. The regulatory 
   High Density Rule was placed in the statute so that neither the FAA nor the Authority could change it unilaterally. The previous passenger cap was repealed, thereby ending growth controls, in exchange for a freeze on slots. Lastly, the perimeter rule at 1,250 miles was established. 
   For those interested in securing capital investments at both airports, the transfer of these airports under a long-term lease arrangement to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority gave MWAA the power to sell bonds to finance the long-overdue work. The Authority has sold millions of dollars in bonds which has financed the new terminal, rehabilitation of the existing terminal, a new control tower and parking facilities at Reagan National. 
   These improvements would not have been possible without the 1986 Transfer Act which included the High Density Rule, and the Perimeter Rule. Limitations on operations at National had long been in effect through FAA regulations, but now were part of the balanced compromise in the Transfer Act. 
   For those who feared significant increases in flight activity at National and who for years had prevented any significant investments in National, they were now willing to support major rehabilitation work at National to improve service. They were satisfied that these guarantees would ensure that Reagan National would not become another ``Dulles or BWI''. Citizens had received legislative assurances that there would be no growth at Reagan National in terms of permitted scheduled flights beyond on the 37-per-hour-limit. 
   These critical decisions in the 1986 Transfer Act were made to fix both the aircraft activity level at Reagan National and to set its role as a short/medium haul airport. These compromises served to insulate the airport from its long history of competing efforts to increase and to decrease its use. 
   Since the transfer, the Authority has worked to maintain the balance in service between Dulles and Reagan National. The limited growth principle for Reagan National has been executed by the Authority in all of its planning assumptions and the Master Plan. While we have all witnessed the transformation of National into a quality airport today, these improvements in terminals, the control tower and parking facilities were all determined to meet the needs of this airport for the foreseeable future based on the continuation of the High Density and Perimeter rules. These improvements, however, have purposely not included an increase in the number of gates for aircraft or airfield capacity. 
   Prior to the 1986 Transfer Act, while National was mired in controversy and poor service, Dulles was identified as the region's growth airport. Under FAA rules and the Department of Transportation's 1981 Metropolitan Washington Airports Policy, it was recognized that Dulles had the capacity for growth and a suitable environment to accommodate this growth. Following enactment of the Transfer Act, plans, capital investments and bonding decisions made by the Authority all factored in the High Density and Perimeter rules. 
   Mr. President, I provide this history on the issues which stalled improvements at the region's airports in the 1970s and 1980s because it is important to understanding how these airports have operated so effectively over the past thirteen years. 
   Everyone one of us should ask ourselves if the 1986 Transfer Act has met our expectations. For me, the answer is a resounding yes. Long-overdue capital investments have been made in Reagan National and Dulles. The surrounding communities have been given an important voice in the management of these airports. We have seen unprecedented stability in the growth of both airports. Most importantly, the consumer has benefitted by enhanced service at Reagan National. 
   For these reasons, I strongly oppose the Committee bill to add 48 slots, or another 16,000 flights annually, at Reagan National. There is no justification for an increase of this size. It is not recommended by the Administration, by the airline industry, by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority or by the consumer. 
   Last year, I cautiously supported a modest increase in flights at Reagan National because I believed it was a fair compromise of the many competing demands in the airline industry today. While many of my constituents strongly opposed this limited increase in aircraft activity at National, I came to the conclusion that this growth could be accommodated without significantly disrupting consumer services or safety. 
   Mr. President, I deeply regret that the Committee did not include in S.82 the provisions from last year's bill which was the result of an agreement  between the Chairman, the Majority Leader and those of us representing this region. I am prepared today to stand behind our agreement and will continue to work with the Commerce Committee to ensure that they understand how detrimental this excessive increase in flights will be for our hard-fought regional balance, air traffic safety and consumer service. 
   At a time when the Committee is considering legislation to protect air travel consumer rights, why are we considering legislation that will do nothing but severely disrupt consumer services at Reagan National? 
   The capital improvements made at Reagan National since the 1986 Transfer Act have not expanded the 44 gates or expanded airfield capacity. All of the improvements that have been made have been on the landside of the airport. No improvements have been made to accommodate increase aircraft capacity. Expanding flights at National to a level included in the Committee bill will simply ``turn back the clock'' at National to the days of traffic gridlock, overcrowded terminal activity and flight delays--all to the detriment of the traveling public. 
   This ill-advised scheme is sure to return Reagan National to an airport plagued by delays and inconvenience. This proposal threatens to overwhelm the new facilities, just as the previous facilities were overwhelmed. However, now it would be worse. Now, we would be facing increased aircraft delays. There would be delays and inconvenience both on the ground and in the air. 
   Any discussion of operations at Reagan National cannot occur without a recognition of the impact these increased flights will have on aircraft noise. One of the principal reasons why many in the Washington region were so wary of improvements at Reagan National, making it more attractive for additional flights and increased noise levels, appears to be coming true. 
   My colleagues will attempt to persuade you that these new flights, based on noise measurement techniques, will not result in noticeable increases in noise levels. The plain fact is that the increased flights included in the Committee bill will result in about 16,000 new flights each year at Reagan National. Do any of us believe that 16,000 new flights will not result in a ``noticeable'' increase in noise. 
   Mr. President, I regret that I must oppose the recommendations of the Commerce Committee to add another 48 slots at Reagan National. This is an unjustified increase that has not been thoroughly examined by the FAA. I believe it has the very real possibility of jeopardizing the significant improvements made at Reagan National in the past 10 years and will return the airport to the days of poor service, delays and overcrowding. 
   The current temporary extension of FAA activities and AIP funding expires at the end of this month. I readily recognize that the Congress must move forward with a full reauthorization proposal. Due to the press of time, it is regrettable that the Committee has decided to make such a significant change from last year's bill. This new approach does not aid our efforts to enact a full FAA reauthorization bill for our communities. 
   For these reasons, I am introducing today the FAA legislation passed by the Senate last September by a vote of 92 to 1. It provides for a modest increase in flights at Reagan National both inside and beyond the 1,250-mile perimeter. 
   Mr. President, I also intend to exercise all of my rights and engage in an extensive debate on these important issues. 
   Mr. President, this bill is exactly the bill passed by the U.S. Senate last year with a vote of 91 Senators to 1 no vote. 
   Mr. President, this is the bill which said that there shall be 24 slots in the judgment of the Senate. It was to go to the House, which it did. The House and the Senate could not reconcile their differences. I worked very carefully with Senator MCCAIN. I want to make it clear we had an understanding that I would support this bill of 24 even though I felt the slots were too many. 
   I had every reason to believe that in the negotiations with the House, the number of slots would come down below 24--usually the House and Senate split their differences--to, say 12, which although I still would not like to see 12 additional slots, for safety and other reasons, 90 other Senators felt there should be additional slots. 
   So recognizing the preponderance of the Senate wanted additional slots, I was willing to accept. Senator MCCAIN did not break his deal with me because the House would not accept any. So now he will soon be back here on the floor, presumably with another bill for 48 slots. I think that is too high. My bill hopefully will be put on as an amendment, as a substitute, in the course of that deliberation.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join in cosponsoring legislation introduced today by Senator CHAFEE and my other colleagues to establish a voluntary incentive-based program to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases. 
   This is an innovative concept that is in its formative stages. I am pleased to join in support of the concept of providing binding credits for industries who can verify reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. While there are significant issues that must be resolved in the final version of this legislation, I believe this voluntary approach has significant potential to encourage real reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. I look forward, as a member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, to actively participating in the further development of this legislation. 
   Mr President, I also want to make clear that my support for this legislation does not indicate a change in my position on the Protocol on Global Climate Change--the Kyoto Protocol. I continue to strongly feel that the protocol is fatally flawed, and in its current form, should not be ratified by the Senate. My objections to this international agreement have been stated many times before. The agreement does not include appropriate involvement by key developing nations and it sets unachievable timetables for emissions reductions by developed nations. I am concerned that the end result would be unrealistic emission reduction requirements imposed on the United States without appropriate reductions assigned to other countries, and that in the end the United States economy would be severely impacted. 
   The legislation I am supporting today does not endorse the Kyoto protocol or call for a regulatory program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This legislation simply ensures that if the private sector takes important steps today to achieve reductions in their emissions, then these actions will be credited to them if there is a mandatory reduction program in the future. 
   Now, Mr. President, how we devise a legislative package that provides these credits and verifies if emissions are reduced will require significant discussions through the Committee's hearing process. For my part, I am enthusiastic about a successful resolution of these many issues. I look forward to particularly working to ensure that appropriate credit is provided for substantial carbon storage. Any legislative effort must recognize the important role of carbon sequestration in determining emission reduction strategies. 
   This bill is about protecting United States companies that have or are interested in taking voluntary steps to lower their output of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. These companies have requested the protection this bill provides and I intend to work closely with Senator CHAFEE and others to deliver it.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Liberty Dollar Bill Act. 
   Last year, students at Liberty Middle School in Ashland, Virginia came up with an idea. The measure I introduce today simply implements their vision. This bill directs the Treasury to place the actual language from the Constitution on the back of the one dollar bill. 
   Our founding fathers met in 1787, to write what would become the model for all modern democracies--the Constitution. Washington, Madison, Franklin, Hamilton and many other great Americans met for four months that year to ignite history's greatest light of government. 
   They argued, fought, and compromised to create a lasting democracy, built on a philosophy found in the preamble of the constitution. And they protected this philosophy and these ideals by creating three branches of government and divisions of power between the federal and state governments found in the articles and the amendments of the Constitution. 
   Although our currency celebrates the men who first drafted the Constitution, it doesn't celebrate their most nobel achievement. Shouldn't this greatest of American achievements be in the hands of all Americans? 
   All presidents, likewise all public officers, swear to ``preserve, protect and defend'' the Constitution. No country can survive if it loses its philosophical moorings. The freedoms and liberties we enjoy give substance, value and meaning to the laws by which we live. Our Nation's philosophy can be taken for granted in the daily business of lawmaking. Yet we can hear in John F. Kennedy's inaugural address that we do not defend America's laws, we defend its philosophy--a philosophy embodied in the Constitution. 
   Seventy-five percent of Americans say that ``The Constitution is important to them, makes them proud, and is relevant to their lives.'' 
   So important is this document that we built the Archives in Washington to house and safeguard it. Hundreds of thousands go there each year to see it. However, ninety-four percent of Americans don't know all of the rights and freedoms found in the First Amendment. Sixty-two percent of Americans can't name our three branches of government. 
   Six hundred thousand legal immigrants come to America each year. Often their first sight of America is the Statue of Liberty, holding high her torch, symbolizing our light and our freedom. Many of these immigrants become American citizens by the naturalization process and learn more about the Constitution than many natural born citizens. 
   If America's most patriotic symbol--the Constitution--were on the back of the one dollar bill, wouldn't we all know more about our Government? The Constitution should be in the hands of every American. 
   Our Constitution is a beacon of light for the world. People everywhere should be able to hold up our one dollar bill as a symbol of the freedom of modern democracy. 
   I am proud to join my colleague in the House of Representatives, Chairman TOM BLILEY,  and reintroduce the companion legislation in the Senate. The Liberty Dollar Bill Act directs the Secretary of the Treasury to incorporate the preamble to the Constitution of the United States, the Bill of Rights, and a list of the Articles of the Constitution on the reverse side of the one dollar bill. 
   Mr. President, I agree with the students of Liberty Middle School. The Constitution belongs to the people. It should be in their hands. 
   I want to commend the students of Liberty Middle School and their teacher, Mr. Randy Wright for their contribution to our Nation. I hope all my  colleagues in the Senate will see the wisdom of these students and join me as a cosponsor of this legislation. Let the Nation hear that the younger generation can provide ideas that become the laws of our land.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today legislation to reauthorize the civil works mission of the Corps of Engineers. 
   I am joined today by the Chairman of the Committee on Environment and Pubic Works, Senator CHAFEE; the Committee's Ranking Member, Senator BAUCUS; the new Chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Senator VOINOVICH; Senator BENNETT, Senator LAUTENBERG, and Senator BOXER in cosponsoring this legislation. 
   Since 1986, it has been the policy and practice of the Congress to reauthorize Corps of Engineers civil works activities--projects for flood control, navigation, hurricane protection and erosion control, and environmental restoration--on a two-year cycle. Last year, the Senate passed S. 2131 by unanimous consent. Regrettably, the House was unable to consider companion legislation. 
   In an effort to keep these critically needed projects on schedule, I am pleased that the Chairman CHAFEE and Majority Leader LOTT have indicated their strong support for promptly considering this bill this year. The bill I am introducing today mirrors S. 2131 passed last year with updated cost estimates and project revisions provided by the Corps of Engineers. 
   This legislation authorizes the construction of 37 new flood control, navigation, environmental restoration, hurricane protection and shoreline erosion control and recreation projects. It modifies 43 previously authorized projects and calls on the Corps of Engineers to conduct 29 studies to determine the economic justification of future water resource projects. 
   Mr. President, the landmark Water Resources Development Act of 1986 established the principle of cost-sharing of economically justified projects that have a federal interest. Local interests are required to share 35 percent of the cost of construction of flood control and hurricane protection and shoreline erosion control projects. The non-federal financial requirements for navigation projects depend on the depth of the project and range from 25 percent to 50 percent of the cost of construction. 
   The legislation we are introducing today is consistent with the cost sharing provisions of prior water resource laws. Also, the Committee has been consistent in requiring that every new construction project receive a cmpleted project report by the Chief of Engineers before it is included in this legislation. 
   As the former Chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I commend Chairman CHAFEE and Senator BAUCUS for standing firm in support of these cost-sharing and economic benefits tests. These policies have proven effective in authorizing projects that are worthy of federal investment and have the strong support of local sponsors. No other approach has been more effective in weeding out questionable projects than requiring either a state or the local government to contribute to the cost of engineering, design and construction of a project. 
   I am pleased that this financial commitments from local sponsors, that have been thoroughly evaluated and received a report from the Chief of Engineers, and have demonstrated that the economic benefits to be achieved by the project exceed the federal costs. 
   These fundamental requirements are applied to each project and only those that meet all of these tests are included in this legislation. 
   Mr. President, this legislation is critically important to many communities who have already contributed significant resources to prepare these projects for authorization. There is ample evidence to confirm that the federal investment in water resource projects is a wise investment of taxpayer dollars. In 1997 alone, Corps flood control projects prevented approximately $45.2 billion in damages. The continued maintenance and deepening of our commercial waterways remains critical to the U.S. successfully competing in a one-world marketplace. The value of commerce on these waterways  totaled over $600 billion in 1996, generating 15.9 million jobs. 
   It is important for the Committee to enact this bill prior to the appropriations cycle this year. I pledge to work with my colleagues so that the full Senate can soon consider this bill.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will resume consideration of S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. There will be a short period of debate until 9:45 a.m., at which time the Senate will proceed to two back-to-back rollcall votes. The first vote will be on or in relation to a Sarbanes-Warner amendment regarding civilian pay, followed immediately by a vote on or in relation to a Cleland amendment regarding thrift savings. 
   Following those two votes, the Senate will continue consideration of S. 4, with the intention of completing action on the bill by, I would hope--there is even the possibility, and I would like to have the views of my distinguished ranking member--maybe the middle of the day. We are getting excellent cooperation from all Senators on this matter. We are quickly going through the amendments and I will momentarily address the amendments. I believe it could be done by sometime this afternoon. Therefore, Members should expect rollcall votes throughout the deliberation on this bill. 
   Again, the first vote is to begin at 9:45.

   Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, with regard to the amendments, we are working out a number of these amendments. As I said, I am optimistic that this matter can be completed, hopefully by early afternoon. 
   The possible amendments still remaining are: 
   An amendment regarding Guard and Reserve participation in the Thrift Savings Plan, by Mr. CLELAND--that is scheduled for a vote, so that will soon be disposed of; 
   Modify the MGIB to permit reservists to transfer benefits to family members, Mr. JEFFORDS; 
   Permit RC to receive lump sum GI bill payments for certain courses, Mr. JEFFORDS; 
   Civilian pay raise of 4.8 percent; that is the Warner-Sarbanes; we will be voting on that momentarily; 
   Expand use of the MGIB to include prep for college and grad school entrance exams, Mr. ROCKEFELLER; 
   Make food stamps and WIC available to soldiers overseas--that is, soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines overseas--Mr. HARKIN; 
   Sense of the Senate re: 2-month extension of the tax-filing deadline for uniformed services personnel stationed  outside the United States, Mr. COVERDELL; 
   Sense of the Senate regarding processing of claims for veterans benefits, Mr. BINGAMAN; 
   Sense of the Senate regarding the possibility that provisions of S. 4 may be reconsidered during the authorization or appropriations process by my distinguished colleague, the ranking member here, Mr. LEVIN; 
   Technical change to section 202, Senators WARNER and ALLARD. 
   Now, I think that concludes it. There were several amendments by the Senator from Missouri, Mr. ASHCROFT; I have discussed those with him. And another one by Mr. JEFFORDS, and another one by Mr. LEVIN--I will be discussing those amendments. I think it is not likely they will be brought up. 
   At this time, perhaps my distinguished colleague, the comanager of the bill, will have a few comments?

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is a technical correction to section 202 of the bill. When the Armed Services Committee drafted S. 4, it was our intent to permit the enlistment, reenlistment, and the REDUX bonus to be deposited directly into a service member's Thrift Savings account. In order to accomplish this, it was necessary to waive the limit on annual contributions to the Thrift Savings account. S. 4 as reported does not include the waiver. However, after the bill was reported, the Thrift board, which administers the Thrift Savings Plan, notified the committee that one of the additional statutory requirements was necessary--and that is the purpose of this amendment; it corrects the unintended oversight. Therefore, I believe this amendment is acceptable on both sides.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if the Senator will just yield, our good friend and colleague here has a distinguished career in the Navy, in aviation. As a pilot, he understands the risks that pilots undertake every day. People always think the risks only occur in combat. Those of us who were in training commands many years ago know it is quite different. Indeed, in combat are the aviators over Iraq this morning, enforcing U.N. Security Council resolutions. And pilots are awaiting the instructions with regard to the fighting that is going on in Kosovo. So this is a major piece of legislation to retain those people. 
   I would just like to rhetorically ask my good friend a question. I know there is great concern among some of our colleagues, genuine concern, that this bill represents an awful lot of money. But I ask my colleagues, what good are the planes and the ships and the other equipment that we buy if there are not qualified people to operate them? Am I not correct, Senator?

That is this Senator's intention.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, on behalf of the committee, we welcome the  Senators joining our committee this year. Senator REED brings a distinguished background in the military services, having been on active duty himself at one point. It was an excellent statement.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we are continuing to make progress. It is the understanding of the Senator from Virginia that Senator MCCAIN is en route to the floor for the purpose of making a statement about the bill and to present an amendment for himself and Senator COVERDELL. 
   I also urge Senator FEINGOLD to consider coming to the floor following that. Hopefully, it will be mutually convenient. 
   Seeing no Senator seeking recognition at this time, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my very, very dear friend and colleague. Our association goes back many, many years when at one time, I suppose, you could consider me his boss, but those days when I was his boss ended with his distinguished family of predecessors who have served in our naval service with such distinction for so many generations. 
   Before the Senator departs, I want to say that earlier, in the context of the Harkin amendment, I made it very clear to the Senate that that important provision on food stamps in our bill originated with the Senator, and it represents a lot of study and commitment that the Senator has made for a number of years on this issue; it just didn't come to mind yesterday. The Senator has spoken on it many times to our committee, to the Senate as a whole, and, indeed, to the Nation as a whole. The Senator has addressed the problems associated with food stamps. 
   Also, the Senator mentioned the concern he has about NATO. I share a number of those concerns and particularly the relationship to the United Nations. I had a meeting early this morning with the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, and later today I will put into the RECORD some remarks. 
   Of course, I stressed with him our deep concern about Iraq and the need for greater unity of commitment and understanding in the United Nations on that question. But I also touched on the issue that they are entirely separate organizations, the United Nations and NATO, and there are times when we work together. 
   And the Senator is quite correct in sending out a clarion call that as we approach the 50th anniversary and decisions relating to the future of NATO, and particularly what we call ``out-of-area missions,'' that again the separability of those two organizations be kept in mind. I hope at some point to more formally address that issue. I have been doing some research on it which I would be happy to share with my good friend and colleague. 
   On Kosovo, our committee will be holding a hearing tomorrow, and I hope the Senator can schedule time to attend that hearing and, perhaps in his opening remarks in the course of the hearing, address some of the very concerns that the 
   Senator stated here today. 
   I thank my good friend for bringing to bear on the deliberations of the committee and the Senate as a whole his years of experience in the military. It is very important. Without it, we would be at a great loss. I thank my colleague. 
   If I might ask one question, there was some thought that the Senator was going to offer an amendment on behalf of Mr. COVERDELL. Could the Senator clarify that?

   Mr. WARNER. We are ready to move this bill, I say to the Senator, but in fairness we have to get some further cost information. The Senator from Arizona brought up his concern about costs. The Senator is a watchdog on that, and we are beginning to get that from the Department of Defense, particularly with the amendment of the Senator from Iowa regarding the extension of food stamps to overseas men and women of the Armed Forces. I don't know whether the Senator has a view he would like to add on that.

   Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator. 
   I wish to advise the Chair and all Senators that we are about to get some other amendments accepted here very quickly. And if we can accept about four amendments, I would hope maybe we can arrange for a break here at the noon hour, and then resume early in the afternoon. But that is a decision that is up to the leadership at this time. 
   Mr. President, on the amendments, Senator JEFFORDS is on his way to the floor to address two of the three he has. The first one is in relation to what we call a lump-sum payment. And I am of the opinion that the committee is going to accept that. And the second is an extended window of eligibility; that is whereby a person in the service has a period of time, after they depart the service--somewhat extended now--within which to make certain decisions  regarding their eligibility under the various GI bill provisions. So I hope that we can accept those two. 
   Senator FEINGOLD has an amendment. And I think momentarily my colleague, the joint manager of the bill, will address that. That leaves the amendment from the Senator from Iowa, the Harkin amendment. And I think we are very close to closure on that. It is being redrafted in a manner in which I think it can be accepted.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in the course of deliberations on the floor, there have been a number of amendments to extend benefits to Guard and Reserve forces. And momentarily we will be considering additional amendments. We are operating under a total force concept. I remember very well when I was in the Department of Defense working for then-Secretary Melvin Laird. He really started the concept of what we call ``total force.'' 
   Yes, we have Reserve and Guard forces active, but it is a total force in a time of need. There have been extraordinary contributions by Reserve and Guard officers, men and women, in the past decade, particularly in connection with the Bosnia deployments. 
   For example, the air guard have flown, I think, approximately half of the missions involved, and I would like for the RECORD to get the exact figure on that during that period. They are still flying. Each one of us here in the Senate received notice of a detachment from our State that is now being deployed into that theater of operations to help an active duty group in the performance of their duties and perhaps even to relieve an active duty group so they could go back either to the continental United States or to their stations in Europe. So it is really one total force now. 
   I know that Senators are concerned about the dollars involved in these various pay proposals. For example, this extended window of eligibility--that is only going to cost $5 to $10 million. That is a relatively small sum to accommodate these young people as they return from a period of active duty and then have to sit down and sort out their lives and figure out when they want to take on their education. What are their family responsibilities? Perhaps they want to try a job before they go back to get additional schooling. All of these things is a component, is going to help, in my judgment, to not only induce young people to come in, in the front end, but to keep those in uniform now remaining on active duty so the taxpayer in America can save the enormity of the cost associated with training a new service person. 
   In the pilot training it goes into the multimillions of dollars to train these individuals to operate the high-performance aircraft, both fixed and rotary wing, that we have today. So bear with us. Those of us who are on the committee, I think, have a great appreciation not only for the budgetary considerations, but for the need to make these improvements at this time. It is absolutely essential that we do so, Mr. President. 
   I really appreciate the support I have gotten, particularly from the leadership on both sides here, and Members of the Senate who have come up to me. While they have concerns about the budgetary considerations, they know, bottom line, that we have to fix this personnel situation. There is no sense in spending millions and millions--indeed billions--of dollars to buy the new aircraft and ships if we do not have the personnel to operate them. 
   The ships of the U.S. Navy now on deployment in the gulf region are undermanned because of the inability to retain the skilled personnel. We simply cannot ask those aboard the ship to accept the additional risk and overtime hours aboard that ship without trying to do everything we can back here in the Congress of the United States to straighten out this problem. 
   Mr. President, I think it is just moments before Senator JEFFORDS appears on the floor. In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. WARNER. Next year, we will take a fresh look. Momentarily, I will advise the Senate on the balance of the amendments that the managers know of. Hopefully, we can get to final passage very early this afternoon. 
   We still have the amendment of the Senator from Iowa, Mr. HARKIN, and that is, I am certain, going to be accepted on both sides. It relates to the costs. I think we will have a good estimate of the costs now coming in from the Department of Defense before we ask for passage of that amendment. 
   Senator COVERDELL has an important amendment--a sense of the Senate--to codify some extension of tax filing deadlines for men and women of the Armed Forces. 
   Mr. LEVIN may have an amendment, which is sort of generic to the entire bill, is my understanding. There is some indication that the Senator from Florida may wish to address an amendment. I have looked at it, and as soon as I have the opportunity to speak with him, I will express my strong concerns regarding that amendment on this bill. I will withhold those comments for now. 
   Is the Senator finished?

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I find myself in a very awkward position in that I am going to support that--not today but eventually if this motion of the Senator from Virginia prevails. Then the committee of jurisdiction, the Finance Committee, presumably will take up this subject, and hopefully enact legislation, if not identical to those of the Senator from West Virginia, certainly to achieve the same goals. 
   What the Senator from Virginia is doing is very simple at this moment. That is, the Senate conducts business in a certain way. We respect the jurisdiction of our several committees. We respect the chairman of those committees to ask a fellow chairman such as myself to protect the jurisdiction of that committee and to allow the Finance Committee in this instance to do the legislation. That is the sole purpose of my motion to table, because someday the Senator from Virginia will cast a vote to achieve the goals that the Senator from West Virginia, I think, has very properly raised today as a matter of great need 
   to our veterans. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for those comments, my good friend and colleague. It is just that, indeed, Chairman SPECTER, and the Senator from West Virginia as ranking members have come over to address the issue. You made the decision. Chairman ROTH, likewise, examined this amendment, came over, and took a different position as chairman. Therefore, out of respect to him and the way that we try to accord jurisdiction to the committees, I continue to adhere to the motion to table, and ask Senators to support that motion. 
   I yield the time, and, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to table.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this morning I had the opportunity to confer with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who is in Washington, D.C. holding extensive meetings. He will be meeting with the Speaker and other members of the Congressional leadership before returning to New York. 
   This morning, we had a very broad range of discussions about the many threats that face the world today, primarily weapons of mass destruction. I expressed my concern about the situation in Iraq and the continued failure of Saddam Hussein to abide by the many U.N. Security Council Resolutions which require the continuing destruction of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, as well as the capability to manufacture such weapons and their delivery systems. I stressed to the Secretary General the urgency of the situation and the need for the Security Council to act to ensure compliance with its resolutions. In my view, the future credibility of the Security Council is on the line.

   Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Senator. 
   Mr. President, fortunately we have a flurry of activity on this bill. We have an amendment to be offered momentarily by our distinguished colleague from Idaho. There are some 21 amendments that have been made known to the managers, Mr. LEVIN and myself. And I am confident we can make some strong gains today on this bill. 
   The leadership--and I presume in consultation with the Democratic leader--desire a vote at the conclusion of our two luncheon caucuses today. So after further consultation with the leadership, I think they will direct me to seek from the Senate an understanding that we will vote at about 2:15 on the amendment of the Senator from Idaho. 
   Mr. President, before we proceed further on the bill this morning, I would like to--each day as the bill is brought up, I am going to address what I call the overnight constructive criticism that is brought to bear on this piece of legislation. And I ask unanimous consent to have printed in today's RECORD an editorial from the Washington Post, dated Tuesday, February 23, 1999, entitled ``Bad Bill in the Senate.'' 
</TEXT>

   Mr. WARNER. I will not take up too much time of the Senate here today, but I welcome constructive criticism, such as forwarded by this piece and others. And I am ready to meet it head on and reply and explain exactly what it is that this Senator intends to achieve through this bill. 
   We are faced every day that we get up with fewer and fewer young men and women willing to sign on the dotted line and take up an initial career in the U.S. military, and it is very serious for all the services. Every day we wake up, fewer and fewer men and women who have been in the services, who have received--in many instances, pilots the most notable--an extraordinary taxpayer investment in their training, are not seeking the opportunity to remain in the services. We have to address these two ``hemorrhaging'' problems. That is the purpose for driving this bill through. 
   I am confident when we emerge in conclusion of this bill, and we come to the final passage, we will probably have a better shaped instrument than is before the Senate at this time, but that shaping has to take place on this floor with constructive criticism such as the editorial sets forth. 
   This bill was driven by the testimony of the Chairman and the members of the Joint Chiefs in September and again in January.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could just say a word about the amendment pending from the distinguished Senator from Idaho. I am prepared to support that amendment. It is long  overdue, and I think it just removes another one of the inequities that, regrettably, from time to time throughout history come up through our system. Those men and women who serve in the active forces for great periods of time should not be penalized when a Reserve officer or a Guard officer or others, don't have a comparable situation. So I commend the Senator.

We knew the demands of Texas were perhaps matched by the Appropriations Committee, where she also has the opportunity to work with the Defense Subcommittee on Appropriations so that she is still very much involved in defense issues. 
   This, I hope, is an amendment that we can accept. We will be working with the Senator from Texas throughout perhaps today and tomorrow. But she is absolutely right. My constituents, as I travel among the bases, bring this to my attention wherever I go. I commend the Senator for her leadership.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, we thank the Senators. 
   Subject to concurrence by the distinguished ranking member and others, I hope we can arrive at a vote on this amendment this afternoon, with an opportunity preceding that vote with the sponsors to once again address it. I understand another Senator has indicated his desire to speak to this amendment. 
   So I hope we can put this up as a package and have it addressed by the Senate in the form of a vote this afternoon.

   At this time, Mr. President, I think it is in order--we have revised it. While we are waiting for that, it is my understanding Senator LEVIN has some questions for the Senator from Idaho.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, my friend and colleague raises a very valid point, and I suggest that we address that in the course of this bill but allow this amendment to go forward, because numerically we are talking about a relatively small number of officers who, fortunately--and I underline ``fortunately''--have offered their service to the Congress in comparison to many others throughout other agencies and departments in the Government.  
   So I would not want the amendment by our distinguished colleague to be delayed from a vote subject to our reconsideration of this very important issue. 
   As you might imagine, I think it is incumbent upon primarily the two of us to consult with one of our more distinguished colleagues around here whose knowledge of the Senate and salaries gave rise to this amendment. I would certainly want his input before we tried to make any adjustment. 
   Why don't we leave it that we can go ahead with this amendment, and at a time convenient in the course of the deliberations on this bill we will address the other problem.

   So at this time, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote occur on or in relation to amendment No. 9 at 2:15 today, and that no amendments be in order prior to the vote on amendment No. 9, and, further, no points of order be waived with respect to the amendment. I further ask that with respect to a motion to waive the Budget Act or portions thereof, the motion to waive be debatable.

   I wonder if I might just propound a question that I hope the Senator will address in the course of her remarks.

I wish to advise Senators that we are scheduling votes for tomorrow morning at 9:45 a.m. It is a vote on an amendment by myself and Senator SARBANES relating to civil service pay. That would be followed--and I presume with a 10-minute vote--by an amendment by Senator CLELAND, who will address that vote tonight. But it is a further expansion, and an important one, of the Montgomery GI bill provisions, which Senator CLELAND put in the basic bill.

I especially thank our two leaders, Senator LOTT and Senator DASCHLE, for giving strong support to the managers. 
   Having said that, I now ask unanimous consent the Chair place an order that we will have two votes in the morning, at 9:45 a.m., on the Warner-Sarbanes amendment, and a second vote to follow thereafter, not to exceed 10 minutes, on an amendment by the distinguished Senator from Georgia, Senator CLELAND. He will lay that down immediately following the 5:30 vote. We will have a certain amount of debate, and it will be pending the following day.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, this is my 21st year in the Senate, and I have had the privilege to work with my good colleague and other members of the delegation from Maryland and Virginia through these many years. I think we have done our duty as trustees to protect the parity of the civil servants who are just as key players in defense and other areas as any other individuals. So many of them have made their lifetime careers serving the country. Many of them are very highly technically qualified. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor a sense of Congress amendment to S. 4 along with my colleagues Senator SARBANES, Senator MIKULSKI, and Senator ROBB on behalf of the hard working federal civilian employees. 
   This sense-of-Congress amendment states that there should continue to be parity between the adjustments in the compensation of members of the uniformed services and the adjustments in the compensation of civilian employees of the United States. In the past, military employees and federal civilian employees have received equal pay adjustments in compensation. 
   Throughout my tenure in the Senate, I have fought to ensure the fair and equitable treatment of all of our federal employees. Our federal employees play an important role in the efficient and intelligent operation of our government. These dedicated public servants should be compensated justly. 
   Mr. President, increases in the levels of pay of members of the uniformed services and of civilian employees of the United States have not kept pace with increases in the overall levels of pay of workers in the private sector so that there is now up to a 30 percent gap between the compensation levels of Federal civilian employees and the compensation levels of private sector workers. Retention and labor shortage issues in areas related to high technology jobs, and specialized trade occupants in the current economy poses significant gaps in pay for our federal civilian employees from their private sector counterparts. This is particularly prevalent in the Greater Metropolitan Washington area due to the high demand for high tech workers in the private sector where salaries continue to increase.

   Mr. WARNER. Senator, you and I came to this marvelous institution roughly two decades ago, give or take a year or so. We have witnessed on this floor spirited debates on the very issues that you raise, more or less circling around the War Powers Act legislation that followed the war in Vietnam and legislation which, in the judgment of many, is questionable to constitutional standing. I think it is time that we had another debate on this issue because it is very important. 
   Mr. President, had we used force in Kosovo, it would have been the fourth time President Clinton has directed force against a sovereign nation. Now, I must say, in the course of the deliberations in Rambouillet, France, and prior thereto, I think the administration tried to take an almost unmanageable situation and do the best they could. Frankly, I am relieved that force at this moment is not to be used. I have not had the opportunity in the last 4 or 5 hours to get the latest situation, given that I have been on the floor managing this bill. But I believe the talks are at a virtual stalemate; am I not correct?

   Mr. WARNER. Well, Mr. President, I think it is timely that the Senate went back and, once again, as we did in years past, take a look at the War Powers Act, take a look at the proposal that the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania has, not by way of criticism at the moment of the President, because you have two situations--one in Kosovo, and, of course, the parallel in Bosnia, and then you have Iraq. 
   I have said from time to time, as we have had deliberations among ourselves in small groups, if anybody has a better idea how to manage it, come forward. They are the most complex situations that I have had in my tenure here in the Senate, and prior thereto in the Department of Defense, in terms of the complexity and the difficulty to resolve it. 
   I would encourage the Senator, and I would be happy to participate in that debate at some future date.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, before the Senator departs, I think the RECORD should reflect that in connection with the action taken against Iraq in the fall, and then in connection with the proposed sending of ground troops as part of the NATO force and U.S. contingent of up to 4,000, there was confrontation with leadership in the Senate and the House in both instances. I think there has been a level--whether it is up to the expectations of my colleagues, it is individually for them to say --a level of confrontation in both sequences. We must bear in mind that under the Constitution, the President is the Commander in Chief. He has the right to direct the deployment of our Armed Forces in harm's way when he thinks hopefully it protects the vital security interests of the United States, and only under those situations because oftentimes the Congress has dispersed--it is in recess, and the like--and those decisions have to be made quickly. Nevertheless, we have a coequal responsibility with the President regarding the welfare and the state of our men and women in uniform and the circumstances under which they are employed, particularly in harm's way. 
   I commend the Senator.

It was legislation that I had drawn up in accordance with the directions of Senator Dole, then-leader. We had a vigorous debate for some 3 days, and it is interesting. There we had in place a half million men and women in the Armed Forces. We had seen the most atrocious form of aggression by Saddam Hussein down through the gulf region, primarily Kuwait. Yet, that debate took 3 days. And by only a mere margin of five votes did the Senate of the United States express its approval for the President of the United States, in the role as Commander in Chief, to use force in that situation.

<TEXT>
   Mr. WARNER. Madam President, it is the intention of the Senator from Virginia, in his capacity as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, to make an opening statement regarding this very important piece of legislation. I shall be followed by my distinguished colleague, the ranking member, and then we ask other Members, particularly those on the committee, to join us in the Chamber such that we can, hopefully, this afternoon in a very material and constructive way, begin the Senate's deliberation on this absolutely critical piece of legislation. 
   Today, the Senate begins consideration of S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. The bill is an integral part of the national security element of the Republican agenda, I might say, Madam President, that Senator LOTT and other leaders announced in the January 19 timeframe of this year. 
   Last fall, Senator LOTT, in an excellent exchange of letters with the President and Republican chairmen, identified key problems with the military pay levels and the military pay system. Following this exchange of letters, the Armed Services Committee held hearings on September 29, 1998, and again on January 5, 1999, the first business this year, in which General Shelton and the service chiefs described the many problems--underline ``many''--military services are experiencing because of the years of shortfalls in funding. 
   During these hearings, particular emphasis was put on readiness, the retention of highly trained people and the inability--very critical, Madam President--the inability today of the military services to achieve their recruiting goals; that is, the young men and young women in their very first step, often their first job, full-time job, they have ever had. We have experienced here in the past year substantial shortfalls, and one of the many purposes of this bill is to try to address that problem. 
   I say with a great sense of pride that the Joint Chiefs, individually and collectively, showed great courage in their presentations both last September and again this January. They spoke candidly of the problems borne by the men and women in the military today and how increased defense funding was needed in order to begin to alleviate these serious problems. General Shelton and the service chiefs urged the President and the Congress to support a military pay raise that would begin to address the inequities between military pay and civilian wages and to resolve the inequity of what is known as the Redux retirement system. 
   Senators LOTT, MCCAIN and ROBERTS took the initiative and showed leadership in developing early drafts of this legislation. These Senators worked within the Armed Services Committee to craft a bill that would address the problems identified by the Joint Chiefs in a comprehensive and responsible manner. When the Armed Services Committee reported this bill out on February 2, 1999, 18 of 20 members of that committee voted in favor of the bill. The two remaining members voted present, and we will hear from them. I don't say that by way of criticism. They have their own views. And one, of course, is my distinguished friend and colleague, the ranking member.

   Mr. WARNER. Madam President, the CBO estimates that enactment of S. 4 will raise discretionary spending by about $1.1 billion in fiscal year 2000 and $13.8 billion over the 2000-2004 time period. There are, of course, direct spending and forgone tax revenue issues that we will have to overcome. I have been working with Senator DOMENICI, Senator STEVENS, and others to address these issues in the budget resolution and the defense authorization bill, which are ongoing deliberations. 
   The important perspective to consider here is that, even though this bill is expensive, the alternative is unacceptable. I wish to stress that: The alternative is unacceptable. We, simply, as a nation--the leader of the world, with the strongest and the largest armed force of any nation in the world, an armed force which is deployed overseas, now, in many places, preserving freedom and trying to secure freedom for others--we simply cannot allow the best military force in the world to wither and atrophy. We must be prepared to pay the price in dollars to fulfill our constitutional duties ``To raise and support Armies,'' and ``To provide and maintain a Navy.'' As I and other Members of the Senate--and that is of course taken from the Constitution. And subsequent thereto we have the Air Force, and of course the Marines have been with us forever, but that is the wording out of the Constitution. 
   As I and the other Members of the Senate have visited military bases here in the United States, in Bosnia, and in other deployment areas, we have found that our young service men and women and their families are doing a tremendous job, under adverse conditions in many cases--tremendous stress on the family--and how proud we are, particularly of the many wives and others in the families who make this system work. It is a family matter. 
   In order to demonstrate to these highly trained and dedicated military personnel that we appreciate their sacrifices and contributions, we must move quickly to pass this legislation. Such action will permit military personnel and their families to make the decision, hopefully, to continue to serve and will assist the military services in recruiting the high-quality force we have worked so hard to achieve. And that means front-end acquisition at the recruiting stations. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important legislation and again salute those of my colleagues who were the early pioneers--Senators LOTT, MCCAIN, ROBERTS, and others--and I am proud to join with them today in presenting this bill to the Senate.

   Mr. WARNER. ``Dear John,'' writes our former colleague Senator COHEN,  
   I am following up on the comments General Shelton and I made concerning S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999 during our posture hearing before your committee. First, let me thank you for your early action to endorse the President's initiative to improve compensation for our military personnel. I fully appreciate the desire of the Committee to take the lead for the Senate on these important matters. Unfortunately, there are a number of elements of the bill which cause concern and the Department has not had an opportunity to testify on this bill and outline our concerns. So I am taking this opportunity to present to you our reservations.  
   On the question of the opportunity to testify, of course we had the two hearings, one in September and again this January, so there was a great deal of testimony that was used directly in formulating this bill. However, the subcommittee, under the distinguished chairman Senator ALLARD, will be meeting this week to take up further hearings on the bill.  
   Again, let me emphasize that I sincerely appreciate your endorsing key elements of the Department's proposal, including: (1) a large across-the-board pay raise increase for military service members; (2) substantial increases in retirement benefits, such that all members can receive a retirement pay that is 50% of their average high salary at 20 years, vice 40% for many members; and (3) reform of the military pay tables, including increased raises for promotions, I especially appreciate your endorsement of pay table reform which more than anything will correct pay inequities. These three items are fully funded in the defense budget I submitted last month.

   Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I think the argument has been framed. My friend and colleague points up his desire to follow the procedures that he and I followed for 21 years as a member of the Armed Services Committee. But, Madam President, I accept responsibility for bringing up this bill early and encouraging our leadership to give me their support. And here is the reason. Let me just give you one example of the problems we are seeing in our military today. 
   During fiscal year 1998, the military lost 1,641 more pilots than they expected. 
   They very carefully planned for a certain amount of attrition through retirements at the end of 20 years--or whenever it may be--and for those persons who decided not to make the military a career, it was time to accept other challenges. Those figures show you have to retain a certain percentage in each of those key pay grades of pilots in order to keep the airplane flying, in order to fulfill the missions abroad. President Clinton has sent the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States abroad more than any other President in the history of this great Nation. We need these people, particularly the airmen. We are 1,641 airmen short. 
   Let's translate that into dollars. The average cost to train a military pilot is about $5.8 million. To replace 1,600 pilots will cost the Department of Defense over $9 billion--repeat, $9 billion. If the enhanced benefits within this bill--the subject of criticism by my colleague--can reduce the unprogrammed losses of pilots by even one-third, we will have more than made up for the additional costs of S. 4 compared to what the Department of Defense bill sent up. There is an example. 
   If you need one more, it is right here. Last year, the Army missed the recruiting goals by about 800. The Navy missed their recruiting goals by 7,000. So far this year, the Army has failed to meet the first quarter of this new fiscal year goals by 2,500. According to the Army's own estimates, they will in 1999--unless this bill and other signals that we send change the course--they will in 1999 have 10,000 fewer recruits than what they need to man the forces all over the world. 
   What does that mean, Madam President? That means that some soldier must stay that added time overseas on an assignment, 
   away from his family, or be recalled from his assignment here in the United States to go overseas and replace another, more often than he or she ever anticipated. As a result, these people are getting out of the middle pay grades and the youngsters aren't coming in. 
   I will take responsibility for bringing up this bill. I will take responsibility for going in for the high figures for this pay increase. Yes, we will accept that, because in any negotiation that I have to undertake with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the chairman of the Budget Committee, I want to go in with a top figure, hoping I can do better than what the administration came up with in their pieces of legislation. 
   These are the problems we are facing, the real problems--shortfalls, shortfalls, shortfalls--resulting in loss of time with family, fewer skills, and the inability to attract and find young men and women to come into the services.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask the Senate to indulge me just a few words. 
   It is a privilege for me to stand in for our distinguished leader, Mr. LOTT. And my remarks also reflect on the outstanding performance not only by Leader LOTT but Leader DASCHLE on this historic day of the Senate. Mr. President, I have just returned, as have most Senators, from responding to many requests by the media on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol. I have said that the verdict is in. It has been given by the Senate. It is now before the Nation and they will be the final jury, the final arbiter. The sovereignty of this country rests not in the high office holders, but it is in the hands of the people. It is for them to decide. 
   As they approach the decision, I humbly submit to them: Let us put this chapter in our history, tragic though it may be, behind us, and that we heal ourselves and unite and go forward. 
   This is a great and strong nation. It is a leader of the world, not only in matters of security for ourselves but security for others, not only in matters of military security but in matters of economic security. Our President, by his own actions, is a weakened President. That strength which for a while he can no longer give to the Nation must be filled in by the people--individually and collectively. I think we should not spend time dwelling on the past. Leave it to the historians. Let us move forward to the future, heal ourselves, strengthen our Nation, so we can resume as a leader in the world. And may God rest his hand on this Senate and its verdict as being the best for the Nation and for our people. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would like to address the Senate for a few minutes about this very serious situation unfolding in Kosovo. 
   Last fall I gave a series of remarks regarding the increasing problems relating to Kosovo. On September 3, 1998, having just returned from Kosovo at that time, and subsequently on October 2, October 8 and October 20, I stood at this very desk and said it was my belief that the types of atrocities that the world has witnessed in the past few days would quickly unfold, unless NATO placed in the Pristina region a ground force to serve as a deterrent. That may not be a popular position, but it is a realistic one, and I expressed it to the Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, General Clark, just a few days ago. I reiterated the fact that we simply had to put in place a deterrent force. 
   Now, there is the complexity that Kosovo is a sovereign part of Yugoslavia--a sovereign nation. However, if we are using the threat of air operations against that sovereign country, it seems to me that short of taking that step, we could make it very clear to Milosevic, who unquestionably is responsible for these atrocities, that it is absolutely essential to have this ground force in place. Currently, over 800 individuals--unarmed verifiers--are in Kosovo, trying to help the people of this tragic region sort out their lives and receive the basics of food and shelter. Now, those people are at risk. 
   Mr. President, I also say that if that NATO force were to be placed in the Pristina region, as I so recommend, a part of that force would have to be a U.S. component. General Clark, Supreme Allied Commander of NATO, is an American officer. In my judgment, we could not in clear conscience have a NATO force in place without some representation of American servicemen and women. I recognize the risks, but there is a direct parallel, Mr. President, between the disintegration in Kosovo, the threat of atrocities and, indeed, conflict between the KLA and the Serbian forces. Conflict, which in the estimate of those on the scene, is looming just weeks ahead. There is a direct correlation between Kosovo and Bosnia. Although I personally was initially opposed to the deployment of U.S. ground troops in Bosnia, once done, I have been a strong supporter of getting it done correctly. This Nation has contributed a very significant investment, first, of men and women in the Armed Forces serving as an integral part of the NATO forces in Bosnia, and second, with respect to billions of dollars of the taxpayers' money. 
   In my judgment, there has been very little progress of late in Bosnia because of the political factions still tenaciously holding on to their fractious relationships between Serbs and Croats, Muslims and Croats, and Muslims and Serbs--all of the ethnic, deep-rooted problems which brought about this conflict many years ago. But we could lose that investment; what little gain has been achieved in Bosnia could be lost and, indeed, in all probability, any ability to advance toward an independent nation--one that is militarily and economically able to stand on its own feet so that we can get our forces out, together with other allies involved. That is in jeopardy with this instability in Kosovo because those various factions are going to watch Kosovo and say, ``NATO is not going to do anything there, so let's just wait it out in Bosnia. Wait it out, and we will have that opportunity some day to go back and fight amongst ourselves to achieve our respective goals.'' 
   So, Mr. President, I so recommend to our President and other leaders in NATO today, other nations, examine very carefully, indeed, the suggestion to place a ground force as a deterrent force in the Pristina region as quickly as possible. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President I rise today to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Washington and Lee, an institution revered in Virginia and rooted in American history. 
   My first association with Washington and Lee came at the knee of my father, a 1903 alumnus. His deep sense of honor and integrity was indelibly linked to his days at Washington and Lee. Indeed, still today, Washington and Lee's strong honor system is the foundation of the moral standard that is the guiding principle at the university for its alumni. 
   As a student at Washington and Lee and even after my graduation in 1949, I have had a keen interest and fascination with the history of the university. In 1749, Scottish-Irish pioneers founded Augusta Academy in the vicinity of what is now known as Lexington, Virginia. Fueled by a budding Revolution and a sense of patriotism, trusties of the academy changed its name to Liberty Hall in 1776. 
   In 1796, George Washington saved the struggling institution from possible demise with a gift of stock shares in the James River Company. At the time, this gift, which was valued at $20,000, was the largest gift ever made to a private educational institution in America. Moreover, as part of the University's endowment, George Washington's gift has generated over $500,000 of income and, to this day, helps pay part of the cost of every student's education. 
   In appreciation of Washington's gift, the trustees changed the school's name to Washington Academy in 1798. Washington responded: ``To promote the Literature in this rising Empire, and to encourage the Arts, have ever been amongst the warmest wishes of my heart.'' 
   Following the Civil War, the Board of Trustees unanimously elected Confederate General Robert E. Lee as president in 1865. Initially, Lee was very hesitant about accepting the position. He feared his name would be forever linked to the Confederate cause, bringing embarrassment and hostility toward the school. However, after repeated urging by the trustees, Lee accepted and on September 18, he rode Traveler into Lexington to assume the presidency of Washington college. 
   During his tenure, Lee affiliated Lexington Law School with the college and institutionalized the school's unique honor system. He greatly emphasized the sciences and created courses in business and journalism that were among the first by any school in the United States. In appreciation for Lee's lasting contribution to the growth of the college, the trustees changed the school's name from Washington College to Washington and Lee University in 1870. 
   Mr. President, I ask that my colleagues join with me today, on Washington and Lee University Founder's Day, in tribute to the ninth oldest institution of higher learning in America.

   Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today Senator LOTT, the Majority Leader, introduced S-4, The Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. This bill is an integral part of the National Security element of the Republican agenda that the Leader announced this morning. 
   Last fall, Senator LOTT, in an excellent exchange of letters with the President and Republican Chairmen, identified key problems with military pay levels and the military pay system. Following this exchange of letters, the Armed Services Committee held hearings on September 29, 1998 and again on January 5, 1999 in which General Shelton and the Service Chiefs described the many problems the military services were experiencing because of many years of shortfalls in funding. Particular emphasis was put on readiness, the retention of highly trained people and the inability to achieve recruiting goals. 
   The testimony of the Joint Chiefs was courageous. They spoke very candidly of the problems borne by the men and women in the military and how increased defense funding was needed in order to begin to alleviate these problems. 
   General Shelton and the Service Chiefs urged the President and the Congress to support a military pay raise that would begin to address inequities between military pay and civilian wages, and to resolve the inequity of the ``Redux'' retirement system. 
   Senators LOTT, MCCAIN, and ROBERTS took an initiative and showed leadership in developing this legislation. These Senators worked within the Armed Services Committee to craft a bill that would address the problems identified by the Joint Chiefs in a comprehensive and responsible manner. 
   The bill will provide military personnel a four-point-eight percent pay raise on January 1, 2000 and will require that future military pay raises be based on the annual Employment Cost Index plus one-half a percent. The bill restructures the military pay tables to recognize the value of promotions and to weight the pay raise toward mid-career NCOs and officers where retention is most critical. The Joint Chiefs testified that there is a pay gap between military and private sector wages of 14 percent. This bill moves aggressively to close this gap and ensure military personnel are compensated in an equitable manner. 
   The bill provides military personnel who entered the service after July 31, 1986 the option to revert to the previous military retirement system that provided a 50 percent multiplier to their base pay averaged over their highest three years and includes full cost-of-living adjustments; or, to accept a $30,000 bonus and remain under the ``Redux'' retirement system. The Joint Chiefs testified that the ``Redux'' retirement system is responsible for an increasing number of mid-career military personnel deciding to leave the service. S-4 will offer these highly trained personnel an attractive option to incentivize them to continue to serve a full career. 
   We will establish a Thrift Savings Plan that will allow service members to save up to five percent of their base pay, before taxes, and will permit them to directly deposit their enlistment and re-enlistment bonuses into their Thrift Savings Plan. In a separate section, the bill authorizes Service Secretaries to offer to match the Thrift Savings Plan contributions of those service members serving in critical specialities for a period of six years in return for a six year service commitment. This is a powerful tool to assist the services in retaining key personnel in the most critical specialities. 
   Senator MCCAIN was the key proponent of an initiative in the bill that would authorize a Special Subsistence Allowance to assist the most needy junior military personnel who are eligible for food stamps. 
   The allowance would provide these families an additional $180 per month and will reduce the number of military families on the food stamp rolls. 
   As I and other Members of the Senate, have visited military bases here in the United States, in Bosnia and in other deployment areas, we have found that our young service men and women are doing a tremendous job, in many cases, under adverse conditions. In order to demonstrate to these highly trained and dedicated military personnel that we appreciate their sacrifices and contributions, we must move quickly to pass this legislation. Such action will permit military personnel and their families to make the decision to continue to serve and will assist the military services in recruiting the high quality force we have worked so hard to achieve. 
   I am proud to be a co-sponsor of this important legislation and will do my upmost to ensure its quick passage.
